HEADLINE: PERIPHERALS;
Phantoms of Physics Made Visible

BYLINE: By L. R. SHANNON

 BODY:
MAXWELL'S DEMON, a figment of the imagination of the 19th-century physicist James Clerk Maxwell, could reduce entropy, or disorder, with little or no expenditure of energy. Although nothing like the demon exists in the real world, you can play with it in one of the eight Physics Demonstration Programs published by Physics Academic Software.
Intended for classroom instruction or independent study at the high school and undergraduate levels, these computer animations also deal with manifestations of things entitled longitudinal waves, waves on a string, two sine waves, a chain reaction, a moving charge, a radiating dipole and a thin lens. The programs were written by Robert H. Good of the department of physics at California State University at Hayward. 
 Two of the other physics programs are Chaos Demonstrations (by Julien C. Sprott of the physics department of the University of Wisconsin and George Rowlands of the physic department of the University of Warwick, England) and Physics Demonstrations, also by Professor Sprott. The editor of the series, an American Institute of Physics project in cooperation with the American Physical Society and the American Association of Physics Teachers, is John S. Risley of North Carolina State University.
The 22 chaos demonstrations range from a driven pendulum through the Mandelbrot and Julia Sets and the Game of Life. All are nicely done, and many are quite beautiful. The 10 physics demonstrations simulate concepts like wave speed on a rope and the Doppler effect. Quizzes, references and ideas for instructors round out the packages.
Physics Simulation Programs is $49.95, with disks for both I.B.M.-compatible and Apple II computers; a 10-copy Lab Pack is $149.95. Chaos Demonstrations is $69.95, or 10 for $199.95, for the PC only. Physics Demonstrations is $49.95, or 10 for $149.95, also for the PC only.
The three programs mentioned here were selected because they are reasonably accessible to a writer who learned physics when Newton was a pup. But the company produces other programs for more advanced students. If you want a catalogue, information or orders, contact the Academic Software Library, North Carolina State University, Post Office Box 8202, Raleigh, N.C. 27695, or phone (800) 955-8275.
 
Publish or Perish

A book with the intriguing and eccentrically punctuated title "Stop Stealing Sheep & find out how type works," by Erik Spiekermann and E.M. Ginger, is a gentle little introduction to a field, publishing, into which the computer has dropped a lot of unsuspecting souls in the last few years. There are examples of typography, both very good and screamingly bad, much advice and many aphorisms.
"Stop Stealing Sheep" is $19.95. It is published by Adobe Press of Mountain View, Calif., and may be ordered by calling (800) 428-5331.
Oh, yes, the title. Frederick Goudy, the great American type designer, once said, "Anyone who would letterspace lower case would steal sheep." In other words, unnecessarily adjusting the spacing between lower-case letters would be esthetically dishonest.
"Everybody's Guide to Successful Publications," by Elizabeth W. Adler (Peachpit Press; $28), is aimed at people who want to get a message across in print effectively and economically. It deals with the whole process of producing a newsletter, report, advertisement or whatever, from the initial planning and budgeting to the final distribution. There is advice on typography and design, and even on writing style. The desktop publishing forum on Compuserve, the information service, brings together desktop publishers from all over the country, and beyond, to exchange tips, ask for and give help and generally have a good time with people who speak the language. "The Best of the Desktop Publishing Forum on Compuserve," by Thom Hartmann, Brad Walrod and Don Arnoldy (Peachpit Press; $25), is an anthology of these exchanges.
The trouble with the printed forum is that you cannot join in; the advantage is that the editors have put together the discussions in a form that is much easier to follow. The real thing usually has a large number of threads, or topics, running at about the same time, running from "Remind me to buy you a beer next time we meet at a trade show" to "It is readily apparent from the primary 'OPI' servers that the option to use EPS files as the placement provides the most flexible option to the implementation of 'APR.' "
Much of the book consists of listings of all the files in the Desktop Publishing Forum, as of Sept. 19, 1992. Peachpit Press is in Berkeley, Calif. The number for orders is (800) 283-9444.

HEADLINE: Better Law for Tribal Gambling

 BODY:
In the five years since Congress set rules for gambling on Indian reservations, the boom in new games has been matched by a boom in lawsuits. Tension between sovereign tribes and sovereign states makes it clear the law needs fixing.
The Indians' right to operate gambling establishments was confirmed by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act in 1988. There are now more than 100 sites, run by 61 tribes in 18 states. Their spread has been an economic boon to long-suffering tribes with few other resources, but unwelcome to people who don't want full-blown gambling halls in their states. 
 The law lets tribes run any type of gambling their home state already permits. If casino-style "Las Vegas Nights" for charity are allowed, Indians may have round-the-clock casinos. States resist for various reasons -- not least, money. Indian casinos divert gamblers from state-sponsored games and add to the cost of roads, police and other services. Like gambling everywhere, they attract crime and prey on compulsive gamblers.
Therefore, to establish a casino -- or pari-mutuel racing or other high-stakes games -- the law requires a "compact" between a tribe and state officials, setting rules for the enterprise. If they can't agree, the tribe may go to court and force mediation, but some states have sought to block this by claiming constitutional immunity.
Connecticut's Mashantucket Pequot tribe had to fight two governors to get permission for its new and highly successful casino near the Rhode Island border -- so successful that it could afford a $100,000 "soft money" gift to the Democratic National Committee last year. The Pequots' success has already created pressure for more. New York has recently negotiated a compact with its Oneida Indians for a casino in mid-state. A second, near the Canadian border, is in the works.
For good or ill, organized gambling is spreading through most of America, as it often does when times are poor. But 49 governors have petitioned Congress to clarify the 1988 law.
The governors seek tighter definition of the types of gambling permitted, tighter regulation of tribe-sponsored games on non-reservation land, and clearer guidelines for negotiating compacts. They have good reason; as a difficult compromise, the law was necessarily vague.
It's a problem for tribes, too. Tribes involved in gambling, or trying to be, want less state intrusion on their sovereignty, not more. At the least, the matter of state immunity to suits must be resolved.
The subtlety of competing sovereignties makes all these issues delicate ones. One could wish for a higher cause than gambling. But the greater cause for Congress to address is balanced consideration for America's native peoples.

HEADLINE: Welfare Recipients Need Education and Jobs, Not Bank Cards

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I read with increasing dismay "Welfare Recipients Are Joining the Age of Plastic" (news article, March 14). Underlying the article is the notion that streamlining the administration of welfare payments with bank cards is effective reform because, among other things, it "lessens" the stigma of using food stamps. 
 Without disregarding the very understandable fear of street crime and the salutary objective of reducing administrative costs, I believe any reform that leads a beneficiary to believe she is "self-sufficient" and "independent" without moving her toward employment and real economic security is not likely to end welfare as we know it.
My dismay is predicated on the experience of one who spent the first 20 years of her life in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn and who observed the unintended consequences of welfare as we know it, particulary the disintegration of two-parent families.
I vividly recall my upstairs neighbor fleeing out the door whenever the caseworker made a home visit because his wife was on Aid to Families with Dependent Children and the impact of their deception (fraud) on their children.
The stigma of waiting with my mother in the welfare office to receive surplus food and emergency assistance strengthened my determination to escape the poverty trap. Then -- as now -- the ticket out of poverty was not a more streamlined and less stigmatizing welfare bureaucracy; rather the ticket out was education (in my case, a one-way ticket to San Francisco to attend Stanford Law School after graduating from the City College of New York).
The focus of welfare reform should be to provide recipients with education, training and work experience to learn skills that will enable them to lead productive lives.
The only difference between the state as banker and the neighborhood banker is that between dependence and hopelessness in one case and responsibility and self-respect in the other.

HEADLINE: Trade Pact Is Facing New Hurdles

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22

 BODY:
The North American Free Trade Agreement, which already faces a number of political obstacles, now faces two more -- plans by Ross Perot to speak out against Congressional approval, and the emergence of deep misgivings about it in the House of Representative's huge freshman class -- members of Congress said today.
Mr. Perot is scheduled to testify before a House panel on Wednesday about the plan to lower trade barriers among Canada, Mexico and the United States, and he is expected to repeat some of the strong criticisms of the pact he made during the fall Presidential campaign. 
 Mr. Perot is also considering a half-hour television commercial devoted to attacking the agreement, said a person familiar with preparations on the subject who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
 
 
Political Generation Gap
 At the same time, a political generation gap on trade issues appears to be undermining the agreement's prospects in the House. This year's bumper crop of House freshmen appears less ideologically inclined to support free trade than were the older representatives they replaced.
For example, an informal count of the 63 Democratic freshmen by the House leadership shortly after the November election found that only 5 of them supported the deal. By contrast, 27 of the Democrats who left the House last year had voted in 1991 to give President George Bush the authority to negotiate the pact and submit it for fast-track consideration with no amendments allowed.
Republican freshmen are also less inclined than their elders to support the pact, said Representative Jim Kolbe, the six-term Arizona Republican who has organized his party's support for the pact on Capitol Hill. "It is more of a generational gap than anything else, but it's also related to party," he said, contending that lawmakers who grew up during the Depression or World War II had a more international outlook.
Representative Karen Shepherd, a freshman Democrat from Utah, said the freshmen, who make up a quarter of the House, were skeptical of the pact. "I'm one of the few who will stand up for it, at least in principle," she said. "Most say it can't be fixed."
Representative Bart Stupak, a freshman Democrat from Michigan who replaced a Republican supporter of the original fast-track authority, is one of the strongest opponents of the pact. "Nafta would be particularly damaging to workers in our manufacturing sector," he said.
Representative Karan English, a freshman Democrat from Arizona, said she thought it was too early to see a generation gap. Many freshmen now questioning the pact are eager to learn about it, she said. Still, she was reluctant to accept the agreement as intrinsically a good idea. "It's not enough to say we have a great plan and it will work; we have to say how it will work," Ms. English said.
While it did not seem likely that either Mr. Perot or the reluctant freshmen could torpedo the pact by themselves, the combination has alarmed the White House, which is reassessing its strategy.
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said in an interview today that it was still too early to assess the pact's eventual prospects. He also said that three side agreements now being negotiated on labor, environmental and trade-volume issues would help the political prospects of the overall deal.
"When we come back with a package on the issues that people are concerned about, that will make a difference," Mr. Kantor said.
George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, said the White House would "just wait and see what" Mr. Perot said.
An aide to Mr. Perot said he would appear on Wednesday before the House Small Business Committee only because he had been invited to do so by its chairman, Representative John J. LaFalce, Democrat of upstate New York.
To be sure, the overall betting of many members of Congress is still that the trade pact will be approved by Congress if President Clinton produces strong side agreements and also lobbies hard for party unity on the vote. "I don't think this is a lost cause for him; this is eminently doable," said Representative Robert T. Matsui, a California Democrat and senior member of the Ways and Means Committee's trade panel.
Yet the problems lying ahead of the Administration are clearest in the cases of Representatives like Ms. Shepherd and Ms. English. Both are moderate Democrats from the Southwest, the region seen by many economists as the most likely to benefit from the pact.
Both of them also went on a recent Congressional trip to Tijuana, Mexico, and said the environmental and labor problems they saw there had made a deep impression .

HEADLINE: Months After Order on Gay Ban, Military Is Still Resisting Clinton

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22

 BODY:
Two months after President Clinton ordered the Pentagon to prepare an executive order lifting the ban on homosexuals in the military, little work has been done, senior Congressional and Defense Department officials say.
In fact, these officials say, some steps have been taken to undermine the order. The Navy is showing lawmakers a commander's sworn statement describing the disruption caused by a gay sailor's presence at a California naval base. And an Army panel studying the effect of lifting the ban is warning that doing so could hurt recruiting so badly that the military might have to return to the draft. 
 Defense Secretary Les Aspin has not yet appointed members to the Pentagon study group that will direct the Administration's effort to draft a new policy. And with no guidance from the panel, some of the services seem to be pursuing strategies to keep the ban.
In January, after days of negotiation and rancor, the Administration and Congress struck a compromise to allow the military to continue its ban for six months while the Defense Department drafted the executive order to lift it. But some military officials are trying to derail the new policy by highlighting problems with it.
 
'We Can't Fight It Openly'
 "The military would love to fight this, but we can't fight it openly," said one Army official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The Pentagon has until July 15 to present details of a new policy to Mr. Clinton, and senior Administration officials insist they will work out a proposal acceptable to military leaders and Congress by then.
George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, said in an interview that he was unaware of any efforts by the military to undermine the new policy and that the Pentagon's planning was "proceeding as it should be." He said the Pentagon study group and a second team of personnel experts, from the Rand Corporation, would begin work on April 1.
 
'Plenty of Time' Left
 "We have plenty of time to carry out the study group," said Lieut. Gen. Robert M. Alexander of the Air Force, who is temporarily the Defense Department's chief personnel official and who will probably serve on the panel.
But time is running short. The Senate Armed Services Committee is to begin hearings on homosexuals in the military next week, and although Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the committee, has promised that the hearings will be "fair, thorough and objective," he opposes lifting the ban.
The Senate hearings will first examine the history of homosexuals in the military and then look at how other countries have handled the issue. Mr. Nunn said the committee would visit military installations to interview troops and by June would hear from advocacy groups and senior military officials in Washington.
"If I were the Administration, I'd be reviewing all the questions Nunn has raised, because like it or not he is the adversary on this one," said a senior member of the Senate staff.
By contrast, senior civilian officials at the Pentagon, preoccupied with Bosnia and Somalia, base closings and next year's military budget, have spent little time on the issue. Mr. Aspin and Deputy Defense Secretary William J. Perry are the only senior Pentagon officials nominated by the White House and confirmed by the Senate, leaving dozens of important positions vacant.
The services have filled the vacuum with their own campaigning.
The Navy, for example, has distributed to two Congressional committees a sworn statement from the commander of Petty Officer Keith Meinhold, a 12-year Navy veteran who was discharged last year after disclosing on national television that he is gay.
 
Citing Navy Procedure
 A Federal court later ordered the Navy to reinstate Mr. Meinhold, an airborne sonar operator. The statement by his commander, Capt. Gregory Markwell, was taken in connection with a Government appeal and asserted that Mr. Meinhold's presence had hurt morale and that some other airmen had refused to fly with him.
A Navy spokesman, Comdr. Craig Quigley, said that the Senate Armed Services Committee's Republican staff requested the deposition last Friday and that Navy procedure required that the same document be given to the committee's Democratic staff, as well as to the Republican and Democratic staffs of the House Armed Services Committee. But Navy officials who support the ban have been quietly advertising the availability of the statement for several weeks.
Further, a five-officer Army team studying the implications of lifting the ban said in working papers that any such policy would "force the military to experiment with profound cultural and life style changes not accepted by the majority of Americans."
The Army group also warned that recruiting might be hurt to the point where "the country may be forced to consider abandoning the all-volunteer force and returning to conscription," said the working papers, which were presented last week to Lieut. Gen. Thomas P. Carney, the Army's personnel chief, and whose contents were first reported last week by the Scripps Howard News Service.
 
Each Sevice Has Panel
 Each of the armed services has formed its own working group on the gay issue that will eventually work with the Pentagon panel.
The working papers of the Army's team, headed by Brig. Gen. Thomas C. Jones, suggest that the group is compiling evidence to demonstrate how lifting the ban would harm the military.
The Air Force's 20-member working group, headed by Brig. Gen. William B. Davitte, "is taking the position that we've been told change will take place, so how can we best do that," said one officer involved in the review.
The Navy has selected Rear Adm. Scott Redd to head its study team but has not actually created it yet, preferring to wait for guidance from the Pentagon panel, said one Navy officer.
Gay-rights advocates are reluctant to criticize the inaction on this issue, partly because they fear alienating their allies within the Defense Department and partly because their own lobbying efforts have lagged.
Thomas B. Stoddard, coordinator of the Campaign for Military Service, a new coalition of rights groups that oppose the ban, said that its grass-roots lobbying campaign was revving up. Gay veterans and their supporters started a six-week nationwide bus tour last week that will end with a rally in Washington on April 23.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 26, 1993, Friday / March 27, 1993, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about President Clinton's news conference comments about the possibility of restricted military assignments for gay troops referred incorrectly to a leading advocate of homosexuals in the military. The advocate, who was quoted on his reaction to the comments, is Thomas B. Stoddard.

An article on Tuesday about military resistance to President Clinton's proposals to allow homosexuals in the military misstated the date of a gay rally scheduled for Washington. It is April 25, not April 23.

HEADLINE: U.S. Power, Less Than Super

BYLINE: By Stephen Sestanovich; Stephen Sestanovich is director of Russian and Eurasian Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Lose Yeltsin, lose the peace dividend. From Richard Nixon on down, commentators treat the prospect of higher defense spending as the clinching argument for increasing Western aid to Russia. Secretary of State Warren Christopher made the same case yesterday in his speech before the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations. Yet the pay-me-now-or-pay-me-later choice they and others pose is less hard-boiled analysis than wishful thinking, and it reflects a failure to imagine the immense problems that will flow from the failure of Russian democracy.
Increasing the defense budget bought security during the cold war. It will buy much less if things now go wrong in Russia. The real cost we face is not the loss of the peace dividend, but the loss of American pre-eminence. 
 A post-Yeltsin government is likely to make a major effort to save our peace dividend -- and theirs -- by convincing us that the cold war is still over. And it won't be so hard: Russian conservatives can't pay for an arms race any more than Russian liberals can.
In the past few months, there has been a clear convergence in their positions on defense and foreign policy. Liberals now favor increased sales of sophisticated military equipment to the third world to keep Russian arms manufacturers in business. And conservatives say they recognize that the military-industrial complex has to be sharply cut back.
A change of government could push this convergence further still. In power, Russian conservatives might well discover virtues in the very arms control agreements that they now call humiliating. Their favorite, Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoi, has already endorsed the Start 2 treaty; as president, he would be likely to change his stance (although to please his supporters he might prepare a list of provisions whose terms he would like to see "improved").
As for President Clinton, his stake in protecting his economic program will give him a powerful incentive to conclude that a new government in Moscow does not pose a greater military threat to America after all.
In contrast, Russia's neighbors cannot afford to be complacent. Germany, Poland, Ukraine, China, Japan, South Korea, Turkey, Iran and others will worry about being on the receiving end of more belligerent Russian nationalism. Almost all of them will turn to Washington for security guarantees, military assistance and in some cases even the stationing of U.S. troops.
To most such inquiries, however, it will be hard for the U.S. to give a satisfying answer. One obvious idea will be to reconsider the ongoing withdrawal of U.S. forces from Western Europe, where troop levels are already down to 167,000 from the cold war norm of 300,000. (Congress last year set a target of 100,000 troops for 1995.) But the practical difficulty of reversing this process would be only half the problem. Restoring our ability to fight a war in the middle of Germany has little relevance to the dangers created by a less cooperative and possibly revanchist Russia.
Conservative nationalists in Moscow don't aim to reacquire what was East Germany. But they do want to draw Ukraine back into some sort of political union, and they may be prepared to use military pressure to help matters along. Given this possibility, does anyone seriously believe that the U.S. will make a military commitment to Ukrainian independence? To do so now, as a preventive step, would be needlessly inflammatory; to do so later, too dangerous. Inevitably, the Western response to Ukrainian appeals will be far more muted, a combination of diplomatic warnings to Russia and offers of mediation. Meanwhile, the chance that Ukraine will voluntarily give up the strategic nuclear forces that were left on its territory when the Soviet Union collapsed will shrink to nil.
The Ukrainians will not be alone in seeking help -- nor in failing to get it. The rest of the old Warsaw Pact will be in a similar state of alarm. Western security guarantees to Poland or Hungary may not seem as inconceivable as the same commitment to Ukraine. But they and other Eastern European states have already found it impossible to get serious consideration for full NATO membership. At a time when no one thinks they are threatened, they have been told, in effect, come back in five years. When Russia begins to talk ominously about its natural sphere of influence, Western reluctance to get involved will only grow.
America's traditional allies can count on firmer-sounding reassurances. Yet, no matter how much we pledge to stand by them, they too will see that the threats to their security have increased. Our inability to address the anxieties of countries directly affected by a resurgent Russia will make the international environment look much more menacing to Germany and Japan. As a result, American guarantees may seem less and less adequate for their security. Neither country's Government wants to build nuclear forces, but a more nationalist Russia will make the subject harder to avoid.
The eclipse of a pro-Western Government in Russia will destabilize international politics, but it will not revive the cold war. Nor will it call for cold war solutions. Instead, it will reveal the precariousness of the American claim to be the only superpower. As new conflicts arise to which we have no real response and as other governments (including our closest friends) are forced to take more responsibility for their own security, our influence will inescapably wane.
Those who warn about the impact on our defense spending if Russia's democrats are ousted are right that America stands to lose a lot. But they greatly understate the problem by not acknowledging how little we will be able to do for those whose security is directly threatened. An extra hundred billion dollars here and there in the Pentagon budget doesn't deter military conflict the way it used to. The fact that we will have no good response later is the most powerful argument to do what can be done now. Real doubts can be raised about all the many types of aid that have been proposed for Russia, but these doubts are nothing compared with the frustration and powerlessness we will feel once Russian democracy fails.

HEADLINE: Clinton Would Consider Segregating Gay Troops;
For Yeltsin's 'Courage,' President Vows Plan to Support Russia

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 23

 BODY:
President Clinton today brushed aside criticism that he was too closely tied to President Boris N. Yeltsin, saying that Mr. Yeltsin's decision to circumvent the Russian Parliament was "appropriate" and that he would give Mr. Yeltsin "an aggressive and quite specific plan" of aid at their summit meeting.
"Boris Yeltsin is the elected President of Russia, and he has shown a great deal of courage in sticking up for democracy and civil liberties and market reforms, and I'm going to support that," Mr. Clinton said, adding that he would begin briefing Congress this week on his aid proposals. 
 Senior Administration officials said that among the proposals Mr. Clinton was considering were these:
*Housing loan guarantees, to build homes for demobilized Russian troops.
*An enterprise fund to make seed loans to emerging Russian capitalists.
*A technical aid package to help develop the potentially lucrative Russian energy industry.
*Easier terms for the long-promised currency stabilization fund from the West.
*An American-led effort with the Group of Seven industrialized democracies to reschedule some of Russia's $80 billion in foreign debts to provide some $15 billion in relief on interest and principal.
 
U.S. Backing Helps Yeltsin
 State Department officials said reports from the United States Embassy in Moscow have suggested that the backing for Mr. Yeltsin from the United States and other major Western countries like Britain, France and Germany, appeared to be helping generate support for the Russian President among Muscovites and giving pause to his parliamentary opponents.
These reports apparently encouraged Mr. Clinton to come out forcefully and personally in Mr. Yeltsin's behalf today, even though the American President acknowledged that outsiders could only have limited influence events in Moscow.
The President, speaking at his first formal news conference, held in the East Room of the White House, appeared to choose this moment in the Russian political crisis to lend his personal weight to the American backing for Mr. Yeltsin. Mr. Clinton dismissed criticism from some conservative foreign policy specialists like former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger that the Administration was betting too much on the Russian President.
 
Endorses Referendum
 "At this moment, Russia is in a constitutional and political crisis," Mr. Clinton said in his opening remarks. "President Yeltsin proposes to break the logjam by letting the people of Russia decide on April the 25th. That is an appropriate step in a democracy."
Despite Mr. Clinton's forceful words, he did not seem as comfortable talking about Russia as he did answering a range of tough and complicated questions on domestic affairs, from the spotted owl to homosexuals in the military.
When it came to Russia, while he strongly backed Mr. Yeltsin, the President seemed to be trying to find the delicate line between endorsing Mr. Yeltsin enough to help him, but not to the extent that the Russian leader might think he could engage in anti-democratic measures, or to leave the impression that Mr. Clinton was naive about the hard realities of Russian politics.
 
A Throwback to Reagan
 Mr. Clinton's first news conference, which lasted 45 minutes, seemed athrowback to the Reagan years. President Bush usually chose to hold his news conferences in the more drab, crowded White House press room. But like Mr. Reagan, President Clinton began and ended by striding alone down the long red-carpeted hallway leading through the White House to the cream-colored East Room, with network cameras tracking his every pace.
The questions from the media were split between foreign and domestic issues. Mr. Clinton's demeanor was as congenial and smiling, except when he seemed rattled by a question on unhappiness in the American military toward him.
Mr. Clinton spoke with scant reference to the three-by-five cards that Mr. Reagan depended upon. When he was done, he bounced off the podium, clearly pleased with his performance, and joking that he liked the encounter with the press so much he might do it again sometime.
It was clear from his opening statement, which began with the need to support Mr. Yeltsin, that Mr. Clinton wanted to send the signal that when the first popularly elected President in Russia was on the ropes, the Clinton Administration did not waver in its backing.
In his efforts to help Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Clinton said that if the Russians want to move the site of the summit next month to Moscow he would be ready to consider the idea. But the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, who today met with Secretary of State Warren Christopher, said after several hours of talks that there were "no changes" contemplated in the meeting, which is scheduled to be held in Vancouver, British Columbia, April 3-4.
"We have agreed upon an agenda and a place for this meeting and we are concentrating not on revision of all this but on preparing a good stage for Presidents to have productive summit," Mr. Kozyrev said. "Everything is O.K. and under control."
 
Russia's First Elected Leader
 The Washington Post carried a lengthy article this morning on its Op-Ed page by Mr. Kissinger, which said: "Once again, American policy toward Russia is being presented largely in terms of supporting a particular Russian leader. First it was Mikhail Gorbachev; now it is Boris Yeltsin. I questioned then and doubt now whether it is wise to gear American policy so totally to any individual whatever his merits."
Mr. Clinton seemed to refer to that article, and others like it, when he responded to a question whether he was getting too close to Mr. Yeltsin, as the Bush Administration had with Mr. Gorbachev.
"I don't think so," he said. "I know some people say, well, what's the difference in this and the Gorbachev situation before, and is this the same sort of problem? I've tried to be supportive of reformers throughout Russia and, indeed, throughout all the former Communist countries and the former republics of the Soviet Union. But he is, after all, the first elected President in a thousand years. He has the mandate of having been voted on in a free and open election where people were free to vote and free to stay home, something that was not true previously. And that is something you would expect me to do."
 
List of U.S. Interests
 Mr. Clinton, though, tried to temper his remarks by placing his support for Mr. Yeltsin in the context of broader, immutable American interests. But he recited these with none of the passion contained in his remarks about the Russian President.
"The United States has three interests in our cooperation with Russia," Mr. Clinton said, referring to note cards. "One is to make the world a safer place, continue to reduce the threat of nuclear war and the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Two is to support the development of democracy and freedom for the people of Russia -- and indeed for all of the Commonwealth of Independent States. And three is to support the development of a market economy."
Mr. Clinton said Americans "have no reason to be concerned" about who is in command and control of Russia's arsenal of 30,000 nuclear warheads during the power crisis. "We are monitoring that very closely," Mr. Clinton said. "We feel good about it."

HEADLINE: ATTORNEY GENERAL SEEKS RESIGNATIONS FROM PROSECUTORS

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 23

 BODY:
Attorney General Janet Reno today demanded the prompt resignation of all United States Attorneys, leading the Federal prosecutor in the District of Columbia to suggest that the order could be tied to his long-running investigation of Representative Dan Rostenkowski, a crucial ally of President Clinton.
Jay B. Stephens, the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia, who is a Bush Administration holdover, said he had advised the Justice Department that he was within 30 days of making a "critical decision" in the Rostenkowski case when Ms. Reno directed him and other United States Attorneys to submit their resignations, effective in a matter of days. 
 While prosecutors are routinely replaced after a change in Administration, Ms. Reno's order accelerated what had been expected to be a leisurely changeover.
 
Says He Won't Resist
 At a news conference today only hours after one by Ms. Reno, Mr. Stephens said he would not resist the Attorney General's move to force him from office, and he held back from directly accusing her of interfering with the Rostenkowski inquiry.
But Mr. Stephens left the strong impression that Ms. Reno's actions might disrupt the investigation as he moved toward a decision on whether to seek charges against the Illinois Democrat, who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
"This case has been conducted with integrity," Mr. Stephens said, "and I trust the decisions in this case will not be made based on political considerations."
Nonetheless, lawyers who have followed the investigation have said that Mr. Stephens has been concerned that the Democratic Administration might try to upset his investigation.
 
Has Denied Wrongdoing
 Mr. Rostenkowski has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, and he has not been accused of any impropriety. But if he is indicted, he would be forced by House rules to relinquish his chairmanship, a development that some lawmakers have said could seriously jeopardize Mr. Clinton's efforts to steer his economic and health-care proposals through Congress.
Mr. Stephens and his prosecutors began the investigation that led them to review Mr. Rostenkowski's activities in mid-1991, focusing initially on low-level employees at the House post office who absconded with money. There have been several guilty pleas as prosecutors have worked their way up the ranks at the mailing operation.
Mr. Rostenkowski has been under scrutiny since last year, when his office records were subpoenaed in an inquiry into whether someone in his office used his expense account fraudulently to obtain cash from the post office. Since then, some of his aides have testified to a grand jury and investigators have examined his use of campaign funds.
 
Denies Any Connection
 In announcing her order at her first news conference as Attorney General, Ms. Reno denied there was any connection between her action and the Rostenkowski case and said Mr. Stephens had been treated like other United States Attorneys."
Ms. Reno said United States Attorneys "are absolutely integral to the whole success of the Department of Justice," and her aides said today that she did not intend to immediately remove any whose presence was required to complete an investigation.
One official suggested that even Mr. Stephens might be asked to stay on until a successor is named, saying Ms. Reno had made no decisions about who she may choose on an interim basis.
All 93 United States Attorneys knew they would be asked to step down, since all are Republican holdovers, and 16 have resigned so far. But the process generally takes much longer and had usually been carried out without the involvement of the Attorney General.
 
Battles of the Past
 Ms. Reno is under pressure to assert her control over appointments at the Justice Department. She was Mr. Clinton's third choice for Attorney General and arrived after most of the department's senior positions were already filled by the White House.
The comments of Ms. Reno and Mr. Stephens evoked the pitched battles of the past, when independent United States Attorneys resisted removal by new administrations.
In 1969, for instance Robert Morgenthau, now the Manhattan District Attorney, resisted efforts by the Nixon Administration to replace him as United States Attorney in New York until he was given what he called an "ultimatum" by President Richard M. Nixon to leave office.
In 1978, Attorney General Griffin B. Bell removed David W. Marston as United States Attorney in Philadelphia, provoking charges, never proved, that a lawmaker under scrutiny by Mr. Marston's office had urged President Jimmy Carter to remove the prosecutor.
 
Four-Year Terms
 United States Attorneys are appointed to serve four-year terms at the pleasure of the President. It was unclear whether Ms. Reno initiated the request for resignations or whether it was pressed on her by the White House. The Attorney General said it was a "joint decision."
Ms. Reno said she wanted the resignations "so that the U.S. Attorneys presently in position will know where they stand and that we can begin to build a team."
Some Administration officials dismissed Mr. Stephens's veiled assertions about the Attorney General's motives as "absurd," as one put it, saying that what was surprising was that it had taken so long before the Justice Department could begin putting its own appointees in place.
 
Abortion Clinic Violence
 On other topics, Ms. Reno said she would work with Democrats in Congress to prepare legislation to give Federal agencies a larger role in protecting abortion clinics.
Her comments came after she had ordered a review of current law, which she said was inadequate "to prevent or to help prevent physical interference with access to abortion clinics."
She also ruled out a Federal inquiry into the death of Dr. David Gunn, a physician who was shot to death as he entered an abortion clinic in Pensacola, Fla., apparently by a man who said he was an anti-abortion activist. "Florida law on this subject is more effective than Federal law," said Ms. Reno, a former Florida prosecutor.
Ms. Reno also said she had not decided whether to replace William S. Sessions, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who has been found to have violated ethics rules.

HEADLINE: Lessons of South Carolina: What Secretary May Try for U.S. Schools

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SUMMERTON, S.C.

 BODY:
When Richard W. Riley -- then Governor, now President Clinton's Secretary of Education -- first looked hard at South Carolina's schools in 1983, he saw an educational backwater. The state trailed nearly all others in test scores and money for schools. Rural towns like this one did not even have working microscopes in science classrooms.
It was the start of his second term. Within a year, mounting a campaign that offered toll-free education phone lines and educational town meetings, Mr. Riley pushed through changes hailed at the time as the nation's most wide-ranging education effort. By spending more money on public schools, imposing higher standards and holding the schools responsible for results, the law helped South Carolina post some of the biggest test score increases in the country, even if the state's scores still lag behind many others. 
 "It brought South Carolina from the dark ages into the light," said Jo Day, a first-grade teacher at Joseph Keels Elementary School in Columbia.
 
From Statewide to Nationwide
 The lessons Mr. Riley learned along the way are the ones he plans to apply to America's schools: rally public support to build coalitions to fight for education; insist that schools set goals and test for results; spend money to help schools meet higher standards; ask schools to develop comprehensive plans for change, and keep tinkering with the results. Many of these principles are incorporated in the Clinton Administration's first big education bill, expected to be unveiled next week.
The admirers of the 60-year-old Secretary expect him to do for American education what he did for South Carolina: apply his persuasive powers, his gift for winning allies and his grit to a cause he cares deeply about.
"He has a bone-deep commitment," said Bill Youngblood, a lawyer in Charleston who heads a business-education group charged by the state with monitoring South Carolina's education laws. "You feel it within a few seconds of the time you meet him. It affects you."
But Mr. Riley's experience in South Carolina also shows how difficult, complex and slow a task he and his department will face. Despite considerable progress, South Carolina still ranks low compared with the nation as a whole, and test scores have not improved in the last two years. This plateau suggests the limitations of the basic-skills, top-down approach many states adopted in the mid-80's.
And time has also demonstrated other needs the law did not meet -- ones Mr. Riley and his aides say they will emphasize at the national level: teacher training, more extensive early childhood programs, flexibility for local schools, consolidation of the melange of social services for poor children in schools, and more emphasis on the sophisticated analytical skills that employers want.
 
A State System Near the Bottom
 When Governor Riley began lobbying for education in 1983, South Carolina's schools, by universal agreement, were in big trouble. "You're talking about a state that by many measures was right down there with Mississippi and Louisiana at the bottom of the barrel," said John C. Norton, now vice president for information of the Southern Regional Education Board and then an education reporter.
But when Mr. Riley asked legislators to raise taxes to increase financing for schools in 1983, they rebuffed him, fueled by opposition from business groups.
The Governor responded with tactics like those Ross Perot and Mr. Clinton would later make famous. He held question-and-answer sessions, set up toll-free numbers and deployed county coordinators to whip up enthusiasm for his proposed changes. In education meetings across the state, Mr. Riley asked participants to commit to further action in their communities. In all, said Terry K. Peterson, an aide to Mr. Riley, about 100,000 people were involved.
South Carolina's Education Improvement Act was passed in 1984. It raised the state sales tax by a penny on the dollar to pay for remedial and advanced classes, higher teachers' salaries, early-childhood programs, and new basic-skills tests, including a high school graduation exam. Schools that improved scores and attendance got cash bonuses; the state intervened in school districts whose scores and other indicators dipped below set levels.
South Carolina's law was similar in many respects to changes Governor Clinton made in Arkansas: increasing the sales tax to spend more money on education, setting higher academic standards, expanding early childhood programs, and raising teacher salaries. Yet experts rate South Carolina's education changes as the most comprehensive in the country.
And by comparison with Arkansas, another state ranked near the bottom by most measures of education, South Carolina's improvements were often remarkable, although they were powered by a more robust economy. From 1983-84 to 1989-90, per-pupil spending rose 50 percent after inflation, compared with 25 percent in Arkansas and in the United States as a whole; in the 1980's, teachers' salaries in South Carolina rose 25.6 percent, compared with 11.3 percent in Arkansas and 19.7 percent in the United States.
In 1983, just 42 percent of South Carolina's eighth graders passed a basic-skills math test and 56 percent passed a reading test. Teacher salaries, which averaged $16,523, and the state's per-pupil spending, $2,080, placed it 46th in the nation.
By 1991, 73 percent of students were passing the math test and 75 percent passing the reading test in eighth grade. Teacher salaries had risen to $28,340, 38th in the nation. Per-pupil spending increased to $4,537, 40th in the nation.
In addition to raising test scores, the education law and subsequent revisions fired public enthusiasm about education and created a coalition of politicians, business executives and educators that continues to push for improvement in the schools.
Mr. Riley wants to generate similar excitement about education nationwide. "We got so much into it, it really became a movement in our state," he said in an interview last week. "If you develop a feeling in this country of reaching for high standards and quality education throughout the system, an almost patriotic feeling -- that kind of an upswell has to come from national leadership."
 
Two Schools, Two Results
 Joseph Keels Elementary School in Columbia is a kind of showcase for Mr. Riley's educational improvements. Because it has continually improved test scores, the school has won state incentive awards that not only bought Keels Elementary rooms of new computers, but also prompted teachers to change how they were serving their mostly black, poor and working-class students.
The principal, Shirley Henderson, and a group of teachers decided to put $90,000 of their money into training teachers in new educational techniques. They also developed a program, including full-day kindergarten, to prevent early school failure. They won a grant to keep the computer lab open through the summer. And they began an after-school program for students whose parents need to leave them in school until 6 P.M.
The teachers are so enthusiastic they complete one another's sentences. "We are much better teachers than we were five years ago," said Ms. Day, the first-grade teacher. And Sandra McLain, a third-grade teacher who won a place on a national committee developing science curriculum standards, added, "But not as good as we will be tomorrow."
Fifty miles southeast of Columbia, here in Summerton, it is easier to see how far South Carolina has come and how far some parts still need to go. A rural town of worn wooden shacks, trailers and a handful of more gracious houses on the white side of town, Summerton has no industry and virtually no tax base. Change has come slowly to a town marred by continuing racial division and the political cronyism that comes when the school district is the biggest payroll in town.
Scotts Branch High School is in a cheerless, worn building of the 1950's, when it was built for black students in an effort to stave off desegregation. The money from the Educational Improvement Act bought the district new computers, remedial classes, and some classes for gifted children. Milton Marley, the superintendent, proudly cites the first two grants the schools have ever won for improving test scores this year and last year. The science classroom now has laboratory sinks and microscopes. But a sense of deprivation still hangs heavily here, as evident as the scarred and rutted linoleum.
A science teacher tries gamely to interest her students in a demonstration of convection and radiation. Students light candles, moving their hands above the flame as she coaxes them to guess how the heat is reaching their fingers. A kind of torpor pervades the classroom and the school.
 
Some Progress, But Not Enough
 As Mr. Riley sets out to apply some of the solutions he tried in South Carolina to the country, he may be guided by what worked and what did not in his home state. Mr. Riley intends to continue a push begun by the Bush Administration for national curriculum standards and a national testing system.
In South Carolina, Mr. Riley raised standards, but also poured money into remedial programs to help the one-third of the state's children who could not meet even basic-skills standards.
But educators in South Carolina are rethinking remedial programs because not enough students made progress, an experience that may influence Mr. Riley as he redesigns the biggest Federal remedial program for poor children, Chapter One.
South Carolina has also struggled with the highly charged issue of how to hold schools accountable for results and how best to measure student progress.
While many schools like Keels Elementary flourished under a system of rewards and punishments based on achievement, many educators continue to question whether the tests fairly measured student progress and whether they overemphasized basic skills.
Some school districts, feeling pressure to raise scores, based their curriculum on the tests and issued rigid guidelines. "You could go into a school district, and at 10 on Tuesday morning at every school in the district, teachers were all teaching the main idea in a paragraph," Mr. Norton said.
Mr. Riley's closest allies agree with the state's new Superintendent of Education, Barbara S. Nielsen, that schools now need to emphasize, and new tests need to measure, more sophisticated analytical skills. "We need problem solving, the ability to work on a team, the training necessary to understand work -- things you can't measure by filling in a bubble with a No. 2 pencil on the basic-skills test of our reform of 10 years ago," Mr. Youngblood said.
South Carolina has continued to revise its education laws as the state's needs have changed. A successor to the 1984 law, called Target 2000, was passed in 1989 under Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr., a Republican who succeeded Mr. Riley and remains a leader in education nationwide. The legislation offers grants to schools that emphasized some of these new skills and established an ambitious arts education program.
But there is a clear sense in South Carolina that deeper changes are needed. "It's time to refocus," said Mary Jones, superintendent of the Kershaw County School District, who helped plan the original 1984 law. "We tried to implement this on top of a system that was already in place that was not working."
And as Mr. Riley embarks on his new task, the question remains exactly how he will put into practice the lessons he learned in South Carolina.
"This reform was very progressive for its time," Mr. Norton said. "The question is, has he learned from that, and now does he see that was only part of the way home?"

Wall St. seems to like Rochester Telephone's plan to split in two.

BYLINE: By Anthony Ramirez

 BODY:
THE Rochester Telephone Corporation, a peanut in the elephantine world of telecommunications, is receiving a great deal of attention from Wall Street after proposing a bold plan to end its near-monopoly in local phone service in exchange for freedom from regulation that has hurt profits.
Under a plan filed in February with the New York Public Service Commission, Rochester Tel would split into two entities. One, a company known for filing purposes as R-Net, would run the phone network in Rochester and provide basic phone services to all comers -- a new Rochester Tel unit and new competitors. This other company, known for now as R-Com, would buy services from R-Net and resell them to the public with a greater chance of making higher profits. 
 New competitors in local service would buy services from R-Net on the same terms as R-Com. The plan affects about 30 percent of Rochester Tel's $804 million in 1992 revenue. Another 40 percent of its business involves local service in 14 other states, and the rest involves a Northeastern long-distance carrier and some cellular properties.
New York regulators are expected to begin hearings on the plan in the next month or so. But analysts say it may take a year or more before regulators finish reviewing the plan.
The company's stock had risen from $37.125 at the time of the announcement Feb. 3 to $38.375 on Friday. Yesterday, in what analysts said was profit taking, the stock fell $1 a share, closing at $36.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.
To understand the local phone market, imagine that Procter & Gamble owned all the nation's laundry detergent factories, the trucks for delivering it, and the supermarket shelf space for the boxes. Competing against such a Procter & Gamble would be prohibitively expensive. But one alternative would be to have P.& G. lease factories and trucks to competitors while they build up their own companies.
That, in broad outline, is what happened with the breakup of A.T.& T. and what would also happen under Rochester Tel's plan.
The plan may well be a model for other local carriers. Like a more widely publicized plan by Ameritech, the regional Bell company in the Midwest, the Rochester Telephone plan is designed to position the carrier as a nimble competitor, hold down rates for residential customers and unlock value for shareholders.
Analysts say the smaller Rochester Tel is likely to encounter less resistance than Ameritech from regulators and potential competitors, giving its plan a better chance for approval.
Rochester Tel competitors would presumably come out of the woodwork if the plan was approved. Possible competitors include A.T.& T., MCI and Sprint, as well as small companies that serve businesses, like Metropolitan Fiber Systems and Teleport Communications Group.
Other competitors might be cable television companies. New equipment and digital technology would allow operators like Time Warner to offer phone service over much the same cable network that now carries television. Moreover, an alliance with a long-distance carrier like MCI could offer an attractive discount package of both local and long-distance service.
Under its plan, Rochester Tel would freeze phone rates until next year and then raise rates by no more than the inflation rate through 1997. Thus, Rochester Tel expects the typical $23 residential bill to rise slowly in the plan's first years.
John E. Money, telecommunications analyst at Argus Research in New York City, said the Rochester Tel plan "was absolutely and philosophically right on." If the plan is approved, he expects Rochester Tel's stock price to rise at least 10 percent to 15 percent and probably more.

HEADLINE: Japan Gets New Demands on Chip Imports

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, March 24

 BODY:
The United States pressed on Tuesday for continued improvement in sales of foreign-made computer chips in Japan, even though Tokyo had already met the main goal of a semiconductor trade agreement.
At a meeting in Hawaii, United States Government officials told the Japanese that it would be a "reasonable expectation" for foreign chip makers to average 20 percent of the Japanese market for all of 1993, according to one American official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
 But the Japanese Government, which fears that the semiconductor agreement will become a precedent for setting quotas in other trade treaties, said it would be "inappropriate" to set any new, specific targets.
The debate came at a meeting to assess progress of the 1991 semiconductor trade agreement between the United States and Japan, which called for American and other non-Japanese products to get 20 percent of Japan's semiconductor market by the end of 1992.
In a separate meeting in Hawaii between representatives of the American and Japanese electronics industries on Monday, the American manufacturers also called for new "quantifiable targets," saying that such goals were found to be clearly effective in opening Japan's market.
In newly calculated data that came as a shock to both sides late last week, the 20 percent goal was met in the fourth quarter of 1992, when the foreign market share jumped an unprecedented 4.3 percent, to 20.2 percent.
Although this gain may have been an aberration, it defused what had been expected to be a tense meeting with American officials threatening to impose trade sanctions on Japan.
Officials from both sides said that the meeting in Hawaii was constructive and that they had agreed on several steps to continue helping American and other non-Japanese semiconductor companies sell in Japan.
The United States conveyed the view of the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, that averaging 20 percent foreign share in 1993 would be a "reasonable expectation." But American officials did not seem to press this issue too hard, one Japanese negotiator said.
"They didn't ask anything concrete," the Japanese official said. "They just conveyed that message."
American officials say that achieving an average of 20 percent for 1993 would insure that foreign market share in Japan did not slip.
The fact that market share rose above 20 percent in the fourth quarter of 1992 was considered somewhat of a fluke. The Japanese companies, under severe prodding from their Government, made a last-ditch effort to buy more foreign chips. At the same time, the overall size of the Japanese market declined because of the economic slump here.
But if the economy recovers, foreign market share could fall again. Japanese officials are already saying that market share could be expected to "fluctuate" from now on.
The American officials say that the trade agreement calls for "steady and gradual" improvement in market access through the life of the agreement, which runs until 1996. The agreement also states that market share, which will continue to be calculated quarterly, is the main method used to measure progress in market access. Thus, they say, the agreement implies that market share should continue to improve.
Japanese officials are worried that the Clinton Administration will view the semiconductor agreement as a model for other agreements.
Although the Administration's trade policy is still unclear, President Clinton and advisers have at times talked about taking a tough approach to Japan.
At his news conference on Tuesday, President Clinton said "the persistence of the surplus the Japanese enjoy with the the United States and with the rest of the developed world can only lead one to the conclusion that the possibility of obtaining real, even access to the Japanese market is somewhat remote."

HEADLINE: A Risky Partnership

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 23

 BODY:
When President Clinton called the White House Monday from Little Rock, where he was visiting his critically ill father-in-law, several aides told him they thought he could conduct his first news conference today with only perfunctory reference to the crisis in Russia.
"Make a short statement, then say the situation is too delicate for further comment, that was the advice," one adviser reported today. 
 "But he didn't want to do that. He told us this was an issue he wanted to link himself to in a strong, positive, public way, not just through Administration spokesmen. He wanted to make Russian reform his cause as much as Boris Yeltsin's."
So that was what Mr. Clinton did, at this, his first full-dress news conference as President. The conference had been a long time in coming, but it was hardly his coming-out party; Mr. Clinton has been to a lot of dances already, answering questions in almost every setting imaginable in his first two months in office.
 
No Pomp in Old Circumstance
 Today, in the stagey East Room forum originally devised for Ronald Reagan, the President seemed loose and jolly, if understandably more guarded on the dicey situation in Russia than in discussing a wide range of other domestic and foreign topics.
There were hedges, of course, in his comments on the perils that the Russian President faces, notably an effort to identify the United States with all Russian democrats -- not just Mr. Yeltsin. But in promising to present a substantial aid program in the next few days and in passing the word that he would gladly meet Mr. Yeltsin in Moscow instead of in Canada if that would help, Mr. Clinton was taking a bold approach for one so inexperienced.
"We are not bystanders," he said. And at another point: "I intend to go in there with an aggressive and quite specific plan for American partnership."
Like many other American Presidents, Mr. Clinton sought to make Russians seem like Americans, a dubious proposition in the best of times. Of Muscovite-in-the-street interviews on television, he said: "They sound almost like our people might sound talking about some fight we were having here. They've been remarkably levelheaded about it, and I think we have to let it play out."
 
The Activist From Arkansas
 The difference, of course, is that Russia has no established institutions into which political animosities can be channeled. The potential for an explosion, in which the United States could be seriously hurt, is therefore great.
So if Mr. Clinton's approach is bold, it is also quite risky. The White House concedes that it has only limited power to help Mr. Yeltsin; as Mr. Clinton said today, it will be the Russians who will decide their own fate.
But the President thinks he must be seen to be trying to achieve all he can, even at the margins. He told a friend last week that it would be better to try and fail, than to sit on his hands and allow his critics to accuse him of having passively lost Russia, as Harry S. Truman's enemies for so many years accused him of having "lost" China.
Between now and April 25, the date of Mr. Yeltsin's referendum, one aide said, "help will have to be symbolic." Mr. Clinton's comments today were part of the symbolism, as will be the very fact of the summit meeting early next month. As things now stand, Vancouver, British Columbia, remains the site because, as the Russians have suggested strongly in the last 24 hours, moving it would make Mr. Yeltsin look too weak.
 
Trying to Round Up Aid
 The President is also reportedly preparing for a major effort to push Japan into a more cooperative position on the question of aid to Russia.
"They're going to have to drop their insistence on those islands," the aide added, alluding to Tokyo's demand that its long-standing territorial dispute with Moscow over four Kurile islands be settled before it discusses major aid for Russia.
In the diplomatic maneuvering over the next few weeks and months, the Administration would also like to win a commitment for further help from Germany. But the Government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl has already spent heavily to help the Soviet Union and then Russia, with only limited results, and it faces huge bills in modernizing eastern Germany.
The big question preoccupying American planners is how to get money past or around the Government in Moscow and into the hands of people who will put it to good use, whether to alleviate economic distress or to start new businesses.
With so few alternative channels open, and with the central bank's status unclear, no solutions are obvious, and selling aid to the American public will almost certainly require a convincing explanation of how it will reach worthy recipients rather than disappear into bureaucrats' pockets.
Mr. Clinton also faces some opposition from foreign-policy specialists; Henry A. Kissinger warned him in a Washington Post essay today to tread carefully. But he faces much more formidable resistance from a public that is weary of foreign adventures, skeptical about Russia and eager to use scarce resources to create jobs and improve health care at home.

Kozyrev, the Russian Foreign Minister, approached a stand of microphones to reassure reporters on the status of the coming summit meeting after he met with Secretary of State Warren Christopher.

Corn and Soybeans Climb On Strong Export Report

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Corn and soybean prices climbed yesterday on reports of strong American corn and soybean exports and hopes that President Clinton's support for President Boris N. Yeltsin might soon translate into agricultural aid for Russia.
In other commodity markets, pork prices retreated in the face of an increased supply, lumber and cotton prices sagged, and oil prices rebounded sharply. 
 Despite a thin burst of buying after President Clinton's first news conference, grain traders were reticent to put too much stake in Mr. Clinton's support of the Russian President, who faces possible impeachment.
Traders showed more immediate interest in United States corn exports, which are running well ahead of a year ago, said Dale Gustafson of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. A donation of 210,000 metric tons of corn to the former Soviet republics and a 200,000-metric- ton offer of subsidized corn to Ukraine helped the market.
May corn pushed through technical resistance at $2.26 to rise 2.75 cents, to $2.27 1/2 a bushel at the Chicago Board of Trade.
May soybeans also knocked down resistance at $5.91, the upper end of a two-month trading range. May soybeans jumped 6.25 cents, to $5.91 1/2 a bushel. Soybean buying was prompted by larger-than-expected weekly exports and weather-related delays in the South American crop.
Wheat prices retreated as traders evened up positions, with May finishing 1 cent lower at $3.40 a bushel.
Lumber futures fell steeply in light trading as the futures market for spruce continued to swing wildly. Mr. Clinton made reference to balancing competing interests regarding the timber industry. The May lumber contract dropped $3.40, to $424.50 for a thousand board feet at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Oil prices rose in a technical bounce and the belief of many traders that supplies of oil products had declined in the latest week. Late yesterday, the American Petroleum Institute issued its weekly report showing that crude oil stocks had declined to 330.9 million barrels in the week ended March 19, from 343 million barrels the week before, while gasoline stocks had fallen to 232.9 million barrels, from 237.4 million barrels.
May crude oil rose 27 cents, to $20.03 a barrel. April heating oil gained 0.94 cent, to 58.11 cents a gallon, and April unleaded gasline firmed 0.86 cent, to 57.12 cents a gallon. April natural gas jumped 7.5 cents, to $2.117 for million British thermal units.

HEADLINE: How a Rebellion Over Environmental Rules Grew From a Patch of Weeds

SERIES: What Price Cleanup? -- Fourth article of a series.

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ohio

 BODY:
This city didn't want to pave paradise for a parking lot. It just wanted to cover a patch of weeds and mud behind the Short Street garage, where the city maintains its fleet of police cruisers and garbage trucks.
But two years ago, city engineers here in Ohio's capital discovered traces of chemicals in the dirt and learned that the Federal hazardous-waste law might require a $2 million cleanup before the first ounce of pavement could be laid. Right then, a forgettable little stretch of urban America became the focus of anger and exasperation so profound that it started a national campaign among cities and states. 
 After the city issued a report on its problems, all of a sudden Columbus's leaders were joined by hundreds of city officials, state leaders and many private homeowners across the country as they advocate a cause that until now big business has been arguing most forcefully: that many of the nation's environmental rules bring enormous expense for little gain.
Although independent safety specialists said the chemical concentrations were too small to cause any harm, Federal law defined several of the compounds as hazardous and required that they be removed, if detectable in the soil at all.
 
What the Law Demanded
 In effect, the law required the city to take these expensive steps:
*Dig up 2.4 million pounds of dirt containing no more than a few pounds of toxic chemicals from a patch of ground no larger than a baseball diamond.
*Ship that dirt 1,500 miles south to Texas to be burned in an incinerator.
*Install detection equipment to monitor the air for up to 25 years for traces of any contaminants that might remain.
All this, the engineers asked, to expand a parking lot?
They called a meeting at City Hall, and that led to the first major study to identify the cost of complying with Federal environmental regulations. It showed that environmental costs were about to swamp Columbus in red ink -- or generate a revolt.
Now nearly 1,000 other cities have asked to see the report. And prompted by the Columbus study, the National League of Cities has made updating the nation's environmental laws -- and through that reducing costs -- one of its top five political priorities in Washington.
In January, mayors from 114 cities in 49 states opened the campaign by sending President Clinton a letter urging the White House to focus on how environmental policy-making had, in their view, gone awry.
"Not only do we sometimes pay too much to solve environmental problems, we've been known to confront the wrong problems for the wrong reasons with the wrong technology," the mayors said.
During the Bush Administration, William K. Reilly, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, offered public support for this campaign and even began offering grants to states that wanted to re-evaluate their priorities.
With that money, Michigan and Vermont were among the first to appoint panels of citizens and scientists to examine environmental policy. In published reports, both state's panels concluded that the largest sums of money were being spent on the least threatening environmental problems, like exposure to toxic and radioactive wastes. In the view of these state panels, more important issues, like damage to farmland and forests, were being largely ignored.
"We're really just about at the end of the reductions in risk that you can achieve by the conventional approach, which is to crank down on the pollution coming out of the end of the pipe," said Dr. William Cooper, an ecologist at Michigan State University who helped lead his state's study. "Now we're into more subtle issues. How clean do we really want our environment? How much are we really willing to pay for it?"
 
The Seeds
Benefits Are Vague As Policy Shifts
 The seeds of this grass-roots push lay in the Federal Government's shift in focus over the last 15 years from promoting broad environmental goals (purifying the air, cleansing the water) to regulating specific toxic substances: dioxin, asbestos and dozens of other compounds found at trace levels in drinking water, chemical-waste sites and the like.
Controlling the kind of pollution that poured out of automobile tailpipes or factory smokestacks, and stopping waste discharges into rivers and streams, showed clear social benefits. And so public acceptance usually came easily.
But the improvements in health or environmental safety from the more recent efforts have been less obvious. Scientists continue to debate how dangerous dioxin may really be. An industrial byproduct, dioxin was once considered the most toxic substance known to man. Reducing dioxin levels to the Federal standard -- less than 13 parts per quintillion in drinking water, the equivalent of a single drop in Lake Michigan -- is difficult and terribly expensive, even though no one really knows what, if any, benefits result.
More than 10 years ago, the Federal Government adopted the view that when there is any doubt, it is better to take the prudent approach than do nothing. But a decade later, the economic costs of this policy are painfully clear while the benefits remain largely unmeasurable.
Last year, home owners, farmers, miners and timber industry workers roared into Washington and brought to a standstill Congressional efforts to reauthorize the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act, two of the laws that form the foundation of American environmental policy. President Bush focused on this theme during his re-election campaign, largely siding with these protesters.
This year, city and state leaders have joined in a campaign to write into statutes a provision requiring the Federal Government to evaluate scientific evidence and the cost to communities before issuing new environmental directives.
Leaders of the major environmental groups are fighting this idea. They argue that it would set a level of proof so difficult to meet that the Government could not write new regulations until people started dying.
But backers of the provision assert that unless changes are made, public support for environmental protections will crumble as costs rise.
 
The Anger
Counting the Costs In a City Hall
 It was precisely this issue of cost that prompted the Columbus engineers to call a meeting in January 1991. One participant, Michael J. Pompili, who was in charge of the Columbus Health Department's environmental-health division, had on his own been quietly studying how much the city would have to pay to comply with a new wave of rules coming out of Washington. These were intended to prevent public exposure to minute levels of chemicals in air and water.
"The guys were talking about spending all that money for nothing at the Short Street garage," he said in an interview. "They were complaining about the $2 million. And I said, the issue isn't $2 million. It's a lot more than that. I told them my guys had identified millions more in costs citywide to meet Federal environmental requirements, and where were we going to get the money to meet those mandates?"
Columbus's Mayor at the time, Dana Buck Rinehart, a Republican, promptly named Mr. Pompili chairman of the city team that published the environmental study in May 1991.
The report said that to meet dozens of Federal environmental requirements, Columbus faced $1.3 billion to $1.6 billion in new expenses from 1991 through the end of the decade, depending on the inflation rate. Virtually all of that money was to come from the Columbus city treasury.
Of the $591 million 1991 city budget, $62 million, or 11 percent, was devoted to environmental protections. That year, the average Columbus household paid $160 for that purpose.
The study said that by the end of the decade, if every Federal requirement were met, Columbus's environmental budget would more than triple, to $218 million, or roughly 27 percent of the city's $810 million budget projected for the year 2000. The cost to a household for environmental protection would be $856 that year -- more than the cost of fire or police protection.
"When we came up with these kinds of costs, we also looked for the justification and just couldn't find much there," Mr. Pompili said. "I had to wonder, Am I out of touch? I have worked all my life to protect people from environmental harm. Am I looking at these issues in the wrong way?"
Now, he said, "I no longer ask those questions because I'm convinced that we are doing the right thing."
Mr. Pompili said he wants clean air and water as much as anyone else ("This city will not survive without a clean environment"), but he added: "What bothers me is that the new rules coming out of Washington are taking money from decent programs and making me waste them on less important problems. It kills you as a city official to see this kind of money being spent for nothing."
 
The Revolt
Battling Radon: Changing Targets
 Officials in many other cities feel the same way. Late last year, Hastings, Neb., began its own review of environmental costs and concluded that the single biggest drain on its treasury was the $65 million it would take to build a treatment plant to meet a proposed E.P.A. rule for removing radon from the city's water.
Radon is a radioactive gas formed naturally when radium decays in rocks and soil. It is frequently found at trace levels in water pumped from the ground. Before the E.P.A. proposal, made under authority of the Safe Drinking Water Act, almost no public-health specialist had considered radon in drinking water to be any sort of threat. And for years Hastings had been boasting that its water supply was so clean that it could be pumped from an underground aquifer directly into the homes of 23,000 residents.
Last year, however, the E.P.A. said Hastings did have a problem with water: Radon levels exceeded the proposed safety limit. But critics of the proposal, including some agency officials, said the E.P.A.'s decision to tackle the issue was a lesson in the dangers of using weak scientific assumptions to write an expensive new regulation, even while many experts found the idea absurd.
Many studies of radon have shown that it is harmful only if inhaled at high levels over a long period. Almost 30 years ago, the Government did confirm that uranium miners in the West contracted lung cancer after years of working in the mines, where they were exposed to some of the highest levels of radon ever recorded. Among those who died, though, many were heavy smokers.
Then, during the 1980's, the E.P.A. found significant levels of radon in 10 percent of the homes they surveyed across the country. That led the E.P.A. to call radon the most serious environmental public health threat the nation faced. It was a menace so great, the agency said, that radon was probably causing up to 20,000 cases of lung cancer a year.
That estimate has come under intense criticism from many radiation-health specialists, who have called it unscientific and wildly exaggerated.
 
Going After the Water
 But the E.P.A. ignored the criticism and set an unofficial guideline for the amount of radon it considered safe in homes. The agency has been reluctant to make the limit legally enforceable because of the backlash that some E.P.A. officials feared from homeowners. Hundreds of thousands would have had to spend thousands of dollars on ventilation equipment to clear radon from basements.
Since the agency was unwilling to regulate the air in private homes, E.P.A. scientists and technical experts chose to defend their assessment that radon was a menace by taking action against the only other source in homes: tap water. So the E.P.A. proposed a legally enforceable limit on radon in water.
Scientists who have looked at the issue said the threat to health from radon in water, if there is one at all, can come only from inhaling radon that evaporates, particularly during showering. In other words, the Government was trying to prevent someone from getting lung cancer from their morning showers.
Independent radiation-health experts said that in virtually every area of the United States, the amount of radon that evaporates from water is only one-thirtieth to one one-hundredth of what is already naturally in the air. These experts said the regulation does nothing to protect health. "It's a silly thing that E.P.A. is proposing because radon in water is an insignificant public health hazard," said Dr. Ralph E. Lapp, a radiation physicist in Alexandria, Va., and author of 22 books on radiation and public health.
If the regulation becomes final, the cost to install filtering equipment in public water systems in the United States would be $10 billion to $20 billion, according to estimates made by several states. The Association of California Water Agencies recently estimated that the cost in California would approach $4 billion.
"How do we explain to our residents the need for a regulation that costs as much as this one will and doesn't provide any public-health benefits?" asked Dr. Adi Pour, the toxicologist for the Nebraska Department of Health. "If this kind of rule-making continues, it's going to hurt public confidence in environmental protection."
The protests prompted Congress last year to pass legislation sponsored by Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, that prevented the E.P.A. from making the radon rule final until the agency looked at the benefits and costs again. When asked about the rule, Martha G. Prothro, the acting Assistant Administrator for Water at the E.P.A., acknowledged: "We may have gone further than we need to in human health concerns. It's appropriate to go back and look at this proposal."
So for now, Hastings, Neb., has been given a reprieve.
 
Back in Columbus
 As for that parking lot in Columbus, City engineers are still working on the problem. One idea they proposed was to dig up the dirt, turn it over and allow the chemicals to evaporate.
But the state said Federal law forbade that. The engineers then proposed inserting pipes beneath the ground, pumping air to the surface and trapping and filtering chemicals that are released. The state environmental agency is considering that idea. The estimated cost: $250,000 to $500,000.
Next: Thinking of solutions.

GRAPHIC: Table: "Regulation and the Price per Life"
 Two years ago, the Office of Mangement and Budget tried to estimate the cost of certain environmental and safety regulations by dividing the cost of enforcing rule by the number of lives it appeared to save.
 The estimate is highly subjective since it is virtually impossible to know how many lives might have been lost without a certain rule. In addition, the analysis did not account for non-fatal injuries. But this cost-benefit analysis did demonstrate the Bush Administration's attitudes toward the laws it was enforcing.
 Now, state and local governments are distributing this analysis widely to support their criticism of environmental policy.
 The table shows a partial list of regulations and cost per premature death averted.

HEADLINE: Clinton Achieves Diversity Among Rich Advisers

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 23

 BODY:
Some of President Clinton's senior advisers earned hundreds of thousands of dollars as executives and lawyers involved in businesses from Wall Street to Main Street before joining his Administration, according to financial disclosure reports made public today by the White House.
Robert E. Rubin, the President's chief economic adviser who was co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, was the highest paid of the advisers. He reported that he received $26.5 million last year from the brokerage partnership, as well as millions from investments in real estate, oil and gas and other partnerships. 
 Mr. Rubin also disclosed he had significant contact with 42 Goldman clients, most of them foreign companies or countries. The list included Taiwan and Mexico, and companies from Germany, Japan and England. His American clients included Kohlberg, Kravis & Roberts, RJR Nabisco, Safeway and Time Warner.
 
Investment Held in Trust
 Mr. Rubin has liquidated his interest in Goldman, Sachs and converted the proceeds into a bond that is guaranteed by a third party and held in a trust.
Thomas F. McLarty 3d, the White House chief of staff, was paid more than $600,000 by Arkla Inc., the natural gas concern he headed. In addition, Mr. McLarty, upon leaving the company, collected another $3 million for benefits, stock options and deferred compensation that he had accumulated in nearly two decades as a director or executive with Arkla.
His financial disclosure form shows that Mr. McLarty also had consulting arrangements with a wholesale grocer, poultry processor and automobile rental company while he headed Arkla. He received more than $500,000 last year from the three businesses, part as payment for last year's consulting and the rest for terminating the consulting contracts, according to the disclosure report.
 
Worked With First Lady
 Lawyers in the Administration have worked for large financial interests from Wall Street to Little Rock, Ark., as well as smaller businesses. Two of them, Vincent W. Foster, deputy White House counsel, and Webster L. Hubbell, a top Justice Department aide who has served as liaison to the White House, are former senior partners in the Rose law firm, the Little Rock firm where Hillary Rodham Clinton worked before her husband was elected President.
Mr. Hubbell's former clients include Tyson Foods, the poultry giant, and the Worthen Banking Corporation, a Little Rock-based banking company now seeking Federal approval for a merger with a banking company in Arkansas. It is principally owned by the Stephens family, a powerful business group based in Little Rock.
Mr. Foster also represented parts of the Stephens empire, he reported on his disclosure form, including Stephens Inc., a large investment banking company, and Leisure Arts Inc., which publishes needlework patterns and magazines. Mr. Hubbell reported income of $310,000 from the law firm, while Mr. Foster disclosed compensation of $295,000.
The financial disclosure statement of President Clinton's counsel, Bernard W. Nussbaum, shows the disparity in earnings between a partner in a leading law firm in Little Rock and one in New York. Mr. Nussbaum, who withdrew as partner in Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz before becoming White House counsel, reported law partnership income of $1.8 million.
Mr. Nussbaum's list of more than 100 clients reads like a who's who of corporate America, with companies like American Airlines, Allied Signal and Unisys, as well as financial institutions like Chemical Bank, Salomon Brothers, Goldman, Sachs and Prudential Insurance.

HEADLINE: Medical Allies Seek Exemption From Trust Law

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 23

 BODY:
Doctors, hospitals and drug companies told Congress today that they needed relief from antitrust laws so they could collaborate in delivering health care or negotiating prices.
But the chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, Janet D. Steiger, and the American Association of Retired Persons, which represents more than 33 million older people, opposed their pleas. So did Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, the chairman of the Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust policy who presided over a hearing today on the issue. 
 The Clinton Administration is considering changes in antitrust laws to permit doctors and hospitals to collaborate in offering health care to millions of people in a particular area.
The campaign for relaxation of the antitrust laws is, in part, a response to the strategy chosen by President Clinton to revamp the nation's health-care system. He wants people to buy health insurance and health care through large groups of consumers and small businesses. Doctors and hospitals want to increase their market power to counterbalance the economic strength of these purchasing groups.
 
Opposition on Many Sides
 But Mr. Metzenbaum, an Ohio Democrat, and Mrs. Steiger, a Republican, warned that relaxing the antitrust laws could harm consumers.
"We are not aware of any evidence to suggest that allowing physicians to collaborate in negotiating prices will lead to any benefits to consumers," said Mrs. Steiger.
Reginald S. Matthews, a regional coordinator of the A.A.R.P. in Texas, said his group remained "profoundly skeptical" of proposals to relax antitrust enforcement.
The American Medical Association says it wants "immunity from the antitrust laws" to let doctors form cooperative networks and negotiate on prices and other issues with employers, insurance companies and other large buyers of care. The American Hospital Association is asking Congress to revise antitrust law to allow greater cooperation among hospitals. It says such cooperation may lower health costs.
The drug industry has asked the Justice Department to grant an exemption from antitrust laws so drug companies can discuss price restraints.
 
Arguments for Doctors
 Kirk B. Johnson, senior vice president and general counsel of the medical association, said: "Doctors should be able to organize in groups, without entirely merging their practices, as long as they don't dominate the market and as long as they provide some clear efficiency or economy. They should be allowed to agree on a price or reimbursement mechanism. Doctors have to start forming these groups so they can offer services to employers, insurance companies and other purchasers of health services."
Confidential work papers from Hillary Rodham Clinton's Task Force on National Health Care Reform show that the panel is considering "revisions to antitrust laws.
While Congress focused on a complex legal issue, President Clinton spoke at a news conference today in broad generalities about his vision of a new health-care system.
He said he would strive to guarantee health insurance coverage for all Americans within four years. And he said he would not ask individuals or families to pay higher taxes for this purpose until employers, doctors and hospitals had paid some of the cost.
Many health policy experts had assumed that universal coverage would be phased in gradually over more than four years.
Mr. Clinton's comments indicate that the timetable could be swifter, enabling the changes to pay political dividends by the 1996 elections.

HEADLINE: Albany Considers Fund To Preserve Open Land

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ESSEX, N.Y.

 BODY:
Four and a half years ago, New York State's top environmental official telephoned an Adirondack landowner named Gary F. Heurich and floated an offer Mr. Heurich did not want to refuse: nearly $3 million for most of his property, which takes in the largest undeveloped piece of privately owned shoreline on Lake Champlain.
Needing cash and pleased at the idea of public ownership of the land, Mr. Heurich said he was eager to sell. But the deal depended on the passage of a $1.9 billion environmental bond act. And when the state's voters unexpectedly rejected the measure in 1990, New York State had no money left to buy open space -- Mr. Heurich's or anyone else's.
 
Land to Be Auctioned
 Mr. Heurich now intends to put his land up for auction. "What it boiled down to was that the state was a willing buyer and I was a willing seller and everything was in place except the money," he said. "My preference has always been to see the property protected, but at this point, anybody's money is green." 
 Mr. Heurich's property is just a small piece of the Adirondack Park, a six million-acre patchwork of public and private land in northern New York State that for decades has been pulled back and forth between environmentalists who want it further protected and residents who say the state owns too much.
Under legislation being considered in Albany, the state would set up an environmental trust fund of more than $200 million a year to finance environmental projects, including land purchases in the Adirondacks and Catskills and on Long Island.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, a Democrat, and the Assembly, which is dominated by Democrats, have offered different versions of the bill. Mr. Cuomo proposes raising $271 million a year, in part through unclaimed can deposits and a new $5 fee on automobile tires. The Assembly has offered several proposals that include raising $248 million a year, in part through new fees on appliances and household pesticides.
 
Opposition in Senate
 Though the Democrats seem committed to passing some kind of legislation, efforts to enact similar measures in the last two years have been blocked in the Republican-led Senate, where many senators have objected to taking unclaimed soda deposit money from soda manufacturers, and where Senator Ronald B. Stafford, a Plattsburgh Republican, remains firmly opposed to the state's efforts to buy land.
Mr. Stafford, whose district is in the heart of the Adirondack park, has been given virtual control over matters affecting the park by the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, Republican of Oyster Bay. But there are signs that Mr. Marino, feeling pressure from pro-environment Republicans like Larry Rockefeller, wants to pass a trust fund bill this year.
There is a another new twist this year: several paper companies in northern New York, whose interests Mr. Stafford and other Senate Republicans have championed in the past, are facing bankruptcy. To raise money, they have proposed selling to the state conservation easements on thousands of acres -- rights that the state can buy only if the trust-fund bill is passed.
The companies have pleaded with Mr. Stafford and other Senate Republicans to pass legislation providing the money, but Mr. Stafford, at least, has been unmoved so far, proposing instead to give the companies tax breaks and other economic help.
 
Private Ownership Favored
 Mr. Stafford's main objection to the trust-fund bill, said his spokesman, Thomas Bergin, is that he believes the state should not own more open space. "We'd like to see as much land remain in the private sector as possible, because once you take it out of the private sector, it's gone," he said. "With the state owning 42 percent of the park already, we don't think it's essential for them to own more."
But the state's top environmental official, Commissioner Thomas C. Jorling of the Environmental Conservation Department, said unless the state buys thousands of acres that may soon come up for sale in the park, the land might be forever lost to the public. "For the first time in many generations the state has no resources for open space," he said. "We may be depriving future New Yorkers of using it."
The debate is mirrored here in Essex, which is too small to have a stoplight and where the boarded-up stores on the main street attest to bad times and high unemployment. The town has been divided for many years between longtime residents who yearn for more economic development and newer residents who have worked to get the town designated a historic district and who, after a bitter fight several years ago, used environmental arguments to defeat a plan to give Essex what would have been its only gas station.
"Naturally you need a better economy and you want to see some sort of industry," said Bill Hopper, the Heurichs' longtime caretaker, who was doing some chores around the property recently. "But you want to see something to offset it, too."
 
Battle Lines
 When people in town talk of the Heurich property, it is clear where the battle lines are drawn.
"It's the only space that's developable in the town of Essex, and we're not a very rich town," said Patricia Gardner, the town postmaster. "There's enough parks out here." Mrs. Gardner said she did not want to see development run rampant over the property, but at the same time did not want the state, which already owns a chunk of land in Essex, take over any more property.
But summer visitors and newer residents, who have moved to this sleepy corner of the state to get away from big-city life, said that the spectacular property -- which covers 2,100 acres, crosses rivers, mountains, bogs and woods and has an array of animals like beavers, deer and porcupines -- would be a perfect candidate for public acquisition.
"I think it would be good for our community," said Bob Hammerschlag, executive director of the Essex Community Heritage Organization.
Mr. Heurich, whose father began accumulating the property as a summer retreat 35 years ago, is clearly on the side of the preservationists. When the deal with the state fell through, Mr. Heurich began a slow and fruitless effort to find some other way to preserve it, writing to scores of environmental groups, to the Federal Government and even to environmentally conscious celebrities like Robert Redford.
But nothing panned out, and Mr. Heurich, in debt from pouring money into his new brewery business, said he needed cash badly. He has scheduled an auction for April 18, advertising the property as a "one-of-a-kind opportunity" and listing its development potential -- under current zoning, at least 117 parcels worth. He said that he and the state were like "two ships passing in the night," both wanting the same thing, but unable to meet.
"I thought I was in reach of my own personal dream for what should be used for this property in the best of all possible worlds," he said. "I can't believe that it's coming down to this."

HEADLINE: Transcript of Clinton's First News Conference at White House

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 23

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of the question-and-answer portion of President Clinton's first official news conference, held in the East Room of the White House today, as recorded by The New York Times:
Q. Mr. President, would you be willing to hold the summit meeting in Moscow if it would be best for President Yeltsin's political health? Have you spoken to President Yeltsin? And don't you think that if you did go through Moscow it would engage the U.S. too closely in the power struggle in the capital? 
 A. You got me on both sides of the issue before I even started. Well, let me say, first, I have not talked to President Yeltsin but I have sent him two letters -- one, in response to his statement and the other, of course, a letter of condolence on his mother's death. I am going to meet in the morning with the Foreign Minister Kozyrev to get a direct, first-hand appraisal of where we are, after which it might be appropriate for us to have a telephone conversation, but I thought I should have the Kozyrev meeting first.
As of this time, we have not received any indications that the Russians, specifically President Yeltsin and his Government, have any desire to change the site of the meeting or the time. So we are working very hard, indeed. I'm going to have a long session tonight to try to prepare for the summit at the appropriate date in Vancouver. I will spend -- I expect to spend -- a good deal of time this week consulting with the Congressional leaders of both parties and others who might have ideas about what we ought to put in our package, and I intend to go there with an aggressive and quite specific plan for American partnership and, so, that's where we are now.
Q. Would you go to Moscow if it was called for?
A. Well, let me say this, if -- if they were to express an interest in that, then it's obviously something that we would have to consider, but that has not been done yet and there were some conversations this morning between the Secretary of State and Mr. Kozyrev. That has not been done yet. If that were to happen, then we would cross that bridge when we come to it.
 
Yeltsin as Leader
 Q. Mr. President, what would the U.S. policy be if the Soviet Legislature votes to impeach Mr. Yeltsin, as appears increasingly likely? Would you continue to view Mr. Yeltsin as the duly elected leader of Russia?
A. Well, I view him as such now. He is the only person who has been elected. The others are proceeding under a constitution that goes back to the Communist era. What I would do under those circumstances, I don't want to speculate about.
This is another one of those -- first of all, let me say, we have to appreciate, I think, the unique character of the events going on in Russia. It is a Russian experience. I, myself, have been, I think, in a way, most interested by the television interviews of the people in the street in Russia, you know, just talking about it they sound almost like our people might sound talking about some fight we were having here.
They've been remarkably levelheaded about it and of different opinions, obviously. I think we just have to let this play out. I don't want to speculate about what the position of the United States would be in a hypothetical situation.
 
Nuclear Weapons
 Q. Mr. President, have you received any assurances about the command and control of Russian nuclear weapons in this crisis?
A. We are monitoring that very closely. And we will continue to monitor that very closely. At the present time, we have no reason to be concerned that the command and control procedures that are appropriate have been interrupted or face any imminent threat of interruption. We feel good about it at this time and we will continue to monitor it closely. Britt.
 
U.S. Role in Russia
 Q. Wonder what your view of the American possibilities are. How do you see the U.S. role? Can the U.S. play a decisive role, or are we really just ultimately bystanders?
A. I think somewhere in between. I think in the end the Russian people will have to resolve this for themselves, and I hope they'll be given the opportunity to do that in some appropriate fashion. But I'm not sure that, you know, we -- I have only the same access, in a way, that you do in terms of all the possible developments that are in the air. I do not believe that we can be decisive in the sense that we can determine the course of events in Russia or, frankly, in the other republics of the former Soviet Union with which we also have a deep interest.
But I do believe that we are not bystanders. For one thing, I don't think that this country can do what it needs to do, in any acceptable time frame, in moving to a successful economy, unless we move to act across a whole broad range of areas. And over the next few days I should have more to say about that as I work hard on this package. Wolf.
 
Pentagon Budget Cuts
 Q. Mr. President, the former Secretary of State, Dick Cheney, and the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sam Nunn, have both suggested that your proposed Pentagon budget cuts would perhaps be inappropriate at this time of uncertainty in Russia and elsewhere around the world. Are you taking another look at all of those cuts to perhaps revisit the whole issue?
A. I'm not taking another look at the cuts at this time. Let me remind you of, that basically I think we have still presented a responsible defense budget. But what I am doing is trying to make sure that we can fulfill the missions that we have to fulfill based on any projected developments within the confines of that budget as it's staged over the next five years. And we'll be able to constantly review that.
Obviously, these budgets are passed every year for five years in the future. And I expect, to whatever extent the world is uncertain, we'll have to be more vigilant in reviewing what our commitments are. Tom.
 
Aid to Russia
 Q. Mr. President, you've made clear that you support both Russian reform and Yeltsin as the embodiment of that reform movement. But if President Yeltsin is removed, either constitutionally or unconstitutionally, would it affect the package of aid -- both the size and the specific package -- that the United States would offer Russia without a President Yeltsin? Should the conservatives, the nationalists in the Parliament, be on notice that it could affect the kind of aid we contribute?
A. Well, let me say again, I don't want to get into hypothetical situations because I don't want anything I say or do to either undermine or rigidify the situation there. I mean this is something the Russians are going to have to develop. The United States has three interests in our cooperation with Russia:
One is to make the world a safer place; to continue to reduce the threat of nuclear war and the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
*Two is to support the development of democracy and freedom for the people of Russia. It is a vast and great country. And indeed, for all of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
*And three is to support the development of a market economy.
At every step along the way, with or without President Yeltsin in authority, from now, I suppose, till the end of time, or at least for the foreseeable future, the United States will have those interests. And we will be guided by those interests.
 
Gay Issue and Military
 Q. Mr. President, you seem to be having some difficulty with the Pentagon. When you went to the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt, the sailors there were mocking you before your arrival even though you are the Commander in Chief. The services have been undercutting your proposal for permitting gays to be in the military. There's been no Pentagon creation of the task force that was supposed to be created. The hearings are to start a week from now, and Congress has not gotten any advice from the Pentagon or from the services as to what to propose. Do you have a problem, perhaps because of your lack of military service or perhaps because of issues such as gays in the military, in being effective in your role as Commander in Chief? And what do you propose to do about it?
A. No. No, I don't have a problem being Commander in Chief. You knew they -- you knew that a lot of the service officers disagreed with the position on gays in the military before I ever took office. The Secretary of Defense has not been in the best of health. I think he is either fully recovered now or on the verge of it. And I asked him to give me a report on June the 15th.
Senator Nunn said back in January that he would have hearings sometime -- probably in March. So I think we're at the outer limits of the time that he was going to have hearings. And his schedule to have hearings, in my view, has nothing to do with the fact that I asked the Secretary of Defense to present to me on June the 15th a report which I expect to receive.
Q. Excuse me, could I follow, sir? The task force was supposed to be created by now. The Pentagon has not created the task force and there's been no report to the Hill, and in fact Senator Nunn has indicated that he thinks some of the compromises that might have been possible, such as not having gays go to sea or be in combat, are not constitutional. Does that give you pause?
A. Not constitutional?
Q. Would not pass constitutional muster.
A. Well, I don't want to get into a constitutional debate. But if you can discriminate against people in terms of whether they get into the service or not, based on not what they are but what they say they are, then I would think you could make appropriate distinctions on duty assignments once they're in. I -- the courts have historically given quite wide berth to the military to make judgments of that kind in terms of duty assignments.
 
Supreme Court Justice
 Q. Mr. President, on another topic, you've laid out some of the criteria you're going to use to choose the next Supreme Court Justice: a fine mind, experience in the law, experience dealing with people and a big heart. Does Gov. Mario Cuomo fit that criteria, and do you think that he would make a good Supreme Court Justice?
A. Well, I'm on record on that, but the last time I said it I -- he wound up in the midst of a lot of conversation that I don't think either he or I intended. I will stay with my criteria. I will make the appointment as soon as I reasonably can. Justice White, I think, tendered his letter at this time, before the end of this term of the Court, in order to give me a significant amount of time to make a judgment. This is a very busy time around here, as you know, because of all the foreign and domestic activities. But I intend to spend a lot of time on that. Yes.
 
F.B.I. Director
 Q. Mr. President, aides suggested there's been a preliminary decision to remove William Sessions, the F.B.I. Director, from office, that you're only waiting for a recommendation from Janet Reno. Would you deny that?
A. Yeah. That's not correct. I've not had a decision about that. I have -- I have asked Janet Reno to look at it. My review of the Director, and the issues surrounding his appointment, is largely confined to what has already been in the press.
And I want to wait until -- I wanted to wait until I had an Attorney General and until she could make a review. I have not made a decision and I am going to wait for her judgment on it. Yes, Susan.
 
Health Care Agenda
 Q. Mr. President, Americans are eagerly awaiting May 1st to find out what you have in mind for health care reform. Are you ready to stand here now and make a pledge that by the end of your first term, all Americans will have health insurance, and how much latitude do you think you have politically to raise taxes to be sure that that happens before the end of your first term? And I have a follow-up.
A. Well, I'm ready to tell you that I will present a plan which would provide the American people the opportunity to have the security of health care coverage by the end of my first term. Whether or not that plan will pass the Congress in the form I will propose it is still -- you know, that's a matter of conjecture, but I think we're got an excellent chance of passing it.
In terms of how it will be paid for, let me say that no decision has been made on that. All the surveys show lopsided majorities of the American people are willing to pay somewhat more, a little more, if they were guaranteed the security of health coverage when they change jobs, when someone in their family's been sick, when other things happen, when their company can no longer afford it under present circumstances.
But what I'm trying to do now is to reconcile -- the key financial conflict in the health care issue is this: We've got to give the American people the right to know they're going to be covered with health insurance, that they're not going to have their costs going up two or three times the rate of inflation, they're not going to lose the right to pick their doctor.
And we know that if we do it in any one of three or four ways, it will save literally hundreds of billions of dollars between now and the end of the decade -- of tax money and more importantly, of private money. Massive amounts of money will be saved, so the question is, how much do you have to raise now in order to save all that money later? Those are the judgments we'll be making in the next month -- we've still got about five weeks to make the decision.
Q. I wanted to ask you if long-term care would absolutely be included in that package of benefits that you're talking about everybody having by the end of the first term?.
A. To what extent it will be, hasn't been resolved because of the cost question, Sarah. Mark?
 
Homosexuals in Military
 Q. Are you prepared to support restrictions on -- to follow up on Andrea's question -- prepared to support restrictions on the deployment of homosexual members of the service? And if you are, do you think that fulfills the criteria that you laid out, that discrimination should be on the basis of conduct, not orientation?
A. That depends on what the report says; that's why I'm waiting for the Secretary of Defense to issue the report. But I wouldn't rule that out, depending on what the grounds and arguments were. Yes?
 
Health-Care Costs
 Q. Mr. President, your own advisers have said that your health care reform might cost from $30 billion to $90 billion more a year, cost the Government. Now that's in addition to the tax hikes you propose in your economic program. Are you saying you cannot tell the middle class and working people that you will not seek higher taxes for health care reform?
A. I'm saying that I have not made a judgment yet about how to recover what monies it would take to provide the security to all families that they would have some health insurance. That's right, I have not made that decision yet. We have -- I have sat through now probably 10, 12 hours maybe of intense staff briefings on the health care issue, and I would say we have 12 to 15 hours to go before I will be in a position to make some of these calls.
I can tell you this: I will not ask the American people to pay for a health care plan until the people who will be making money out of the changes that we propose are asked to give back some of the money they will make. Keep in mind, these changes will save massive amounts of money immediately to some of the health care providers. Yes?
 
Yeltsin and U.S. Interests
 Q. Thank you, sir. Mr. President, if I may return to Russia for a moment. As your spokespersons have told us over the past few days, there are other reformers there. Is there a danger in putting too much American weight behind Boris Yeltsin?
A. I don't think so. This is a -- I know that some people say, "What's the difference in this and the Gorbachev situation before, and is this the same sort of problem?" I tried to answer that question earlier about what the United States' interests are and how we would pursue them. And I tried to be supportive of reformers throughout Russia and, indeed, throughout all the former Communist countries and the former republics of the Soviet Union.
But he is, after all, the first elected President in a thousand years. He has the mandate of having been voted on in a free and open election where people were free to vote and free to stay home -- something that was not true previously. And that is something you would expect me to do.
Let's put it in a different context. Suppose -- well, we just had the Prime Minister of Great Britain here, right? And the United States and Great Britain have had historic ties and shared values; you expect me to work with the Prime Minister of Great Britain even if he is of a party that was openly supportive of my opponent in the last election. I mean, you know, this is not a -- Boris Yeltsin is an elected President of Russia, and he has shown a great deal of courage in sticking up for democracy and civil liberties and market reforms. And I'm going to support that. Yes, in the back.
 
Hurdles in Senate
 Q. Mr. President, you congratulated the House of Representatives for speedy action on your economic plan last week but you face some tougher hurdles in the Senate, in part because some members of your own party, like Senator Breaux, are not on board with you. Why haven't you been able to get some of these Democratic Senators on board, and are you prepared to make some compromises in breaking gridlock there?
A. Well, let me just answer this way. There are two big problems that we confronted when we got here in terms of how the people's money was being spent. One problem was the deficit had exploded, it had gone from $1 trillion, the debt had, to $4 trillion in 12 years. The other problem was we'd managed to explode our national debt while reducing our investment in the future.
Now there are a bloc of people in the Senate, including some Democrats, who believe that the only thing that matters is to reduce the deficit. Now, believe me, that's a big improvement over the past, but I just disagree with them. I don't think that's the only thing that matters; I believe that investing in the future matters, too. And I believe that if we don't change the spending patterns of the Government, and invest and put some of the American people back to work and create some -- millions -- of jobs, that we're not going to have an economic recovery.
So we just have a difference of opinion. Now, Senator Breaux is much closer to me than many others are in the sense that he basically wants to phase in this spending. But the problem with phasing it in is if you delay the investment, you also delay the impact of the investment, which means you put off the effective date of the jobs being created.
That's my only argument with him. He, to be fair to him, has said this is an acceptable stimulus package and an acceptable level of investment. But I think we should, in effect, slow down the rate of spending until we have the whole package passed.
My position is, if the United States Senate will adopt a budget resolution like the House did, the American people will know we are not going to raise their taxes till we cut spending, and we are going to create jobs. And this is a plan where 70 percent of it's paid by people with incomes of over $100,000; $500 billion of deficit reduction but millions of jobs over the next four years, including a half a million in this program. So that's my argument, and I hope I'll be able to persuade enough to get the votes.
 
Nuclear Arms Strategy
 Q. Mr. President, could you explain please the situation on nuclear weapons ----
A. This is self-selection here, it's impressive! Go ahead.
Q. Mr. President, given the fact that both the Start I and the Start II treaties are hostage to the political outcome in Moscow, given also the potential for conflict -- armed conflict -- between Russia and Ukraine, are you prepared to draft contingency plans, at least, that would either restore funding or add funding to the Strategic Defense Initiative -- if not the space-based part, at least the ground-based element -- as a hedge against the worst possible outcome?
A. Well, we're not in the position to make a judgment about the worst possible outcome now. I mean, keep in mind -- and let me say I've talked to President Kravchuk twice about the Ukraine's position on Start I, and I'm very concerned about the very issues you raised.
But let me say that even as we speak, I'm not ready to say that there's a strong likelihood that we can't proceed with both Start I and Start II, and that we can't resolve the conflicts between Russia and Ukraine. If that becomes apparent, that we can't, then we will obviously assess our position and all of our options.
 
Free Trade Agreement
 Q. Mr. President, on April 2 the free trade agreement negotiators are going to meet again to talk about the additional agreement. Now there has been a lot of talk that your Administration plans to be very tough. How do you characterize "being tough"? Do you agree with that statement, and is there any room for compromise? Just how are you seeing those negotiations?
A. Well, I wouldn't call it being tough. I would say that I intend to try to get a trade agreement that will be in the best interests of both the United States and Mexico. And keep in mind that this is not simply a trade agreement, this is also an investment agreement. And the issue is whether when we make it much more attractive for the United States to invest in Mexico, and much more secure, shouldn't we also in the interests of both the economies of Mexico and the United States, see that basic environmental standards and labor standards are observed, and shouldn't we have some protections greater than those embodied in the present agreement in the event that there are severe economic dislocations because of unintended consequences?
I believe that we should, and I believe that that's in Mexico's interest. And I would just point you to a much smaller example. We have examples in our aid program where the United States spent taxpayers' money to encourage American companies to invest in Central America, who then went down there and actually lowered wages instead of raising them in the host country. So what I'm trying to do is promote market reforms and the benefits of them to both countries.
The second thing let me say, I have enormous admiration for President Salinas and for what he's done. I want to support that. And I want to remind all of you that insofar as the trade portion of the Nafta agreement goes, just look at -- the unilateral reductions by the Salinas Government in trade barriers took the United States over the past five years from a $6 billion trade deficit to a $5 billion plus trade surplus with Mexico, so I have no quarrel with the trade provisions.
But the investment provisions need to be used in ways that will raise wages on both sides of the border instead of lower wages on both sides of the border and pollute the environment. That's what I want to avoid. Yes?
 
Relations With Cuba
 Q. Among the people you have charmed -- it seems you have charmed President Fidel Castro because in a recent interview with a TV station -- a TV network, he wanted to meet with you. Would you be willing to meet with him? And a Democratic Administration might change the approach toward Cuba, versus a Republican?
A. I have no change in Cuba policy except to say that I supported the Cuban Democracy Act and I hope someday that we'll all be able to travel to a democratic Cuba. Deborah?
Q. Would you meet with President Castro?
A. As a democratic Cuba. Elections. Go ahead.
 
Mississippi Jails
 Q. On a totally different subject, although it is south of here, I wondered about -- in Mississippi, where, as you know, civil rights and human rights groups are asking for your help in investigating the 40-plus hangings -- suicides, supposedly -- in Mississippi jails. Some of the civil rights groups say that they are asking you, in fact, to order a Justice Department investigation. Have you heard from them directly? And are you amenable to that request?
A. Well, I'm very much concerned about the deaths in the jails. I have not had a -- if they have communicated with me directly, my staff has not yet discussed it with me, although they may have done so. What I would always do in a situation like that is to first discuss it with the Attorney General after an assessment of the facts, and to see whether it is appropriate. But, obviously, if -- if we were asked to look into it, I would certainly at least discuss it with the Attorney General.
 
Trade With Japan
 Q. Mr. President, on another trade issue, during your campaign last year in Michigan and other states you criticized a Bush Administration decision which allowed foreign-made minivans, MPV's, to come into the country at low tariff rates. This led the auto industry and auto workers to believe that you would take action early in your Administration to do something about this. Have you changed your mind on that subject, or do you still intend to take action?
A. No, I haven't changed my mind on that subject. I have -- that issue is now under review, along with a number of others relating to our trade relations with Japan.
Let me just say this, the -- I have -- I had hoped, and still hope, to engage the Japanese Government in an on-going dialogue across a whole, broad range of these issues. If you look at the history of American trade relationships that -- the one that never seems to change very much is the one with Japan. That is, we're sometimes in a position of trade deficit, but we're often in a position of trade surplus with the European Community. We were once -- we once had huge trade deficits with Taiwan and South Korea, but they've changed now quite a bit; they move up and down.
But the persistence of the surplus the Japanese enjoy with the United States and with the rest of the developed world can only lead one to the conclusion that the possibility of obtaining real, even access to the Japanese market is somewhat remote. And I was, and I will say again, I was astonished that the Bush Administration overruled its own Customs Office and gave a $300 million-a-year freebie to the Japanese for no apparent reason. And we got nothing, and I emphasis nothing in return.
So, no, I haven't changed my position about that. I did hope, you know, to put it in the context of a larger set of trade issues to be raised first, with the Japanese Government before acting unilaterally. But my own opinion about that has not changed. Go ahead.
 
Supreme Court Nominee
 Q. Mr. President, you've been ----
A. I've got to go back to the right; I'm left-handed, you know, and I sometimes discriminate. Go ahead.
Q. Mr. President, during the campaign you gave some pretty strong indications that your Supreme Court nominee -- you would certainly consider their position on abortion. Is that still the case?
A. Thank you for asking, because I want to emphasis what I said before. I will not ask any potential Supreme Court nominee how he or she would vote in any particular case. I will not do that.
But I will endeavor to appoint someone who has certain deep convictions about the Constitution. I would not, for example, knowingly appoint someone that did not have a very strong view about the First Amendment's freedom-of-religion, freedom-of-association and freedom-of-speech provisions. And I strongly believe in the constitutional right to privacy. I believe it is one of those rights embedded in our Constitution, which should be protected. Yes.
Q. On the issue of the Supreme Court, is your commitment to a government that looks like America -- does that also extend to the Supreme Court to the extent you can influence that through your appointments? Will you be taking age into consideration? And, given what you just said about the right to privacy, do you think it's appropriate and will you, or members of your Administration, be asking potential nominees if they support the right to privacy and whether they think that right includes the right to abortion?
A. I'm going to -- I'll answer you the question, I will not ask anybody how they will vote in a specific case. I will endeavor to appoint someone who has an attachment to, a belief in, a strong and broad constitutional right to privacy.
And on the age issue, I will not discriminate against people who are older than I am.
Q. Mr. President ----
A. Yeah, I won't discriminate against people who are of a different gender, of a different racial or ethnic group.
Q. How about a government and a Court that looks like America, sir, on diversity?
A. Well, I'm not going to -- you know, I don't know how many appointments I'll get to the Supreme Court. I don't know what will happen there. I'm going to appoint someone I think will be a great Justice. Go ahead.
 
Campaign Finance
 Q. Mr. President, on campaign finance reform, could you tell us how you plan to end the soft-money contributions to state and national parties?
A. Well first, let me say that I plan -- I intend to come forward with a proposal that will end the use of soft money in Presidential campaigns, in the next few days. We're working on it now. We're working on trying to hammer it out with the -- with the -- with the friends of campaign finance reform in both houses of the Congress.
I will attempt to do it in a -- with a little in a different way that will at least enable the parties to raise sufficient funds to involve grass-roots people and empower people to participate in the political process, but I -- I think that we should do away with this soft-money issue and make a lot of other changes as well, and we're working on it.
We should have a bill out -- that has the support of the Administration -- quite soon. We've been working very hard now for the last couple of weeks on it. Sir?
 
Forest Conference
 Q. Mr. President, you've been -- you're going to the forest conference ----
A. Go ahead.
Q. You're going to the forest conference in a couple of weeks looking for a solution to an issue that has dragged on for a long time, partly because both sides are unwilling to compromise or share the pain, and some say the previous Administration's unwillingness to obey the law of the land. How do you find -- propose to find a solution where so many have failed or have been unwilling to find a solution?
A. Well, I -- let me say, I would like to begin by having the United States have one position. Let me -- let me come back to the larger issue. The forest summit involves, as you know, what will happen to the old-growth forest and to adjacent forest in the Pacific Northwest, which are the habitat of the spotted owl, but which also are now a -- a very small part of what once was a massive old-growth forest up there.
Thousands of jobs are at stake, but the very ecostructure of the Pacific Northwest is also at stake. The parties on both sides have been paralyzed in court battles and all timber sales have been frozen, including many timber sales that virtually all environmentalists think should go forward because of the impasse.
One of the problems has been that the United States itself has taken different positions on -- across the agencies. So the first thing I hope to do is to be able to at least adopt a uniform legal position for the United States.
The second thing I want to do is go out there, along with the Vice President, and just -- and listen, hammer out the alternatives and then take a position that I think will break the logjam. The position -- it may be like my economic program, it'll probably make everybody mad. But I will try to be fair to the people whose livelihoods depend on this and fair to the environment that we are all obligated to maintain.
And let me say, I live in a state with -- that's 53 percent timberland. I have dealt with a lot of these timber issues for many years. The issue is, in this case, what is the right balance given some facts that are inevitable about what's going to happen. And I think we can hammer out a solution and, as I said, a lot of people -- everybody may be somewhat disappointed, but the paralysis now gripping the lives of the people out there is totally unacceptable. One last ----
 
Job-Stimulus Projects
 Q. Mr. President, sir, did you screen those projects in the economy-stimulus package before you sent them to the Hill? The Republicans are saying there are so many things in there that are totally unnecessary. I can't believe that you sent those up there, and maybe somebody did it for you? There -- there're golf courses in there and swimming pools and copying statues ----
A. No ----
Q. ---- and even a project on studying the religion in Sicily.
A. No. Let me say -- let me say, you will read those bills for years in vain and not find those projects. The -- well, let me say, I have a letter here dated on March the 22d to Senator Byrd from Leon Panetta about those alleged projects, and what Mr. Panetta points out is to say that none of the specific projects referenced are actually in the legislation proposed by me. But what they have done is to go to these departments and say, "If you had this more money -- much more money -- give me every absurd thing you could possibly spend the money on." I am not going to let those things be done.
The other thing they have done is to go to some isolated parts of the country and pick atypical examples that the Community Development Block Grant funds. I would remind you that it was the Republicans who always supported the Community Development Block Grant proposal, on the theory that we ought to rely more on the states and local governments to make judgments about how best to create jobs.
So, I will do everything I can to keep undue waste and abuse from coming into this process. I do not support it.
We've got to quit. Thank you.
Q. "W Let's do it again some time, all right? A. Thank you. I hope soon.

HEADLINE: Soft-Drink Industry Is Fighting Back Over New Taxes

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ohio

 BODY:
Not even their biggest boosters pretend that a Pepsi, a Dr Pepper or a Cherry Coke delivers the nutritional kick of, say, broccoli juice. But soft drinks do contain phosphorous, sodium, a little calcium and other vital minerals, and 80 percent of them still have sugar, a carbohydrate a healthy body needs, in moderation.
But in Ohio, whether a soft drink is a genuine life-giving, tissue-and-cell-building food is a matter of caustic debate. The state has a deficit-clogged budget, and the government has put a special tax on soft drinks to help balance it. 
 The state recently began collecting a 1-cent excise tax per soft-drink can, on top of a 5 percent sales tax, and an equivalent amount on other containers, syrup and the canisters that fast-food outlets keep behind their counters. Gov. George V. Voinovich and the Legislature enacted the tax in December, reasoning in part that soda pop is not food, which the State Constitution exempts from taxation.
Soft drinks have become a target in other states, most of whose constitutions, unlike the Federal Government's, mandate balanced budgets. The taxes on tobacco and alcohol, known as sin taxes, are not sufficient. And carbonated beverages are easier prey politically than meat, potatoes or infant formula.
 
Drawing the Line
 But the soft-drink industry is drawing the line in Ohio, the latest and most populous state to turn to the tax.
"We face taxes every year," Jim Finkelstein, senior vice president of the National Soft Drink Association in Washington, said. "But this year we seem to have a concentration of them."
Arkansas and Chicago started imposing similar excise taxes a week before Ohio. The Alabama and Montana Legislatures are considering their own versions. Florida is weighing two bills, one that would impose a 2 1/2-cent charge per 12-ounce container right away, the other starting at half a cent growing to 2 1/2 cents over four years. Puerto Rico enacted the highest excise tax, 5 cents per can, two years ago. Washington State has been collecting a 1-cent tax for nearly four years.
Some other states are backing off in the face of opposition. Soda-pop tax proposals this year in Connecticut, New Mexico and Oklahoma appear to have been derailed, and last year, Mississippi repealed a tax it had adopted eight years ago. But at least four states -- Louisiana, South Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia -- have taxed soft drinks for decades.
 
48 Gallons a Person
 States are discovering that taxes on carbonated beverages are a quick and easy source of tens of millions of dollars. People drink a lot of them -- 48 gallons per person a year, Mr. Finkelstein said. Tax departments have to deal with relatively few soft-drink businesses (400 in Ohio, for example), so they do not have to add more than a collector or two to their budget-strapped bureaucracies.
So far, the soft-drink taxes seem not to stir up much hostility. As excise taxes (generally, levies imposed on specific products and charged to the maker or distributor), they are usually buried in the price a consumer pays, unlike a sales tax, which shows up on the receipt from the cash register.
To date, they have escaped the rage that followed attempts to tax other items. In a referendum last November, California voters killed a sales tax on snack foods that the Legislature had imposed the year before. And Florida's sales tax on a broad range of services lasted only six months in 1987.
"You go to where the social resistance is least," said Leo Navin, an economist at Bowling Green State University, south of Toledo.
 
Where the Money Goes
 Where opposition might arise, most states try to mute it by earmarking the revenues for popular programs, freeing income tax and sales tax revenues for other purposes. Washington State's soft-drink tax helps pay for drug education and rehabilitation, and West Virginia's supports a state medical school. Florida's proposed taxes would finance the purchase of parks and environmentally endangered land.
States that have had the soft-drink tax the longest say it has become so entrenched that repeal is unlikely. "We have not had any questions at all about it," said Ralph Slaughter, Secretary of the Department of Revenue and Taxation in Louisiana.
The industry says Puerto Rico's hefty tax has slowed consumption of soft drinks, but smaller taxes seem to have little effect. Even as West Virginia's population declined in the 1980's, soft-drink tax revenues rose 30 percent, to almost $10 million a year, Tax Commissioner James Paige 3d said.
 
An Industry Fights Back
 Even so, the industry has begun to fight back. In Arkansas, Mr. Finkelstein said, bottlers have collected more than enough signatures to call for a referendum on the tax. Bill Goodman, assistant director of the state's Bureau of Legislative Research, said that a Coca-Cola bottler that had been planning to add a plant in Arkansas is threatening to put it in Missouri, and that Pepsi-Cola had sent letters to Arkansas charities saying it would not be able to contribute because of the tax.
But it is in Ohio that the industry is trying hardest to curb "the ever-encroaching greed of the states," as Maryann B. Gall, a lawyer for the Ohio Soft Drink Association, put it. The bottlers fear that if the excise tax survives in Ohio, states like New York and California will be next.
"We're going to make sure the public has all the facts," said Claude Clements, vice president and general manager of a Cincinnati bottling company that produces more than 70 million cases of Coca-Cola a year. "If necessary, we'll take it to the ballot."
The companies have gone to court, with some success. Judge John A. Connor of Common Pleas Court in Columbus temporarily enjoined the state from collecting the tax. But the Ohio Supreme Court recently let the collection proceed while the debate over the tax's constitutionality continues.
The state seems to have a difficult case. The State Constitution, unlike those of most other states, protects most food from taxation. Food consumed in restaurants can be taxed, but not food bought in a grocery store.
In the depths of the Great Depression, the state introduced a sales tax that exempted food but not carbonated beverages. They became subject to the sales tax as something other than food.
Ms. Gall says the industry agreed to accept that distinction in the 1930's as part of a compromise to prevent imposition of a separate tax on soft drinks. But the industry has not been able to produced documentation to verify the intent of that old agreement, leaving the state free to argue that a precedent for taxing soft drinks is well established and that they are not food.
But Wayne Johnson, chairman of the department of nutrition and food management at Ohio State University, cited a typical textbook definition of food as "any nutritive material taken into the body for the maintenance of life and the growth and repair of tissues."
Soft drinks do contain nutritive material, Professor Johnson said. Maybe some people drink too many soft drinks, he said, "but it would be hard to argue that they're not a food."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury and Municipal Prices Gain

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury bonds and notes rose yesterday in light but choppy trading, pushing yields back down toward the lows reached at the beginning of the month.
But it is not yet clear whether the bond market will continue its remarkable 1993 rally any time soon, pushing yields through those historic lows. For the last two weeks, the market has been stuck in a narrow trading range. 
 Prices in the tax-exempt municipal market also rallied today, but the municipal market faced the same doubts as the Treasury market about lower interest rates.
In a clear sign that no matter what direction rates move they are still attractively low in the near term, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company announced yesterday that it was redeeming $1.75 billion in existing higher interest rate bonds. The cost of calling the bonds will cut A.T.& T.'s earnings by about 4 cents a share for the first quarter this year. But A.T.& T. said that the lower interest costs in the future should increase earning by about 3 cents a share annually, beginning in 1994.
 
 
Long Bond Nears Low on Yield
 In late trading, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond was up 13/32 , to 104 19/32 , to yield 6.76 percent, down from 6.80 percent Monday. This is just 4 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, off the 6.72 percent yield reached March 8, the lowest level since the Treasury began regularly auctioning 30-year bonds in 1977.
"I look for us to retest the lows again," Terrence Crowe, a vice president at Nikko Securities, said of the yields. "And retesting may take them to new lows."
The price of the 10-year bond was also higher, rising 7/32 as the yield dropped to 5.90 percent, down from 5.93 percent. The yield on the 10-year note fell to 5.82 percent on March 4, its lowest level since the early 1970's.
"I think we are still locked in a trading range," said Mary Rooney, an economist at S. G. Warburg & Company. But she added that the auction of two-year Treasury notes today and five-year notes tomorrow could give some indication of how much lower investors and traders are ready to push interest rates. In the when-issued, or pre-auction, market yesterday, the yield on the two-year note was 3.90 percent, the same as Monday, while the yield on the five-year note was 5.13 percent, down from 5.17 percent.
 
 
Looking to Treasury
 Ms. Rooney said the market was being supported in part by expectations that Treasury borrowing would drop sharply in the second quarter. But she said that any such reduction in Treasury borrowings would be temporary and that borrowing needs would jump again in the third quarter.
In trading yesterday it was hard to tell where the market inclination was because the trading was light and it was moved by an odd combination of factors, including a key inflation index that has been ignored recently and a possible misreading of an economic report.
In addition, the buying of intermediate-term Treasury notes by local governments that are refinancing older, higher-interest rate bonds helped push prices higher. But this demand is not based on views on inflation or economic growth but on the need to set up escrow funds to pay off the old bonds with the money borrowed at lower interest rates.
"There is nothing in the market today that is telling us that we are heading to a 6.5 percent yield on the long bond," Alan Levenson, the money market economist at UBS Securities, said.
Traders said President Clinton's news conference did not have an impact on prices. Earlier in the day, Robert E. Rubin, chairman of the National Economic council, said that the yield on the 30-year bond could stay under 7 percent for the rest of the year. He also said that the Treasury could still reduce the size of the 30-year bond auction, an expectation that has already helped support the price.
 
 
An Odd Twist
 Traders said that, in an odd twist, the market seemed to rally in the afternoon as the Commodity Research Bureau index declined sharply. The index is usually a closely watched barometer of inflation. But it was mostly ignored in the market as it it jumped from under to near 214 recently. But that did not prevent some traders from taking the decline yesterday as positive news and a reason to buy.
Also in the afternoon, a Johnson Redbook Service report showed that department and chain store sales had declined 1.8 percent in the first three weeks of March, compared with the month of February. There appeared to be some buying on the news. But the decline was a somewhat less than expected and far less then the fall of 3.6 percent for the first two weeks of the months, which was greatly affected by the blizzard that hit the East Coast.
 
Municipal Bonds
 Municipal bond prices were up about1/8 to 1/4 of a point yesterday, but the gains were not broad based. There were an estimated $2 billion in new issues yesterday, according to Bloomberg Business News.
The largest issue of the day was the $740 million in Puerto Rico Telephone Authority bonds. The demand was strong enough that some of the bonds were repriced to lower yields in the afternoon.
Randy Smolik of Municipal Market Data in Boston said that in the last two weeks the yields on tax-exempt bonds had risen enough to wipe out about a third of the gain from the rally that started in January. He said that the market might now be set to push yields down another 10 or 15 basis points. But he does not think that the 1993 lows will be tested until much later in the year.

HEADLINE: Bank Money Market and C.D. Yields Fall

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields offered by banks on money market accounts and certificates of deposit for the week beginning today are down from the previous week, with the New York market leading the decline.
According to The Bank Rate Monitor, an interest rate publication in North Palm Beach, Fla., the average New York money market yield, three-month and six-month certificates of deposit were all down two basis points, to 2.56 percent, 2.67 percent and 2.88 percent, respectively. 
 At the Treasury's weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills, which usually points to trends in deposit rates, bills were sold with lower discount rates than the previous week and the lowest in about a month. The rate for a three-month bill fell 6 basis points, to 2.94 percent, while the rate for a six-month bill fell 7 basis points, to 3.05 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
In the the rate publication's latest survey, the average money market account at a commercial bank was down 3 basis points, to 2.39 percent, with a three-month certificate down 4 basis points, to 2.54 percent. The yield for a six-month certificate fell as much as the average money market account, down 3 basis points, to 2.69 percent.
For the third consecutive week Chase Manhattan Bank was named among the New York banks posting the sharpest changes in deposit rates this week. The bank lowered the yields on both its three-month and six-month certificates of deposit, with a three-month C.D. down 25 basis points, to 2.38 percent, and a six-month C.D. down 26 basis points, to 2.43 percent.
The Key Bank lowered the yield on its money market accounts by 30 basis points, to 2.13 percent.
Outside the New York market, yields at 20 large banks were a little down to unchanged, compared with the New York market, as an average money market account slipped 1 basis point, to 2.55 percent, and a six-month C.D. remained at 2.89 percent.


GRAPHIC: Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday, March 24, 1993. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yields are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimum vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Budget Termed Low

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 23

 BODY:
The nation's chief stock market regulator told Congress today that he would have to lay off officials who track Wall Street wrongdoers if he wished to hire more mutual fund inspectors.
The Securities and Exchange chairman, Richard C. Breeden, said in testimony before a House panel that budget constraints meant he would be "robbing Peter to pay Paul" to deal with the rapid growth of mutual funds. 
 Mr. Breeden testified before the House appropriations subcommittee that oversees the S.E.C. on the $225.4 million budget the White House is proposing for the commission in the 1994 fiscal year. That is an increase of $2.1 million from the $253.2 million the S.E.C. got from the Bush Administration for 1993.
But Mr. Breeden said the budget proposal actually amounted to a cut of about $7 million when inflation and other factors were figured in.

HEADLINE: The Circus Is Just One of His Acts

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Consider, for a moment, the kaleidoscopic and far-flung interests of Kenneth Feld, owner of the world's largest live entertainment company.
A replica of the space shuttle that Mr. Feld owns and leases to the Kennedy Space Center is visited by 5,000 to 7,000 people a day and is now on its way to South Korea for an exposition. Ice skaters employed in his five Walt Disney World on Ice shows are twirling in arenas from Milwaukee to East Asia. 
 The illusionists Siegfried & Roy are in the third year of a record-breaking run at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas, Nev. The finishing touches are being put on a "George Lucas's Super Live Adventure," a multimedia spectacle that Mr. Feld is taking to Lucas-mad Japan in late April. And on Broadway, David Shiner and Bill Irwin are packing them in to "Fool Moon," a critically acclaimed comedy that Mr. Feld is co-producing.
And tomorrow, the cornerstone of Mr. Feld's business, the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, 123 years old and three rings full of brand-name recognition that rivals Kleenex and Coke, opens a five-week run at Madison Square Garden.
"We are the Wal-Mart of the entertainment business," Mr. Feld said in an interview in the small office his company keeps on West 45th Street in Manhattan. "We give a great product at the best price there is."
Mr. Feld has cause to sound satisfied.
At a time when much of show business is in retreat, victimized by recession, high ticket prices, television and videocassette recorders, Irvin Feld and Kenneth Feld Productions, the corporate umbrella under which the circus and all of Mr. Feld's other shows operate, had its best year ever in the 12 months ended Jan. 31, Mr. Feld said. And he says the prospects for 1993 seem bright.
"The trends for the first six months are incredible," Mr. Feld said. "I don't ever remember seeing anything like the increases we are seeing in terms of advanced ticket sales."
Price is one reason his shows remain so popular, Mr. Feld believes. In most of the 90 cities the circus plays each year, the top ticket costs $15. (Madison Square Garden is an exception; ringside seats cost $27.50).
"It's a business that is very price sensitive," Mr. Feld said. "If you raise prices by $1 a ticket you can see a reaction."
A privately held company, Feld Productions will not talk specifically about how much money it takes in, let alone how much it makes. Indeed, for the last six years Mr. Feld has told any reporter who asked that annual revenues were around $250 million.
"I used that number once, and then I decided not to give any more numbers out," he said. But other people who follow the company's operations say revenues are probably double that amount.
A slight, unassuming, engaging man, Mr. Feld, who is 44, has been running the company that owns the circus since 1984, when his father, Irvin, died.
Widely hailed as the "man who saved the circus," Irvin Feld, his brother Israel and Judge Roy Hofheinz, who built the Houston Astrodome, bought the ailing Ringling Brothers-Barnum & Bailey Combined Shows Inc. from John Ringling North in 1967 for $8 million.
 
Moved Circus Indoors
 None of the new owners had any circus experience. Irvin Feld, who had been promoting rock-and-roll concerts, made two decisions that were critical to the circus's future: to attract bigger crowds, Mr. Feld got rid of the big top and moved the circus indoors. And to keep his product fresh, and spread out production costs, he created a second unit in 1969.
One new show would be created each year, and each unit, the red and the blue, would be on the road for two years. Between them, the two circuses will do 550 shows in 90 cities across the country this year.
Those were not Irvin Feld's only innovations; he also created Ringling's Clown College in 1968, which Kenneth Feld likes to call "research and development spending."
"With an acrobat or an aerialist who perform a specific act, even if it's great or memorable, I still have a problem with them in the third year, because by then everybody has seen the act," he said. "But if I get a good clown I would like to keep him or her forever."
Now, Mr. Feld is thinking of creating a broader circus college to nurture talent, now that the collapse of Communism and the breakup of the Soviet Union have threatened the many state-supported circuses throughout Eastern Europe that have been a source of many Ringling acts.
 
Florida Elephant Farm
 An eye on the future also led Mr. Feld to set up a 20-acre elephant farm in Florida more than seven years ago. At age 123, the circus can fairly be called a mature enterprise. So to spur growth, Mr. Feld has chosen to stretch his entrepreneurial legs into areas of entertainment his father might not have considered. And he appears to have bolstered the company's huge concession operations, which add mightily to Ringling's bottom line.
"His father was far more conservative in nature," said Tim Holst, Ringling's vice president of talent and production. "Kenneth is pragmatic, but he will take far more risks. The ice shows were a tremendous risk, to take that many on the road and keep them out there. Kenneth handled all of that."
Some circus purists say such moves may make good business sense, but they fear that in the bargain the quality of the circus has suffered.
"Kenneth's father had a love affair with the circus that was beyond business," said John Culhane, author of "The American Circus." "He would pocket a loss if he brought something that was really great to the circus. You can count on getting your money's worth at a Kenneth Feld show, but I wonder if that sort of commitment is still there."
 
Bringing 'Movies to Life'
 The George Lucas project, which Mr. Feld has been working on for the last two and a half years, illustrates the kind of calculated risk he is willing to take.
Developing what he called "the biggest traveling arena show that has ever been done, one that brings the movies to life," will cost the company around $20 million. By choosing to open in Japan, where Mr. Lucas's films remain wildly popular more than five years after their release, Mr. Feld limited his exposure.
"It is 100 percent financed by the Japanese, and by sending it over there I have a six-month window over there to refine it, a period where in essence I can do no wrong," he said.
Based on the advance sale, Mr. Feld said he expected that the show, which will carry a top ticket price of $60, would be seen by at least one million people during its 22-week run.
In the United States, the show might tour, or it might be permanently based "someplace where there is a heavy, heavy tourist industry," Mr. Feld said.
And that is just one aspect of the company's overseas operations. The ice shows now perform in 22 countries, and Mr. Feld took the circus to Japan in 1989-90.
A change of rail gauges in Mexico will allow the circus to take a unit into Mexico next year, and Mr. Feld is planning to take a new, smaller unit to play in South America.
 
Made in Far East
 The company maintains extensive relationships with suppliers throughout the Far East from China to Taiwan. These factories manufacture everything from toys to plastic lights sold at the circus and the Disney ice shows.
"We sell four to five million lights a year," Mr. Feld said, at prices ranging from $8 to $10. The ubiquitous snow cone of chopped ice and syrup, Ringling's biggest seller, has been repackaged in a plastic mug with 3-D characters on the outside. It sells for $4.50, compared with 75 cents previously.
Indeed, the range of items offered at Ringling concession stands has grown so long that Mr. Feld has established a consumer hot line to field complaints. The concession business operates under the name of Sells-Floto.
Despite huge operating and production costs -- 350 people are on the road with each circus 48 weeks of the year, and developing a new show costs $9 million to $10 million annually -- Mr. Feld says the entertainment operations are profitable. But it seems certain that Sells-Floto, which operates separately from the entertainment arm, is the business that generates the bulk of the company's earnings.
"Concessions are a huge business in any entertainment industry," said Greg Parkinson, executive director of the Circus World Museum in Baraboo, Wis. "Ringling has developed it into an art form."
Bucking a longstanding tradition, Ringling last year stopped selling its wares at seats during a performance and shifted to stalls in arena lobbies. And Mr. Feld got his vendors to spruce up their personal appearance and to wear neckties.
Mr. Feld conducts seminars for his sales staff, pays them bonuses if sales are up from the previous years and says he is pleased with the results.
Still very much a hands-on operator who approves virtually everything that goes into his shows, Mr. Feld no longer travels as much as he once did, personally recruiting all the acts and performers he employs. And with an eye to the future, he has been transforming performers in his various shows into line executives.
Mr. Holst, for example, is a Clown College graduate who toured with the circus for 13 years before moving to Ringling's corporate headquarters in Tysons Corner, Va.
"The business has changed dramatically since my father died eight and a half years ago," Mr. Feld said. "It has grown by leaps and bounds, and you don't do that by yourself. I've got what I think are the best people in the business, and they are unique in that they have worked their way up through the business, and who know about the culture, the life style."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Retreats Broadly After Bundesbank's Move

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The German Bundesbank injected anxiety into the foreign exchange market yesterday with an interest-rate announcement that sent the dollar skidding against the German mark and most other major European currencies.
Meanwhile, the Japanese yen, after spurting overseas to another record postwar high against the dollar, lost some of its gains in New York. Traders grew less nervous that major industrialized nations favor a higher yen as a way to trim Japan's trade deficit. 
 Gold prices retreated after moving higher Monday. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery closed at $331.90 a troy ounce, down $1. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid of $331.60 a troy ounce, off $1.10 from late Monday.
During European currency trading, Germany's central bank announced an agreement to repurchase money market securities as a way to supply banks short of cash with fresh funds.
Currency traders feared the resulting demand for short-term securities would drive German rates higher, further hurting demand for dollars after last week's disappointing rate cut by the Bundesbank.
"We're all on the edge of our chairs trying to figure out what will be going on tommorow," said Robert Ryan, senior trader at the Bank of New York.
In European trading, the dollar fell to 1.6312 German marks from late Monday's 1.6375. In New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.6303 marks at 4 P.M., down from late Monday's 1.6380.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at another record low of 115.33 yen, down 0.69 yen from Monday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 115.70 yen. But the dollar rose in New York to 115.95 yen from late Monday's 115.63 yen.
The dollar rose against the British pound. In London, the pound fell to $1.4840, from $1.4880 late Monday. Later in New York, the pound fetched $1.4840, less than late Monday's $1.4870.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday, were: 1.5105 Swiss francs, down from 1.5140; 5.5475 French francs, down from 5.5705; 1,579.00 Italian lire, down from 1,581.00, and 1.2473 Canadian dollars, unchanged from late Monday.

HEADLINE: The Right Stuff for Russia

BYLINE: By Bill Bradley; Bill Bradley, Democrat, is senior Senator from New Jersey.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The need to clarify U.S. policy toward Russia has been heightened by the political crisis in Moscow. Our long-term interests there can be promoted by practical aid and people-to-people programs.
Boris Yeltsin's solution to the impasse between a popularly elected President and a Parliament that, under the Constitution, is the supreme organ of the state shows he believes the answer to the problems of emerging democracy is more democracy. He has cast his fate on the seas of his own waning but still significant popularity. 
 In an atmosphere in which individuals regularly switch opinions and sides, the U.S. should not try to intervene in Russia's day-to-day politic concerns such as: Should the Parliament impeach Mr. Yeltsin in light of the Constitutional Court's ruling yesterday that his announcement of emergency powers violated the Constitution? Should concessions be made for the support of Vice President Aleksandr Ruskoi? Russians, not Americans, will decide these problems. But Washington ought to keep open the lines of communication to all sides.
Beyond the political drama are the large issues that Russian society is debating: whether it should seek integration with the West or exist apart from the West. Whether it will focus inward on its gargantuan economic, environmental and ethnic problems or look imperially toward the former republics of the Soviet Union and beyond.
Whether free enterprise and private property will be actively promoted or barely tolerated. Whether more power should be dispersed to the oblasts and autonomous republics of the Russian Federation or exercised exclusively from Moscow.
Whether Russia should adopt a model of economic development that is economically and politically liberal or one in which, like China, it would seek Western capital, technology and markets but deny individual freedom while preserving collectivist controls.
If Russia opts for the Chinese model, America and Europe could end up espousing open trade, free markets and democracy but be unable, in the 21st century, to advance our values and compete freely in a vast area from Kaliningrad to Shanghai that plays by different rules and starts from different cultural principles.
I hope President Clinton thinks about the long term. Since August 1991, America has moved at a dangerously slow pace, giving Russians who want to retard reform an opportunity to blame us for our empty promises.
To play a more constructive role, we need to see America's relationship with Russia beyond tomorrow's headlines and with emphasis on improving the lives of American and Russian citizens.
With the defeat of Communism, there is no ideological conflict between our nations. We should make it absolutely clear that we support both Russia and our own values. This means respecting the human rights of the 25 million Russians who live as minorities in the former Soviet republics, avoiding encouragement to the movements for self-determination in the 20 autonomous republics of the Russian Federation such as Checheno-Ingush and Tatarstan, and giving Russian history and culture the respect they deserve.
Such actions will make clear to all Russians that we are not anti-Russian. It was the expansionist Communist system, not Russian culture, that we opposed.
America's values and interests are served by helping Russia become a democracy with a market-oriented economy that raises its living standards, with a smaller defense establishment, with a firm commitment to guarantee individual human rights and with the acceptance of free-flowing capital, trade and ideas.
In other words, our objective should be to normalize relations with Russia and the other former Soviet republics and to bring them into the international system as full members.
Russia's main worry lies to the east, where an emerging Chinese colossus with a booming economy and a modernizing military maintains its territorial claims on Russia, and to the south, where the peoples of Islam, full of religious fervor and rapid birth rates, yearn for greatness. A strong U.S.-Russian relationship can reassure Russia and hedge against changes that would injure U.S. interests in Europe and Asia.
The Clinton Administration should adopt a tangible and nonbureaucratic program that has a permanent effect and not only helps Russia but also Ukraine, the Baltics, Kazakhstan and the other former republics on the road to reform.
With U.S. leadership, the West should reduce the burden of foreign debt on the economy by rescheduling it, which the Administration apparently is contemplating, and promoting debt-equity swaps; it should replace the 17 Chernobyl-type reactors that are time bombs threatening Europe and the world with radioactive emissions, and send far more humanitarian aid (medicine, food, infant formula, syringes) for pensioners and children.
In addition, the World Bank should provide insurance coverage (similar to that offered by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation) to private investors in the farming and energy sectors. We need to push multilateral financing for trade in oil and gas equipment, and provide additional assistance to nuclear scientists and scientific institutes to convert from military to civilian pursuits.
We should help Russian refugees from the former Soviet republics get resettled and started in private farming by giving the green light to lending by the World Bank, and should combine help for a social safety net with radical monetary reform that could stabilize the ruble, provided that Russia caps its money supply and controls inflation.
In addition to its support for international financial institutions, this program would cost the U.S. $3 billion to $5 billion a year: between 1 and 2 percent of our defense budget.
The most important long-term consideration is to maximize the personal ties of Russians, Ukrainians, Balts, Kazakhs and others with Americans. A Russian friend in Moscow said: "In the 1930's, when the Soviet Union was building Stalinist Communism, thousands of Americans came to Russia to help. Now, when we're trying to build a market-oriented democracy, few Americans offer to help. Why?" I did not have a good answer.
We should begin a large-scale exchange program bringing tens of thousands of Russians here annually. Last year, there were nearly 50,000 Chinese in our colleges, as there has been for a decade, and 127,000 students from Taiwan, Japan, India and Singapore. There were only 1,200 Russians.
Nothing short of a large-scale sharing of ideas, people and training will accomplish our goals of economic prosperity and political security for Russia, its neighbors and ourselves.
I hope that President Clinton encourages Americans to reach out generously toward the peoples of Russia, Ukraine and the other republics. There should be 30,000 Russian high school students living with American families for a year, 10,000 Russians in small business in towns across America, 10,000 college students at our universities and thousands of former military officers learning modern banking, finance and accounting in the West.
We can help young people learn what life in a market-oriented democracy with a heart is all about. They will see America's openness, generosity and pride at work. Their experience would bring our peoples together in countless ways, creating bonds that would last a lifetime. As the Russians get ready to decide their future in the streets or, preferably, at the ballot box, we should step forward on many fronts with solid help for their country.

HEADLINE: Small Businesses Need More Time for New Insurance Law

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I am outraged that the New York State Legislature has enacted a community rating insurance law which will have a devastating effect on the state's small businesses. Because of it my company will lose health insurance April 1. We were insured by Liberty Mutual and informed of what to expect in mid-February. 
 The alternative is to see the family policy rise to $11,500 a year and our individuals rate rise by $2,400. Since I cannot afford to pay these costs, the alternative is to pass them on to our employees. Is that what the Legislature had in mind, at a time when the only sector of business that is attempting to grow in New York is small business?
With most major corporations in New York cutting back, downsizing and laying off, the only hope is the small-business community, and this is the very group targeted. The law applies only to companies with fewer than 50 employees. The net result will be more unemployment and no hiring by small businesses.
The idea to create a fair system of health insurance is good, but the execution, timing and targeted group does not make sense. Instead of spreading the risk, we have lost 10 major insurance carriers, crippled small business and forced employees to absorb exorbitant costs or face no insurance coverage at all. This law will surely add to the country's uninsured population.
Since my business started in 1981, I have watched our rates rise by 500 percent before enactment of this law. The problem is not our employees. The problem lies with an abusive legal and medical system. Instead of trying to curtail the problem, the Legislature has put the burden on the little guy. To compound matters, because of my company's corporate status, I cannot as a principal and officer deduct my insurance and will be taxed additionally on this new higher rate. So will my employees if a cap on health insurance benefits paid by employers is enacted.
What happens April 1, when many small businesses have not had ample time to secure other health insurance? What happens to their employees, to their families? Has the Legislature, in its haste to enact this law, thought about those who will have medical problems and emergencies, and how they will cope with the tragedy our Legislature has handed them?
It is imperative that this deadline be extended, so that we can provide for our employees, and the insurance industry can adjust and prepare in some way other than a state of panic and confusion.

HEADLINE: Clinton Would Consider Segregating Gay Troops;
Remarks Are Contrast With Earlier Stand on the Military

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 23

 BODY:
Facing resistance from the military over his pledge to allow homosexuals to serve in the armed forces, President Clinton said for the first time today that he would consider proposals to segregate troops by sexual orientation.
Mr. Clinton's comments at a White House news conference contrasted sharply with his public statements during the Presidential campaign and in the first days after he was elected. Mr. Clinton said then without qualification that he would end discrimination against homosexuals in the military. 
 The President's remarks surprised people on both sides of the issue and raised eyebrows in the Pentagon, where officials studying ways to deploy gay soldiers said they had never considered segregation a serious option.
 
Alarm and Welcome
 Organizations that had been urging Mr. Clinton to reverse the ban on homosexuals expressed alarm, saying his comments reflected a retreat. But opponents welcomed the President's remarks for the same reason, citing them as evidence that Mr. Clinton was giving in to pressure from top generals who have asserted that the ban was needed to preserve military discipline and spirit.
Shortly after taking office, Mr. Clinton had sought to put the controversy to rest by delaying immediate action on his pledge, instructing Les Aspin, the Defense Secretary, to write a new policy by July 15 that would examine whether homosexuals should be barred from ground combat and warships, as women are now. In recent weeks, Mr. Clinton has avoided public discussion of the issue.
Asked by reporters whether he would support segregation of homosexual members of the service, Mr. Clinton referred to the report being drafted in the Pentagon. "That depends on what the report says," he said. "That's why I'm waiting for the Secretary of Defense to issue the report. But I wouldn't rule that out, depending on what the grounds and arguments were." [Transcript, pages A9-A10.]
 
Supreme Court Nomination
 Mr. Clinton did not comment on how homosexuals might be separated from heterosexuals -- in separate units or separate living quarters within the same unit.
Mr. Clinton addressed several other domestic issues, including how he would select a replacement for Justice Byron R. White, who has announced his retirement from the Supreme Court. Asked whether he would ask potential nominees their position on abortion, Mr. Clinton said: "I will not ask anybody how they will vote in a specific case. I will endeavor to appoint someone who has an attachment to a belief in a strong and broad right to constitutional privacy."
The President also said he thought that most Americans would pay "a little more" in taxes for a better health-care system. As the Senate voted today on the framework of his budget, he predicted that he would persuade reluctant Senators to vote for his economic plan this week.
He also said that in the coming days he would propose eliminating the practice of evading campaign spending limits through big contributions to political parties rather than candidates. And he said his efforts to resolve the longstanding dispute over protection of spotted owls in the Northwest's timber country "will probably make everybody mad."
 
On the Defensive
 It was the questions on homosexuals in the military that seemed to put the President the most on the defensive, to the point that he found himself defending his ability to lead the armed forces. "No, I don't have a problem being Commander in Chief," he insisted. Dismissing the notion that his not having served in the military had generated some opposition to his proposal to end the ban against homosexuals, he said, "A lot of service officers disagreed with the position on gays in the military before I even took office."
While Mr. Clinton said he would wait until the Pentagon report was completed before making a decision on whether gay soldiers should be treated differently from heterosexual ones, groups on both sides said his comments raised the prospect that he was backing away from his initial stand, that soldiers should be punished or rewarded on the basis of conduct and job performance, not sexual orientation.
Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, the chairman of the Armed Forces Committee who is Mr. Clinton's chief foe on allowing openly gay people in the military, suggested recently that he opposed even permitting the segregation of homosexual soldiers. He said he feared that would be unconstitutional.
Mr. Clinton disputed that notion today, saying, "The courts have traditionally given wide berth to the military to make judgments of that kind in terms of duty assignments."
Recently, Mr. Clinton toured a warship for the first time when he flew to the carrier Theodore Roosevelt off Norfolk, Va. During the tour he viewed the triple-decker berths in the crew's sleeping quarters. Administration officials said that caused the President to begin rethinking his position.
Thomas S. Stoddard, coordinator of the Campaign for Military Service, a coalition opposing the military's ban, said the President's comments were "slightly alarming." But he added, "I believe on study and reflection, the President would reject any distinction based on sexual orientation."
Senator Dan Coats, an Indiana Republican who favors keeping the ban and opposes a compromise on segregation, said: "I'm hoping that this is a thoughtful reconsideration of whether or not this is the time to have the Pentagon preoccupied with this subject. The President is discovering that this is a far more complex and difficult issue than he initially realized."
 
Criticism of Japan
 George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, said the President had not made any decision about whether to support segregating the troops, but that "he's certainly saying that he's open to it."
Fielding questions on other topics at the news conference, Mr. Clinton issued a surprisingly harsh condemnation of Japan's trade surplus with the United States, which reached $49.42 billion last year. "The persistence of the surplus the Japanese enjoy with the United States and with the rest of the developed world can only lead one to the conclusion that the possibility of obtaining real, even access to the Japanese market is somewhat remote," he said.
By contrast, the Bush Administration and many economists have contended that the size of the trade surplus has less to do with the openness of the Japanese market than with macroeconomic problems in the United States, such as a low savings rate here.

HEADLINE: New York State Plan Would Require Jobs To Be Part of School

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

 BODY:
The New York State Commissioner of Education is proposing to make work as integral a part of the requirements for high school graduation as math, reading and science.
The proposal is intended to address concerns that public schools are not giving students even basic job skills. If it is approved by the State Board of Regents on Friday, New York would become the first state in the nation to require high school juniors and seniors to work before they graduate, according to the National Governors Association. 
 What Dr. Thomas Sobol, the Commissioner of Education, is asking the Regents to endorse is a broad policy change to include work in the school day and as a prerequisite for a diploma. Details of how the plan would work -- including how many hours students would be required to work, what kinds of jobs would qualify for graduation credits and how jobs would be found for every one of the state's more than 300,000 juniors and seniors -- have not been decided.
But the proposal would in the most basic sense change the way schools teach, refocusing education to include work experience and lessons about work skills in all curriculums and calling on private businesses and labor unions to participate. If the plan is approved, it would be put into place gradually in schools around the state over the next five years.
Under Dr. Sobol's proposal, the work programs could vary widely from district to district and student to student. One senior might work as an apprentice to a welder, another as a part-time lab technician and a third as a manager of a student-run business.
 
Job Skills AreIs Goal
 In all cases, though, the goal would be the same: to give students a taste of the work world, to teach them specific job skills and to prepare them for a job market in which even entry-level jobs can require advanced knowledge of math, science and computers.
"We have reached a point in history when social and economic trends create a crisis for many young people in the transition from education to employment," Dr. Sobol wrote in his report to the Regents. "Research, our constituents and the public tell us that students are not prepared for this new workplace as well as they should be."
The proposal, which the Commissioner's staff has worked on for the last two years, has triggered a debate in Albany and across the state over the role of public education in preparing students for work.
Proponents, including many labor unions, say America is losing high-paying jobs because its high school graduates are less skilled than their European and Japanese peers.
"You can see that systems in these other countries produce kids vastly more skilled at 18 than American kids are at 26 or 27," said Marc S. Tucker, the president of the National Center on Education and the Economy, a think tank in Rochester. "It's a pretty big difference with major implications not only for the economy but also for the kids."
But critics, including organizations representing school boards and principals, say a work program will add a new layer of responsibility for administrators already spread thin by state mandates. But more fundamentally, they contend that the program will make public schools less a training ground for the mind than for business.
"Having students work for credit is making schools into something they are not," said Louis Grumet, the executive director of the New York State School Boards Association. "Schools are there to have kids learn and think and create. If they are working, when are they going to do those things?"
 
Work Force Considered
 The Commissioner's proposal -- which integrates the findings of a series of studies in recent years by various state agencies and committees, including one headed by Lieut. Gov. Stan N. Lundine -- comes as states are considering ways to better prepare students for the work force. In addition to the work experience, the proposal would also require lessons about work skills, like managing time, handling money and using computers, in all courses at all grades. All student would then have to have assessments of those work skills by the 10th grade to insure they have mastered basic jobs skills.
Jack A. Kadamus, the Assistant Commissioner for the Office of Workforce Preparation and Continuing Education, said that the idea was not to track some students into vocational training and others into college, but rather to prepare all students to work in an increasingly technical world, especially those students who do not go on to college.
"That's not necessarily getting done in schools now," he said.
 
Flexibility Is Stressed
 If approved, the proposal, which would initially cost $1.2 million, would create six pilot projects in the fall of 1993, like one already begun by Cornell University at six schools in Broome County.
Mr. Kadamus said the details of the work programs would have to be worked out by the Commissioner's staff over the next few years as the pilot programs begin -- and in the end would leave room for school districts to mold them to their needs.
"We don't have a set model," he said. "We have a set of ideas, of principles, we're asking the Regents to adopt."
Mr. Lundine, whose task force on work and education last year offered many of the same sort of recommendations integrated into Dr. Sobol's proposal, said that with the proposals New York would take the national lead in training all students to compete in the work force.
"We have largely ignored what has been called the forgotten half, the students who do not go on to college," Mr. Lundine said. "I think this is going to be one of the most important and most thorough reforms adopted in education in decades, perhaps this century."

HEADLINE: SENATE DEMOCRATS UNIFIED ON BUDGET

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24

 BODY:
Democratic Senators held ranks today and defended President Clinton's economic program against a fierce volley of political potshots from Republicans.
By a vote of 52 to 47, the Democrats rejected the most serious Republican threat to the Clinton budget plan, an amendment that would have scrapped the President's proposal to raise taxes on the Social Security benefits of the most affluent retirees. Only four Democrats voted against the President. 
 But as Congress neared approval of the Clinton plan, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, called for even deeper cuts in the budget deficit, saying he feared that it would rise again late in the decade. [Page D1.]
Today's vote on the Social Security benefits was an important test because it showed that for the time being Democrats were willing to stand fast behind the President, even on the most difficult issue politically.
The Democrats also defeated a Republican proposal for much deeper spending cuts than those Mr. Clinton wants, more spending for the military and none of the Clinton tax increases. The vote, basically along party lines, was 57 to 42.
The Republican amendments came as the Senate was considering the outline of Mr. Clinton's budget. Their defeat showed beyond doubt that the basic budget plan would be approved intact on Thursday. The more crucial votes -- on exactly which taxes will be raised and which programs cut -- will not come until later in the year.
 
Vote on Spending Plan
 After the budget vote on Thursday, the Senate will take up Mr. Clinton's $16 billion spending bill, which is intended to stimulate the economy and create jobs over the next two years. The discipline displayed by Democrats today indicated that the stimulus package would probably pass, but Senators said the President might have to accept some modest compromises to get it through.
The House of Representatives approved slightly different versions of the budget plan and the stimulus bill last week. The differences between the House and Senate measures will be reconciled by conference committees.
To underscore the importance of the Social Security vote and how close the outcome had been expected to be, Vice President Al Gore made a rare appearance to preside over the Senate this morning in case his vote was needed to break a tie.
But the debate on the budget in general and the Social Security amendment in particular lacked the emotion that might have been expected on such sensitive topics. Senators from both parties tried harder to score politically than to illuminate the issues involved.
A higher tax on the Social Security benefits of some retirees is a central part of the Clinton plan to cut the budget deficit. The President would increase the portion of Social Security benefits that are subject to income taxes to 85 percent from 50 percent for couples with total incomes, including retirement benefits, of more than $32,000 and single retirees with incomes above $25,000. The Social Security payments of taxpayers with incomes below those thresholds are not now taxed and would not be under the Clinton plan.
Social Security has been the heart and soul of the Democratic Party's philosophy for more than 50 years, and rare is the Democratic politician who has not used the issue to gain leverage over Republican opponents.
 
Prime Time Debate
 So this time Republicans tried to turn the tables. With the debate on Tuesday night televised live in prime time on C-Span, the cable channel, they flailed at the Democrats with one oratorical jab after another.
"Our nation's seniors did not create this budget deficit; Congress did," Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said in an almost empty Senate chamber. "I will not be party to balancing the budget on the backs of our nation's seniors."
Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, said the President's proposal made a mockery of his campaign promise not to raise income taxes on anyone but the very wealthy. And Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, even accused Mr. Clinton of wanting to tax the elderly on the potential income they could get if they rented their homes, an accusation that had no basis in fact but was meant to stick in the craw of the television viewers.
Democrats for the most part stayed away from the debate, apparently confident they had the votes to beat back the Republican onslaught. But occasionally they entered the fray, saying that the deficit had to be reduced and that the best course was to follow the Clinton prescription. The higher Social Security tax would raise more than $30 billion over five years, one of the largest tax increases in the President's plan.
 
Democratic Counterattack
 "Our colleagues are now making an effort to derail President Clinton's momentum," Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic leader, said when the Senate went back into session this morning. "Do we want to give President Clinton a chance, or do we want to torpedo President Clinton's program before it gets under way?"
The only Democrats who voted with the Republicans were Howell Heflin and Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona and Bob Krueger of Texas. A fifth, Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii, was absent.
But the Democrats had some partisan gamesmanship up their sleeves also. After the Social Security vote, Senators Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey and Jim Exon of Nebraska offered an amendment that they termed a compromise. It expressed "the sense of the Senate" that the Finance Committee should try to find a way not to raise the taxes of single retirees with incomes below $32,000 and couples with incomes below $40,000.
The amendment was approved, 67 to 32, with every Democrat in favor except Charles S. Robb of Virginia, who voted "no," and Mr. Inouye, who was absent.
"Sense of the Senate" measures have no binding effect and are often ignored after the vote is taken, but Senator Lautenberg immediately issued a news release taking credit for liberating more than one million retirees from the effect of the proposed new tax.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN MOSCOW;
Clinton Meets Russian On Assistance Proposal

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24

 BODY:
Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev of Russia asked President Clinton today to help stabilize his country's teetering economy by purchasing its oil, lifting trade restrictions, rescheduling the repayment of its debt and lobbying for the country's admission to the club of industrialized nations.
Mr. Clinton in turn pledged to continue his efforts on behalf of Russia by telephoning foreign leaders, asking Americans for support for an extensive economic aid package and avoiding potentially inflammatory comment on Russia's political turmoil. 
 In an Oval Office meeting intended to signal Mr. Clinton's seriousness about supporting President Boris N. Yeltsin in the crisis, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kozyrev discussed ways to speed the development of the Administration's proposal, which is expected to be announced before the summit meeting scheduled 10 days from now in Vancouver, British Columbia.
In a speech at American University today and in the meeting with Mr. Clinton, Mr. Kozyrev insisted that his country did not want American "aid." "We want specific projects, but not a sum of money," he said.
Rather, he outlined the broad cooperation Russia is hoping for, and while Administration aides would not comment on specific suggestions, they later said they had not ruled out any of them.
 
Help 'in Our Interest'
 "It is very much in our interest to keep Russia a democracy, to keep moving toward market reforms, and to keep moving toward reducing the nuclear threat," Mr. Clinton said before he met with Mr. Kozyrev. "It will save the American people billions of dollars in money we don't have to spend maintaining a nuclear arsenal, if we can continue to denuclearize the world.
"It will make the American people billions of dollars in future trade opportunities," he said. "And it will make the world a safer place."
The Administration has been trying to emphasize the benefits of such support over the potential costs.
"The notion of providing help is unpopular in the United States -- and in Russia, as a matter of fact," Mr. Kozyrev said, "so we discussed opportunities for cooperating between two great countries. And what is very important, that President Clinton is very action-oriented, he is very businesslike, and he just is not about to talk. I feel that he is about to act."
 
Talks With Other Leaders
 Mr. Clinton spoke about the Russian aid issue by telephone with Prime Ministers John Major of Britain and Brian Mulroney of Canada. Canada and France have been pushing to move up the date of the economic summit meeting scheduled for July in Tokyo to address Russian aid. But the United States and Britain appear to be leaning toward Japan's stand that a meeting of foreign and finance ministers should be held in mid-April.
Mr. Kozyrev proposed a "concrete program of action" that would include lifting trade restrictions on high technology exports, working together with the United States on military conversion projects and developing a timetable for debt rescheduling.
"Cooperation in the area of conversion of Russian and U.S. defense industries may become the driving force in the entire program," Mr. Kozyrev said. "Joint efforts to dismantle the bloated military-industrial complexes of both sides will go a long way toward building confidence and symbolizing the end of confrontation."
Mr. Clinton said today that he was planning to speak with Mr. Yeltsin. Their last communication came on Tuesday when Mr. Clinton sent condolences on the death of Mr. Yeltsin's mother.
In an interview tonight on the CBS News program "48 Hours," President Clinton was asked whether he thought Mr. Yeltsin would hold onto his office.
He responded: "He's a very resilient fellow, you know. He's like all of us in public life. He is not perfect. I'm not perfect. We all have our problems. But he is a genuinely courageous man, genuinely committed to freedom and democracy, genuinely committed to reform, and I think now he is more open perhaps than in the past to try and work out some kind of accommodation with others who would negotiate with him to keep reform going even though they may have some different ideas."
After the White House meeting today, Mr. Kozyrev signaled that Mr. Yeltsin was willing to meet with Parliament members who have opposed his reforms.
"It is for Russians and Russian people to pass final judgment, and the President calls for a vote, a popular vote," he said. "And I think this will be the decisive event. But on the whole the President is always open to compromise with those political forces who are not out to just reverse the reform and revanche the democracy."
On the question of Russian admission into the group of seven industrialized nations, some members have spurned American suggestions that its membership be expanded.
Mr. Kozyrev said the question was still "on the table."
Secretary of State Warren Christopher would not endorse the idea of Russia's joining, but said its role in the coming meeting would be "very important."

HEADLINE: U.S. IS CUTTING AID TO LATIN DRUG WAR

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24

 BODY:
Congress and the Clinton Administration are quietly reversing a Bush Administration anti-drug initiative that sent hundreds of millions of dollars to South American governments.
In January, Democrats in Congress slashed military and economic assistance for Peru, Colombia and Bolivia after concluding that the program was failing to produce the desired effect: encouraging the South American nations to reduce production of drugs, principally coca leaf and its refined product, cocaine. 
 Now the White House is preparing to go further as part of an extensive classified review of Government programs aimed at stopping drug shipments before they enter the United States. The expected additional cutbacks would represent a substantial step away from the Bush strategy, introduced in 1989, which focused on halting cocaine trafficking at its source.
 
Shift to Domestic Programs
 Officials involved in the review of the $3 billion international drug-fighting budget said it was the first step in of a Clinton Administration plan to shift anti-drug resources from foreign intervention to domestic programs -- education, treatment, and local and state law enforcement -- intended to reduce the demand for drugs in the United States.
One sign of a new approach to drug fighting came shortly after Mr. Clinton's inauguration, when he ordered a severe cut in the size of the drug policy office. Although he promised to elevate its new director to Cabinet rank, he has not yet nominated anyone to fill the job, and officials said the White House and its National Security Council staff had begun to take charge of the spending debate.
No final decisions have been reached in the review of international drug policy, and some officials insisted that budget figures being prepared by the Administration for next year appeared to leave intact some international drug-fighting programs, including overseas operations of the Drug Enforcement Administration.
But representatives of the Departments of State and Defense, the Drug Enforcement Administration and other agencies were said to be struggling in anticipation of the expected realignment to protect their own programs at others' expense.
 
Worry Over Deeper Cuts
 Officials described an atmosphere of unease they said had been created by the aid cutbacks and the expectation that the White House review will lead to wider drug-budget reductions.
"Everyone thought that narcotics was sort of a sacred cow and that there might just be some tinkering here and there," said one top official involved in drug-control efforts. "Frankly, all this has caught everyone just a little bit flat-footed."
The study is one of more than two dozen being conducted by the new Administration on different aspects of national security policy. But officials said the drug policy review was one of the more highly charged of the studies because it follows a a near-doubling in anti-drug spending under the Bush Administration, with the sharpest increases in international drug-fighting programs.
Officials said the efforts by Congress and the White House to cut the anti-drug assistance to Peru, Bolivia and Colombia reflected a recognition that coca crops and cocaine production remained virtually undiminished despite the extensive transfer of weapons, military training and economic aid to those countries since 1989.
 
Some Gains in Colombia
 Colombia in particular has made some progress in tracking down drug traffickers. But the officials said all the programs were vulnerable to an increasing public aversion to foreign aid programs, even when used to help fund a drug war that once seemed sacrosanct.
Under final allotments made by Congressional appropriations committees without objection from Clinton aides, the United States this year will dispatch no more than $174 million in counter-narcotics aid to the three Andean countries, a 35 percent cut from last year's total. The package represents 45 percent of what the Bush Administration had requested.
The cuts have set off quiet protests from each of three nations, which regard United States aid as essential to their efforts to reduce coca farming and the production and export of cocaine.
The Government's overall anti-drug budget -- more than $12 billion this year -- doubled in size under Mr. Bush, with the international programs the fastest growing part. The Pentagon alone received a quadrupling in spending on military efforts to detect drug trafficking abroad, and the direct aid given to the three Andean countries soared from almost nothing in 1989 to the Bush Administration's record request for $387 million for this fiscal year. It was this request that the Congressional Democrats cut back in January.
 
Charges of Fund Diversion
 But the assistance programs have also run into controversy, with South American governments accused of diverting some of the military aid to fight guerrillas instead of drug traffickers. Peru and Bolivia, which together account for more than 90 percent of the world's coca supply, have also repeatedly failed to meet the eradication targets set by the United States as a condition for economic aid.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Protect a Songbird But Give Builders Leeway

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 24

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration will play the first major card in its environmental policy Thursday by proposing to list a small Southern California songbird as threatened rather than endangered.
The Administration's action on the bird, the California gnatcatcher, has been widely expected as a sign of a new policy direction toward protecting species while also encouraging economic growth. The decision is to be announced in Washington by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who oversees the Fish and Wildlife Service. 
 An advance copy of the new rule provided by environmentalists shows that Mr. Babbitt will designate the bird as "threatened" under the Endangered Species Act, a status that requires less stringent measures of protection than the designation of "endangered."
 
Thousands of Jobs at Stake
 The four-inch-long gnatcatcher has emerged as the chief symbol of the clash between endangered species and economic development. Developers have been fighting Federal protection because the bird occupies 200,000 acres of prime housing land in depressed Southern California; its listing could affect thousands of construction jobs. Environmentalists have petitioned to give the bird the endangered listing, saying that 90 percent of its habitat has been destroyed and that only 2,000 pairs of the birds remain in the state.
The "threatened" listing will allow Mr. Babbitt to issue a special rule whereby developers can destroy the bird's habitat in some areas if they agree to participate in a new state program that might require them to give up other land deemed crucial to the bird's survival. The program would set aside a large enough area to preserve the coastal sage scrub ecosystem inhabited by the gnatcatcher; theoretically, this would not only insure the survival of the bird but also avert legal battles over other dwindling plants and animals in the ecosystem.
 
Looking for Compromise
 Mr. Babbitt has been pressing for such an approach to species protection all over the country. The gnatcatcher is the first animal for which he has drawn an actual rule. The Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group based in New York, had petitioned to list the bird as endangered, a step that would have made further development in four Southern California counties extremely difficult. With the consent of the council, Mr. Babbitt did not meet the March 17 deadline to respond to the listing petition while he worked out a political compromise.
Mr. Babbitt's action tries to mesh the Federal law with the new California program mounted by Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, to allow housing projects to proceed if developers agree to set aside land to preserve the central ecosystems of certain species.
It remains to be seen how developers and their environmental adversaries will respond to the proposed ruling, which is contingent on adoption of five-year interim guidelines for the land involved. The guidelines, being prepared by a scientific review panel appointed by the state, would govern exactly how much development could take place while the habitat is fully studied.

HEADLINE: Durables Orders Up 2.2% in Month

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Offering fresh evidence that the economy is gaining strength, the Commerce Department reported yesterday that February orders for durable goods -- factory machinery, aircraft, autos, military hardware and other expensive, long-lasting items -- rose a healthy 2.2 percent, the fourth increase in the last six months.
But like most recent Government reports, this latest measure of the economy's health also suggested weaknesses that could dilute the recovery in coming months. 
 Orders for new commercial aircraft, for example, go up one month and down the next. In February, they rose very sharply, after having fallen in January. Excluding aircraft, durable goods orders fell by seventh-tenths of 1 percent in February.
"It is hard to say what this mix of numbers is telling us, but they seem to be saying that the economy does not look bad," said Kathleen Menth, supervisor of the statisticians who gather the durable goods data at the Census Bureau, an arm of the Commerce Department.
The February increase nearly reversed a 2.3 percent January decline. Rising consumer demand, coupled with the apparent tendency of some manufacturers to rebuild inventories, helped to explain the strong February report, economists said.
A three-tenths of 1 percent increase in unfilled orders, the third consecutive monthly rise in this category, suggested that manufacturing output would remain strong this spring. A rise in unfilled orders indicates that manufacturers are busy and taking longer to fill buyers' orders.
But economists cautioned that some of February's demand was a result of strong retail sales from Thanksgiving through January. Consumer buying fell off in February, which could affect future durable goods orders.
"Quite frankly, as we look ahead, we might find ourselves with another slowdown in the manufacturing sector as consumer demand declines," said Nancy Lazar, a senior economist and executive vice president of the ISI Group, a Wall Street consulting and investment firm.
The Commerce Department said that durable goods orders, seasonally adjusted, reached $135 billion in February. That nearly matched December's performance and was well above all other months last year, when monthly durables orders never exceeded $127 billion.
The February rise of $2.9 billion, from $132.1 billion in January, included a $3.7 billion jump in commercial aircraft orders. That increase bucks a trend, here and abroad, of declining aircraft orders from airline companies.
Orders for military equipment, which also gyrate from month to month, fell 24.5 percent in February after rising 10.5 percent in January. But there were gains in other areas, including autos and trucks, railroad and construction equipment, engines, some factory machinery and other nonmilitary capital goods. Orders for electronic equipment fell, however.
Actual factory shipments in February rose by a healthy 2.6 percent after having declined 2.7 percent in January.

HEADLINE: Haikou Journal;
For Treasure (and Pleasure), Their Special Island

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAIKOU, China

 BODY:
A middle-aged man in a business suit entered the nightclub and placed his order. A moment later, it was delivered: a pretty woman in a flowing robe eased into the seat beside him with a glittering lipsticky smile.
Filled with 50 or so love seats and sofas and about 15 private karaoke singing rooms, the International Trade Club represents the kind of life that people come from all over China to taste. There is easy money, easy housing and, sometimes, easy love. 
 Hainan Island, of which Haikou is the capital, is a tropical province that China has proclaimed its newest and largest special economic zone. Partly because it is separated from the Chinese mainland by a 13-mile strip of water, the authorities give it special dispensation to stray from economic and social orthodoxy.
As a result, many Chinese are leaving their homes to forge a new life in what is in some ways a Chinese equivalent of the Wild West.
"I agonized every day for two months about whether I should leave -- my family objected, I had a good job with a good employer and no one wanted me to go," said 31-year-old Yang Huping, who has now found a senior post at the local stock market. "Now I'm a Hainan resident and I like it. I can pursue my own desires and develop my own talents."
 
Money Is the Lure
 Fat-cat cadres from the north come here to sample the night life or the sandy beaches that officials here constantly compare to Hawaii's. Others, like the young woman in the nightclub, come to seek their fortune.
The woman, who refused to be identified, said she had obtained a leave from her position as an assistant to a senior official in Hangzhou. She added that she had not told her parents that her new job was to spend her evenings cuddling up to strange men and plying them with drinks.
The 200 hostesses at the club are not all prostitutes, and sex is conducted elsewhere after negotiations strictly between the hostess and the customer. The woman said she had decided that she would not return to hotel rooms with her customers.
"I've decided to give it a year," she said as she sat on a plush couch while waiting for her next customer. She said she could earn the equivalent of about $8,200 in 12 months -- not nearly as much as a prostitute but much more than the $420 that a typical worker earns in a year.
That kind of money is exactly the lure that attracts many Chinese to Hainan.
 
A Leader's Pet Project
 These days, millions of peasants are descending on China's major cities to help fuel the momentous growth there. But Hainan is getting white-collar workers -- technicians, engineers, managers, teachers and a lot of bureaucrats.
Hainan was made a province and a special economic zone in 1988, in the hope that it could become another Hong Kong. The island's development was a pet project of Zhao Ziyang, the former Communist Party leader, until he was ousted in June 1989.
Mr. Zhao had hoped to turn the entire island into a free port and to give it special privileges to attract foreign investors. Officials often said that Hainan was China's second-largest island, after Taiwan, and they seemed to think of it as a good prospect for pursuing Taiwan's miracle economy in the coming decades.
After Mr. Zhao was purged, Hainan fell from favor. It still grew extemely quickly, but it no longer is the centerpiece of economic restructuring. That honor now goes to Pudong, a part of Shanghai, and Hainan has been largely left to itself.
Now it is trying to turn itself into an export processing zone and a tourist center. A new international airport is being built at Sanya, near the beaches, and when it is finished next year Hainan hopes to attract sun-worshipers from all over Asia and the world.
 
Executives From the North
 Beijing still supplies Hainan's leaders and each brings a cabal of northerners, who barge in like cowboys entering a rodeo arena, ready to gain influence or income. Virtually all senior officials are from up north.
The result is a budding resentment among the local people, some of whom feel they are being turned into a virtual second class. At the Hainan Automobile Factory, a joint venture with Japan, most of the managers are from the mainland while the workers along the assembly lines are locals.
On a recent afternoon, a group of peasant women, wearing pointy straw hats to shield themselves from the sun, held a sit-in on the lawn of the Provincial Government building. Their land was being taken away for development and they protested that they were getting only a pittance in compensation.
Even locals who are well educated say they sense the slight. "Everyone with any kind of clout is from Beijing or the mainland," said an official researcher whose family has been here for generations. "Who gets rich? Not the locals, but the mainlanders."
 
Professionals Benefit
 Still, some local professionals are also benefiting from the province's free-and-easy policy. During the generally quiet trading session of the official foreign exchange swap center, Lin Yu hit his buzzer several times to signal a bid.
The 24-year-old Mr. Lin, who was born here, earned $175,000 for his firm last year trading Chinese yuan and dollars. His own salary, he said, is a secret.
"I'm a Hainan man," Mr. Lin said, adding his signature to a stack of contracts as customers surrounded his desk. "I have a base here. I don't even want to go to Hong Kong."

At a currency exchange in Haikou, not all the business of trading for dollars is done on the inside. (Sheryl WuDunn/The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
If Government rides to the rescue of ailing airlines, will consumers get trampled in the process?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
IF there is an economic recovery in progress, it's news to the airlines. The 10 largest have lost an awesome $10 billion over the last three years and Washington is scrounging for ways to help.
A soon-to-be-formed blue-ribbon commission, charged by Congress with the job of coming up with a plan by summer, will not lack for suggestions. The airlines and their unions are floating proposals ranging from loan subsidies to tax breaks to a get-tough policy on foreign competitors. But in the view of many economists, the proposed fixes put the cart before the horse. It is still not clear that anything important is really broken. 
 The industry is in trouble, practically everyone agrees, because the biggest carriers gambled and lost, expanding capacity into the teeth of an enduring recession in full-fare travel. What everyone does not agree on are the likely consequences.
If happier days await only a strong economic recovery, it would probably serve the public to let the markets (and the bankruptcy courts) work it out on their own. On the other hand, if hard times mean the liquidation of another big carrier or two, maybe, just maybe, it would pay to give them some financial breathing room.
From 1987 to 1992, the number of airline seats grew roughly in proportion to the number of passengers. But this apparent match, notes Daniel Kasper, an economist with Harbridge House consultants in Cambridge, Mass., obscures sobering truths.
To fill the extra seats, the airlines had to cut average fares. Adjusted for inflation, revenue per mile flown fell by nearly a fifth as business travelers became cagier about flying for full fare and vacationers insisted on exceptionally steep discounts.
What's more, the biggest carriers ignored the warning signs of stagnant demand in their lemming-like rush to exploit the anticipated economies of scale, providing more service to more cities. When Eastern and Pan Am went out of business, the decline in capacity was fully offset by growth at American, United and Delta. Today no large airline, with the exception of a maverick, Southwest, is making a profit. Most are hunkering down, mothballing jetliners and scaling back orders for new planes.
Who is to blame for the industry's sorry financial performance is a matter of dispute. To Robert L. Crandall, chief executive of American Airlines, the villains of the piece are Continental, T.W.A. and America West. These bankrupt carriers continue to fly under protection of the courts, competing with solvent airlines that devote huge sums to servicing debts.
But Severin Borenstein, an economist at the University of California, is skeptical of Mr. Crandall's argument. Forcing insolvent carriers out of business would "violate the whole principle of Chapter 11" reorganization under bankruptcy, he said. While Mr. Borenstein concedes that judges are inclined to give airline managers and workers the benefit of the doubt, he emphasizes that it does not make economic sense to shut down a carrier if it can still cover out-of-pocket operating costs.
More to the point, Mr. Borenstein notes, the Chapter 11 carriers have not been the aggressors in the price wars of the last few years. In fact, twice-bankrupt Continental has actually worked to chill the industry's fire-sale mentality by holding seats off the market at key moments.
That said, should Uncle Sam play Uncle Sugar for the industry? Alfred E. Kahn, former chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board and the father of airline deregulation, offers a resounding "no." As long as there are too few passengers chasing too many seats, Mr. Kahn said, "there is every reason to believe the airlines would compete away" any tax breaks or subsidies from the Government. The best hope -- and Mr. Kahn's expectation -- is that a strong economy will solve the carriers' problems.
But one airline executive, who agreed to speak only off the record, is less sanguine. If the most vulnerable carriers, in particular Northwest, do not survive the recession, he says, more markets will be left with monopoly service. He suggests permitting money-losing airlines to defer payment of the 10 percent ticket tax.
Mr. Borenstein thinks the whole debate has a wrong turn. The Government's primary responsibility here, he suggests, is to protect consumers and taxpayers -- not the airlines' stockholders or their employees. Thus the public policy agenda ought to be the same now as a decade ago: the preservation of competition.
To Mr. Borenstein, that means, among other things, a more aggressive stance against price-signaling through the airlines' computerized reservation systems, a close look at allegations of predatory pricing and mandatory disclosure of travel agents' commissions. Today, he notes, travel agents routinely steer customers toward the airlines that secretly pay them the most.
In Government, consumers rarely come first. In politics, money talks, and the airlines and their unions are doing most of the talking.

HEADLINE: Suspect's Arrest in Blast Puzzles His Family in Egypt

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, March 24

 BODY:
In the gritty back streets in Kafr El Dauwar, 15 miles southeast of Alexandria, the arrest of Mahmud Abouhalima in the World Trade Center bombing was a mystery to his family. They said they had not seen their son since he left the country for Germany more than a decade ago.
"He has not been back and he was not arrested here," said Mohammed Halima, his father. 
 "I don't know if he is in Egypt," said his father, wearing a green and white striped robe, his head covered by a white skull cap. "He left 13 years ago and I have heard nothing from him or Mohammed. I don't know if the charges are true or false."
The row of small, two-story bungalows, built for workers at the country's second-largest textile mill just yards away, was home to Mr. Abouhalima until he left Egypt. His father, now retired, worked at the mill as a foreman and raised his children next door to his brother's family.
 
Subject to Strict Rules
 The cramped living room, with two bedrooms on the story overhead, matched every other dwelling along both sides of the street. A collection of porcelain horses, a red parrot and a white donkey, along with a few plates, were housed in a wooden sideboard with glass doors. On the table a glass vase held some artificial red carnations.
Several children, including a 15-year-old son, were in the living room until ordered out by Mr. Abouhalima's father who sat on the one couch with his bare feet pulled up in front of him.
Neighbors said they doubted that Mr. Abouhalima, whose father, a former weight lifter who ruled with a stern hand, could have taken part in the attack. They said Mr. Abouhalima and his brother, Mohammed, who also lived in the United States, were always subject to strict rules that allowed for little gaiety or socializing.
"He was a wisp of a kid," said one former classmate, "an indifferent athlete and not that ambitious. He was not like his father, who was a champion power lifter and hard. When he left Egypt he just wanted to get a job and make a living. He wasn't into this kind of thing."
An uncle, on his way home with a plastic bag full of vegetables, said that even before he left for Germany Mr. Abouhalima "was a very religious boy."
 
Center of Militancy
 And while Mr. Abouhalima as a young man learned to smoke, neighbors said, he never lighted a cigarette in front of his father or at home, and studiously avoided alcohol.
Mr. Abouhalima complained to relatives about religious persecution in Germany, especially after his German-born wife converted to Islam.
"His wife was thrown out of Germany because she converted," said his stocky uncle, wearing a battered pair of brown slippers and a blue robe. "In Germany, conversion to Islam is forbidden."
The mill town, with soaring unemployment and overcrowding, is a center of Islamic militancy. Many young men, bearded and in robes, congregated on street corners near the Halima home, located on Abu Halima Street. They wearily eyed an Egyptian and an American reporter and turned their backs when approached.
"Better not to even bring up the role of Islamic militants here," one neighbor said. "Don't even ask us about this."

HEADLINE: Angry Japanese Deplore Clinton's Remarks

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 24

 BODY:
Japan reacted harshly today to tough trade talk from President Clinton, angrily rejecting his strong suggestion that the Japanese market was closed and threatening a legal battle if the Clinton Administration imposed higher tariffs on Japanese mini-vans.
The latest exchange was set off by comments President Clinton made at his news conference Tuesday in Washington, in which he pressed the combative tone of his Administration on trade relations with Japan. 
 Asked if he had abandoned a campaign pledge to sharply increase the tariffs on the imported mini-vans by reclassifying them as trucks rather than cars, Mr. Clinton criticized the Bush Administration's decision not to take this step and said he was reviewing the issue.
Then, without a further question, he harshly criticized Japan's big trade surplus and went broadly after the Japanese, comparing the accessibility of their markets with those of other countries.
In looking at the history of American trade relationships, he said, "the one that never seems to change very much is the one with Japan." He went on, "That is, we're sometimes in a position of trade deficit, but we're often in a position of trade surplus with the European Community."
Then, in a remark that seemed to have particularly angered Japanese officials, he said:
"But the persistence of the surplus the Japanese enjoy with the United States and with the rest of the developed world can only lead one to the conclusion that the possibility of obtaining real, even access to the Japanese market is somewhat remote."
He said he was "astonished" that the Bush Administration overruled the Customs Service "and gave a $300 million-a-year freebie" to the Japanese "for no apparent reason," adding, "and we got nothing, and I emphasis nothing, in return."
Based on the number of mini-vans and sport vehicles imported from Japan, tariff revenue is estimated at $300 million a year more if the Bush Administration had supported a Customs ruling that the vehicles should be taxed as trucks at 25 percent, rather than as cars at 2.5 percent.
Mr. Clinton's remarks in effect rejected the assumptions of a decade of trade negotiations with Japan, which have assumed that the removal of barriers could open markets.
Japanese officials formulated several responses to the President.
This afternoon, Noboru Hatakeyama, Vice Minister for International Trade and Industry, said in a phone interview that a reclassification of the mini-vans as trucks without negotiations would violate the rules of the General Agreement on Tarriffs and Trade, or GATT, the world body that governs trade.
"I hope an influential country such as the United States is not trying to circumvent the GATT rules," Mr. Hatakeyama said, and he repeated a threat. "If they do, of course, we will go to GATT" and take legal action against the United States.
 
Tariffs and Deficits
 A senior Japanese trade official said last month that if Washington punished Japan with export restrictions, it would retaliate with similar penalties against American products.
Mr. Hatakeyama responded to Mr. Clinton's remarks about the closed nature of the Japanese economy by asserting that it was more open than America's, as measured by tariff levels, and that the trade deficit was largely the fault of the United States because it imported too much.
Japan, he said, is now America's largest market for agricultural exports and its second largest for manufactured goods, after Canada. "Therefore it is a mistake, or misunderstanding, to feel that market access to Japan is closed," he said. "If Japan is interpreted as closed, then every country except for Canada is also closed."
"What I am hoping," Mr. Hatakeyama added, "is that the Clinton Administration will come to an accurate analysis of the nature of the Japanese market. Japan is quite open."
He largely ignored the matter of the Japanese trade surplus with the United States, which is running close to $50 billion a year. Asked if that suggested difficulty in gaining access to Japan, as Mr. Clinton had argued, Mr. Hatakeyama replied that the problem existed more in the United States than in Japan.
"The United States maintains a great budget deficit, which is unfortunate and the reason for this," he said.

HEADLINE: Forecasts by Drug Makers Send Clintons a Message

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
The announcements of slumping pharmaceutical earnings that depressed drug stocks yesterday sent messages to Washington and investors alike, health-care analysts said.
Analysts noted that Merck & Company's announcement Tuesday that growth in profits was slowing would reach Hillary Rodham Clinton and the President while they were in the final five weeks of drafting plans for broad changes in the health care system. The Clintons have singled out drug prices for sharp criticism. 
 "It was a response to the finger-pointing of the Administration by the best company in the industry," said Tony Forstmann Jr., a partner at Forstmann-Leff Associates, a pension management firm, referring to Merck's announcement that earnings this year would be lower than expected. "Their earnings are probably stronger than they are saying," he suggested. "It makes no sense to have strong earnings now with the attacks from Washington."
Barbara Ryan, a securities analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons, said: "Portfolio managers view drugs as no longer a growth industry. Price-earnings multiples are down. Washington is all over them. Why report a good number?"
Analysts said Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., indicated that 1993 profits would grow 11 percent to 13 percent, down from earlier forecasts of 14 percent to 16 percent. They said the company hoped to increase unit sales volume by 8 percent to 12 percent. However, Merck said that the dollar's strength overseas could subtract 3 percentage points from sales growth in 1993. Sales last year were $9.66 billion.
But the political message may be just a side issue to fundamental changes in an industry that had been an investors' favorite until early last year.
Merck stock dropped to $32.75 yesterday, a two-year low, before recovering to close at $34.875, down $2.125 for the day in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company said it was buying back some of its 1.15 billion shares, partly as a calming measure for the markets.
 
Other Stocks Also Fall
 Stock prices of other large drug companies also declined. Pfizer Inc. dropped $2.125, to $57.50;; Johnson & Johnson fell $1.125, to $39.50, and Bristol-Myers Squibb was down 12.5 cents, to $58.
Analysts said the lowered earnings expectations announced by Merck and other drug companies were an attempt to steer the Clintons away from including drug price controls in the health-care plan. Dr. P. Roy Vagelos, Merck's chairman, made that clear on Tuesday, when he said the drug market "certainly does not need price controls at this time."
But Susan Thrasher, a health-care analyst at Chancellor Capital Management, which manages $25 billion for pension plans, insurance companies and foundations, said economic realities outweighed the politics.
"What is hitting the pharmaceutical industry is not Hillary or Washington or Clinton," she said. "It's the changing fundamentals inside the industry."
Ms. Thrasher cited rising competition from me-too drugs -- which might be five or six similar-acting cardiovascular pills from different manufacturers, for example -- as well as low-priced generic versions; a dry period in the research pipeline for most companies, and a growing sense that there is a buyer's market in health care.
"The companies are losing control of what their top line looks like," she said, referring to sales dollars. As for profits, "they have to adjust the rest of the cost structure to keep control of the bottom line."
 
Job Cuts at Merck
 On that score, Merck said it would cut 1,000 jobs, or about 3 percent of its work force. That might be just the beginning. Viren Mehta, at Mehta & Isaly Worldwide Pharmaceutical Research, said Merck might shrink by 3,000 more jobs by 1996.
In a slimming gesture of their own, Dr. Vagelos and his senior executives will take a 10 percent pay cut, and middle managers will give up 5 percent, the company told analysts Tuesday.
Elsewhere in the industry, Bristol-Myers Squibb has announced a cut of 2,250 jobs, and Syntex, Ciba-Geigy and Searle have also announced layoffs. In view of national concern about joblessness, "the cut in employment is not something Clinton would like to see," Mr. Forstmann, of Forstmann-Leff, suggested.
Drug company jobs grew 36 percent between 1980 and 1991, to 297,000, while all manufacturing jobs declined 6 percent, according to the Labor Department.
Ms. Thrasher at Chancellor said most drug company job cuts had been in management and production.

HEADLINE: Report Notes Urban Woes In New York

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
After a decade of economic turmoil, the cities of New York State have emerged in worse condition than those elsewhere in the nation, but New York City and its Westchester County neighbors have in many ways fared better than their upstate counterparts, according to a report by Moody's Investors Service.
More than ever, the Moody's researchers found, the economic landscape of New York is divided between two regions, the densely populated south and the industrial north. For mayors, legislators and other officials, the findings could add to longstanding competition for school aid and other government support. 
 "All cities in New York are under economic strain, but when you look upstate and downstate, the causes are very different," said Michael Johnston, a Moody's vice president and one of the authors of the report. It analyzed the condition of the state's 15 largest cities.
 
Consideration of Need
 For state officials, "This report underscores the fact that we have to consider need when we administer programs to upstate and downstate communities," said Allan Sullivan, executive deputy commissioner of the New York State Department of Economic Development.
"There has always been competition for funds but it has too often been a contest of political clout instead of differing economic conditions in the state," he said.
The Moody's report said new influences, including a wave of immigration downstate, a loss of population in upstate cities and the increasingly high cost of living in the south, are reshaping the state's economic landscape. More familiar trends, including the loss of manufacturing jobs and the flight of affluent city dwellers to the suburbs, are also having an impact, it said.
Moody's, one of the nation's largest credit rating agencies, regularly examines the finances of cities, counties and states. Its ratings are critical to financial markets, which establish how much interest government agencies must pay to borrow money.
"New York cities are generally rated lower than the national average," the report said. Moody's has given ratings of A1 or better, its highest category, to only 9, or 15 percent, of 58 cities in New York, compared with 38 percent of all United States cities.
New York City, with a rating of Baa1, has a lower fiscal grade than most other major cities. In contrast, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles and Miami are all rated by Moody's at A or better.
Mr. Johnston said the poor showing for cities in New York State resulted largely from the decline of the state's manufacturing economy.
The problems are not unique to New York, however. And while Moody's said its report yesterday was the first to compare municipal economies within a large industrialized state, similar forces may be at work in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Michigan and other states anchored by large cities and struggling under the weight of a recession and lost manufacturing jobs.
"For all the problems cities like New York seem to have, you just have to take a look at upstate New York and we don't seem so bad," said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist of Chemical Bank in New York City, who said Moody's findings "square with reality."
 
Long-Term Factors
 Although much of Moody's research focuses on the fiscal policies of cities -- how much they borrow, collect in taxes and keep on reserve -- its report yesterday focused more broadly on population shifts, long-term economic changes and other factors beyond the direct control of municipal officials.
It said the state's largest cities continued in the 1980's, as they had since the 1950's, to lose their dominance as population centers. The cities had 49 percent of the state's residents in 1990, it said, down sharply from 67 percent in 1950.
But while the losses were partly reversed during the 1980's in New York City and four large municipalities in Westchester County, the 10 largest upstate cities continued to shrink, mainly because of the flight of affluent residents to the suburbs and more distant towns.
In 1990, the report said the 10 cities had 1.2 million residents, down by 6 percent from 1980. The upstate cities are Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Albany, Utica, Schenectady, Niagara Falls, Troy, Binghamton and Rome.
The population of the downstate cities -- New York, Yonkers, White Plains, New Rochelle and Mount Vernon -- grew by 300,000, or 3 percent, during the 1980's, the report said.
It ascribed the reversal to the huge waves of foreign immigration, confined largely to the downstate urban centers. In contrast to most of the upstate cities, where the percentage of foreign-born residents declined in the 1980's, the numbers of immigrants grew sharply in each downstate city, accounting for 23 percent of their residents in 1990, compared with 18 percent in 1980.
Mr. Johnston said the rising population of immigrants raised new questions about the economic health of the downstate cities. While population growth seemed certain to be strengthening the tax bases of the cities, "it remains unclear how much new demand it will create for social services," he said.
In another mixed measure of economic health, the income levels, housing costs and overall cost of living in the downstate cities, which has always been higher than in upstate, grew even more rapidly in the 1980's, adding to a wide gap between the regions.
 
Home Prices Soared
 From 1980 to 1990, the report found that median family incomes in the five downstate cities jumped 104 percent, to $46,250, while the median price of a home soared 252 percent to $250,000. The increases exceeded those elsewhere in the nation, and sharply outpaced those in the upstate cities.
The report said the median income in the upstate cities rose 69 percent in the 1980's, to $31,666, and the median price of a home rose 125 percent, to $71,428.
Moody's said the upstate cities ended the 1980's with a far greater reliance on manufacturing. "In upstate New York," it said, "manufacturing is still undergoing a long-term decline."
Among the upstate cities, it found that 26 percent of the workers in Rochester were employed in manufacturing. The figure was 23 percent in Niagara Falls, 19 percent in Binghamton and 16 percent in Buffalo.
By contrast, less than 15 percent of the work force in each downstate city was employed in manufacturing. In New York City, it said, manufacturers employed 12 percent of the work force in 1990.

HEADLINE: Perot Wants A Trial Run Of Trade Pact

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24

 BODY:
Ross Perot, who spoke out strongly against the North American Free Trade Agreement during the Presidential campaign, told a House committee today that the accord should be tried only on an experimental basis because of the big gap in wages between the United States and Mexico.
During a hearing that Administration and other supporters of the agreement had looked to with considerable alarm, Mr. Perot recited a litany of criticisms, emphasizing that American workers could not compete with Mexican workers earning less than $1 an hour. 
 But he stopped short of urging Congress to reject the pact, and told the House Small Business Committee that a group of intelligent people could draft an agreement protecting American workers in 30 days.
Mr. Perot did not make clear whether this would require an entirely new accord or whether it could be accomplished through the side agreement on labor issues now being negotiated by the Clinton Administration. He said he did not know what the details might be in an agreement protecting American workers. "That would take a lot of study, which I have not done," he said.
 
Pilot Program Advocated
 Mr. Perot repeatedly asked that a pilot program for the trade accord be put into effect, but had no specifics on how such a program might be designed. The nations subscribing to the pact, he said, should "have a clear understanding that either nation may decide to cancel this agreement, if in that nation's judgment, the pilot program is not successful."
During the campaign, the Texas businessman had criticized the agreement in strong and often-colorful terms, warning in a debate in October of "a giant sucking sound of jobs being pulled out of this country." But in the same debate, he did not rule out an eventual agreement with Mexico, saying, "We've got to proceed very carefully on that."
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, pointed out in a interview tonight that the accord allowed any of its members -- Canada, Mexico and the United States -- to withdraw at any time with six months' warning. He said that labor costs were a small portion of overall manufacturing costs, suggesting that Mr. Perot may have exaggerated potential job losses.
Kay R. Whitmore, chairman and chief executive of the Eastman Kodak Company, said in a telephone interview arranged by a business coalition that supports the agreement that he could not envision how it might be tried on a pilot basis, as Mr. Perot suggested.
"I don't know what a pilot program would be," he said. "I don't think you can pilot a trade agreement. You either do it or you don't do it."
Mr. Perot's arrival on Capitol Hill had caused worry among supporters of the agreement -- including Clinton Administration officials, some members of Congress and business lobbyists. With his wealth and private political organization, he could prove to be a significant ally to labor and environmental groups opposing the accord, lawmakers said in interviews earlier this week.
The White House responded by arranging for Mr. Kantor to call reporters after the hearing to rebut Mr. Perot's arguments. In addition, nearly a dozen Congressional supporters of the agreement held a news conference to defend the agreement.
 
Perot Musters Own Backers
 The business coalition, called U.S.A.-Nafta Inc., consists of 1,100 companies and trade associations that favor the pact. It offered reporters a choice of executives to be interviewed on the potential benefits of the accord for the American economy.
Earlier, Mr. Perot showed up at the House hearing with a small crowd of his supporters, who took turns waiting in the hallway and quietly sitting in the last two rows of the committee room. During an intermission, a swarm of young men and women took turns asking Mr. Perot for his autograph and hugging him while their friends took pictures.
Richard Angelica, a teacher from Steubenville, Ohio, said he was a supporter of United We Stand America, Mr. Perot's political group. He had already been visiting Washington when the group notified him that Mr. Perot would testify on the trade pact, which Mr. Angelica also opposes. "I think it's a poor idea -- we'll lose jobs," he said.
Mr. Perot, in a brief interview during the intermission, was unclear whether he would produce a television commercial attacking the trade pact, as some aides have suggested. "I haven't thought about it -- let's assume everybody wants us to do it, then I probably will," he said.
Later, he was asked whether Congressional rejection of the agreement would risk political instability in Mexico. "I hope there is no instability," he replied. "But we can't make a bad deal just because there's a threat."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices of Treasury Securities Drop

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Treasury prices declined yesterday as traders and investors continued to buy and sell in alternating waves that are keeping prices and yields in a tight trading range.
The price of the 30-year bond, which had gained 14/32 Monday and Tuesday, was off 22/32 yesterday to yield 6.82 percent, up from 6.76 percent Tuesday. The price of the 10-year note, which was up 11/32 Monday and Tuesday, was off 14/32 yesterday, to yield 5.96 percent, up from 5.90 percent. 
 After two weeks of trading since the yields on Treasury bonds and notes fell to the lowest point in many years, yields ended yesterday fairly close to the middle of their recent range, which for the 30-year bond is a 6.72 percent low to a 6.89 percent high.
Traders said that the Treasury auction of $15.25 billion of two-year Treasury notes went well, with the notes sold at a single yield of 3.92 percent.
 
But Market Drops
 But the market declined in the afternoon despite the success of the auction, which made it difficult to explain why trading moved as it did.
"Sometimes we just have to acknowledge that the market is in a trading range," said Donald fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities Inc. "The market is waiting for the next conclusive sign on the real economy or inflation," he added. The next such report will be the employment report for March, which will be issued a week from tomorrow.
One explanation for yesterday's decline, especially in three- and five-year notes, is that the new-two year note appeared to be a better bargain than the slightly longer maturities, so traders sold them and used the cash to buy two-year notes.
John Costas, managing director of government trading and sales at the First Boston Corporation, referring to this kind of dealer selling and switching, said, "the arbitrage bid made it into a very good auction." But, he added, it was not the kind of trading that would drive prices higher and yields lower.
 
Durable Goods Up
 There was also news that would normally send prices lower and yields higher. In the morning, the Government reported that orders for durable goods rose 2.2 percent in February, when the forecast was for a small decline. Prices of bonds and notes declined on the report but then recovered.
Later in the morning, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, generated a flurry of headlines, telling the Senate Finance Committee that the deficit would be a problem in the future if more reductions were not made after the five years covered by the Clinton economic plan. He said that he had not directly endorsed the Clinton economic program over other plans to cut the deficit, although he was encouraged by Congress's efforts to approve it.
While such comments about the possible inadequacy of the Clinton program seem unfriendly for the bond market, several traders said that they did not appear to have much impact yesterday. But that does not mean that the comments cannot eventually affect the market as traders and investors consider what Mr. Greenspan said over the next several days.
It may take some time to try to figure out what message Mr. Greenspan might have been sending to traders and investors. He said yesterday that job growth was increasing but added that it was not at a pace that would worry him.
Such a remark can be interpreted in at least two ways: One is that the economy is growing faster, which might disturb some bond traders because that could mean inflation could increase this year above the 3 percent of 1992. This could mean that the Fed would increase short-term interest rates and that bond yields could rise.
But it could also mean that the Fed chairman would be comfortable with even a little faster economic growth and still not have to worry about inflation. This interpretation would make some think that short-term interest rates will not rise soon.
 
Auction Set Today
 The Treasury will auction $11 billion of five-year notes today. In late trading in the when-issued market yesterday, the yield on the five-year note had jumped to 5.20 percent from 5.13 percent the day before. If the yield holds at this level, it could increase the auction demand.
The yield on the two-year note, which was auctioned at 3.92 percent, had inched up to 3.93 percent by late in the day.
Following are the results of the two-year note auction:
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
High Yield . . . 3.92%

HEADLINE: Cray Withdraws Complaint

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 24

 BODY:
Cray Research, the American supercomputer maker, has withdrawn a complaint over a public research institute's decision to buy a competing Japanese-made computer, a high official of the company's Japanese division said today.
Yoshikazu Hori, president of Cray Research Japan, said officials decided they would not gain anything by pursuing the complaint. "We withdrew it," he said, "but it's absolutely not the case that we are satisfied." 
 Cray filed the complaint with the Japanese Government last July over the decision by the National Institute for Fusion Science to buy an SX-3 supercomputer from the NEC Corporation, a Japanese producer. Cray said its C90 computer was superior and had lost business because of a rating system that awarded more points to performance criteria where NEC was strong.
A Government review board rejected the complaint in October, saying it found no problems with the selection process.
Japan is now considering an economic-stimulus package that reportedly includes purchases of as many as 20 supercomputers. "We'd like to receive one-third of those orders," Mr. Hori said.
Under an agreement with the United States, Japan pledged that purchases by public institutions would be open, selection standards clearly defined, and competing computers thoroughly evaluated.

Money Market Fund Yields Are Mixed in Latest Period

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
The average yields on tax-exempt and taxable money market funds were mixed in the latest week, according to the most recent survey by IBC's Money Fund Report.
Tax-exempt yields were up sharply in the week ended Tuesday for the second consecutive reporting period, as the supply of new municipal issues continued to outpace the demand. With so much new debt available, yields are moving higher to attract buyers. 
 The assets of tax-exempt funds declined by $546 million, to $102.2 billion, but the outflow was not considered unusual, according to analysts at the money market publication.
The average number of days to maturity of securities held in tax-exempt fund portfolios was down two days, to 52.
According to the IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Average, the seven-day compounded yield for tax-exempt funds rose 11 basis points, to 1.92 percent, with the average seven-day simple yield up 10 basis points, to 1.90 percent. Over 30 days, the average compounded yield was 1.83 percent, and the simple 30-day average yield was 1.82 percent. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
Ignoring state and local taxes, the taxable bond equivalent yield of the average seven-day compounded yield is about 2.67 percent for investors in the 28 percent tax bracket and about 2.78 percent for those in the 31 percent bracket.
Among tax-exempt funds with assets greater than $100 million, the Money Fund Report said, the Dreyfus Basic Municipal Money Market fund outperformed all other funds in its group for the third consecutive week, posting a yield of 2.68 percent. The yield was 13 basis points higher than the previous week.
 
Taxable Funds
 The assets of taxable money market funds rose $4.4 billion in the week ended yesterday, to $488.9 billion. Of the increase, the assets of institutional funds gained $4.9 billion, to $171.6 billion, and those of the retail funds declined $500 million, to $317.3 billion.
Analysts said the average days left to maturity remained at 60. In light of that lengthy period, analysts at the Money Fund Report said managers were maintaining a position that rates would continue lower.
The average seven-day yield of taxable funds fell a basis point, to 2.68 percent, and the seven-day simple yield also fell a basis point, to 2.65 percent.
Dreyfus Basic Money Market fund had the highest return among general-purpose taxable money funds, with a yield of 3.49 percent, the same figure posted by Olde Premium Plus Money Market Series in the previous week.
By comparison, banks are offering an average of 2.63 percent on their money market products, down a basis point from the previous week.

Dollar Jumps Against Yen On Profit Taking by Traders

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar soared against the Japanese yen yesterday as traders rushed to take profits from the yen's all-time high one day earlier.
The United States currency was broadly higher Against European currencies. The German mark fell against the dollar after a Bundesbank announcement that kept hope alive for a significant reduction in high German interest rates. 
 Gold prices rose in New York after falling overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery closed at $332.50 an ounce, up 60 cents. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid of $332.20 an ounce, up 60 cents from late Tuesday.
The dollar, quoted at a postwar low of 115.10 yen early Tuesday, recovered to 115.95 yen by late afternoon and jumped nearly 2 more yen by late yesterday in New York.
 
Japanese Economy Cited
 Dealers said the market was uncomfortable with the low levels, given the weak state of the Japanese economy. In addition, there was less speculation among traders that industrialized nations favor a stronger yen as a way to reduce Japan's trade surplus with its major trading partners.
The dollar also benefited from the German Bundesbank's announcement early yesterday that a key short-term market rate had not climbed as a result of its weekly repurchase operation. Some traders had expected a slight rise.
The mark rose in European trading but fell in New York.
In late Europe trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6279 marks, down from 1.6312 marks. In New York, the dollar rose to 1.6375 marks, from 1.6303 marks late Tuesday.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 115.93 yen, up 0.60 yen from Tuesday's record low close there. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 116.85 yen. By 4 P.M. in New York, the dollar was quoted at 117.65 yen, up from 115.95 yen late Tuesday.
The British pound sank to $1.4825 in London, from $1.4840 late Tuesday. In New York, the pound was trading at $1.4770 late yesterday, down from $1.4840.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Tuesday, included: 1.5155 Swiss francs, up from 1.5105; 5.5685 French francs, up from 5.5475; 1,596.00 Italian lire, up from 1,579.00, and $1.2430 (Canadian), down from $1.2473 (Canadian).
Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Tuesday, included: 1.5085 Swiss francs, down from 1.5090; 5.5425 French francs, down from 5.5530; 1.8310 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8323; 1,592.50 Italian lire, up from 1,587.00, and $1.2445 (Canadian), down from $1.2481 (Canadian).

Vehicle Sales Get a Boost From Trucks

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 24

 BODY:
Brisk sales of light trucks helped to push up overall sales of domestically built vehicles by 10.7 percent in mid-March, the nation's auto makers said today, although car sales rose only slightly from the sluggish level of a year earlier.
Car sales were 170,329 for the March 11-20 period, up 1.6 percent over the period a year earlier. But sales of light trucks -- which include mini-vans, sport-utility vehicles and pickups -- rose 24.6 percent, to 136,078. Total sales of vehicles built in North America, which are considered domestic vehicles for reporting purposes, were 306,407. 
 The seasonally adjusted annual rate of car sales for the period was 6 million, down from 6.5 million in early March but up from 5.8 million a year earlier.
 
Stuck at Same Level
 Automotive analysts have been watching sales creep higher in tandem with the economic recovery. But for the last three months, "there's been some concern that sales are stuck in first gear," said Jean-Claude Gruet, automotive analyst for UBS Securities Inc. in New York. "We're waiting for a move up to the next plateau."
He said that if car sales did not soon reach a 6.7 million annual rate on a sustained basis, auto makers would have to consider trimming second-quarter production, which would trickle through the economy and cause further weakness.
Dealers, too, have noticed that sales have not advanced consistently. "They're spotty; strong one day, slow the next," said Kevin Hall, sales manager of Foley Chrysler-Plymouth in Quincy, Mass. Regarding the strength of light-truck sales, Mr. Hall said Chrysler's mini-vans "are the best property I have."
 
G.M. Car Brands All Suffer
 The General Motors Corporation, the nation's leading producer, continued to show weakness in cars and strength in light trucks. G.M.'s car sales were 73,247 for the period, down 6 percent from a year earlier. Every G.M. car brand posted a year-to-year decline, including Saturn, which had previously been improving consistently. G.M.'s full-size pickups and Suburban utility vehicle were the mainstays of the auto maker's truck business, which gained 29.5 percent, with sales of 49,586.
The Ford Motor Company posted car sales of 49,538, a gain of 6.4 percent, and light-truck sales of 43,415, a gain of 13.1 percent. All of Ford's car lines except the Tempo and Mustang improved; the two aged models will soon be replaced.
Ward's Automotive Reports, a trade publication, estimated that the Chrysler Corporation posted car sales of 20,600, up 43.5 percent, and light-truck sales of 33,800, up 25.8 percent, in mid-March. Chrysler reports its sales only once a month.
The Toyota Motor Corporation sold 9,907 cars, up 4.9 percent, and 3,222 light trucks, a more than threefold increase. The Honda Motor Company sold 8,059 cars, down 25.5 percent. The Nissan Motor Company sold 4,912 cars, more than double the total a year earlier, and 3,970 light trucks, up 35.1 percent.

HEADLINE: A Philosophy Built It; Solar Logic Keeps It Warm

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: ORFORDVILLE, N.H.

 BODY:
It was the quintessential New Hampshire winter day: bright sun, snow underfoot as crisp as corn flakes and temperature around zero, cold enough to make the teeth ache. But that was outside.
Inside, Jonathan Sands waved a desktop thermometer with a gesture that suggested either Merlin with a wand or Perry Mason with the crucial piece of evidence. The thermometer said 75 degrees, although his 1,900-square-foot house has no boiler or furnace. It does have a wood stove, but the fire had gone out almost 12 hours earlier. 
 The house, in which Mr. Sands and his wife, Deborah Merrill-Sands, and their son, Sam, 4 1/2, are completing their second winter, is heated mostly by the sun, and by three cords of wood a season -- which would make a pile about 7 feet wide, 7 feet long and 8 feet high -- at a cost of less than $300.
Since they designed the house themselves and Mr. Sands did much of the labor himself, seeing that it all works is more than a matter of comfort; it is also a confirmation of skill and philosophy.
Mr. Sands's work in areas related to natural resources has taken him around the world (he once ran a small company in Bermuda that installed solar heaters for swimming pools); Ms. Merrill-Sands is a consultant to the World Bank and the Ford Foundation on agricultural issues. When they decided to build a house in New Hampshire, a few miles from where he grew up, he was determined to practice what he preached with a house that would rely as heavily as possible on "renewable" resources like sun and wood.
Heating here, about 20 miles up the Connecticut River from Hanover, N.H., requires about 50 percent more fuel to maintain a given temperature over the course of a winter than an identical house in New York City. For that reason almost everything built here is designed to take advantage of the sun and to seal out the cold. And Mr. Sands, who studied solar engineering at Hampshire College, in Amherst, Mass., agricultural engineering at Cornell and resource dynamics at the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth, said, "It comes down to philosophy."
"It's deciding not to use more than your share," he said.
That philosophy also helped the Sandses pick the spot on their 70 acres to build when they returned from The Hague, where both had worked for the International Service for National Agricultural Research. There were other south-facing slopes -- the best spot for solar heating -- but this one was on a rocky ledge with thin top soil that was unproductive as meadow or forest land. They named the house Wolf Pine Ledge, for the scraggly pine that grows there.
Nothing in its appearance screams that it is a solar house. With a spacious main room and a cathedral ceiling, the house feels not snug, but open. This is possible because of a frame of hemlock from a local company, Outback Post and Beam.
The house relies mostly on techniques that have been proven elsewhere to varying degrees. But more so than most other houses, this one goes to extreme lengths to ease the heating burden. In most new houses here, that means thinking about the sun; for the Sands family, it means relying on it.
Life inside is comfortable but sometimes complicated. In a house with a conventional heating system, the residents simply set the thermostat; but here, maintaining the right temperature requires planning. In the beginning, Mr. Sands built fires on cloudy mornings, and if the sun came out later in the day, they had to open the windows or sweat. "You can't just plug it in and use it, like a toaster oven," Mr. Sands said of his house. He regularly consults weather forecasts on Compuserve, the computer bulletin board, before deciding how big a fire to build.
But if the family goes away for a weekend or a week, there is no heating system to fail; the sun and the incidental sources of heat, like the refrigerator, will keep the temperature in the upper 50's.
Houses like this one are not rare, although the Census Bureau found too few in 1990 to measure as a separate category. The Passive Solar Industries Council of Washington, a trade association of building materials manufacturers, architects and others, believes that half a million American houses are heated primarily by the sun, half of them built in the last 10 years. The American Solar Energy Society, of Boulder, Colo., puts the number far lower, at about 100,000.
The problem is also in the definition of a solar house, particularly of passive solar heat, which relies on the sun coming through windows, unlike the much less common "active" systems that use rooftop solar collectors.
The real test of whether a house really relies on the sun is whether it has an oil- or gas-fired furnace as a backup. Mr. Sands has considered adding a coil to his propane-fired water heater that would circulate hot water as a backup heat source. But the house is doing well without it.
Solar power is not for everybody. When building from scratch, it's possible to add big heating improvements at low cost, but few people start from scratch. And the builder has to be interested in more than just plain economics.
For example, Northeast Utilities, which generates much of the electricity used in the area, sells plans for solar houses that cut the heating requirement nearly in half. It estimates that a 2,100-square-foot Victorian built to comply with the local building code would cost $203,200, or $212,600 for a solar house, an increase of less than 5 percent. In New Hampshire, the solar version would save about 385 gallons of oil a year. At current oil prices, about 90 cents a gallon, that would be $346.50, not quite enough to pay the interest on the $9,000 additional construction expense. But someone enthusiastic about solar houses could reasonably assume that the oil price will rise slightly, because of President Clinton's proposed energy tax, and that minimizing oil use also makes environmental sense.
There are also intangible benefits, like enjoying the view of the grosbeaks and the blue jays at the bird feeder in silence, without the distraction of a whirring, clicking, whooshing heating system.
Mr. Sands, having saved much on labor, said his house cost about $80,000. How much of that is extra for making it solar he couldn't say, because he has never figured the cost of the house any other way.
The calculation is always muddied by the question of where to draw the line. An extra window, for example, may be for solar heating but may also be a nice touch in a house set in the evergreen hills. And a new house in this climate would be heavily insulated no matter how it was heated.
Here is how the Sands house works:
First, it is nearly completely airtight. In fact, when the clothes dryer runs, pushing exhaust air out of the house, the front door of the house swings open if not latched.
Second, the house is miserly with its openings to the outside. It has exhaust fans in each of the two bathrooms and in the kitchen area of the living-dining-cooking room. But the air does not go straight outdoors; it runs through ducts to the basement, where outside air is also drawn in.
The air to be exhausted is run through hundreds of tiny passages in the aluminum honeycomb of a heat exchanger, while the outside air runs through adjacent passages, in the opposite directions. Thus the outgoing air gives up most of its heat to the incoming air; if the temperature is 72 degrees indoors and 32 outdoors, the outside air will be warmed to 64 degrees by the time it enters the house, and the air being exhausted will be cooled to 40 degrees. The $800 heat exchanger, built by Newtech Energy Systems of Ontario, Canada, runs continuously on a 100-watt fan. The result is that the house, while airtight, is continuously vented.
(Mr. Sands is currently unemployed, but is an ambitious tinkerer. He is working on a mechanism to recover some of the heat from the water that goes down the drains and use it to heat water from the well.)
Third, the house was configured with the sun in mind. About 60 percent of the south-facing area is glass, while the north side has only a few small windows. In fact, the "south" side isn't quite facing south; it is angled 17 degrees to the east. ("Well, 15 to 19 degrees," admitted Mr. Sands, who laid out the foundation himself.) This is to let the house pick up a little more sun at daybreak, when the day is coldest, and a little less in late afternoon. In summer, the angle helps reduce the peak temperature of the house, although cooling is not a major challenge in this climate. Angling a dwelling this way has been understood for thousands of years, but ignored in the last 50 years of tract developments, whose builders relied on cheap fuel and didn't think much about the environment.
But energy streaming through the spacious vertical windows, called clerestory windows, is not enough if the sun does not shine around the clock. And when the sun is shining through all those windows, without something besides white pine floors acting as a thermal mass to absorb the heat by day, the house would get too hot during the day and would not save energy for use at night.
"Once the glass gets over 7 percent of the wall area, you're looking at the need for additional thermal mass," said Helen C. English, the executive director of the Passive Solar Industries Council.
Mr. Sands's solution was to put a concrete slab in the south side of his wood-frame house, covering 164 square feet of the living-dining area and abutting the white pine floor, at a cost of about $1 a square foot. The concrete is five inches thick, covered with an inch and a quarter of blue soapstone tile quarried from the same Virginia hills as the stone for the stove. During the day, the slab is heated by the sun, and at night it gives the heat back.
For extra heat, there is the stove, manufactured by the Tulikivi Group of North America, a branch of a Finnish company based in West Lebanon, N.H. Most wood stoves are metal and are designed to burn continuously, starving the fire for oxygen to keep it running. The Tulikivi burns with a roar for an hour or two, heating up its 8,000-pound mass until it is hot to the touch. It gives off the heat over many hours. Usually this works well, although if the stove has been left unused for days, warming it can take hours.
"Our biggest cost that no sane person would have done was the stove," Mr. Sands said. It was $9,000; a conventional stove is less than $1,000.
Mr. Sands describes his house as "passive solar." But a purist might quibble, because the house, with a peaked roof 26 feet off the living room floor, has a mechanical system for moving heat around -- a return vent at the top driven by a small electric fan. The fan draws air down through a duct, through the concrete slab and back into the room. (In summer, it pushes air out of the house.)
For the Sandses, there are still unfinished details. Many houses this far north, solar or not, use quilted window shades to hold in heat at night. But the Sands like the uncluttered look of the white pine windowframes, and they are still looking for window treatments that will blend in.
And then there are hanging questions, like the four feet of heavy-duty electric cable dangling from the peak of the ceiling.
"The client really wanted a fan there and the contractor really didn't want to put one in," he said. Mr. Sands was his own contractor; the "client" is his wife.
The problem, he said, was that the decorative ceiling fan might look nice, but it would be so high off the floor that it would not circulate the air to the area at the bottom where the family actually lives; all it would do is mix the air in the top 20 feet or so, thus reducing the efficiency of the return vent at the roof's peak.
He said he would probably cut the cable and install a junction box in case he had a need later for electric power on the ceiling; the client, he predicted, would eventually agree.
 
 
 
BEFORE YOU PICK UP THAT HAMMER . . .

IF you are building a house or renovating an old one, your local electric utility probably wants to talk to you.
Northeast Utilities (P.O. Box 270, Hartford 06141), which serves large parts of Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, sells a book, "Operation Solar," for $2 .
Among other free services, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (851 Howard Street, San Francisco 94103) will put house models on a three-axis table adjusted for latitude, month and hour. The table rotates under a spotlight to simulate the motion of the sun, and video cameras inside and outside the model record sun and shadow pattern.
The Passive Solar Industries Council sells a $50 book on design strategies, customized for local climate and construction practices: 1511 K Street NW, Washington 20005.

HEADLINE: Russia's Unnoticed Revolution

 BODY:
Ten million new capitalists. No, they're not Koreans, Americans or Western Europeans. They're Russian. In a matter of months, tens of thousands of Mom and Pop shops and hundreds of large enterprises have been privatized -- turned over to workers, managers and outside investors, some foreign. By the end of April, when the number may reach 10 million, Russia will be well launched on an astonishingly quick traverse from Socialism to capitalism.
While the West fixates on Russia's political turmoil that threatens to bury Boris Yeltsin's reform Government, an economic revolution goes on largely unnoticed. Privatization hasn't always been pretty or fair. But it has been popular. It's been very, very quick. And, for Mr. Yeltsin, quick counts for a lot. When Russians go to the polls next month, he's counting on the new capitalists to back his pro-market reforms. 
 Privatization may be more than Mr. Yeltsin's ticket to political victory. It also creates an opening for Western help. Previous Western efforts to spur reform -- for example, with debt relief and funds to stabilize the ruble -- fell apart when Moscow was unable to provide assurances that it could manage economic policy so that the Western money wouldn't be wasted. Privatization is different. It's happening. All Mr. Clinton and other Western leaders need to do is push it along.
Mr. Yeltsin recognized that capitalism couldn't work without capitalists. Yet he couldn't sell state-owned factories because, without markets, no one could know their value and few Russians had any savings.
Faced with the same dilemma, the Solidarity-led Government in Poland created what first seemed a textbook-perfect plan. The plan would give state-owned enterprises to a few large mutual funds. Ownership of the funds, in turn, would be turned over to Polish citizens. The idea was to privatize companies but keep ownership concentrated so the owners would be able to keep the managers in check.
The plan's features added up to elegant economics, but dreadful politics. It failed to involve ordinary citizens. Three years later, the plan remains just that -- a plan, bottled up in Parliament.
Mr. Yeltsin chose a different tack. Borrowing from the Czechoslovaks, he involved citizens from the start. The plan typically turns half a company's shares over to its workers and managers -- in an attempt to buy their allegiance. Most of the company's other shares are put up for auction; ordinary citizens bid for shares with vouchers provided free by the Government.
Nearly every Russian citizen is participating; few have sold their vouchers for cash, which they're entitled to do, rather than holding them to buy shares.
But the plan could backfire, having been built more for speed than care. By spreading ownership thinly across the population, it might produce companies that are ungovernable. Businesses owned by millions will be controlled by no one, permitting managers to run riot with shareholders' assets. Privatization could unravel if the Yeltsin Government falls or if hyperinflation erupts. And as yet, participation is uneven across regions.
The threats are severe, but the West could make a difference. Prof. Andrei Shleifer of Harvard, an adviser to the Russian privatization minister, suggests two important props: Western seed money to encourage foreign companies to forge partnerships with Russian ones; and Western guarantees against political confiscation for foreign investors.
The political landscape in Russia looks bleak these days. With inflation escalating and production falling, the economic landscape doesn't look much better. But a crucial component of Mr. Yeltsin's reformist vision, privatization, is providing grounds for hope.

A Virgin No More

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Now we know why President Clinton resisted for two months the serious test of a formal news conference: the traditional format reveals his weaknesses.
He and his staff are patting each other on the back for not having made a gaffe and for anticipating the likely questions. Here is a more astringent view of Mr. Clinton's first foray into communications reality -- answering sustained professional questioning from grown-ups. 
 1. Ease up on the Staging. Clinton adopted the Reagan Grand Entrance, the long red-carpet walk created by Michael Deaver to add royal pomp to the proceedings and strike awe in the viewers. Its pomposity is wholly out of character for Bill Clinton; news conferences are Presidential business, not state ceremony.
And what's with the ferns? Sprouting up around the lectern were a half-dozen potted plants, separating the speaker from the audience by presenting the President as a flowering fount of knowledge. Al Gore's greenery influence is getting out of hand.
2. Cut the opening commercial. He began by reading (too fast and without feeling) a statement about supporting reform in Russia, then vitiated its effect with a long, dull pitch for his economic program. This mishmash was presumably intended to show a domestic President unconsumed by foreign affairs; instead, it showed him self-conscious about appearing to be.
Advice: Unless there is big news to break, go directly to questions.
3. Focus on an unambiguous lead story and stick to it. The President's purpose here was to show support for the embattled Boris Yeltsin. But by laying out America's "three interests . . . with or without President Yeltsin in authority," he diluted that support. Later he started to speak strongly for the Russian leader, but veered off on the last word: "Boris Yeltsin is the elected President of Russia, and he has shown a great deal of courage in sticking up for democracy and civil liberties and market reforms, and I'm going to support that." Not him, but that.
Obviously, Henry Kissinger's ambiguities got to Clinton, who is letting himself be torn between avoiding a charge of "Who lost Yeltsin?" and a charge of "Who stayed too long with Yeltsin?" Advice: If his aim is to strengthen the Russian, Clinton should make that decision and stop festooning it with escape hatches. 4. Be prepared for the unwanted tough question. Clinton surely knew he would be asked about gays in the military, but when Andrea Mitchell of NBC -- emerging as the most penetrating and fearless questioner in the White House press corps -- asked about the broader "difficulty with the Pentagon," the President looked as if he had been slapped with a wet fish.
He first fumbled by reaching for the illness of the Defense Secretary as an excuse, then quickly said Les Aspin was "either fully recovered now or on the verge of it." Either Mr. Aspin's absence is an excuse or it's not. Clinton ducked completely the repeated question about the Pentagon's failure to appoint a task force on gay rights, then erred in seeming to advocate non-combat limitations on homosexuals. I cannot believe this was a prepared answer.
5. Take control of the East Room. These sessions are not occasions to look bemused at confusion and to marvel at "self-selection" by shouting reporters. Advice: Point with a straight finger and stop making journalists look foolish by begging for the favor of your attention.
In his Presidential news debut, Clinton came across relaxed but uncertain. Contrast his confident answer about the "forest summit" with his walking-on-eggs responses on the Yeltsin summit. (The press fell short, too: not one question on dying Bosnia.)
Of course foreign affairs is trickier, but confidence can be gained by thinking through and rehearsing answers beforehand. Even a refusal to speculate about "hypotheticals" can be presented crisply; F.D.R. neatly turned aside what he called "iffy questions." It takes practice.
Regular news conferences impose discipline on an Administration, which must submit suggested answers to the White House beforehand; that forces decisions. The anticipated grilling also demands a President do his homework on every governmental subject. Clinton has been playing hooky and it shows.

Wealth Crosses The Pacific

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

DATELINE: ZHONGSHAN CITY, China

 BODY:
Boris Yeltsin's struggle for political survival, which rivets Europe and America, stirs mostly rhetorical yawns from East Asian leaders gathered here in southern China for a conference. To these government officials, business moguls and scholars, Russia is a long-term wreck about which outsiders can do little. Whether democratic or authoritarian, it is for them neither a threat nor, more importantly, a market.
What preoccupies East Asians today is not the old strategic mumbo-jumbo, but money. For the first time they are making it hand over fist as a region. And they want more -- as well as a bigger slice of the power salami. 
 The economic might that lodged in Europe during the Renaissance and crossed the Atlantic at the turn of this century is now traversing the Pacific. The pervasive new sense of economic dynamism gives East Asia its first glimmers of regional identity -- as well as self-confidence, optimism, a growing pride, a muscularity.
In the 1980's, in this region stretching from Singapore to Japan, the average gross national product grew more than twice as fast as it did in Europe and America. And that stunning gap will persist.
By 1990, East Asian trade with Western Europe and North America exceeded direct European-American trade. East Asia's savings rate -- 30 percent of G.N.P. -- dwarfs the West's -- 10 percent on average, much less in the U.S. And from savings come new investments.
Here in Guangdong Province, an area mired in poverty 10 short years ago, growth in the 1980's averaged an astounding 20 percent annually. This compares with 7 percent for the rest of China -- not bad either. In 1991, per capita income among Guangdong's population of about 70 million hit $1,230, very small by Western standards but an enormous leap forward in the developing world.
When you disembark from the Hong Kong ferry at Nansha and drive the 40 miles to the resort site of this Asia Society conference, you see scores of factories and high-rise apartments leaping from the mud alongside rice paddies. Thanks mainly to a rich network of overseas Chinese, more construction is under way in Southern China than anywhere else in the world today.
East Asians don't want anything getting in the way of this economic explosion -- not governments, not foreign policies, not protectionism, not American ideals, not America.
With few exceptions, leaders here are the world's most ardent advocates of freer trade. They feel East Asia has the skills to compete, and they want to knock down trade barriers. The U.S. and Japan, two flagging economic powerhouses, are the ones now dragging their heels.
Without exception, the East Asians at this conference worry that Washington will spoil everything by linking politics and economics. Specifically, they fear the U.S. will withdraw most-favored-nation trading status from China to punish Beijing for human rights violations, thereby disrupting regional trade.
"Economic growth is more important than political freedom," a Filipino businessman volunteered. "The Philippines, a former American colony, was the most subject to American idealism, and it's the place with the worst growth in the region. There is democratic gridlock in my country."
The consensus among Asians at the conference was that in their part of the world, government should be "for the people rather than by the people," as one Hong Kong businessman put it. Most argued strongly that authoritarian rule is the surest path to economic growth, and perhaps even eventually to democracy, as in Taiwan and South Korea. To them, Russia embodies the folly of putting the democratic cart before the economic horse.
The group not only questioned American ideology but bridled at American arrogance toward Asians. "Do you want to get even?" I asked. One particularly vehement Singaporean economist looked me in the eye, smiled, and said, "Yes."
But for all their new assertiveness, many Asian leaders here understand full well the political fragility underpinning their economic boom, and how easily booms go bust.
And for all their complaining about America, East Asians remain very much preoccupied by the U.S., still the biggest economic and security factor in their lives. It is a love-hate relationship -- with a little less love and a little more envy. Sensing their ascendancy and America's decline, they now want to redefine that relationship -- and they will.

HEADLINE: Whatever Yeltsin's Fate, Russia Can't Go Back;
Unemployment Crisis

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The fundamental economic issue in the contest between the Yeltsin Government and the Parliament is the choice between inflation and unemployment. The Government is right in its determination to halt accelerating inflation. That requires reining in the state budget deficit, which requires curtailment of the subsidies to wasteful and unprofitable enterprises. 
 But sudden elimination of subsidies will lead to mass unemployment. The Government's program provides for a social safety net, but it has not made a convincing case for having thought through the political and social consequences of unemployment.
The Central Bank, under the control of the Parliament, is right in its determination to prevent mass unemployment. Thus it has authorized the continuous expansion of money and credit to keep the inefficient subsidized enterprises in business. The bank's spokesmen pay lip service to the need for monetary stabilization, but their policies fuel inflation.
Mass unemployment could spell the end of such progress toward democratic market-based reform as the country has made. Even the British Government was forced by popular protest to abandon its very sensible plan to close 31 subsidized coal mines, which would have left 30,000 miners without jobs. Prospective unemployment in Russia ranges from Government estimates of 3.5 million to 6 million to the International Labor Organization estimate of 10 million to 11 million (out of a work force of 75 million). In the best circumstances, it would be difficult for a Russian Government to survive such a calamity.
The most strategic program the West could offer to Russia would help cushion the blow of the mass unemployment inevitable if there is to be sound economic reform. For a model, we can reach back into our own history to the last time massive unemployment threatened our political foundations. The public works programs of the New Deal then carried the country through the hardest times.
"The Perfect Gift for Mr. Yeltsin" (editorial, March 10), proposing United States support of an unemployment insurance plan for Russia, is on the right track. But, like our Great Depression, this is a time when investment in Russia's long-neglected infrastructure could be of strategic importance. Projects like highway and road building, for example, would provide large economic benefits in bringing farm products to urban markets and reducing transport costs. Labor-intensive projects in homebuilding, railbed maintenance, urban amenities and environmental restoration would also be suitable. A program of this sort would fit well with the Clinton Administration's commitment to investment in infrastructure in the United States.
With assistance from the West in providing job support for the unemployed, the Yeltsin Government would have a credible response to the opposition's legitimate concern about mass unemployment.
Russia's future will be shaped overwhelmingly by Russia's own politics and very little by Western well-wishers. But strategically selected help, like a public works program, may help tilt the balance in some small way.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Calls for More Cuts

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24

 BODY:
With Congressional approval nearly clinched for President Clinton's economic plan, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve's chairman, called today for even deeper cuts in the budget deficit, saying he was worried that it would begin rising again late this decade.
Testifying before the Senate Finance Committee, Mr. Greenspan said the deficit would soar again late this decade unless Congress cut more over the five years covered by Mr. Clinton's plan and enacted new cuts after that. 
 Mr. Greenspan had given strong and crucial backing to Mr. Clinton's proposal shortly after it was disclosed in February and today he said he remained encouraged by Congress's efforts to approve it. But he went on to say that the Clinton plan by itself was not enough to remove the structural forces that have caused the Federal debt to balloon over the last decade.
 
Theory on Timing
 "I would argue strenuously that merely reducing" the deficit over the next five years "without addressing the period thereafter is not going to have the type of permanent effects that I think we need," he said.
Some analysts who watch the Fed suggested that Mr. Greenspan always thought the Clinton plan did not cut the deficit enough, but that he did not tell Congress that in February because that would have hurt the chances of Congress's approving the first credible deficit reduction plan in years. What is more, they said, if he had criticized the plan initially, bond markets might not have taken the Clinton plan seriously, and might have pushed long-term interest rates up rather than down.
But today, with the Clinton plan moving steadily through Congress, Mr. Greenspan apparently saw an opportunity to nudge Congress and the President to embrace even more deficit reduction. If they accept his invitation -- and there is no guarantee that they will -- that will no doubt push long-term interest rates down further, analysts say.
 
Worries About Inflation
 Mr. Greenspan said the bond markets were worried by the prospect of sharply higher deficits late this decade and the inflationary pressures these deficits might create. He predicted that long-term rates would fall a good deal further if Congress and the President tackled measures to attack the deficit after 1996.
Unless the issue of the post-1996 deficit problems are successfully addressed, "it will be very difficult to purge the inflation expectations that still exist in the system," he said.
In his prepared remarks, Mr. Greenspan apparently sought to mend fences with conservatives who have lambasted him in recent weeks for praising Mr. Clinton's deficit plan, which relies more on tax increases than spending cuts to reduce the deficit.
Although he said he was speaking in the abstract, rather than commenting on President Clinton's plan, the Fed chairman said that the best way by far to cut budget deficits was through spending cuts rather than tax increases, which he said depress the economy by discouraging investment and entrepreneurship.
"There is no alternative to achieving much slower growth of outlays if deficit control is our objective," he said. "This implies not only the need to make cuts now, but to control the growth of future spending."
But when Senator Bill Bradley, the New Jersey Democrat, asked which was worse, higher taxes or the deficit, Mr. Greenspan said the deficit was the greater evil.
 
Taxation Over Deficits
 "I do not like taxation," Mr. Greenspan said. "I think it's an inhibition to the system. But I like deficits less because I think they are a far more corrosive force."
He said he would prefer that all the deficit reduction be done on the spending side, but he acknowledged that this was politically impossible. He also took pains to explain that while he had often praised Mr. Clinton's economic plan for confronting the deficit head on, he never specifically endorsed it over other plans to cut the deficit.
To rein in spending, Mr. Greenspan said he would favor a constitutional amendment stating that increases in taxes or spending could be enacted only with a 60 percent super majority vote in the House and the Senate.
Mr. Greenspan said he also favored enacting sunset legislation under which all Federal spending programs would expire regularly. He said expiring programs that have merit would be reauthorized with little problems but programs with little justification would not receive the necessary votes.
The Fed chairman predicted that job growth would soon start to gather steam because the length of the workweek had risen to record levels. But he said the unemployment rate would probably not fall as quickly as he hoped.

HEADLINE: Balkanizing the Balkans

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, March 25

 BODY:
As the Bosnian war approaches its first anniversary next week, Serbian forces have embarked on a major offensive apparently intended to bury current peace plans beneath the upheaval and devastation on the ground.
Given their growing diplomatic isolation, the Serbs seem to have concluded that the only thing on their side is military might. And that isolation increased today when the head of the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government signed an international mediation team's peace plan in New York. [Page A12.] 
 The Serbs' thinking seems to be that they may as well be decisively employed now in capturing the areas of Bosnia that they covet and, at the very least, delay peacemaking plans until the situation in Russia is clearer.
 
Counting on Yeltsin's Defeat
 "The Serbs have been counting for months on Boris Yeltsin's defeat and ensuing support from Russia, and their hopes are high right now," said one Western diplomat. "Their offensive serves to delay diplomatic efforts to forge peace, as well as to unravel the maps the peacemakers have devised."
Russia is a traditional ally of the Serbs, and the Serbian Government headed by Slobodan Milosevic has been disappointed by Mr. Yeltsin's endorsement of sanctions and other measures against Yugoslavia, which now consists only of Serbia and Montenegro.
The focus of the Serbian nationalists' offensive in Bosnia has been the eastern region of that republic, particularly the pocket of Muslim-held territory along the border with Serbia around the town of Srebrenica. But there has also been a renewed onslaught on Sarajevo, featuring heavy shelling and increased probes against Bosnian Government defenses in the western fringes of the city.
In and around Srebrenica, where as many as 60,000 Muslims are now besieged, the objective seems clearly aimed at securing Serbian control of an area of strategic importance to Belgrade. It is a region envisioned by Cyrus R. Vance and Lord Owen, the international mediators on the Balkans, as being under Muslim control.
At a news conference here today, Cedric Thornberry, the deputy chief of the United Nations mission in Belgrade, said the Serbian offensive was moving forward, taking an average of one or two Muslim villages a day.
"If there is not a substantial diplomatic initiative, the whole area, including Srebrenica, could fall in the next 15 to 20 days," Mr. Thornberry said. "The consequences of this on the political side would be far-reaching because in the Vance-Owen plan this is seen as a basically Muslim province. In essence, the whole basis for the peace plan would be changed."
Serbian nationalist forces in Bosnia and the Yugoslav Army have effectively sealed off the area to reporters, so independent verification of the offensive is difficult. But Serbian leaders in Bosnia make no secret of their desire to take the area, which is important to them because it helps secure the road between Belgrade and Pale, the headquarters of the Bosnian Serbs, and because it affords them control of both banks of the Drina River, which for stretches forms the border between Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
"Eastern Bosnia is Serbian," Aleksa Buha, a top aide to the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, said in an interview this week. "Our goal is to defeat the enemy. Unfortunately when you fight a war, the goal is to disable the enemy."
In Sarajevo, the objectives of the new Serbian bombardment are less clear. But Western analysts expressed doubt that the offensive amounted to a preparation for an all-out attack on the Bosnian capital, which would cause enormous casualties on both sides and might provoke Western military intervention in Bosnia.
 
Strategy Backfired
 Rather, they believe, the artillery attack may have been intended to persuade the leader of the Bosnian Government, Alija Izetbegovic, not to sign the Vance-Owen plan. This, in turn, would have meant that Dr. Karadzic, the Bosnian Serbs' leader, would be less isolated in his rejection of the plan. But if this was the strategy, it backfired today when Mr. Izetbegovic signed the plan at the United Nations.
The Serbs also know that Sarajevo is the most powerful symbol of the war to the outside world and that its bombardment makes all peace calculations more difficult. At a time when Mr. Yeltsin is under pressure in Moscow, this suits them.
"A change of government in Russia is now Mr. Milosevic's greatest hope," said Vuk Draskovic, the leader of the main opposition party in Serbia, the Serbian Renewal Movement. "He is banking on it."
It seems clear that Mr. Milosevic's hand is not far removed from the current military activities of the Bosnian Serbs, even though the Serbian Government here clings doggedly to the claim that the Bosnian Serbs' affairs are beyond the control of Belgrade. The Bosnian Serbs receive most of their supplies and some of their manpower from Serbia, and Mr. Milosevic has the power to shut down this pipeline.
But at a time of economic hardship, with inflation running at more than 250 percent a month, fighting suits Mr. Milosevic because it is an effective distraction. Thus, turning up the military pressure in Bosnia at a time when peace negotiations are in an intensive phase appears to coincide with his interests.
Lieut. Gen. Philippe Morillon, the United Nations military commander in Bosnia, appeared to admit as much today by coming to Belgrade in an attempt to persuade Mr. Milosevic to halt the Bosnian Serb offensive.
Before leaving Tuzla in Bosnia, General Morillon said, "Mr. Milosevic alone can bring pressure on General Mladic." Gen. Ratko Mladic is the commander of the Bosnian Serb forces and has orchestrated the latest offensive.
After meeting with the Serbian leader, General Morillon said, "President Milosevic promised to help me in the implementation of every request I have made, that is, an immediate cease-fire, not only in the area of Srebrenica, but in the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina."
But whatever Mr. Milosevic told the French general, Western diplomats believe the real thinking of the Serbs is abundantly clear. The Serbs, diplomats say, still reject a solitary state in Bosnia and Herzegovina and are trying by force of arms to insure that the nation is split into three states, the largest of which would belong to them.

HEADLINE: Japanese Mix and Match Auto Plants and Markets

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GEORGETOWN, Ky.

 BODY:
Every so often on the Toyota Motor Corporation assembly line here, a Toyota Camry takes shape with the steering wheel on the right side. But more surprising than the steering wheel's location are the cars' destinations: the ports of Tawara, Japan, and Sheerness, England.
After a decade of making cars in America, Japanese auto makers like Toyota and Honda are turning their ships around and sending American-made cars to Japan, Taiwan, the Middle East and Europe. 
 It began as a trickle a few years ago, but exports are rising sharply and are expected to keep growing for a host of reasons. These include, Japanese auto executives say, the heightened efficiency of Japanese plants in the United States, the improved quality of American-made cars and the cost benefits of making cars in the United States instead of Japan.
 
 
An International System
 In an age of multinational corporations, executives and global markets, Japanese car companies like Toyota and the Honda Motor Company are pioneering the auto industry's first truly global manufacturing system. The idea is to perfect a car's design and production in one place and then churn out thousands of "world cars" each year that can be made in one place and sold around the globe.
 In the automotive industry, where developing cars for different markets can cost billions of dollars, what Toyota and Honda are attempting -- and what the Ford Motor Company is trying to mimic -- could sharply cut development costs, maximize the use of assembly plants and preserve the assembly-line efficiencies that are a hallmark of the Japanese "lean" production system.
In developing a strong export market, Honda is aiming for a "global base of complementary supply," said Roger Lambert, Honda's United States manager of corporate communications. "Japan can supply North America and Europe," he said. "North America can supply Japan and Europe, and Europe can supply Japan and the United States.
 
 
Two-Thirds of Strategy
 "So far, the first two are true," he added, referring to Honda's plants in Japan, North America and England. "This means you can more profitably utilize your production bases and talents."
 Politically, with Japan running a huge trade surplus with the United States, Toyota and Honda acknowledge that it is helpful for them to show Washington they are at least attempting to correct the imbalance by sending cars back home. Moreover, with an agreement last year to increase the flow of autos and parts from America to Japan, Toyota and Honda are only too happy to devise a way to ship their own cars back from the United States.
From a financial standpoint, in the decade or more that Japanese car companies make been building vehicles in the United States, the Japanese yen has risen about 50 percent against the dollar. That makes it less expensive to build cars in America, by some estimates giving American producers a cost advantage of $2,500 to $3,000 a car. That saving far outweighs the cost of shipping a car overseas.
But apart from the currency benefits, which can ebb and flow, is something of potentially longer-term importance, Japanese car makers said. Toyota is creating a system that for the first time allows the companies to manage their auto production levels between Japan and the United States. They are moving, the executives say, toward global manufacturing that can be fine-tuned on a quarterly basis according to economic conditions in different markets.
The strategy of Toyota and Honda contrasts with that of American companies that have historically erected foreign plants and elaborate international operations solely to supply local or regional markets. Although Ford plans to build a new small sedan in Europe and America, neither Ford nor the General Motors Corporation have used their foreign subsidiaries to develop and build cars for numerous markets around the world.
 "It was always more convenient and less costly to focus on the domestic market than to make the long-term commitment to foreign markets," said Robert A. Lutz, president of the Chrysler Corporation and a former Ford of Europe executive.
But even in Detroit, the Big Three auto makers have become more aggressive exporters to Europe and East Asia, sending Jeeps to Japan and mini-vans to Europe. Like the Japanese in America, they have benefited from the dollar's weakness and they are under pressure to demonstrate that their products are attractive elsewhere.
 
Fine-Tuning Production
 But the swing toward global management represents yet another step forward by the Japanese car companies in their drive for manufacturing efficiency, said Daniel T. Jones, an automotive industry researcher at the Cardiff Business School at the University of Wales and co-author of "The Machine That Changed the World," a book that analyzes Japanese car manufacturing.
"In the early days, it was brownie points to export to Japan," Mr. Jones said. "But it's more than that. The Toyota system depends on a tremendous amount of fine-tuning of the production system and eliminating all wasted productivity. Line balancing is an important part of the process -- to try and keep all plants at an optimum level. So you gradually slow each plant rather than penalize one plant a lot."
At Toyota, globalization has a production jargon all its own. Phrases like "line balancing," "leveling" of production and "continuous flow" help capture the notion of trying to wring maximum efficiency from assembly lines even when few cars need to be built.
In the last year, as Japan slid into recession and the Toyota labor force at one big plant, Tsutsumi, faced less work, executives at Toyota's Japanese headquarters decided that the Toyota plants in the United States and Japan should share the pain, said Alex M. Warren Jr., senior vice president of Toyota's Kentucky plant.
 
 
Avoiding Layoffs
 Instead of sharply reducing production and idling many workers, the Georgetown plant is gradually paring its daily production by about 7.4 percent, to 940 cars in May from 1,015 Camry sedans and station wagons last month. This month, 1,005 cars will roll off the assembly line a day; in April, 960. Over the same period, Tsutsumi is also gradually reducing its daily production, Mr. Warren said.
Avoiding layoffs is part of the Japanese production theology. But it has a point, too. Keeping workers occupied is particularly important in Toyota's system, which in both Japan and the United States emphasizes worker efficiency and multiple skills.
As car sales have waned in Japan's recession, the number of hours Japanese auto workers spend on the job has been cut from an average of 2,300 a year to 1,800, or more than 20 percent, said Mr. Jones, the auto industry researcher. Because the Japanese car companies demand a high level of worker participation to maintain high-quality manufacturing, they choose to slow the work rather than to lay off and rehire workers.
"The Japanese think of workers more as a long-term resource," Mr. Jones said. "The last thing they want to do is hire and fire workers."
The "leveling" of production, by keeping output humming but at a slower pace, also suits Toyota's production techniques, which call for lower inventories of parts from outside suppliers, compared with the much larger quantities of parts on hand at most American car plants. It is easier for Toyota or Honda suppliers to adjust their schedules if they are supplying the main plant on a "just in time" basis than if they were geared up for huge volumes in advance, Mr. Warren said.
None of this would work, of course, if the quality of the American-made cars was inferior. When Japanese companies started building vehicles in the United States in the early 1980's, they worried about whether American workers could duplicate the quality that helped to make Japanese cars so popular.
But Toyota officials say the quality of the company's American-made autos is indistinguishable from Japanese-made models. It has to be. In Japan, car buyers are so particular that some get down on the showroom floor to eyeball the alignment of the doors. Others are finicky about the finish coat of paint.
Last year, the Georgetown plant produced 240,000 Camrys, including 3,734 right-hand-drive station wagons that were loaded in a huge rail yard next to the plant here and transported by train to Long Beach, Calif., and then shipped to Japan. This year, 9,600 of the station wagons, which are made only in Kentucky, are headed for Japan. Later in the year, the company will export a coupe version to Japan, industry analysts say.
The station wagon is pitched in Japan as an American car, and its made-in-America imprimatur is emphasized in a sales brochure. A video for potential customers shows the wagon, renamed the Scepter, zipping through Kentucky's rolling horse country near the Toyota plant.
 
 
Japan as Growing Importer
 By 1996, Toyota Motor Manufacturing U.S.A. expects Japan to surpass Taiwan as its biggest export market, absorbing 95,000 cars from the United States. That is more than double last year's worldwide exports from its Kentucky plant and an assembly plant it operates jointly with General Motors in Fremont, Calif. The Georgetown plant sent 8,925 Camry sedans to Taiwan last year, in large part because Taiwan has trade barriers against imports from Japan.
 For Honda, which was exporting American-made cars even before Toyota, Japan is already the biggest export market. Without the exports to Japan, Honda's Ohio plant would have had five weeks' less work last year, said Mr. Lambert, the corporate communications manager at Honda.
"There is the basic economic value of strengthening our position by having an export market in rather tough economic times," Mr. Lambert said.
And Japanese customers' demands for high quality helped improve Honda cars no matter the market. "By paying attention to close panel fits and the tiniest of finishes we have improved the fit and finish for every buyer," Mr. Lambert said.

HEADLINE: Sanctions on North Korea May Get Tighter

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25

 BODY:
The United States and its allies in Asia may move to impose stiff sanctions on North Korea to pressure it to abide by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said today.
The measures would include denying the isolated Government oil, gas, other raw materials and even food, he told a House appropriations subcommittee. 
 South Korea's Foreign Minister, Han Sung Joo arrived tonight for talks with Mr. Christopher on coping with the North Korean nuclear threat. North Korea announced on March 12 that it was withdrawing from the treaty, which it signed in 1985, and earlier this year it barred international inspectors from two sites, raising concerns it was hiding a weapons program.
Mr. Christopher said the Security Council would take up the issue at the end of the month or in early April.
China, which has tried to mediate the dispute, said on Tuesday that it opposed any international sanctions against North Korea for withdrawing from the treaty. As a permanent member of the Security Council, China has veto power over any United Nations sanctions.

HEADLINE: KOHL, DUE IN U.S., LOSES SOME LUSTER

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, March 25

 BODY:
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, the strongman of Europe for most of George Bush's Presidency, went to Washington today for a meeting with President Clinton on Friday.
But the country he leads now looks far less economically formidable and politically self-confident than it did after reunification two and a half years ago. 
 For months, Germany's political system has been all but paralyzed by indecision about how to meet the problems of the swelling ranks of refugees from Eastern Europe, the spiraling costs of absorbing the ruined Communist economy of eastern Germany, and the growing expectations of its international partners.
For years, Germany has been calling on other countries to contribute to Russia and other former Soviet republics as much as Bonn has provided -- nearly $50 billion since 1989 -- to keep the forces of democracy and free markets from coming to grief there. Now that President Clinton is proposing a new program of aid to bolster President Boris N. Yeltsin, Mr. Kohl is expected to say Germany is broke and has done enough already.
 
Germany Faulted on Balkans
 Germany also showed on the eve of Mr. Kohl's departure that it was hardly in a position to lead Europe out of the morass in the Balkans. Mr. Kohl's coalition was so divided on what to do about one important issue relating to the war in the Balkans that it decided, in effect, to sue itself and buck the decision to a federal Constitutional Court.
The issue was whether the clauses against war-making in the German Constitution of 1949 would require Bonn to pull its crew members off NATO air-surveillance missions of military flights over Bosnia if, as expected, the Security Council authorizes force to keep Serbian aircraft from flying.
The Christian Democratic alliance of Mr. Kohl said the constitutional ban on "acts tending to and undertaken with the intent to disturb the peaceful relations between nations" did not apply to peacekeeping missions under the aegis of the United Nations.
But the Free Democrats said the Constitution needed to be amended, which can happen only with the consent of the Social Democratic opposition, before German troops could be put into potential combat situations beyond the country's borders.
Because no country really wants to take the first step into involvement in the Balkan war, and lately because of the political turmoil in Russia, the Security Council has repeatedly put off a vote on enforcing the flight ban.
 
Couldn't Agree on Policy
 Until Wednesday night, the Government kept putting off a decision because it could not agree on a policy.
German participation is key to the surveillance. The 18 four-engined American E-3A planes in the operation are based primarily at Geilenkirchen, near the Netherlands, and Germans make up about 30 percent of the 1,500 military personnel involved, NATO officers say.
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and the Free Democrats have made clear that for them, the problem is not German troops' staying on the planes but the necessity of changing the Constitution to let them.
So late Wednesday night, the Free Democrats and the Christian Democrats agreed that if the United Nations passes the resolution, Mr. Kohl's party would order troops to stay on the surveillance planes and Mr. Kinkel's party would then apply for a temporary injunction and a quick court ruling.
The opposition Social Democratic leader, Hans-Ulrich Klose, today sarcastically called this "a really classy way to govern." His party has challenged German participation in the naval blockade of Serbia, and it is not willing to go along with a constitutional change to permit broader participation in peacekeeping missions.

HEADLINE: Second Chance on Environment

SERIES: What Price Cleanup? -- Last of five articles.

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25

 BODY:
Four laws that help form the foundation of United States environmental policy are up for renewal in the next two years, and leading environmental advocates in Congress say they intend to use the opportunity to begin redefining how the nation safeguards its air, land and water.
The Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Superfund law for cleaning up toxic wastes and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act for disposing of hazardous chemicals all are under Congressional review. Calls for change from lawmakers focus on their desire for more rigorous science and better analyses of the costs and benefits. Several leading members said that too often Congress has moved from panic to panic and not developed a uniform approach to consider risks. 
 "Costs are out of sight," and the benefits from many recent environmental programs are not apparent, said Representative Mike Synar, the Oklahoma Democrat who is chairman of a House subcommittee on the environment. Now, he added, "we have a chance to end the quilt-patch form of environmental lawmaking."
Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, the ranking Republican on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, said current policies had already controlled 90 percent of the pollution. "But now there is increasing recognition of the costs," he said. "It will cost twice as much or three times as much to get the last little percent. Do we want to do that?"
Others in Congress, notably Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, see it as their job to make sure that cost savings do not compromise safety.
Several members of Congress said that one lesson of environmental policy-making in the 1980's was that acting on the basis of being safe rather than sorry had unintended consequences. Not the least of them has been many costly rules that are not producing measurable improvements in public health or the environment.
There is a higher premium on preventing such mistakes in the 1990's, and not only because of scarce financial resources. With even larger global environmental problems becoming apparent from climate change to deforestation, the nation could make even bigger mistakes if it acts aggressively without a measured, careful analysis of the consequences.
 
4 Laws as One Program
 This week, Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who heads the Committee on Environment and Public Works, began a series of hearings to develop a comprehensive and effective environmental program.
Mr. Baucus's effort is the first time a Congressional committee has attempted to consider four separate laws as related parts of a unified program of environmental protection. In an interview, he said that it was too early to make specific recommendations about amending the laws, but he also said that all would undergo some changes.
Senator Baucus and Representative Synar said their work was guided by two main questions.
First, what should lawmakers and regulators do after they discover a new environmental problem that seems dangerous -- but before careful scientific analysis has shown the degree of risk? Many environmentalists say waiting for more data might mean that the Government reacts only after people have begun dying.
Second, what should be done about regulations enacted over the last 15 years that set inordinately strict standards for toxic compounds in air, water or the ground? Most were based on rodent studies now perceived to be flawed, and even scientists who conducted the studies say that as many as two-thirds of the compounds deemed carcinogenic would present no danger to humans.
William K. Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency in the Bush Administration, said one problem was the air of crisis that surrounded every new environmental concern.
 
'Cost Considerations'
 "It is far past time when we become mature enough as a nation to address an environmental issue, mobilize to support it, and do so without acting in an emergency atmosphere," he said. "Not everything is a crisis that has to be corrected tomorrow. And we need to make clear that cost considerations are relevant to any remedy. Cities just aren't going to keep spending more on cleaning up toxic dumps, for instance, than they are on their schools."
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, has introduced a bill that would require the Government to amass much stronger scientific proof and convene expert panels to consider a new environmental rule before it is issued.
Environmentalists call that thinking a recipe for disaster.
"As a scientist, we always hope to have more research to answer complex questions," said Dr. Adam Finkel of Resources for the Future, an environmental research group in Washington. "But in 1993 we don't have the scientific basis for rejecting the current approach, which says we should be prudent when faced with uncertainty."
Many experts also assert that, just as damage from forest fires is reversible, so too is damage from many pollutants. At the same time, the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta say that even after a generation of study, there is no confirmed evidence that pollutants are causing epidemics of cancer, birth defects or other chronic diseases.
The cancer institute says about 500,000 people die from cancer each year. Some institute officials estimate that between 1 and 3 percent of those deaths resulted from environmental pollutants. That would be between 5,000 and 15,000 people. Other scientists say that exposure to the panoply of chemicals in the environment causes other affects in people, among them infertility and nervous system disorders.
Experts urging the most conservative course say environmental poisons may be causing as many as 15 percent of all cancer. The higher number takes into account research indicating that farm and factory workers exposed to high levels of toxic substances are dying at higher than normal rates from certain types of cancers.
Senator Moynihan believes research like this can be improved and put to better use.
"We're entirely capable of moving on to a more productive period of environmental protection that is based on clear factual assessments of what produces risks to human health and the environment," he said.
If the Government decides to undo existing regulations it faces years of work, following much the same process of hearings and notification periods that led to the rules.
"Once something is decided as being a threat, it is very hard to recognize that new information suggests that it's not," said Carol M. Browner, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
Whatever new approach Congress or the Clinton Administration takes in the next two years, leading lawmakers say they want to be careful not to weaken a number of regulations that are widely believed to provide valuable protections for public health. High on that list are the landmark environmental laws passed in the 1970's like the Clean Water Act and the laws establishing protection for public lands.
But environmental experts say many other programs do not offer clear benefits. With this in mind, Mr. Synar and other lawmakers have begun talking about some principles they hope to use as they consider the four major laws that are up for renewal:
*Require the Government to consider the cost of a regulation before it is issued. Several environmental statutes, including the 1972 Clean Water Act, prohibit the Government from taking costs into account.
*Increase spending on problems now regarded as more important, like protecting endangered plants and animals, and reducing financing for less dangerous problems, like cleaning up toxic waste sites.
*Give businesses and cities more flexibility to decide how to comply with environmental standards, ending the expensive and rigid approach demanded under most laws.
Even as they work toward these goals, the lawmakers said they were fully aware that 15 years from now that it was likely that Congress would look back and see that other kinds of mistakes had been made. But at least, they said, in the 1990's the United States would have begun to take more methodical steps based on better science to solve environmental problems.

The Series: A Recap of the Articles

 The first article in this series, which appeared on Sunday, reported that leading scientists, economists and Government officials had reached the dismaying conclusion that much of America's environmental program had gone seriously awry. They said the nation's environmental policy had been allowed to evolve in reaction to popular panics rather than in response to sound scientific analyses.
The article on Monday described how Congress banned the practice of dumping sewage in the sea after trash, industrial waste and worse washed ashore on the East Coast in 1988.
Tuesday's article described the serious doubts being raised about the validity of rat and mouse studies, long the Government's most important tool for identifying environmental hazards and setting priorities for Federal regulation. Chemicals often have different effects in animals and humans.
Wednesday's article described how a movement born in Columbus, Ohio, prompted the National League of Cities to call for an update of environmental laws.

HEADLINE: China Finds Way to Slay Dragon of Inflation

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 25

 BODY:
One of the biggest headaches for China's leaders as this year began was an overheating economy, which threatened to ignite inflation. They fretted about it, fought about it and warned the public about it.
Now, in a demonstration of the power of positive thinking, the problem has disappeared. 
 It is not that anything happened to the economy. Rather, an 88-year-old retiree, a grandfather with no training in economics and no formal position these days, reportedly told associates that the economy was fine.
Since the old man's name is Deng Xiaoping, and he happens to be China's unofficial emperor, everyone decided that he had a point.
Leaders stopped warning about "overheating" and began urging the public to "seize the opportunity" and pick up the economic pace. The central bank announced that it would pursue an easy monetary policy. The expression "guo ri," or overheating, virtually vanished from the official press.
The episode illustrates how China functions these days, and some economists believe it also underscores the risks of basing policy decisions on the whims of emperors. For even if China's officials have all got the message, the economy has not.
"It's clearly overheating," a foreign economist in Beijing said. "Look at the way prices are going up, look at the way investment is soaring, look at the shortages and bottlenecks.
"For a dozen years, China has been following a boom-bust cycle, and now we're headed down the same road. I can see the bust coming."
But some other economists are much more optimistic. And even some of the overheating scenarios -- such as rising inflation that eventually forces a yearlong "recession" in which the economy grows by only 4 percent or so -- would be a dream come true for the United States or Europe.
The real problem is political rather than economic: How will the public react to rising prices? The last bout of inflation helped provoke the Tiananmen demonstrations in 1989.
Already people are grumbling about rising prices and about new programs for raising medical costs and housing prices to rational levels. Economists say price liberalization is a great idea, but workers are unconvinced.
Official statistics show that by the end of February, price levels in major cities stood 15.3 percent higher than a year ago. China does not disclose monthly changes in inflation, but the statistics it does release suggest that inflation is now probably running at an annual rate of more than 20 percent in major cities, and gaining momentum.
Concern about overheating is perhaps inevitable considering that China is experiencing a spectacular boom, resulting in 12.8 percent growth in gross domestic product last year. Most economists believe that this is too fast a clip to be sustained for more than a couple of years.
"The Government officials I talk to are all worried about the economy overheating," an Asian diplomat in Beijing said. "It's not a certainty, but it's a concern."
The economic boom is partly a result of a wave of construction of office buildings, homes, hotels and highways. In the first two months of 1993, state-owned companies increased investment in fixed assets by 64 percent over the same period last year.
The boom is also fueled by loose credit from local bank branches that the central Government has found it difficult to control. The money supply, including cash and checking accounts, rose 37 percent last year.
A survey of 114 Chinese economists, widely reported in the Chinese press in January, found that by a two-to-one margin they believed that the economy "is beginning to grow too quickly and may lead to inflation." The official newspapers in December and January printed front-page editorials against overheating, and the leadership signaled that it planned to slow the pace.
Prime Minister Li Peng and other officials who had tried to restrain the economy apparently gave up when they heard Mr. Deng say in December and January that a bit of overheating was nothing to worry about. Mr. Li recently called for "better and faster economic development."

HEADLINE: Bosnian Muslims Join Croats in Accepting Peace Pact

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 25

 BODY:
The President of Bosnia's Muslim-dominated Government agreed today to a plan to end the year-old war that has torn apart his country, and international mediators said later that the world must prepare to take tougher action against the Serbs, whose leadership in Bosnia still refuses to make peace.
After a day of last-minute bargaining and delays, President Alija Izetbegovic approved a map dividing Bosnia and Herzegovina into 10 near-autonomous provinces and an amended plan for governing the country while a new constitution is drawn up. 
 The Bosnian Croats have also accepted the plan, which was drawn up by a United Nations-European Community mediation team and includes elaborate provisions for a cease-fire, the disengagement of forces and deployment of a United Nations peacekeeping force up to 50,000 strong.

 The leader of Bosnia's Serbian nationalists, Radovan Karadzic, refused to sign either the map or the government plan. In the course of the last few days, he has made clear that he does not share the the fundamental aim of the mediators, Cyrus R. Vance and Lord Owen: ending the war on terms that preserve Bosnia as a unified country.
Dr. Karadzic said it was "unacceptable for Serbs to be subjected to pressure" and called today's action "a victory for the Croatian and Muslim coalition."
President Izetbegovic said he had only accepted the plan with a number of conditions, including an end to Serbian "aggression."
He also said the Clinton Administration had undertaken to do "everything in its power" to lift the arms embargo imposed on Bosnia and the rest of the old Yugoslav federation if the Serbs continue to attack. The embargo has made it difficult for the Government to upgrade its arsenal to match the well-stocked Serbs.
But in Washington, Administration officials said only that they were considering support for an end to the embargo against the Government.
 
Meeting Mediators' Goals
 The outcome of this latest round of talks was substantially what Mr. Vance and Lord Owen sought when they moved the negotiations from Geneva to New York last month in the hope that the Security Council would press the Muslims into an agreement with the Croats, leaving the Serb nationalists isolated.
The mediators hope that this isolation will increase the pressure on the Bosnian Serbs and their patrons in Serbia to accept the peace plan. But critics have noted that Yugoslavia, which now includes only Serbia and Montenegro, has weathered increasing isolation, including a United Nations trade embargo, with no slackening of support for the Serbs in Bosnia.
In an interview today, Dr. Karadzic said he doubted that his people would ever accept the Vance-Owen plan.
"There is no chance they will accept the map," he said. "Anyway I will tell them about the worst possibilities of sanctions and pressures. Then you will find 12 million Serbs are ready to be opposed to the whole world."
He said Slobodan Milosevic, president of the Serbian republic in Yugoslavia, was unlikely to pressure him to accept the plan; neither does he think Russia will press him to sign, he said, adding that he plans to visit Moscow next month.
 
Commitment to Convoys
 Dr. Karadzic also said his first act on returning to his headquarters at Pale, outside Sarajevo, would be "to insure that all humanitarian convoys get through our lines" in eastern Bosnia and to Sarajevo.
At a news conference after the signing, the mediators said they would ask the Security Council to back the plan and to impose tough new economic sanctions on the rump Yugoslav federation and on the Serbian-controlled areas of Bosnia if Dr. Karadzic does not sign as well.
Calling it "a mistake to imagine negotiations can continue without limit," Lord Owen said, "the highest priority is to demonstrate sanctions will be applied more toughly."
"If there is no readiness to come around to this peace agreement, the international community will have to take some further action, and it will be tough action," he said. "Hard choices must be made."
Lord Owen, who represents the European Community, said he hoped the Security Council would now be prepared "to back its words with actions and bring a range of pressures to bear" on the Serbian leadership.
But Lord Owen came down against lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia, saying the danger was that Russia would supply the Serbs with arms and the war would intensify. And he called for sanctions to be relaxed gradually as and if the Serbs carry out the peace plan. "You can't have a stick without a carrot," he said.
 
'Major Step Forward'
 Mr. Vance, representing the United Nations, called today's signing "a major step forward" and said that while Dr. Karadzic had not signed, he had indicated the intention to stay in touch with the mediators and was returning home to consult his supporters and "reflect."
Lord Owen said he thought the Security Council should give Dr. Karadzic about a week to consult his colleagues and give a final yes or no answer on the package.
Tonight the Security Council issued a statement welcoming the agreement and calling on the Serbian side to sign as well and cease its "ethnic cleansing" and "obstruction of humanitarian assistance."
The Council said it "stands ready to take the steps required to bring about a peace settlement."
 
New Sanctions Proposed
 The United States, Britain and France have already prepared a list of sanctions that would further reduce Yugoslavia's contacts by banning shipment of goods across its territory and seizing more of its overseas assets.
They are also currently assisting Yugoslavia's neighbors and European Community countries in tightening the existing trade embargo, which was imposed last year after the Council decided Serbia's government was helping the Serbs in Bosnia to set up an independent state and drive out other ethnic groups.
But the international situation has changed in recent days in ways that promise to make the Vance-Owen strategy more difficult to achieve.
The power struggle in Moscow has already forced President Clinton to give a higher priority to helping President Boris N. Yeltsin than to advancing the Bosnian peace plans.
This became clear Wednesday when the United States agreed to postpone a Security Council decision to enforce the flight ban over Bosnia because Mr. Yeltsin feared that any such anti-Serb move would strengthen the hand of his enemies at home.
It may thus be difficult for Russia to give its full support to tough new sanctions against Serbia as long as Mr. Yeltsin's position is being seriously challenged by opponents who seem prepared to use Russia's traditional ties to the Serbs as a weapon in the domestic political contest.
 
Concession on Sarajevo
 In order to win President Izetbegovic's support, Mr. Vance and Lord Owen agreed to small changes in the proposed provincial boundaries and in the arrangements for an interim government; these changes seem to make the package even more unacceptable to the Serbs.
The mediators slightly enlarged the province surrounding Sarajevo, insuring that it would have a Muslim majority. And they agreed that while all three ethnic factions would share power equally in governing the capital city, the government of the rest of the Sarajevo province would be in Muslim hands.
Dr. Karadzic has anyway hardened his position on both the map and the future government arrangements, demanding extensive new lands in eastern Bosnia and saying there should be no central government at all until a new constitution is agreed upon. This would leave the Serbian provinces as states within a state.
Some Yugoslavia experts at the United Nations fear that the Serbian reaction to today's agreement between Croats and Muslims will be to open a new offensive, taking advantage of the difficulty that Russia faces in taking action against them while President Yeltsin's position is threatened.

HEADLINE: Washington Memo;
Job Plan Sounding Less Monumental

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25

 BODY:
In his economic message to a joint session of Congress last month, President Clinton described a soaring effort "to create jobs and guarantee a strong recovery," to rebuild the nation's decaying foundation, feed and house the unfortunate and give jobs to half-a-million unemployed.
But as the Senate began a raucous debate today on Mr. Clinton's proposal to inject $16.3 billion as an emergency stimulus for the economy, the effort was in peril of becoming something considerably more mundane: a political football, fumbled by the White House and pounced on by Republicans and dissidents in the President's party. 
 Not that the stimulus proposal -- the minuscule tail-end of Mr. Clinton's five-year, $8 trillion budget package -- was in danger of being defeated or even seriously altered. Despite stormy speeches and filibuster threats, the Senate's 57 Democrats seemed likely to pass and send it to the White House next week, just as the House did last week.
The prospect that it may prove an embarrassment, on the other hand, was more palpable. As the economy has revived, the White House has been increasingly pressed to show that its emergency legislation addresses an emergency, that its stimulus will actually stimulate, that its unemployed will gain many permanent jobs or that the red ink it creates as part of a deficit-reduction package is a political plus.
 
Republicans Zero In
 The Republicans zeroed in this week on disclosures that the stimulus includes proposals to inventory fish, build grandstands for canoe races and make films on Acadian culture.
The package's delicate position was underscored today, when Senate debate was quickly stalled by a filibuster, not by Republicans, but by two unhappy Democrats, Senators David L. Boren of Oklahoma and John B. Breaux of Louisiana.
The two fiscal conservatives want to put off spending about half of the stimulus money until Congress locks Mr. Clinton's broader deficit-cutting plan into law, probably this summer. They decided to revolt, sending the Senate into gridlock, when the President's point man on the bill, Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, denied them and the bill's other enemies any such opportunity.
Using the Senate's Gordian rules, he arranged debate so that critics could not amend the stimulus package without first voting against it -- something most Democrats, whose fates are lashed to Mr. Clinton's, are loath to do, even symbolically.
Mr. Byrd needs 60 votes to break the filibuster, but was not certain he had them. Senators Boren and Breaux also need 60 votes, to break any Republican filibuster should they be allowed to offer their amendment, but were not sure they had them either. So the three faced off for more than six hours, daring each other to try something, until everyone finally got tired and went home.
Mr. Boren said that he and Mr. Breaux would suspend their filibuster, at least temporarily, but he was not certain what would happen next.
 
Minimal Results Expected
 On its face, this is much ado about almost nothing. While Mr. Clinton this week called the stimulus bill an essential bridge from economic doldrums to recovery, most economists now agree that it will accomplish little. Of the $16.3 billion allotted, $10 billion to $12.7 billion would enter the economy this fiscal year. Nor would a great many of the jobs it would create be permanent.
Even many Democrats who believe that an economic jolt is no longer needed support the stimulus plan because it would spend on traditional Democratic causes. Mr. Clinton would pour another $556 million into the Head Start program; $300 million more into childhood immunizations; $14 million more into housing for the very poorest rural people; $1 billion into summer jobs for poor youths, and $4 billion in extended unemployment benefits.
But Republican critics have scored by highlighting some proposals that elicit less sympathy. There would be $2 billion to make up a shortfall in a college student loan fund, which would educate students but stimulate the production of few new jobs, and $6 million would be spent on programs to recycle escaping methane from coal mines, landfills and farm-animal dung.
 
Some Strange Programs
 One measure that has been killed would have subsidized loans for casinos on Indian reservations. Among still-extant proposals, the Interior Department would spend $1.4 million to make line drawings of 28 historic buildings, $75,000 to prepare atlases of freshwater fish in three states. And the Forest Service would spend $800,000 to build grandstands and the like for the canoeing course for the 1996 Summer Olympics.
At his news conference this week, Mr. Clinton, who has been stung by the attacks, said those ideas were not officially his Administration's ideas, but arose when critical lawmakers asked Clinton aides for lists of "every absurd thing you could possibly spend the money on." But that is incorrect. The proposals were official submissions, usually offered by Cabinet secretaries or senior aides.
One that has remained is a proposal by the Army Corps of Engineers to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars for automatic piezometers -- devices that gauge the pressure inside dams -- to replace models that now must be read manually.
The proposal prompted what may have been the best line of the long debate over the stimulus, offered by Representative John T. Myers, Republican of Indiana.
"Automating to create jobs -- that's a dichotomy in itself, isn't it?" he said. "That is government work for you. Highly labor-intensive automation. O.K."

HEADLINE: Sacramento Portrait;
Well Liked Even by California Rivals, Latest Brown Is Now Early Favorite

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif.

 BODY:
There was a made-for-television moment here one recent morning that most politicians could only dream of.
With a baby on each hip and the cameras rolling, Kathleen Brown, Treasurer of California, went to the bank to buy bonds for her twin grandchildren and remind voters that politics is her family business. 
 A few hours later and a few blocks away, there was a dry-as-dust hearing of a State Senate subcommittee on indebtedness and financing.
And Kathleen Brown was there too, without cameras or cuddly props, testifying about how California can regain its luster with Wall Street.
 
Favorite of the Pros
 Slick politician and sober administrator. These are the polarities of Ms. Brown's days, a year and a half before statewide elections but with Democrat officeholders ready to anoint her the next governor, as they did her father and brother before her.
Some recent numbers explain the party professionals' heady rush to declare a winner even before there are any declared candidates:
Ms. Brown has already raised more than $2 million, a stunning sum at this stage of the game. In recent polls, she is running well ahead of Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, and in front of the Insurance Commissioner, John Garamendi, her most likely primary opponent. And six of 10 registered voters say they are disinclined to re-elect Mr. Wilson.
These numbers may thrill the party faithful, but in Ms. Brown's camp they spell worry about being the front-runner in a race not yet begun.
 
Focus on Today
 "I have lived long enough on this earth as a Brown to know that rising expectations can only lead to lower expectations," said Ms. Brown, who is 47 years old. "So I'm falling back on what my mother taught me, which is to focus on what I'm doing now: To borrow low and invest high."
How long can Ms. Brown fly high without offering concrete proposals to fix the mess this state is in?
At the subcommittee hearing, one Republican state Senator, Robert Beverly, pressed her hard but without success. With spiraling costs and shrinking revenues -- a result of immigration, recession and assorted expensive disasters -- would she balance the budget with higher taxes or lower spending?
"All options should be considered," Ms. Brown murmured.
 
A Stand or a Pose?
 Such haziness will not be tolerated indefinitely, Dan Schnur, a top aide to Governor Wilson, predicted. Posters of Mr. Wilson wearing Mickey Mouse ears now adorn lamp posts in Sacramento. But the wounded Governor could be an unintended beneficiary if President Clinton succeeds in righting the economy.
Mr. Schnur has already created a line for television describing what he sees as Ms. Brown's reluctance to take substantive positions on difficult issues: "Some people take a stand. Kathleen strikes a pose."
But she strikes it with panache, as she did at the Wells Fargo Bank branch, where she bought $250 in bonds for each of her grandchildren.
As Ms. Brown checked the shoulder of her fuchsia suit for drool, 11-month-old Katherine Brown Armstrong teethed on a bond application and her twin, Brendan Arthur, pretended to yak on the telephone.
 
Easy Questions First
 The first question by the assembled local reporters -- "What year will the twins be eligible to run for governor?" -- was a real softball, and Ms. Brown laughed with everyone else.
Later, she basked in the success of this staged moment as she made her way to one of several Capitol meetings about California's bleak economic picture, its bad credit rating and its cash crisis, which for the second year will leave coffers empty before the end of the fiscal year.
"Weren't they adorable?" she asked. "Now I understand why my father was so shameless about interjecting his children and his grandchildren."
Ms. Brown is the third member of the clan to aspire to California's highest office. Her father, Edmund G. (Pat) Brown, was governor from 1959 to 1967 and was considered the master builder, leaving a legacy of highways, aqueducts and schools. Her brother, Edmund G. Brown Jr., served from 1975 to 1983. Jerry Brown was considered a kind of mad genius, ahead of his time in terms of environmental regulation. Ms. Brown is said, by admirers and critics alike, to embody the best of both, with her brother's brains and her father's charm.
 
Cookie Jars and Budgets
 Politician Brown gave way to Treasurer Brown at the hearing of the Senate subcommittee, which was looking for ways to avoid repeating last summer's budget embarrassment. Using everyday analogies about empty cookie jars, Ms. Brown urged the same remedies she had proposed during last year's 63-day budget stalemate, when the state paid its bills with i.o.u.'s: realistic economic forecasts and a timely budget.
In state budget wars, the Treasurer's office is more a pulpit than a position of real authority. Still, some Wall Street analysts say that Ms. Brown's plain-spoken advice to the Governor and Legislature gave wide public attention to the often-ignored relationship between unbalanced budgets and high borrowing costs.
Ms. Brown said she sees herself as "spokesperson for the state's economic well-being." Apologizing for her immodesty, she compared herself to Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Chairman, "who is looked to with respect because of his independence and breadth of knowledge."
 
Looking to Wall Street
 Ms. Brown's primary duty is to be California's banker, managing a $22 billion investment portfolio, overseeing the sale of state bonds and representing California before the credit-rating agencies.
Along with New York City, California is one of top two issuers in the government bond market. And Ms. Brown seems to get good marks on Wall Street, where a half-dozen experts referred to her as informed, articulate and cooperative.
"Everybody says positive things for quotes because she gives out a lot of business," said Austin V. Koenen, a managing director of public finance at Morgan, Stanley & Company, who handles no California deals. But even if that were not the case, he said, "I don't think there's much negative."
Ms. Brown is widely credited with reducing a big backlog of voter-approved but unsold bonds for schools, prisons and other public works projects, thus stimulating job creation in a time of unemployment.
 
Another Governor's Opinion
 In her first bid for statewide office, against Tom Hayes in 1990, Ms. Brown was elected Treasurer by fewer than 300,000 votes. Her earlier public service had been modest -- sitting on the Los Angeles boards of education and public works, with a hiatus as a bond lawyer for the firm of O'Melveny & Myers.
In hoping to use the Treasurer's post as a springboard to higher office, Ms. Brown is following the path of Gov. Ann W. Richards of Texas.
In a telephone interview, Governor Richards said, "It's an office that shows you have financial skills, which is something the public is looking for these days in an elected official."
Because municipal finance remains a relatively arcane subject, Ms. Brown is less vulnerable to public second-guessing than is Mr. Garamendi. As Insurance Commissioner, he is responsible for turning a voter initiative for reduced automobile insurance rates into a workable program, but the popular measure is bottled up in the courts.
 
'Everyone Has an Opinion'
 Bruce Cain, the associate director of the Institute for Governmental Studies at the University of California at Berkeley, said public cynicism over the insurance measure would make Mr. Garamendi "an easy target" at election time.
Ms. Brown compares that sort of scrutiny to her experience on the Board of Education. "Everyone has an opinion about how the schools should run, how teachers should teach and how Johnny should learn," she said. "Yes, the Treasurer's job is less understood."
As she talks, Ms. Brown is loping, without pocketbook or attache case, across the Capitol grounds, eating her daily frozen yogurt and enjoying the camelias of early spring. There is a naturalness to her, a willingness to come to work with her hair still damp from the shower, that contradicts her studied political polish.
Bernice Brown, Ms. Brown's 84-year-old mother, says that "everyone likes Kathy" because she does things like write thank-you notes and send gifts. She recently delivered a teddy bear to Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, another possible opponent in the Democratic primary, upon the birth of his first grandchild.
 
Liked Even by Rivals
 Mrs. Brown seems to be right about her daughter's likability, and Republicans are almost apologetic about their affection for her.
"She has a nice way about her, and I happen to like her," said Steven A. Merksamer, a Republican strategist and chief of staff to former Gov. George Deukmejian.
Clearly, Ms. Brown both loves and excels at press-the-flesh campaigning, which she has done for her father, brother or herself for as long as she can remember. Last year, when she tepidly supported Jerry's quixotic run for the Presidency, she said she did not have time to campaign for him, given the duties of her job. Instead, she toured the far corners of the state in support of Congressional and state legislative candidates.
There, she collected political i.o.u.'s and nurtured memories of a lifetime on the rubber-chicken circuit.
"There's no substitute for being in Bakersfield, at the Dorothy Donahue Dinner, when they give the Just Because You're You Award," she said. "It's one of my most favorite things in the world. There's a connectedness. It makes me feel with my roots and with the people of California."

HEADLINE: Guilty Plea By Baxter On Boycott

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 25

 BODY:
Baxter International Inc., the world's largest medical supplies company, agreed today to the stiffest punishments the Government has ever meted out to an American business for cooperating with Arab countries in their longstanding economic boycott of Israel.
But experts say the outcome of the three-year investigation may only serve to underscore how difficult it has been to enforce the Federal laws that forbid American companies to honor economic boycotts that the United States does not sanction. 
 Baxter, the first company to face criminal charges of violating the anti-boycott law, pleaded guilty to one violation. It will pay the maximum $500,000 fine. The Government and Baxter also said that the company and two subsidiaries would pay nearly $6 million in penalties and accept a two-year ban on new exports to Syria and Saudia Arabia to settle related civil complaints filed by the Commerce Department.
 
Trying to Get Off a List
 Baxter admitted to the Commerce Department that it had violated provisions of the law that would prohibit it from providing the Arab nations with details of its business dealings with Israel and of its charitable contributions there. Baxter violated the laws in an effort to get off an Arab blacklist that had limited its business opportunities in the Middle East. The company first learned in 1975 that it had been placed on the blacklist; in 1989, it was told it had been removed.
Baxter also announced today that it had settled three shareholder lawsuits contending that its activities had hurt the value of its stock.
The criminal settlement was by far the toughest imposed on an American company since the passage in 1977 of the first law forbidding cooperation with the boycott. In the largest case prior to Baxter's, Safeway Stores Inc. paid just under $1 million in 1988 but did not admit any wrongdoing. A total of 30 cases were settled last year for about $2.1 million.
 
The Government's View
 "Those who choose profits over adherence to American law must now recognize the commitment of the Departments of Justice and Commerce to enforce the statute," said Joan Bainbridge Safford, the Acting United States Attorney here. That commitment had been questioned by a number of critics during the Reagan and Bush Administrations."
Despite the ground broken by the three-year investigation, the power of the statute to punish companies remains limited. Baxter said that it would set aside $7.5 million in the current quarter to cover its financial liabilities in the matter but that it expected no material impact on this year's earnings. Baxter earned $436 million on sales of $8.47 billion in 1992.
"Other companies will take note of this because of the size, but it shows that bad publicity is still the Government's major weapon," said Joseph Kamalick, publisher of the Boycott Law Bulletin, a Houston newsletter.
Baxter said today that it had never intentionally violated the laws. It stressed that despite its guilty pleas, the Commerce Department did not formally find that it had violated the laws. Baxter officials say that the lack of such a finding will allow it to continue to do business in New York City and New York State, both of which forbid public institutions to do business with companies found to have violated these laws.
The stock market shrugged off the news. Baxter's shares ended at $29.50, down 12.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. "The odds are that investors are right in thinking it won't have any impact," said Kenneth S. Abramowitz, who follows the company for Sanford C. Bernstein.
Jewish groups said they were pleased with the announcements today. Henry Siegman, executive director of the American Jewish Congress in Washington, said the penalties were a sign that the Clinton Administration intended to pursue enforcement of the law. He also praised Baxter for stating that it opposed the boycott and for stressing its ongoing business ties to Israel.
 
Dealings With Israel
 Baxter, which is based in Deerfield, Ill., said it was "particularly pleased that the Government's investigation did not find that Baxter had refused to do business with Israel, as some have alleged." It said that its sales to Israel last year, at $6 million, were almost double those to any other Middle East nation.
"We think it is in the best interest of the company, our employees, and Israel to get these matters behind us," said Geoffrey Fenton, a company spokesman, when asked why the company had abandoned its stand that it had not violated the laws.
The civil and criminal investigations of Baxter grew out of reports in the late 1980's and in 1990 that the company had closed a manufacturing plant in Israel, had illegally provided information via the Syrian Army to the Arab League, a Damascus-based organization that coordinates the boycott, and had offered discounted products amounting to bribes to various Arab nations in an effort to get off the league's blacklist of companies that do business with Israel.
The league has urged members not to trade with companies on the list as a way of putting pressure on multinational companies to collaborate with the Arab boycott of Israel.
The criminal charge stemmed from a letter written Feb. 25, 1988, by G. Marshall Abbey, the company's general counsel, to the Syrian Army Supply Department. That letter provided Syria with numerous items of information it had requested about Baxter's activities in Israel. Syria had requested the information in response to an earlier letter from the company asking that Baxter be removed from the blacklist.
As part of the settlements, Mr. Abbey agreed to pay the Commerce Department $100,100.
The Justice Department said the evidence did not prove the more serious charges against the company that had been leveled by critics. For example, the critics had said that Baxter sold its profitable manufacturing plant in Ashdod, Israel, in 1988 as part of its efforts to get off the blacklist; Baxter said the plant was sold because it had poor growth prospects. Nor was there substantial evidence, the Justice Department said, that Baxter had paid bribes to Arab officials to get taken off the list.
 
Funneling Money
 The settlement papers, however, paint a picture of a company that repeatedly violated the law by knowingly furnishing information -- actions that Baxter's outside lawyers had warned might be violations -- and by failing to report Syrian requests for information.
The documents outline discussions by company employees about how to funnel "fees" and "penalty" money to Arab officials whom it expected to help get it off the blacklist. In one letter, Mr. Abbey stated that he was risking violating the law.
In one case, a Baxter employee negotiated a plan to provide $3 million of Baxter products to a Syrian company for $1 million as a way of getting $2 million into the hands of Syrians expected to be helpful.

HEADLINE: Dow Up 15.94 for Its First Gain of the Week

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
Investors returned to blue-chip issues yesterday as the political crisis in Russia appeared to cool, igniting a fairly strong and broad-based advance after three losing sessions.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 15.94 points to end at 3,461.32, thanks to a rebound in several Dow components including Westinghouse, United Technologies and Eastman Kodak. 
 In Russia, President Boris N. Yeltsin's main rival, the speaker of the Parliament, Ruslan Khasbulatov, retreated yesterday from a demand for Mr. Yeltsin's removal, but the confrontation between the Congress of Deputies and Mr. Yeltsin remains.
 
'Source of Anxiety'
 The Russian crisis 'is a sword of Damocles hanging over the market,' said Harry W. Laubscher, senior vice president-market analyst at Tucker Anthony Inc. in New York City. 'It's going to be a continuing source of anxiety, but for now investors are going to look at basic economic issues and trends here at home."
The Dow dropped several points in the last half-hour of trading as several computerized sell programs went into effect and some traders sought to take short-term profits "in case something happens overnight" in Russia, Mr. Laubscher said.
Dennis E. Jarrett, chief market analyst for Kidder, Peabody & Company, noted that despite the generally positive market, investors seemed to be quite cautious in their stock choices. 'It's a situation-by-situation kind of day," he said.
Eugene E. Peroni, director of technical research at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia, said that recent trading had been in a fairly narrow range and that he expected much wider swings in the next few sessions and certainly within the next two weeks.
 
A Drop in Volume
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 251.5 million shares, down from 274.9 million on Wednesday. Advances led declines 1,149 to 741.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index of all listed common stocks rose 1.42 points, to 248.33. The average share gained 20 cents.
 Investors appeared to be searching for bargains, especially in the battered pharmaceutical group. Merck, whose stock plunged Wednesday after announcing 1993 earnings would be at the low end of analysts' projections, was up 3/4, to 35 1/2. Abbot Laboratories rose 3/8, to 24 3/8, and Upjohn rose 5/8, to 28 3/4.
Westinghouse led the Big Board's most-active list; the company said there was no news that would account for the heavier-than-normal trading of 7.4 million shares. Westinghouse rose 1, to 15 3/8.
Analysts noted that several companies that make up the Dow Jones industrial average were up 1 point or more, including Texaco and J. P. Morgan. The arithmetic of the Dow means that a 1 point rise in a stock tends to raise the overall average 2 points, analysts said.
In Big Board trading, Cabletron Systems climbed 4 7/8, to 87 5/8, after the maker of computer software and hardware systems reported record quarterly earnings and sales.
Shares of the Student Loan Marketing Association, or Sallie Mae, rose 1, to 43 5/8, despite a vote in the Senate backing President Clinton's proposal for the Government to make direct loans to students.
 Philip Morris fell 1 1/8, to 61 1/2. Morgan Stanley was said to have cut its estimates and growth rate on the company.
 Shares of Getty Petroleum rose 2, to 12 1/8, after the operator of gasoline stations said its profit doubled in the latest quarter.
Shares of Charles Schwab jumped 2 3/4, to 36 3/8, on composite volume of 291,600 shares. The brokerage firm, coming off record earnings in 1992, raised its quarterly dividend 25 percent and declared a 3-for-2 stock split.
In Nasdaq trading, Oracle Systems rose 1 1/8, to 36 7/8; Cisco Systems climbed 3 1/2, to 45; Adaptec was up 4 1/8, to 26, and Intel rose 1 1/8, to 115 3/8.
 The Nasdaq composite index outperformed the Dow index, as technology shares rose sharply. It ended up 6.65 points, at 681.01.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 2.80, to 450.87. The American Stock Exchange index was up 0.84, to 419.12.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
New York City officials yesterday created two new business improvement districts, including one on Fifth Avenue. Mayor David N. Dinkins signed two bills giving businesses the right to raise money among themselves to complement city services like cleaning streets and increasing security. One bill designated the area along Fifth Avenue from 46th to 61st Streets and includes properties on 57th Street from the Avenue of the Americas to Madison Avenue. The other in Queens, the Woodhaven Business Improvement District, covers Jamaica Avenue from Eldert Lane to 100th Street.

HEADLINE: Caracas Journal;
New in the Seat of Power: A Two-Fisted Radical

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela

 BODY:
Black in a land dominated by Latins, a political outsider who founded his own underground party, Aristobulo Izturiz Almeida is the kind of visitor who could rattle the crystal chandeliers of Caracas's ornate city hall.
Only a few months ago, Mr. Izturiz got into a fistfight with bank guards in an attempt to block the sale of part of Venezuela's state telephone company to an American-led consortium. 
 But in January the 46-year-old militant unionist came in from the streets. Today, in his new office, elegant with gold leaf and stained glass, Mr. Izturiz gives orders as the Mayor of Caracas.
"The established parties are deteriorating," Mr. Izturiz said to explain his upset victory last December on the ticket of his now legal party, Radical Cause. "They are losing credibility. I have absolute confidence that we will win the presidency next December."
 
Faring Well in the Polls
 The same popular revolt that made Mr. Izturiz the Mayor of Venezuela's most populous city is making Andres Velasquez, the Radical Cause candidate, the fastest rising contender in public opinion polls before the December presidential election. Campaigning on a clean government slate, Mr. Velasquez, a state governor, now places second in surveys after Rafael Caldera, a 77-year-old former President, who is losing appeal.
The voter revolt follows a year that saw more than 1,400 street protests and two violent coup attempts against the Government of Carlos Andres Perez.
[The Supreme Court agreed in mid-March to review a petition by Attorney General Ramon Escovar Salom to try Mr. Perez on charges of embezzling $17 million.]
Bitter over economic austerity and unpunished corruption, voters in December delivered Mr. Perez's governing Democratic Action party its worst electoral setback in its 51-year history. Opposition control of state governorships increased from one-half to two-thirds. And in South America's oldest democracy, only half of the electorate voted.
With the presidential race channeling political pressure into half a dozen campaigns, most people interviewed here predicted that Mr. Perez would survive his final year in office.
"I am sure that CAP will finish his presidential term," said Alberto Mansueti, the executive director of a political research foundation, referring to the President by his initials. "But I am not so sure his successor will."
 
Constant Rumors of a Coup
 The year is off to a rocky start for Venezuela, the second largest foreign supplier of oil to the United States after Saudi Arabia.
In February, army troops occupied two state capitals where riots broke out after candidates of the governing party rejected fraud charges and claimed victories. The Supreme Court is to rule on the validity of the elections in those two states, Barinas and Sucre.
Of about 3,000 soldiers and civilians arrested after the two coup attempts all were released except 125, who were tried and convicted by an emergency tribunal. [In mid-March the Supreme Court threw out the convictions.]
Reflecting military unrest, 60 soldiers rebelled in January, briefly seizing the commander of Venezuela's military police as a hostage. In Caracas newspapers, rumors of coup attempts are routine.
"A lot of officers are asking themselves, 'Why am I supporting this situation?' " Francisco Efrain Visconti, a Venezuelan Air Force general who led a coup attempt in November, said in a recent interview in Lima, Peru, where he lives in exile. "If measures aren't taken, there will be a civilian explosion."
 
Military Problem 'Latent'
 Demonstrating a shared rejection of Venezuela's status quo, a Radical Cause congressman traveled to Lima to hold a joint news conference with the exiled rebel.
"The military problem is latent," Mr. Izturiz warned here. "It's like heart disease -- the heart attack could come at any moment."
The rebel soldiers and the Radical Cause civilians share economic views that are nationalist and statist and deep anger over corruption.
"The political and economic ruling classes are submitting to the schemes of foreign financial institutions, above all North American, and to the tyranny of the International Monetary Fund," General Visconti wrote in a recent essay about his "civilian-military movement."
"There is no human being in the country that does not feel beaten down by the effects of the brutal economic policy imposed by the I.M.F.," he wrote.
The general neglected to mention that Venezuela's oil sales, the country's primary source of income, dropped by 20 percent in dollar terms over the last three years. In another essay by the coup plotters, they call for reversing Mr. Perez's free-market policies and restoring controls on imports and on foreign exchange.
Anger over the economy fuels much of the protest here.
On paper, 1992 was another banner year for Venezuela. The country attracted $2 billion in new foreign investment and recorded economic growth of 7.3 percent.
 
Spreading the Wealth
 But deflating these numbers, 71 percent of Venezuelans responding to a poll in January said the economy worsened in 1992. Most investment and growth is in the capital-intensive oil industry, which creates relatively few new jobs.
The feeling is widespread that Mr. Perez's free-market policies violate deeply held beliefs that Venezuela's large state economy exists to spread the oil wealth.
"Wealth is not something that has to be produced, but something simply given," concludes a recent survey of public attitudes by the Fundacion Libertas, a free-market group here. "In the popular mind, work and wealth have nothing to do with each other. Individual wealth is seen as the result of proximity to the distribution process, not of proximity to the production process."
In this environment, Mr. Izturiz has no regrets over his quixotic, bare-knuckled attempt to block the sale of the state telephone company to a foreign consortium lead by GTE.
"Hotels, banks and sugar plantations can be privatized," he said. "But basic and strategic industries, like oil and telephones, should remain in the hands of the state."

HEADLINE: Senate Approves First Step In President's Budget Plan

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25

 BODY:
Voting along party lines, the Senate today approved a five-year budget outline that is almost identical to what President Clinton proposed last month and what the House passed last week.
In a telephone conversation with Senate leaders after the vote, Mr. Clinton called it a remarkable achievement, and said, "Finally we've done something to break the gridlock." 
 Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic leader, also basked in the victory. "The American people made a choice last November," he said on the Senate floor. "I think the American people want change, and this Senate has taken a step toward giving it to them."
But while the vote was doubtless a victory for the new Administration and the Democratic majority in Congress, the measure, which is called a budget resolution, is no more than a skeleton. The first step in the Congressional budget process, it merely establishes how much money will be spent and how much revenue will be raised each year.
The meat and the muscle -- which taxes will be raised and cut, and how much money will be spent on each Government program -- will be determined by subsequent legislation.
 
'The Hard Part Starts'
 "Now the hard part starts," said Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader. "We start shooting with real bullets from now on."
The Senate approved the measure by 54 to 45. Only two Democrats, Bob Krueger of Texas and Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, voted against it. Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii was absent. All 43 Republicans voted "no."
After the vote, the Senate turned at once to Mr. Clinton's plan to spend an additional $16 billion over two years to stimulate the economy and create jobs. The debate will last for days, and any number of amendments may be adopted. But in the end, Congress will probably approve the stimulus plan without substantial change.
The budget resolution is supposed to shrink the Federal deficit by a total of slightly more than $500 billion over five years. On an annual basis, the deficit, now about $300 billion, would be cut to below $200 billion in the fiscal year 1997, the last of Mr. Clinton's term.
The deficit reduction would be slightly greater than what the House approved. The differences between the House and Senate measures will be worked out in a conference committee, probably next week. Congressional leaders hope to pass the final version before the recess for Easter and Passover begins on April 2.
 
Change of Course
 More important than the details of the resolutions, the debate in the Senate and the one in the House last week showed conclusively that the Government is on a different course from the one followed for the last 12 years. Taxes will be raised. The military budget will be cut. More money will spent for a host of programs that languished with Republicans in the White House.
Much of the six days of debate in the Senate was spent on extraneous issues or political hot potatoes like an increase in taxes on some Social Security benefits. But the underlying issue, this change of course, was never far below the surface.
Senator Mitchell framed it in the floor debate on Wednesday night, when the Senate was discussing an alternative Republican budget that included no tax increase and would have allowed more spending for the military and much less for domestic programs than the Democrats favor.
"So the issue is very simple here," he said. "If you like the status quo, if you like the economic policies of the past four years, if you do not think there ought to be any change in this country's policies, if you want to keep going the way we have been going in the last years, piling up this impossibly high debt and telling the American people there are not any problems and we can do this all in a very easy way -- why, if you believe that, then you vote for this substitute amendment.
"But if you think this country ought to change the course it is on, if you think this country ought to have a different economic policy, if you think this country ought to have a policy that looks to the future, not the past, if you think that President Clinton ought to have a chance, just a chance, to get started in office, then you ought to defeat this substitute amendment and pass this budget resolution."
 
Angle of Attack
 Senator Dole, who has probably invested more political capital over the last decade than any other politician in the cause of shrinking the budget deficit, did not really take issue with Mr. Mitchell's view that the debate was over two divergent philosophies. He just said, over and over, that he thought Democrats were attacking the problem from the wrong angle, raising taxes rather than making deep cuts in spending.
"I think this is a big mistake we have just made," he said after the vote this afternoon. "We've got a pretty good recovery under way. We don't want to stifle it."
Sometimes Senate debates build to a peak as the final vote approaches. Not today.
The 50 hours allotted for the debate ended Wednesday evening with at least two dozen amendments still pending. So on Wednesday night and for almost three hours this morning, the Senate took up amendments every 10 minutes, almost all of them offered by Republicans, and killed them on party-line votes with no debate whatsoever, without even a description of what they entailed.
For the Republican Senators, it was a chance to cast votes that would look good on the record and to force the Democrats to cast votes that might be used against them in the next election.
For instance, Senator Dirk Kempthorne of Idaho proposed cutting financing for Congress by 25 percent. His colleague from Idaho, Larry E. Craig, proposed excluding hydroelectric power from the energy tax.
Even if amendments like those had been adopted, they would not have had the force of law, since the sole purpose of a budget resolution is to set only broad outlines, not details. But they could have proved useful in campaign commercials.
The final vote was taken without even a word summing up the six days of debate.

HEADLINE: Fed Chief's Loan Hopes For Small Businesses

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, expressed optimism today that lending to small business would soon increase as banks were willing to take more risks.
Testifying before the House Committee on Small Business, Mr. Greenspan was not ready to declare the credit crunch over, however, saying, "I find reasons for optimism but not complacency." 
 The Fed chairman said that there has been a modest increase in business loans this winter and that the recent improvement in economic growth could soon lead to a further pickup in lending.
He said that because bank earnings and their capital basis were up, "banks are patently in a strong position to meet" the expected increase in demand for loans.
"Our surveys and other information indicate that banks' attitudes toward loans and risk taking are improving," he said.
 
Banks' Progress Praised
 Mr. Greenspan said the banking industry as a whole has made "remarkable progress" in working through its "severe portfolio problems" during a period of weak economic growth.
He noted that banks had written off $125 billion in bad loans over the last five years, causing many of them to adopt stricter lending standards and creating a credit squeeze.
The Fed chief praised President Clinton's announcement on March 10 easing regulations on bank lending. These measures would reduce the amount of paperwork required for many loans, make it easier to grant loans based on a borrower's character, and ease requirements on assessing real estate used as collateral in small loans.
As he often has before, Mr. Greenspan said legislation in recent years has gone too far in regulating banks, adding that the laws had discouraged lending by increasing paperwork and raising costs.
 
'A Chilling Effect'
 "Each new proposed piece of detailed banking legislation has to be evaluated in advance," he said, "to determine what the impacts are likely to be on the health, vigor and competitiveness of the banking system."
Mr. Greenspan complained that these laws had "resulted in a drumbeat" of requirements.
"Such micro-management," he said, "has a chilling effect on bank lending attitudes, imparting a high degree of management uncertainty while the implementing rules are developed, debated and adopted."
The Fed chairman said many examiners had become overzealous in their regulation after they were criticized for being too lax in the 1980's. Another factor discouraging lending, he said, is that commercial real estate remained weak, so that banks often do not feel confident that they know what the collateral of their loans is worth.
He said that until the amount of real estate transactions picked up, bankers would not feel confident about the value of property used to secure existing or new loans. This, he said, has colored business confidence in general, adding, "I am still concerned that a real estate market that has not found its feet is retarding the availability of small-business credit."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Auction Again Fails to Lift Bonds

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
For the second consecutive day, the Treasury held a successful auction that did not give the market a lift. The result was that the price of the 30-year bond slumped 13/32 yesterday and the yield rose to 6.85 percent, not too far from the 6.89 percent top of its three-week trading range.
"Customers are beginning to feel that the bull market has run out of steam," said Steven R. Ricchiuto, chief financial economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. "They are a little more yield-sensitive because they are developing a trading-range mentality." 
 This trading-range mentality is likely to continue until at least next Friday, when the Labor Department issues the employment report for March. If the jobs data indicate that economic growth is solid, yields could jump over 7 percent. But if the data are weak, yields could move toward new lows.
The decline in long Treasury securities, including the 10-year note, came on the day that the Senate approved President Clinton's budget outline, which includes the promise of major deficit reduction over the next five years.
 
Investors Becoming Leery?
 But while the promise of this deficit reduction has contributed to the rally that pushed the yield on the 30-year bond to a 16-year low of 6.72 percent on March 8, Mr. Ricchiuto suggested that some investors were becoming a little more leery of the promise now.
He said that the revision of budget estimates by the Congressional Budget Office, which cut the size of Mr. Clinton's promised deficit reduction, and the bidding war that followed in Congress for more spending cuts, has made some investors wonder what really will be accomplished.
Yesterday's approval also reminded investors and traders alike that the budget resolution that was approved was only an outline and promise of what is to be done. The actual votes on tax increases and spending cuts still have to be cast.
The initial reaction to the Treasury's successful auction of $11 billion in five-year notes was positive. The prices of bonds and notes, which had declined in the morning and the early afternoon, bounced up enough to erase all or some of their losses. But then the prices began to fall again.
"The initial reaction was fairly good," said Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates. "But when they delved into the numbers and realized that it was a dealer-dominated auction, that tempered the price auction," he said.
Mr. McCarthy noted that most of the auction was bought by dealers from New York and that it also appeared that only a few dealers got a large part of the five-year notes sold.
 
May Cut Prices
 Because dealers -- as opposed to institutional investors -- bought most of the notes, there will be a period when dealers move the notes to customers. And this kind of supply bulge can weigh on prices because dealers do not like to get caught with too much supply in a sluggish market and they may cut prices.
The five-year notes were awarded at a single yield of 5.19 percent. The coupon on the notes, which mature in March 1998, is 5.125 percent. By the end of trading, the yield had inched up to 5.21 percent, which may already reflect the effort of dealers trying to pass them on to customers by lowering the price, which moves in the opposite direction of the yield.
 
New York Issue
 The prices of tax-exempt bonds declined about 1/4 to 3/8 point yesterday as the flood of new issues continued in response to low interest rates. About $1.3 billion of new bonds were sold, according to Bloomberg Business News.
The New York Local Government Assistance Corporation, which was established in 1990 to help finance local government operations, moved yesterday to take advantage of the lower interest rates and save some money. It priced $352.8 million of refunding revenue bonds that will be used to pay off older, higher-interest- rate bonds.
The refunding revenue bonds were initially priced through Morgan Stanley & Company to yield a maximum 5.95 percent for a bond due in 2021, with serial bond yields ranging from 4.55 percent in 1999 to 5.65 percent in 2008. Another long maturity was priced to yield 5.92 percent for an issue due in 2016.
Underwriters, who said the bonds were rated A+ by Fitch Investors Service, are expecting a single-A rating by Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
Following are the results from the Treasury's five-year-note auction yesterday:

HEADLINE: Unit Says Budget Balanced, but It Faults Dinkins

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
The state agency that monitors New York City's fiscal health said yesterday that the city would achieve its 13th consecutive balanced budget this year, but it warned that the Dinkins administration was not doing enough to solve long-term problems and faced a grimly rising fever line of multibillion-dollar deficits over the next four years.
In an evaluation of a budget plan issued by the city in January, the state's Financial Control Board said City Hall had balanced a $30.3 billion budget for the 1993 fiscal year ending next June 30 with $245 million left over from 1992 and $675 million in savings devices that will not be available in the 1994 to 1997 fiscal years. 
 Despite an improving economy, the board said, prospects for closing future budget gaps are bleak. Spending is higher and growing faster, and revenues are lower and growing more slowly than last year, it said. By freezing taxes, raising wages and easing targets for cutting its work force, it said, the city missed chances to cut projected deficits ranging from $2.1 billion in 1994 to $4.2 billion in 1997.
"The critical problems causing persistent billion-dollar gaps remain largely unaddressed or unabated by this financial plan," the board said in a 79-page report. "Indeed, the gaps to be closed over the next four years are larger than they were in the financial plan one year ago."
 
City Officials Disagree
 Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel and the city's Budget Director, Philip R. Michael, said the report had focused excessively on projections years off and subject to so many changes -- in the economy and in state and Federal aid, for example -- that they were hard to predict. They said the Dinkins administration, despite the recession, had balanced its budgets and hoped to continue doing so.
Mr. Steisel said the state could help by relieving the city of "crushing" Medicaid expenses, as promised, a point that he said the report had failed to emphasize. He also said tax increases and cuts in services might be needed, but they could be avoided with adequate state and Federal aid. "We remain committed to long-term structural stability," Mr. Steisel said.
Mr. Michael called the report "unrealistic" and "simplistic" in projecting future budget problems, and added: "We have shown an ability to deal with each and every one of those problems and there is no reason to question our resolve or ability to deal with them in the future."
The criticisms of the control board, which was created during the city's fiscal crisis in the 1970's and has the power to take over city finances in an emergency, are hardly new. The board has said repeatedly in recent years that the city has not done enough to secure long-term fiscal stability.
The core problem is that revenues, held down by a poor economy, are not keeping pace with expenses, and the gap -- worsened by rising costs in welfare, education, hospitals and other unavoidable areas -- continues to widen in projections for future years.
By not cutting its work force of 211,000 more sharply, by stretching its debt further into the future, by using a previous year's surplus for current expenses, by relying on many spending cuts that are good for only one year and do not achieve permanent savings, the city has not provided long-term solutions to its fiscal problems, the board said.
"In the past year, the city's problems have steadily gotten larger," Allen J. Proctor, the board's executive director, said in an interview. "Every action has been focused on balancing this year's budget, but the city has not made any inroads in dealing with these larger problems."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains on Concerns Over the Standoff in Russia

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended higher yesterday against most leading foreign currencies except the yen. Traders bought the Japanese currency to take advantage of a plunge the previous day.
Activity was thin on the eve of important new developments in Russia's power standoff and was broadly influenced by heavy cross-selling of German marks for yen. 
 The mark selling gave the dollar enough momentum to advance against the German currency into a new key trading range.
 
Gold Gains
 Gold rose in world markets. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery closed at $332.70 an ounce, up 20 cents. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid of $332.50 an ounce, up 30 cents from late Wednesday.
Financial markets were waiting for today's session of the Russian Congress to consider ousting President Boris N. Yeltsin for his decision to call an April referendum to determine who rules Russia. The Congress opposes the referendum.
Some traders were buying dollars ahead of the weekend, not wanting to get caught short amid the Russian volatility. Traders were also uncertain of whether Germany would press ahead with another interest rate cut, which would help the dollar by hurting the value of mark-denominated investments.
The "vote in Russia is keeping people not wanting to go home short dollars," Earl Johnson, vice president at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank, said. Traders said the uncertainty helped the dollar trade above 1.6400 marks, higher than its recent trading range of 1.6250 to 1.6380 marks.
In European trading, the dollar ended at 1.6425 German marks, up from 1.6279. At 4 P.M. in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.6420 marks, up from 1.6375 marks late Wednesday.
The dollar rose overseas against the yen, but fell in New York. In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 117.15 yen, up 1.22 yen from Wednesday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 117.35 yen. In New York at 4 P.M. the dollar was quoted at 117.30 yen, down from late Wednesday's 117.65 yen.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.4735, from $1.4825 late Wednesday. Later in New York it fetched $1.4750, less than late Wednesday's $1.4770.
Other late dollar rate in New York, compared with late Wednesday, included: 1.5205 Swiss francs, up from 1.5155; 5.5835 French francs, up from 5.5685; 1,603.00 Italian lire, up from 1,596.00, and $1.2442 (Canadian), up from $1.2430 (Canadian).
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday's levels, were: 1.6425 marks, up from 1.6279; 1.5225 Swiss francs, up from 1.5085; 5.5830 French francs, up from 5.5425; 1.8455 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8310; 1,603.00 lire, up from 1,592.50, and $1.2439 (Canadian), down from $1.2445 (Canadian).

3 African Leaders and David Frost

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
South Africa's three pre-eminent political figures are honored tonight by the attentions of David Frost. You may not learn much that is new from the encounters, but it is an opportunity to catch their election-year styles, along with the style of the recently dubbed Sir David himself.
Mr. Frost is most businesslike in his opening conversation with the Zulu chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, whose members have been involved in bloody encounters with supporters of Nelson Mandela and his African National Congress. The longtime rivals blame each another for their failure of communication. Mr. Frost, like an imperial emissary to feuding tribesmen, advises, "The sooner the two of you get together, the better." 
 One issue has to do with arrangements for the South African economy. In this election season, Mr. Mandela says that his organization has always advocated free enterprise, that it has moved away from its advocacy of nationalization of certain industries and that its Communist Party allies will be only a tiny minority of its election list.
President F. W. de Klerk uses most of his time to deliver a stump speech on his desire for consensus, unity, stability, peace and economic growth, from which neither Mr. Buthelezi nor Mr. Mandela dissents.
Like other interviewers faced with the estimable Mr. Mandela, who is given the most time tonight, Mr. Frost adopts a Barbara Walters mode: "And when was there a moment when you decided this was going to be your whole life, fighting for a free South Africa?"
Mr. Mandela reminisces, fairly interestingly, about his years of imprisonment and says he would be willing to serve in any capacity under an elected Government. "What a very interesting and generous offer," Mr. Frost allows, and ends the talk by assuring Mr. Mandela that his wish to be remembered as a "man who has done his duty on earth" will be granted. Being knighted evidently confers powers over history.
 
'The Un-Americans'
 A&E, tonight at 8
The unedifying history of America's crackdown on Communists and so-called security risks is told tonight from the point of view of some of the scores of people who were jailed and the thousands who lost their jobs between the late 1940's and the early 60's. Some say they were victims of mistaken identity or political vendettas; the admitted Communists say they were idealists who were guilty, at worst, of being stupid about Stalin. Admire them or not, very few had committed anything resembling a crime.
As an early reference to "vigilantes and victims" suggests, the two-hour treatment is in accord with a rote leftist mythology that portrays Communists as radicals with a human face and leaves out the many anti-Communist liberals and conservatives who fought the rampages of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy and the House Committee on Un-American Activities. Nonetheless, the newsreels of the time are reminders of the poisonous spirit that infected the land.
The cruel crookedness of it all is personified in a concluding interview with Harvey J. Matusow, an admitted con artist who made a career first as an ex-Communist informer and then as an exposer of the informer racket and finally as a stand-up comedian.
 
'Here's Looking at You, Warner Brothers'
 TNT, tomorrow at 8 P.M.
This two-hour celebration of the studio that Jack, Harry, Sam and Albert Warner built tells little about movie making in what is accurately enough known as Hollywood's golden age, but anyone with a weakness for icons in action should get their money's worth. The puffy anecdotal narration by Clint Eastwood, Barbra Streisand and others serves mainly to link star turns, from Rin-Tin-Tin's to Robert Redford's.
Sure, you've seen most of these big moments from the big years of the big studio before (although John Barrymore as Captain Ahab was new to me), but so what? There's Edward G. Robinson expiring with the line "Mother of mercy, is this the end of Rico?" and Paul Muni fading into a black night with "I steal." There's Bugs Bunny slipping out of tight scrapes and Errol Flynn ("All right, my hearties, follow me!") battling out of them. There's Ruby Keeler in Busby Berkeley mosaics. There's James Cagney pushing women around and Bette Davis kicking men around. There's Humphrey Bogart turning tough toward Mary Astor, going soft over Ingrid Bergman and being provoked by Lauren Bacall. And, as they say, much more.
You can also see or tape several of the scenes in context this weekend, as TNT will be showing, mostly in the early morning hours, "The Jazz Singer," "The Sea Hawk," "The Public Enemy," "I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang," "The Big Sleep," "Key Largo," "Destination Tokyo" and "Now, Voyager," in which, yes, Paul Henreid lights that cigarette for Bette Davis.

 'In Transit'
 New Museum of Contemporary Art
 583 Broadway (near Prince Street)
 SoHo
 Through April 11
"In Transit" is a show whose reach far exceeds its grasp. With works by a host of artists -- among them Mildred Howard, Larry Rogers, Helen Levitt, Krzysztof Wodizcko, Glenn Ligon and Aki Fujiyoshi -- addressing what the museum calls "the involuntary movement of human beings and objects through different urban spaces" and the changing nature of cities, the exhibition should be far more interesting than it is. 
 A blitz of works in a variety of media, including installations, audio and videotapes, photographs and sculptural objects, have been assembled here; approximately half were commissioned especially for the occasion, but few of the works provide much insight into the show's sociological theme.
Camilo Jose Vergara's muddy color photographs of buildings in poor neighborhoods in the United States, for example, say little new about the nature of contemporary cities. Martha Rosler takes on a worthy subject: pollution and toxic waste in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. But her installation is weighted down with seven bulky government reports, and has all the visual interest of a display about the advantages of flossing.
Some of the art is just jejune. Lois Nesbitt presents maps of New York City that record, among other things, subways she has never ridden and places in the city she has never been; these include almost everything outside of Manhattan.
Among the few highlights of the show are Margaret Morton's Piranesi-like black-and-white photographs of the cavernous railroad tunnels under Riverside Park, where homeless people gather, and Santu Mofokeng's quietly expressive photographs of life in Soweto, South Africa. But Mr. Mofokeng's pictures are shown with minimal captions, and as a result provide little specific information about their subjects.
As organized by France Morin, the New Museum's chief curator, with the help of Kostas Gounis, an anthropologist, and Dr. John Jeffries, a political economist, "In Transit" is a muddled stew of confused intentions, political posturing and mediocre art.

HEADLINE: Marines Can't Defer Aircraft Replacement

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Guide for Pentagon Budget Cuts" (editorial, March 9) offers suggestions drawn from a Congressional Budget Office report and supplies another of your own, which is, as we say in Texas, a mile wide and an inch deep. The case you present, without substantiation, is to defer buying the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft for at least a decade to save $1 billion now. The saving would be a false one. 
 The Marines need a medium-lift replacement not 10 years from now, but now. The V-22 is that replacement. The CH-46 helicopters that are in use have passed their useful life. The number of passengers allowed to be carried on them has been reduced, and the distance they are allowed to fly has been limited, all in the interest of safety. They are great helicopters, but they are old and worn out.
Keeping the CH-46's in the inventory for 10 more years without replacement would not save the $1 billion that has been designated for the V-22 because the funds would have to be spent elsewhere to help shore up the medium-lift resources of the Marines. Upgrading the CH-46's or replacing them with other helicopters will cost nearly as much as the V-22 and in addition not provide any increase in capability.
The V-22 is the proved cost-effective solution to the medium-lift requirement and for more than two dozen other joint services specialized missions. Tilt-rotors have considerable potential for civil applications, too, including flying commuter passengers from vertiports, rather than congested airports, increasing the capacity of airports at no cost.
Continuing the V-22 is a sound military and economic decision. Postponing it will cancel it. Nothing will be saved, and another significant American technological advancement will be lost.

HEADLINE: What Nicaraguan Land Claims Mean

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your correspondent in Managua again champions the "oppressed" upper classes of Nicaragua in a March 6 news article concerning the efforts to regain ownership of a house by a woman wealthy enough to have sat out the revolution in Miami. 
 The article contends that 5,000 to 6,000 people seeking the return of their property tell "an impassioned tale of frustration and injustice in pursuit of what each regards as legally his or hers." No source is provided for this number. Your correspondent raises no question about the legitimacy of these claims, many by people who gained wealth and economic power during the years of the dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle, who ruled Nicaragua as a private fiefdom for his family and cronies.
The article ignores the widely supported determination not to give property back to people associated with the Somoza dictatorship.
Your correspondent states that President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro promised all returning exiles the return of confiscated properties. The platform on which she was elected made no such promise, stating compensation would be made to owners of unjustly confiscated property.
The platform did promise that the peasants, or campesinos, would not lose land given them under land reform, a promise your correspondent is not likely to investigate as hundreds of poor campesinos, homeowners and renters are evicted from their homes and land.
President Chamorro has established a process to return land or compensate property owners with full due process. Against this process lies the intense and constant demand for land throughout the country, especially in the countryside, where Mrs. Chamorro promised demobilized Sandinista army soldiers, as well as contras laying down their arms, land and the means to work that land. Such promises have not been fulfilled.
These demands for land and for compensation for confiscated properties come at a time of extreme economic strife in Nicaragua, exacerbated by the Bush Administration's and now President Clinton's continued withholding of economic aid to Nicaragua.

HEADLINE: SPEAKER IN RUSSIA NOW VOICING DOUBT ON YELTSIN OUSTER

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 25

 BODY:
The leader of Russia's Legislature indicated on the eve of a session of the Congress of People's Deputies that he would try to head off a vote on ousting President Boris N. Yeltsin.
His statement reinforced speculation that the deputies lacked the two-thirds majority needed to vote the President out of office. But as the deputies converged on Moscow from around Russia and both sides issued their final appeals, it was evident that this would be the most contentious and fateful session of the Congress in the three years since it was elected. 
 Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, the 50-year-old Parliament Speaker, who has guided the Congress through a steadily growing power struggle with the President, declared in comments to reporters and later in a nationwide television address that he was opposed to the direct ouster of Mr. Yeltsin.
"To tell you frankly, I am not a supporter of impeachment," he told reporters. "Impeachment is the most extreme measure. I don't think that among all possible measures we should immediately talk about the most extreme one."
 
Hostility Remains
 Speaking later on national television, Mr. Khasbulatov (pronounced khahz-boo-LAH-tawff) left no doubt that his hostility to Mr. Yeltsin remained as before. He roundly criticized Mr. Yeltsin for his reforms, for purportedly trying to monopolize power, for an economic program "totally subordinated to Western influence." But he did not directly accuse the president of violating the constitution, and he said, "We didn't summon the Congress to fire anyone." Earlier, he had set the wheels in motion for the vote that could lead to the ouster of Mr. Yeltsin.
Mr. Yeltsin, appearing on television about a half hour later, struck hard and straight. Evidently sensing that the tide of battle was flowing his way, the President criticized his antagonists both in the Legislature and the Constitutional Court, accusing the former of plotting his overthrow and the latter of "political prejudice."
Sitting sternly in front of the white, blue and red Russian flag, he warned: "Remember: if the Congress adopts historically incorrect decisions, it will plunge the people into an abyss of confrontation."
 
A Different Meaning
 Many deputies were dubious that the Congress could muster the 689 votes needed to oust the President. Under Russian law, "impeachment" is not the legislative indictment understood in the United States Constitution, but a final decision to fire the President.
Russians have adopted the word "impeachment" into their language as a noun. A common expression is "golovat impichment," which means to vote impeachment.
But the People's Deputies have given ample evidence in their last eight convocations that they act in unforeseeable ways. Until the first round of procedural ballots in the Grand Palace of the Kremlin on Friday, there was no way to gauge whether Mr. Yeltsin's actions since they last met two weeks ago had intimidated or further incited the majority.
"It will be a very difficult Congress," Mr. Khasbulatov conceded.
From all sides, calls for compromise intensified, often including a call for new elections. The most dramatic came from the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, Aleksei II, who declared in a televised statement that failure to find a political settlement could lead to bloodshed or civil war.
Similar calls came, among others, from Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the former Soviet President, and the Council of Independent Trade Unions.
Mr. Khasbulatov, too, reiterated his call for simultaneous elections for the Legislature and the President, either next fall or in the spring of 1994. Mr. Yeltsin has also talked of new elections, though he has said presidential elections should follow parliamentary elections by a year, since the Congress was elected a year before him: they in March 1990 and he and Vice President Aleksandr V. Rutskoi in June 1991.
In his most recent proposals, however, Mr. Yeltsin has talked only of elections to a new bicameral Parliament with newly defined authority -- not to another 1,000-member Congress with virtually unlimited legislative powers.
Mr. Yeltsin was also probably wary of any deals with the Congress unless he could receive ironclad guarantees that the legislators would not betray him again. Last time he made an agreement with them, in December, the Congress and the Constitutional Court turned around and reneged, forcing the President into the current showdown.
 
Announcement, and Reaction
 It began last Saturday, when Mr. Yeltsin made a dramatic announcement on television calling for a vote of confidence April 25 and vastly expanded powers under a "special rule" until then. The Constitutional Court declared the measures unconstitutional and the sitting Legislature summoned a full Congress to consider ouster.
But when Mr. Yeltsin finally published the decrees on Wednesday, they turned out to have none of the measures to which the Court objected. That left the Court's chairman, Valery D. Zorkin, and Mr. Khasbulatov in an acutely uncomfortable position -- just as Mr. Yeltsin and his tacticians probably intended.
Mr. Yeltsin hammered away at the rush to judgment in his televised address. "The Constitutional Court was in such a hurry to make a decision that it did not even want to wait for the documents that I talked about to be published," he said.
Mr. Khasbulatov acknowledged in his address that the actual decree was less offensive than Mr. Yeltsin's public appeal. But he angrily dismissed this as a transparent maneuver. "We are not in kindergarten," he said.
Mr. Zorkin made no comments.
 
Met with Vice President
 But the Vice President, another prominent actor in the conflict, met with Mr. Yeltsin. Mr. Rutskoi, who would succeed Mr. Yeltsin if he were deposed, refused to support the President's measures last Saturday.
As events swirled toward a climax, the suspense was tangible. Whether the Congress voted to oust, or a compromise was found, it was clear that Russia was headed for more upheavals, struggles and tribulations.
All across Moscow and the country, scenarios were played out and people anxiously pondered where each might lead. There were reports that Mr. Yeltsin would address the Congress.
Mr. Yeltsin's chief tactician, Sergei M. Shakhrai, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, told reporters that the Congress would probably start by sorting out the vague constitutional articles dealing with ouster and succession and that Mr. Khasbulatov would next try to head off an actual vote on ouster. Most likely, he would try to set new presidential and parliamentary elections and to cancel the vote of confidence proposed by Mr. Yeltsin.
Mr. Shakhrai also said some deputies might try to dismiss the leaders of all three branches of Government.
The greatest danger was that the Congress would vote to oust Mr. Yeltsin. He has already declared that he would not step down and that the threat of violence would become real.
But even if the Congress stopped short of ousting him, there was no telling how Mr. Yeltsin would overcome resistance to his April 25 ballot or where he would find the means to finance it. And there was no telling how its results would be used, since the Congress would not recognize them.
The question was whether enough common ground remained for a compromise after the bitter recriminations of recent weeks and months.
Mr. Khasbulatov spoke repeatedly of compromise, but the condition he set in his televised address was effectively for the President to renounce his latest measures publicly.
"If there is a willingness by the President to cooperate, if he recognizes that he pushed erroneous decisions, if he works cooperatively with the Congress, I believe we can find a way out," he said.
"I will try. I will do everything that depends on me, but you know that in such complex situations the chairman is not all-powerful. If the President ties to help smooth the situation and not to aggravate it, we might reach for a serious agreement, based on which people might find new hope."
 
Broad Defense
 In general, Mr. Khasbulatov's televised statements went well beyond the immediate issues and amounted to a broad defense of what he has tried to do as chairman.
He argued that he had always defended democracy, that he always supported economic reform and was only against the economic "shock therapy" tried by Mr. Yeltsin's Government. He spoke for the first time in public of his ethnic background as a Chechen. The predominantly Muslim area of Chechnya has declared independence from Russia.
Mr. Khasbulatov said there was always "dirty propaganda" over the fact that he was not Russian, "though I must say I always thought and said that in our conditions of multinational politics we need a clear pro-Russian policy." He added, "I do this not because I am pro-Russian, but because if the Russian people feel free and secure in their own fatherland, that is the best guarantee for all ethnic minorities."
Mr. Khasbulatov's chatty performance, presented in the form of an interview with a friendly reporter, was in sharp contrast to Mr. Yeltsin's tough, terse statement.
"There are forces in the Supreme Soviet that are seeking any reason to increase confrontation," he said. "It can be said with certainty today: one of the scenarios of overthrowing the President is under way."

HEADLINE: Ending Its Secrecy, White House Lists Health-Care Panel

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26

 BODY:
After much criticism of the secrecy surrounding the work of his health policy team, President Clinton today abandoned his effort to conceal the names of more than 500 people who are developing his proposal to guarantee health insurance coverage for all Americans.
With the names of many of those people having already circulated around Washington, the White House acknowledged that its effort to keep the identities secret had failed, and it reluctantly issued a listing of all 511 staff members of the health-care task force. [The list appears on page 8.] 
 "Most of that list has been circulating around town for weeks," said Michael D. Bromberg, executive director of the Federation of American Health Systems, which represents 1,400 hospitals.
 
Secrecy Led to Errors
 Of the 511 people listed by the White House, 412 are described as full-time employees of the Government. Eighty-two are described as special, or temporary, employees. And 17 are described as consultants.
More than 130 of those described as full-time Government employees work for members of Congress or for Congressional committees.
In the past, Robert O. Boorstin, a spokesman for the Task Force on National Health Care Reform, had said the White House would not identify people working for the panel out of concern that they would be pestered by lobbyists or journalists.
But today White House spokesmen said they were making the list public now because some of the unofficial lists published or otherwise circulated had been incomplete or inaccurate.
Before today, Health Care Reform Week, published by the United Communications Group, and Health Care Policy Report, published weekly by the Bureau of National Affairs, had listed the names of many people working for the task force, which is headed by Hillary Rodham Clinton.
But White House officials said they were particularly upset when the names of 528 people supposedly working for the panel were published on the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday. The Journal tweaked the Administration by inviting "amateur Kremlinologists" to provide information on those whom the newspaper listed.
 
'The Truth Will Out'
 On March 18, Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon, a Republican from upstate New York, issued a similar unofficial list, which was then published in the Congressional Record. "This country has learned, over two centuries, that a free and unfettered exchange in public is the best medicine for any of our nation's problems," Mr. Solomon said last week. "And in the end, as the First Lady will soon learn, the truth will out."
President Clinton created the task force on Jan. 25, five days after he took office. The 12-member panel, which includes six Cabinet Secretaries, is responsible for helping him develop a plan to control health costs and to guarantee health insurance coverage for all Americans.
But most of the work is being done by staff members, the people who were identified today. The task force itself will hold its first meeting, a public hearing at George Washington University here, on Monday. Mr. Clinton has said he will submit his proposals to Congress by May 3.
The most prominent name on the list issued today is that of Ira C. Magaziner, senior adviser to the President for policy development. He is coordinating the work of the task force.
The list includes the names of many longtime employees of the Department of Health and Human Services, like Joseph Antos, Kathleen A. Buto, Barbara Gagel and James Lubitz; people who worked on Mr. Clinton's campaign team, like Judith Feder and Atul Gawande; six people identified as working for Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, and six who work for Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health.
In February, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons sued the Government in an effort to get meetings of the task force opened to the public. Kent Masterson Brown, a lawyer for the association, said tonight that he was pleased that the names of the staff members had been released.
 
Organization Remains Mystery
 But the list does not show the organization of the task force, which has more than 30 "working groups." It does not indicate who is working on which issues, and the identification of outside experts hired by the White House is often incomplete.
For example, Paul Starr is listed as being affiliated with the Department of Health and Human Services. The White House gives no indication that he is, in fact, a professor of sociology at Princeton University.
Nor does the White House disclose that Mr. Starr is in charge of a panel studying one of the most volatile issues, "short-term cost controls," which may include Federal limits on doctors' fees, hospital charges, drug prices and insurance premiums.
 
Tired of Inaccuracies
 Mr. Boorstin, the spokesman for the task force, said: "In conjunction with the public meeting of the task force, we decided to release the list. Frankly, we were tired of seeing so many inaccurate lists published in so many normally reputable places.
"The reason we originally did not release this list had nothing to do with some grand Soviet-style conspiracy," Mr. Boorstin said. "Rather, we were trying to be kind and fair to people who gave up three months of their lives to help devise health-care policy. We didn't want to subject them to the assault of lobbyists, special interests and the enthusiastic Washington press corps."
Mr. Bromberg, often described as the dean of health-care lobbyists in Washington, said: "The staff of the task force has been listening to us. But they ought to be talking to more people in the real world who have to deliver health care. Those 500 have been pretty sheltered. They are doing a good job in terms of identifying options for the President. But very few of these people ever have to treat a patient or insure one or deliver care."

HEADLINE: U.S. Asks I.M.F. to Increase Aid To Russia and to Ease Conditions

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration, working to assemble a new aid package to help President Boris N. Yeltsin, has proposed that the International Monetary Fund greatly increase its assistance to Russia.
The Administration has also suggested that the I.M.F. ease some restrictions that blocked the delivery of much of the Western aid promised last year. 
 Under a proposal that has been submitted to other Western nations, the Administration would have the monetary fund increase aid to $13.5 billion a year, Western officials said today, compared to just $1 billion out of the $8.5 billion in aid it was expected to provide a year ago.
The total amount of aid proposed last year for Russia by the fund, the United States and the six other major industrial democracies was $24 billion. Of that sum, only about $15 billion was delivered, mostly in the form of credits for Russian imports.
The main reason for the shortfall was Russia's failure to make all the economic reforms sought by Western bankers.
For example, the International Monetary Fund put together a $6 billion fund for Russia to help stabilize the value of the ruble. The fund was never used because Russia never took sufficient steps to curb inflation, a prerequisite for maintaining the value of the ruble against other currencies.
The Russian failure was critical because without a stable ruble, investment and trade are extremely difficult to carry out.
 
Split Over Curbing Inflation
 Despite the hopes of the Clinton Administration, it is not clear that Russia could do much better this year, even with less restrictive conditions on the aid. As the turmoil of the last week demonstrated, the Government is badly split over steps to curb inflation, which is now raging at about 25 percent a month.
In the past year, Western bankers and economists have tried and failed many times to work out a program in Russia to curtail inflation by reining in the money supply. But Russia has been slow because of fears that higher interest rates and other anti-inflationary steps would throw people out of work and lead to big increases in prices of food and other goods.
Popular anxiety about rising prices and unemployment fueled the conservative opposition to talk of removing President Yeltsin this week.
Part of the Administration's new proposal, apparently timed to bring action in time for President Clinton's meeting with President Yeltsin in Vancouver on April 3-4, was made Wednesday in a letter to the so-called Group of Seven industrial nations.
The proposal was for the International Monetary Fund to be the main source of loans to finance imports, a fund to stabilize the ruble, and perhaps credits to help rebuild industry.
 
G-7 Support Thought Likely
 Western officials said they thought the seven nations would embrace most if not all parts of the proposal.
A significant part of the Administration's proposal is to expand the I.M.F.'s role in providing aid. In the $24 billion package assembled last year, the fund played a leading role, but much of the aid was promised as direct loans from individual countries to Russia.
If the monetary fund expands its role, then Western governments might then expand their own direct assistance, bringing the total to $30 billion this year.
"We are committed to doing everything we possibly can to keep alive democracy and reform in Russia," President Clinton said today after meeting for the first time with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany. "We believe it is in the immediate interests and the long-term interests of all of our people."
 
I.M.F. Seen as Best Source
 American officials have been deeply disappointed with the West's failure to provide much of the $24 billion in aid it promised Russia last year.
The letter makes clear that the Administration sees the Washington-based International Monetary Fund as the best source to tap for additional aid at a time when the United States and other Western nations are strapped by recession and budget deficits.
One senior official said the Administration wants the monetary fund to act "more creatively" in helping Russia. For example, the Administration's letter suggests that the I.M.F. make between $1.8 and $3 billion available under an emergency fund that provides credit to countries that suffer an unexpected shortfall of export revenues.
The Administration's push for the International Monetary Fund to provide more aid comes at a time when the Administration is eager to show in a highly visible way that the West is helping Russia in its traumatic transition to a market economy and Mr. Yeltsin in his confrontation with the Russian Parliament.
Administration officials said they were also considering a fund to make loans available to Russian entrepreneurs, a technical aid package to help the beleaguered oil industry, and loan guarantees to help finance homes for demobilized Russian troops. They were also urging somewhat easier terms to reschedule Russia's $80 billion in foreign debt to provide about $15 billion in relief on interest and principal.
Mr. Clinton, who said after the meeting with Mr. Kohl that the "personal chemistry" between the two leaders was "quite good," added, "We also believe that the rest of the G-7 countries must cooperate with us and with each other to vigorously produce a program of support for Russia."
At their joint news conference, Mr. Kohl said, "Both of us are aware that any type of setback would be much more expensive than any type of assistance we are discussing."
In words of implicit praise for President Clinton, Mr. Kohl added that "under the leadership of the Americans and the American president" the two leaders wanted to send a message that the West would do its utmost to "see to it that Russia and the other successor states to the Soviet Union stand a chance to walk on their own path towards freedom."
Germany has provided more aid to Russia than any other nation, but because it is saddled by a recession and with the huge costs of unification, it has become hesitant to continue carrying such a large portion of the load.
Today in Tokyo, the Japanese Government, easing resistance to providing substantial aid to Russia, announced that it would serve as host of a meeting of the Group of Seven's finance and foreign ministers on April 14 and 15 to discuss an aid package for Russia.
The Administration's lettersaid aid from the monetary fund should be contingent on Russia's reining in its runaway money supply growth and taking other reforms. Some officials said in private, however, that the Administration was urging the monetary fund to be somewhat less strict in demanding that Moscow make stringent reforms in exchange for aid.

HEADLINE: I.B.M.'s New Leader;
Task of Turning Around I.B.M. Is Given to an Industry Outsider

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
I.B.M. officially named Louis V. Gerstner Jr. as its chairman and chief executive yesterday, after a two-month search that led the troubled computer giant's board to conclude that it needs a risk-taking business strategist, like Mr. Gerstner, not a seasoned technology expert.
By placing its uncertain future and corporate America's biggest challenge in the hands of Mr. Gerstner, the chairman of RJR Nabisco Holdings and a computer industry outsider, I.B.M. has defined its course: to accelerate the evolution of a corporate empire into a loose confederation of more nimble, entrepreneurial businesses. 
 Whether Mr. Gerstner, 51, a former consultant at McKinsey & Company and a one-time president of the American Express Company, is the right person to revive the International Business Machines Corporation has been widely debated in the computer industry. [Page 45.]
 
 
Industry's Suggestions
 But even some of the company's longtime critics concede that I.B.M. is a unique corporation, with $60 billion in annual revenues, and that perhaps its chief executive should not be a person steeped in some niche of computer technology.
James E. Burke, the retired chairman of Johnson & Johnson who led the I.B.M. board's search, said he spoke to 75 computer industry executives, only a few of whom were candidates for the job. Though a veteran I.B.M. board member, he says he found those talks most enlightening.
"What I didn't understand as much as I should have, and what I.B.M. didn't understand enough, was the rate of change in this industry," Mr. Burke said yesterday in an interview. "I don't think any of us understood the impact of that, and how much smaller, entrepreneurial companies can exploit that rapid pace of change. They move quickly, and they love to take risk. And I see those qualities in Lou."
For his part, Mr. Gerstner said he would spend his first few months on the job talking to I.B.M. managers and workers, scrutinizing each of the company's businesses before taking action. And he sought to dampen expectations that there would soon be a sharp reversal of I.B.M.'s fortunes.
"This is not going to be a short-term fix," he said at a morning news conference in Manhattan. "This is going to take time."
The announcement that Mr. Gerstner would succeed John F. Akers as I.B.M.'s chairman and chief executive was not a surprise. It has been known since January that Mr. Akers is being eased out, and the two-month hunt for a new chief was the most avidly watched talent search in the history of American business. It was apparent for a week that Mr. Gerstner was the front-runner.
He has had ample time to ponder the challenge awaiting him at I.B.M. The company is but the most striking example of a crisis facing many old-line American corporations, as household names from General Motors to Sears are forced to cut jobs and streamline operations to try to keep up with leaner, more efficient rivals, from Toyota to Wal-Mart.
"I.B.M., like many other American companies, has found that the markets and the technology have shifted so fast that its old models of doing business no longer work," said James Champy, a management consultant in Cambridge, Mass., and co-author of a new book, "Re-engineering the Corporation," which examines how big companies can be more efficient.
 Under Mr. Akers, I.B.M. did try to remake itself. The company cut its work force from 406,000 in 1986 to 300,000 by the end of last year, and its business units were given more freedom from corporate headquarters.
But the company has not moved fast enough to get ahead of the quicksilver pace of technological change in the computer industry, which is the main reason it reported a loss of nearly $5 billion last year. I.B.M. has been hit particularly hard by a shift from multimillion-dollar mainframe computers, I.B.M.'s mainstay business, toward smaller desktop machines that run on microprocessors.
Mr. Burke, the I.B.M. director, said that one trait he admired in Mr. Gerstner was his belief in decentralized management, with those closest to customers making more decisions.
For a couple of years, sales of I.B.M.'s software and services have grown rapidly even as sales of its equipment have slipped. A comment made by Mr. Gerstner at the news conference suggested that he might try to hasten the shift to software and services, like consulting corporate customers on how to link computers and software most efficiently.
The historic search for a new chief executive -- the first from outside the I.B.M. ranks in the company's 79-year history -- was conducted by the seven members of the board's search team, led by Mr. Burke. It began in late January, Mr. Burke said, with "a handful" of candidates, including Mr. Gerstner, that was informally put together by the search team.
 
 
Code Name: 'Abel'
 With the help of two executive recruiters, Heidrick & Struggles and Spencer Stuart, a more comprehensive list of 125 people worldwide was assembled. But the board mainly focused on its short initial list.
In an effort to insure secrecy, the candidates were given code names, and Mr. Gerstner's was "Abel." "Lou Gerstner was the first person I talked to," Mr. Burke explained.
When Mr. Burke first talked with him, shortly after the search was announced in late January, Mr. Gerstner said his first reaction was negative. "I said, 'That's not for me; I'm happy where I am," Mr. Gerstner recalled in an interview, referring to his post at RJR Nabisco, the tobacco-and-food conglomerate.
But Mr. Burke persisted, and Mr. Gerstner reconsidered. "Jim Burke began to convince me that his was more than an extraordinary challenge, which does turn me on," Mr. Gerstner said. "He began to convince me that it was important to the country and the economy that I.B.M. be restored to the force that it once was."
Mr. Burke said that once Mr. Gerstner began discussing the job in those broader terms, "we figured we had him."
Mr. Burke sought to deflect the impression that others in the computer industry had turned down the job. Several well-known executives, including John Sculley, the chief executive of Apple Computer Inc., and George M. C. Fisher, the chairman of Motorola Inc., had issued public statements saying they did not want the I.B.M. job.
But Mr. Burke said that Mr. Gerstner was the only person to whom the board made a formal offer. Still, as one executive recruiter noted, the etiquette of top-level corporate job searches tends to be that a formal offer is not made unless the candidate has strongly indicated acceptance.
The terms of Mr. Gerstner's I.B.M. pay package have not been disclosed, but should be made known within a few days. He walks away from a multimillion-dollar yearly compensation package at RJR Nabisco.
Investors showed little reaction to the expected announcement, driving I.B.M. shares up 87.5 cents each yesterday, to $51.375, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Casino Backers Raise the Ante In Connecticut

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, March 26

 BODY:
As a debate over casino gambling intensifies in the Connecticut Legislature, casino operators have begun one of the most sophisticated and expensive efforts ever undertaken in this state to win friends and influence the people who count.
Mirage Resorts, which has offered to build two casinos, in Bridgeport and Hartford, spent more than $92,000 last month alone on lobbying, public relations fees, expenses and entertainment, the largest one-month lobbying tab in recent history, if not ever, according to the State Ethics Commission.
 
An Advertising Barrage
 That does not count the $382,000 the company committed for what it called an initial television advertising barrage (by Hal Riney, the high-priced and mellow-voiced creator of ads for Gallo Wines and of Ronald Reagan's "Morning in America" campaign) or the even subtler efforts and arguments that are harder to categorize. 
 "It's intense stuff," said Representative William R. Dyson, a nine-term Democrat from New Haven who said he had not "officially taken a position" on the bill.
"I can't think of anything that's been anywhere near this level," he said.
Opponents and supporters alike say that every new jolt of bad news about the state's troubled economy, like the partial closing of the Navy's submarine base in Groton, announced earlier this month, bolsters the case for casinos.
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., who says that a further expansion of gambling would cause social harm, has not succeeded in stifling the proposal. He signed a $100 million-a-year profit-sharing deal in January with the Mashantucket Pequot Indian tribe, operators of the state's only existing casino, which had seemed to derail casino developers. The deal made the tribe's payments contingent on the Indians' keeping their monopoly on gambling. But now even some of Mr. Weicker's supporters say that by agreeing to such a deal, he may have undermined his right to object to an expansion of gambling on grounds of social principle.
Stephen A. Wynn, the president and chairman of Mirage Resorts, has also raised the ante. He told the State Legislature last month that his company would guarantee a minimum of $140 million in tax revenues for two casinos.
 
Talking About Jobs
 Around the state, discussion on the issue is pervasive and basic, centering on jobs and economic development.
Many Hartford residents awoke this morning, for example, to hear a radio talk-show host broadcasting live from the Mirage in Las Vegas, enthusiastically interviewing casino workers about their jobs. The trip was paid for by the Mirage.
On Saturday, the company will hold a Jobs Information Fair in Bridgeport, Connecticut's largest and poorest city, to tell people about casino jobs that do not yet exist. The idea, a company spokesman said, is to "get people excited" and encourage them to press local legislators.
The casino bill, which cleared a major hurdle on Thursday when the Legislature's Public Safety Committee approved it by a 21-to-4 vote, is still considered a long shot to become law this year. The bill would require the approval of three other committees, and Mr. Weicker has promised to veto the bill if it reaches his desk. Overriding a veto would take a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate.
 
Urban Democrats Lead Drive
 Democrats in and around Bridgeport and Hartford are leading the drive for the casinos, while suburban Republicans have formed the core of the opposition. Legislators from southeastern Connecticut, whose constituents' jobs at the Indians' casino in Ledyard could be endangered by competition, are largely united against the proposal, leaving other lawmakers in both parties to be picked off, one by one. Supporters of the rights of labor, for instance, are being wooed with the argument that state labor laws are not enforceable on Indian lands, but would be in a state-regulated casino.
"They're hammering away and they're scoring some points," said Representative Thomas S. Luby, a Democrat from Meriden and the majority leader in the House of Representatives. Mr. Luby described himself as skeptical about the potential of gambling to provide long-term economic growth, especially if casinos sprout up elsewhere around the region. However, Mr. Luby said, "I don't think anyone at this point can predict the result."
Mr. Luby believes that residents, especially the unemployed, are listening hard. The television ad, with its simple language about jobs and Connecticut's future, makes the casino sound almost incidental.
"You walk into a luncheonette today and you'll see people turning to you and saying, 'What about those 23,000 jobs?' " he said.
 
Going to the Job Fair
 Orlando Rivera, a 24-year-old Bridgeport maintenance worker with a wife and two children and no job since he was laid off four months ago, said today he would be going to the Mirage job fair, if only to keep up his hopes.
"I want a new job," he said. "And if it takes a casino to get one, then I'm all for a casino coming to Bridgeport."
The job fair will feature 38 Mirage employees, ranging from cooks to croupiers, who were flown to Connecticut on Thursday. Mark Rivers, a spokesman for Mirage, said that two of the employees were former Connecticut residents who would be able to tell the sad, but no doubt ultimately uplifting story of how they could not find work in their home state because of the bad economy, and so went west to work for the Mirage.

HEADLINE: U.S. Calls On Japan to Set Trade Goals

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration asked Japan today to set specific figures for how much in foreign goods and services it plans to buy as part of a fiscal stimulus package.
Continuing its aggressive approach to trade policy, the Administration also asked Japan to outline the steps it intends to take to carry out a pledge to increase purchases of American automobile parts. 
 The requests were presented by the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, during a meeting with Trade Minister Yoshiro Mori of Japan and came on the heels of remarks by President Clinton that American companies have only a "remote" chance of cracking Japan's market.
 
Fiscal Package for Japan
 Washington has called on Tokyo to give Japan's sagging economy a budgetary lift by increasing Government spending and cutting taxes. Japan is working on such a fiscal package.
Mr. Kantor's office said that in his talks he "pointed out the importance of including a specific allocation for purchases of foreign goods and services by the Japanese Government" in the package.
"Kantor stressed that U.S.-Japan bilateral agreements and understandings require immediate action by Japan to insure full implementation," the trade representative's office said after the two officials met for an hour.
Mr. Kantor told Mr. Mori that the United States expected Japan's automobile industry to fulfill the pledges it made in January to buy more American auto parts.
 
Pledge on U.S. Auto Parts
 "This includes the pledge to increase purchases of American auto parts by Japanese auto manufacturers in the United States and Japan to $19 billion by 1994 and to increase local content of production in the United States from 50 percent to 70 percent by 1994," Mr. Kantor's office said.
Mr. Kantor presented Mr. Mori with a letter that asked for the "steps Japan intends to take to meet its pledge." The letter was from Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown as well as from Mr. Kantor.
Mr. Kantor did note that Japan had lived up to its agreement to increase its purchases of foreign computer chips to 20 percent of the Japanese market.
But he made clear that further progress was needed during the life of the current agreement, which expires in mid-1996.
Mr. Kantor and Mr. Mori agreed on the importance of bringing the Uruguay round of international trade talks to a successful conclusion, according to Mr. Kantor's office. But Mr. Kantor told Mr. Mori that he expected Tokyo to "be fully prepared to contribute actively to all aspects of the negotiations."

HEADLINE: Of 3 Arkansas Pals and a Raccoon Roast

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26

 BODY:
One of the most important friendships in Washington today is the quiet alliance of three former Arkansas Governors who all ended up working on Pennsylvania Avenue: President Clinton, Senator David Pryor and Senator Dale Bumpers.
Theirs is a unique bond. It was forged on the rubber-chitterlings circuit of Arkansas politics, it survived their once reckless pursuit of a roasted raccoon and it thrives today with Mr. Bumpers and Mr. Pryor serving as Mr. Clinton's eyes and ears on the Senate floor. That is, when the three Democrats are not in the White House living room tuning in Arkansas basketball games via the President's satellite dish. 
 But first, the raccoon story. As Senator Bumpers, the official raconteur of the Bill, David and Dale club, tells it, every year Democrats in Gillett, Ark., put on a raccoon supper that is compulsory for Arkansas politicians. But in January 1988, Arkansas was buried in a blizzard on Coon Supper day.
 
What's a Little Snow?
 "Bill called me and said: 'Are you going to the Coon Supper?' " Senator Bumpers recalled. "I said, 'Gosh, Bill, I don't think we can land.' He said, 'Well, I talked to the county judge and he says the road graders are out there scraping the snow off the runway so we can get in.' "
Senator Pryor looked at the weather and bowed out, but Senator Bumpers and Governor Clinton took off. On the way, as Mr. Clinton regaled Mr. Bumpers with stories, the runway iced up, and when their small plane landed, it skidded and spun into a cow pasture.
"I swear, I don't think Bill ever quit telling that story he was in the middle of when we finally came to a halt. I said: 'Bill, get that door open. Let's get out of here.' And he just casually found the door. He was in no hurry whatever. He finally opened the door and we jumped out of that plane and we took off running through the snow to get away from it. I'm sure we hadn't gone 30 feet, and good ol' Bill says to me, 'Boy, I bet we don't ever lose a vote down here again.' "
Some people never change.
But that, of course, is why Senator Bumpers loves telling the story -- because the shared memories of a thousand dinners and a thousand small Arkansas towns is the glue that cements this friendship.
Since the early 1970's, Mr. Clinton, Mr. Bumpers and Mr. Pryor have taken turns helping one another run their state, warning one another of land mines, supporting one another's campaigns and generally serving as a mutual aid society. With the arrival of Mr. Clinton in the White House, they have taken their alliance to Washington, where, with little notice, the two Senators are now among the President's closest advisers.
When Mr. Clinton wants the inside dope on a representative or senator, he simply calls for "Dale 'n' David," which is usually pronounced as one word around the White House.
"I don't know if the President calls Bumpers and Pryor every day, but someone here does," said Skip Rutherford, an informal White House adviser who like so many in the intertwined world of Arkansas politics is a Bumpers confidant, a Clinton family friend and a former Pryor aide. "There is between the three of them what the operators would call an open line."
When the President is looking for some company he can relax with, he dials up his two Razorback buddies from the Hill, and when Mr. Clinton gave his first nationally televised address from the Oval Office last month, two days before his economic message to Congress, he asked only these two friends down to the White House to keep him company.
 
Senators to Lean On
 The routine started during the New Hampshire primaries, when Mr. Clinton, unnerved by charges of draft dodging and marital infidelity, imported the Senators for moral support. "I did notice this about Bill Clinton in New Hampshire," recalled Senator Pryor. "I think if he could look out into an audience and spot someone he knew, or spot someone especially from Arkansas, I think it kind of inspired him, kind of relaxed him."
Besides policy advice, Mr. Clinton has also gleaned some of his best down-home Arkansasisms from his two friends, including these favorites: "He's squealin' like a pig stuck under a gate"; "If you don't want to run with the big dogs, stay on the porch"; and, "You gotta throw the corn where the hogs can get to it," a Bumpers saying often used in reference to making aid more easily available to the Russians.
In a way, all three men owe their political careers to a liberal Republican, Winthrop Rockefeller, the man who knocked off Gov. Orval Faubus, the archconservative segregationist who ruled Arkansas from 1954 to 1966. In the Arkansas New Testament, Rockefeller begat Bumpers (Governor from 1971 to 1975), Bumpers begat Pryor (Governor from 1975 to 1979) and Pryor begat Clinton (Governor from 1979 to 1981 and from 1983 to 1992).
 
Turnabout in Arkansas
 "Arkansas felt ashamed over the demagoguery and international ridicule that Faubus brought, and so it turned to some of the most liberal governors and senators you will find anywhere outside of Massachusetts," said John R. Brummett, a columnist for the Arkansas Times.
What is unusual is that three ambitious politicians, who shared so many of the same values, aspirations and fund-raisers, managed not only to stay out of each other's way but also to become fast friends. From 1974 on they often appeared together at rallies around the state, but each one was always running for a different job. Thomas F. McLarty 3d, President Clinton's childhood friend whom they all call Mack and who is now White House chief of staff, was the chairman of the Arkansas Democratic Party for some of that time, describing himself "as kind of the Ed McMahon of that traveling minstrel show."
Senators Pryor and Bumpers were clearly always glad they could keep one job ahead of young Bill -- until now. "The first time I met Bill Clinton was at a function in Russell, Ark., in 1974 and he was running against John Paul Hammerschmidt for the House," Senator Bumpers recalled. "I had heard about this young law professor but I was not prepared for him to be as articulate and attractive as he was. I was a Governor running for the Senate, and you know, I looked at him and made a quick calculation: If this guy is elected to the House of Representatives, six years from now he is probably going to come after me. Absolutely! I had no relish for that."
 
Different Relationships
 The relationships among them, while openly affectionate, nevertheless have shades of difference. The 58-year-old Senator Pryor has more of an avuncular relationship with the President, friends say, while Senator Bumpers, though 67 years old, is in many ways more like Mr. Clinton -- Presidential aspirant and policy aficionado with a razor tongue -- and their relationship has just a spice of sibling competitiveness. They still tell the story in Little Rock about a political roast of Mr. Clinton in 1982, when Mr. Bumpers roasted him just a little too well done.
Turning to Mr. Clinton on the dais, Senator Bumpers said: "You'll understand if Bill is not at his best at tonight. He was working all day on his income taxes, but he couldn't send them in because when he came to the line for the signature of head of household he couldn't find Hillary."
Senator Bumpers, who is also very close with Mrs. Clinton, now winces at the memory of that evening, saying: "That did cause some grief. I felt terrible about that."
 
Barometers of Congress
 But the roasting skewers have been put away, and now Senators Bumpers and Pryor serve as the President's personal barometers on Capitol Hill, much as former Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada did for Ronald Reagan. While this has certainly enhanced their status among fellow lawmakers, it has also earned them the extra headache of colleagues' trying to get to the President through them.
Neither Senator will talk about his conversations with the President. The closest they come is Senator Pryor's explanation: "We try to help him with the politics of the Senate, the institution itself, some of the personalities he is dealing with. Sometimes he'll ask, 'What's this guy going to ask me when he comes to White House at 3:30 P.M.? How should I respond? What makes him tick? What's he like? What's he want?' That sort of thing is a role that Dale and I probably play."
Mr. Clinton has also incorporated Senator Bumpers's proposals for helping small businesses with tax credits into his economic plan, and it was Senator Pryor's long-time campaign to control prescription drug costs that helped inspire Mr. Clinton's own assault on the pharmaceutical industry last month.
But while both Senators relish having one of their long-playing trio in the Oval Office, both have been around politics, and Bill Clinton, too long to exaggerate their roles.
"He probably calls us to be nice as much as anything," said Senator Bumpers, "because he got a long way without either one of us."

HEADLINE: A Drawback to Serb Sanctions: They Don't Work

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, March 26

 BODY:
As the United States and its Western allies assess the possibility of tightening sanctions against Serbia in an effort to bring peace to Bosnia, they are confronted by a troubling paradox: The diplomatic measures taken up to now have ended up strengthening the Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic, and entrenching most Serbs in a dogged commitment to the war.
The signing on Thursday by Alija Izetbegovic, the leader of the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government, of a proposed international peace plan has left the Serbs as the only Bosnian faction that has not accepted it. President Clinton has spoken of toughening trade sanctions against the Serbs, or lifting an arms embargo on the Bosnian Government forces, as a means to bring Serbian compliance. 
 But almost a year after the start of the Bosnian war and nine months after the imposition of a virtual trade embargo on the Serbian-dominated federal Yugoslavia, there is scant evidence that sanctions have brought any of the desired results.
With inflation now running above 250 percent a month, unemployment affecting a third of the population, the economy in ruins and young lives being lost daily in the war, the elements would appear to exist for a surge of Serbian protest against Mr. Milosevic.
 
Few Opponents to War
 Yet Zarko Korac, a psychology professor at Belgrade University, who is helping to organize a demonstration against the war on April 3, the first anniversary of its outbreak, believes it would be an achievement if the march drew more than 500 people.
"The number one obsession of people is that they see a plot against the nation to annihilate it," Mr. Korac said. "Sanctions work for the Government because they help feed the notion that the world is unjustly inimical to the Serbs and that only a tough leader like Mr. Milosevic can resist."
Vuk Draskovic, the leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement, the main opposition party in Belgrade, added: "I'm absolutely against the sanctions because Mr. Milosevic has benefited from them. They're his big excuse for all the problems here."
Criticism of the United Nations sanctions, and of the notion of tightening them, is almost universal here, even among those who detest the Milosevic Government. The main effect of cutting Serbia's economic ties to the world, opposition leaders say, has been to awaken an old Balkan instinct -- pride in a defiant struggle for survival.
It was not supposed to turn out this way. Under the scenario sketched by Western officials shortly after the United Nations sanctions were imposed last June, popular discontent was supposed to reach its apex during the tough winter months, eventually swelling to the point where Mr. Milosevic was either defeated in elections last December or driven from power by a tide of protest.
Mr. Milosevic's departure, according to this outline, would in turn unlock the door to peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina because his quiet financial, logistical and ideological support for the Serbian nationalists in Bosnia has been crucial to their prosecution of the war.
But winter has given way to an unseasonably warm spring, and there is scarcely a whimper of protest to be heard among the cafes whose tables are already spilling onto the sidewalks of Belgrade.
People grumble about the lack of gasoline or the shortage of medicine in hospitals, but they seem to make no connection between the shortages, the weakening economy and the Government. The opposition parties are hopelessly divided. Mr. Milosevic has been comfortably re-elected and a brooding fatalism has set in.
"The Government feeds itself on war and sanctions," said Ljubomir Madzar, an economist who supports the opposition Democratic Party. "Indeed, there is a possibility that the Government could be seriously weakened if sanctions were partly lifted."
United States diplomats in Belgrade concede that sanctions may have backfired. "Mr. Milosevic is now more firmly in the saddle than he has been for a long time, and he is there partly because he can always blame the outside world to distract attention from his own failures," one said.
But few policy options appear to remain. By consensus, the most effective moment for a Western military intervention in Bosnia passed several months ago because the division of the republic along ethnic lines favored by the Serbs is now so advanced as to appear irreversible.
All that is left for the United States, it seems, is lukewarm support for the peace plan devised by the mediation team of Cyrus R. Vance and Lord Owen, although Western officials here are skeptical about the Serbian forces in Bosnia respecting the plan's ethnic divisions and central government.
In part, the failure of Western diplomatic measures to bring the desired results appears to reflect a misreading of the complex psychology of Serbia, forged over a long history of heroic defiance and terrible slaughter.
"The agenda here is nationalism," said Vesna Pesic, a leader of the small Civic Alliance opposition group.
This nationalism gained explosive force because the trauma of the brutal civil war fought in Yugoslavia during and after World War II was never resolved in the peaceful postwar decades of Titoism, the nonaligned brand of Communism led by Marshal Tito that sought to forge a homogenous Yugoslavia out of the diverse ethnicity of the Balkans.
"After the war there was oblivion," said Bojan Jovanovic, an anthropologist at Belgrade University. "Nobody ever brought the balance sheet."
All that was repressed has now emerged. To the Serbs, thousands of whom were killed in Croatia and Bosnia during World War II by the puppet Croatian fascist regime, the threats posed by Yugoslavia's breakup apparently raised specters real enough to rally support for renewed nationalist fervor.
This support has been sustained because many Serbs -- even moderate opposition figures -- believe that international recognition of the independence of Croatia and Bosnia failed to take account of the position of the roughly 600,000 Serbs living in Croatia and the 1.4 million in Bosnia who were left to fend for themselves against hostile new governments in Croatia and Bosnia.
"The political structure of this country now needs a war," said Mr. Korac, the psychologist. "It generates support. And that frightens me because Mr. Milosevic is intelligent, ruthless and immensely destructive."
Mrs. Pesic, the opposition leader, added: "Nobody knows how to get out of this. We feel trapped. What's going to happen? Nothing. Disaster."
 
 
Balkan Update
Belgrade, Yugoslavia
Gen. Ratko Mladic, the commander of the Serbian forces in Bosnia, agreed yesterday with the leaders of the Muslim and Croatian forces on a cease-fire to take effect tomorrow. The agreement was announced by Lieut. Gen. Philippe Morillon, the commander of United Nations forces in Bosnia. General Mladic said the cease-fire would take hold along the armies' current front lines.
 
 
Sarajevo, Bosnia
An 18-inch snowfall put a damper on the shelling of Sarajevo by Serbian forces. The snow also worsened the plight of Muslims trapped in the town of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia.
 
 
Washington
Seeming to play down earlier comments that he might consider lifting the embargo on sending arms to the Bosnian Government, President Clinton said that for now he intended to rely on economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure to get the Serbs to accept a peace accord.

HEADLINE: Growth Rate in Late '92 Surged to a 5-Year High

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26

 BODY:
Strong consumer spending helped fuel the fastest economic growth in five years in late 1992, the Government reported today, but analysts said the economy had since slowed, partly because of sluggish hiring.
The Commerce Department said the gross domestic product -- the total output of goods and services -- grew at a 4.7 percent annual rate from October through December, a pace that economists said confirmed that the economic recovery was well in place. 
 For the year, the economy grew 2.1 percent, the best annual performance since 1989, when it expanded 2.5 percent. The economy had contracted 1.2 percent in 1991.
 
Predictions Aren't Robust
 But analysts predicted the G.D.P. would grow only about 3 percent this year.
"Economic growth is definitely slowing from what I call a fairly strong pace in the final quarter of last year," said Sung Won Sohn, an economist with the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis.
Marilyn Schaja, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in New York, agreed. "Recent data suggest that growth during the first quarter is decelerating sharply," she said.
During the seven quarters since the end of the recession in March 1991, output has grown only about 4 percent -- half the 7.9 percent average for the corresponding period of other recent recoveries.
The revised 4.7 percent fourth-quarter growth rate was slightly less than the department's 4.8 percent estimate last month. The economy expanded at a 3.4 percent rate in the third quarter of 1992; 1.5 percent in the second and 2.9 percent in the first.
The department said a measure of inflation tied to the G.D.P. rose a revised 3.4 percent during the fourth quarter, up from 2.1 percent in the third quarter and even faster than the 2.9 percent estimate last month. For the year, the inflation rate was 2.9 percent, down from 4 percent in 1991.
The department also said that after-tax corporate profits shot up 9.2 percent in the final three months of 1992, to $242.6 billion. It was the biggest jump since a 10.8 percent gain in the first quarter. For the year, corporate profits were up 10 percent.
The slight downward revision in the fourth-quarter G.D.P. was attributed to fewer exports and less Government spending than had been previously estimated. Those reductions were partly offset by the heavy year-end consumer spending.

HEADLINE: Clinton, Planning Forest Conference, Hopes to Free Logjam in Northwest

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore., March 26

 BODY:
When President Clinton sits down next week with the warring factions in the Pacific Northwest timber dispute, he will be trying to do something more than save a piece of original America larger than Massachusetts.
The April 2 forest summit conference here will be the Administration's biggest and perhaps most difficult attempt to make good on campaign assertions that it is possible to protect a rare natural resource without putting a lot of people out of work. Voters in the Northwest, even in the timber counties, rejected Republican arguments last fall that the cost of environmentalism was too high. Now, the victors are expected to deliver. 
 The White House is bringing an enormous show of Presidential power to the issue. Mr. Clinton will be accompanied at the forest conference by Vice President Al Gore and at least four Cabinet members, and will be joined by the Governors of California, Oregon and Washington.
During the campaign Mr. Clinton visited timber towns and preached tolerance. But now he has the painful task of finding a solution to a conflict that bedeviled the two previous Republican Administrations and crippled the daily operations of the United States Forest Service.
 
Watershed Repair Plan
 One proposal under consideration by the White House, and favored by some Congressional leaders, is to put thousands of people to work restoring the land hit hardest by logging. The intent is to repair watersheds and streams that nurture salmon, one of the forests' most valuable species.
The timber industry wants trees, not new jobs in the woods, and is pressing for some relief from environmental restrictions that have virtually shut down logging in national forests west of the Cascade Range. But many people in the industry believe the battle has already been lost.
What started nearly a decade ago as an effort to save the spotted owl, a species facing extinction in the ancient, heavily logged forests of coastal Washington, Oregon and Northern California, has grown into a national campaign to save the forests for their own sake. Laws intended to protect fish and wildlife have been used, with great success, to curb the Government's timber program in the Northwest.
For nearly two years, as various government agencies fought among themselves, the courts have essentially been in charge of the forests. They have banned logging on millions of acres until the Federal Government provides a plan to assure that its timber sales are not violating the law.
 
Different Legal Positions
 This gridlock in the forests makes Congressional paralysis seem like sweet harmony by comparison. "One of the problems has been that the United States itself has taken different positions," the President said at a White House news conference on Tuesday. "So the first thing I hope to do is to be able to at least adopt a uniform legal position."
Last week a scientific panel put together by the Forest Service in response to a court order said that "there is simply no free lunch" in the Government's effort to save old-growth forests. More than 600 plant and animal species -- everything from salmon and spotted owls to a cancer-fighting drug that comes from the bark of yew trees -- are dependent on the health of America's temperate rain forest. Logging is causing the ecosystem to unravel, the scientists said.
But more than 30,000 workers who make their living cutting those trees stand to lose their jobs if the restrictions continue, according to the Government's projections.
The large timber companies that own their own land are having profitable years, while small sawmills that depend on Federal timber are running out of wood. The mills have been able to keep job losses to a minimum thus far because they are cutting a backlog of timber that was sold to them before the court injunctions.
As the courts have repeatedly ruled for environmentalists, it has become highly unlikely that the Government will ever go back to full-scale timber harvesting. Instead, the one-day forest conference has focused on how to take care of displaced workers and how to end the legal quagmire.
Mr. Clinton predicts pain for both sides. Whatever solution is worked out "will probably make everybody mad," the President said Tuesday, adding, "But I will try to be fair to the people whose livelihoods depend on this, and fair to the environment that we are all obligated to maintain."
Under the proposal to restore salmon streams, much of the money from the Forest Service budget that has been used for the timber program would be used to hire people in rural communities to plant new trees, fix trails and repair or remove roads that are depositing sediment in nearby streams. The payoff, proponents of the plan say, are healthy forests that will attract fishermen, hunters and hikers.
It would also fit in with Mr. Clinton's campaign promises. In Oregon last September he said, "If national policy puts you out of work, national policy ought to put you back in a job."
Some people in the timber industry seem ready to make a change. "We need to retrain people," said Mike Draper, executive secretary of the Western Council of Industrial Workers, a timber workers' union. "It's the obligation of government, because they are the ones who set these communities up to begin with."
A second major proposal, being advanced by the timber industry, is to allow a considerable amount of logging in the old-growth forests but to change the way it is done. Clear-cutting, in which an entire swath of trees is leveled, cleared and burned, would end. Trees would be selectively cut, or thinned. By going easier on the land, proponents say, fewer species would be harmed.
Environmentalists had hoped to have the national forests east of the Cascade Range, including the vast Colville National Forest in the eastern Washington district of Representative Thomas S. Foley, the House Speaker, be part of the summit conference agenda. But the White House, perhaps in a nod to Mr. Foley's general support of the timber interests, has taken eastern forests off the table.
Because of the climate, forests west of the Cascades are thick and rich in fish and wildlife; the eastern slopes are arid and not as heavily timbered.
The disappointment for the timber industry is that the Endangered Species Act, the legal tool that has been most effective in opposition to logging, is not up for change -- at least not now, said Katie McGinty, the President's chief environmental policy adviser.
 
Banner Year for Giants
 While loggers and sawmill workers dependent on Federal timber are suffering the most as a result of the the forest gridlock, the timber industry is having a banner year over all -- in part because lumber prices are higher now than any time since the late 1970's.
Last year more lumber from private timber tracts in the Northwest was exported than was cut from all of the region's 19 national forests. Environmentalists say there would be no timber crisis if the big companies did not send so much of their lumber overseas.
"We should stop the unconscionable colonial practice of selling off our precious raw materials," said Tim Hermach, head of the Native Forest Council, a nonprofit environmental group based in Eugene, Ore.
Mr. Hermach and other environmental leaders have urged Mr. Clinton to issue an executive order to tax or temporarily halt exports, diverting private timber to American sawmills.
The national forests contribute only 13 percent of the nation's domestic timber supply. Of that, only a fraction comes from the ancient forests. By the Forest Service's estimate, there are about six million acres of these virgin forests left, about half of which are protected in wilderness areas or parks.
The fight is over what to do with the other three million acres of publicly owned old-growth forests. Until a few years ago, more than 60,000 acres a year were being clear-cut.
The White House has been trying to play down expectations for the forest conference, saying it will be the starting point for a resolution of the issue. Congressional leaders are hoping to present a legislative package by June 1, according to Representative Norm Dicks, Democrat of Washington.
In announcing the forest conference earlier this month, Mr. Clinton joked that his summit conference with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, scheduled to be held a day later in Vancouver, British Columbia, would be easy compared to the meeting in Portland. He was only half-kidding.

HEADLINE: Integration Is Issue of Language and Geography

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD

 BODY:
The growth of Hartford's Puerto Rican population and the need to provide bilingual education for its children may be the ultimate complications in a landmark desegregation lawsuit that seeks to link the city's schools with suburban ones.
Almost half of Hartford's 25,400 schoolchildren are Puerto Rican, and in some elementary schools almost half the pupils sit in bilingual classes, where they are taught mathematics, science and other subjects in Spanish while they learn English. 
 So integration here is no longer a matter of black and white. Just as Puerto Ricans are reshaping Connecticut's capital city, where they are expected to become the largest ethnic group this decade, the special needs of their children are remaking its schools. And if integration is to come, they do not want it to come at the expense of bilingual education.
"That's one of the areas that worries me in this case," said Raul Montanez-Pitre, the principal of Hooker School, a Hartford elementary school where nearly half the classes are bilingual. "How do you integrate children with limited English proficiency, who are being segregated linguistically because of sound pedagogical reasons, without jeopardizing the integrity of the program?"
For many suburbs, however, bilingual education would add an entirely new dimension to desegregation. It would introduce into their schools the seeming contradiction of classrooms that are intentionally segregated, by language. And it would require them to deal with the sensitive questions of culture and identity that Puerto Ricans carry with them from birth.
Puerto Ricans are not like earlier immigrants. They are already American citizens, Americans born into a centuries-old Spanish-speaking culture. They are propelled here by poverty at home, but the way home remains open to them. For many, holding on to two languages is vital for reconciling their dual identity.
"When you try to fool around with the language, you start fooling with the culture," said Juan Fuentes, a photographer who has documented the lives of Puerto Ricans here since the 1960's, when most came to work in shade-tobacco fields. "If you lose the culture, you lose everything."
 
Ciencia en Espanol, Writing in English
 The lawsuit known as Sheff v. O'Neill charges that the concentration of poor black and Puerto Rican children in Hartford schools denies them the educational opportunity available to suburban children.
A visit to Hooker School provides a glimpse of the linguistic balancing act entailed in bilingual education.
Hooker looks like any 1950's elementary school from Sherbrooke Avenue, where small houses face it. But a battered housing project is nearby, and visitors must buzz the office to be admitted through the locked front doors. Seventeen of the 38 classrooms are in portable buildings. Seventy percent of the pupils are Puerto Rican. Nearly 400 are assigned to bilingual classes.
In the integration lawsuit, in which testimony was concluded last month, the state blamed poverty for the poor academic performance of the city's children, and poverty is most extreme among Puerto Ricans. Three of four qualify for free or reduced-price lunches.
Reminders of poverty are constant in Maria Collazo's fourth-grade classroom at Hooker School, starting with the breakfast placed on each desk.
In the fourth grade, bilingual teachers begin to teach academic subjects in English, but science is still taught in Spanish. Ms. Collazo goes over the food groups as her pupils eat muffins and drink juice and milk. She has written on the blackboard: "proteinar," "hidratos carbone," "grasas" and "vitaminas."
She reminds the children to cover their workbooks, hand-me-downs from previous years. "Your mothers will be receiving their checks next week and they will be going shopping," she says. "Ask them to save the bags for covering your books."
The children have written stories, in English, with a common plot: A woman builds a robot to do her work, and that robot builds a second one to do his work.
One boy imagined that the second robot was female, and that she built another male. "And then the first robot got jealous," he wrote. "And then the first robot said, 'You got a problem?' Then they started fighting. Then they blew up and the female robot stayed alone."
There is a Spanish lesson. One theory behind bilingual instruction is that children must know the language spoken at home before tackling English. But many Puerto Rican children, especially those born on the mainland, grow up learning fractured Spanish at home.
The children wave their hands wildly so Ms. Collazo will call on them. Doing math problems, those who finish early help others. Her best pupils, she says, will move into mainstream classes taught in English next year. More will move over in sixth grade, or seventh, or eighth.
"It depends a lot on the home," she said. Timing is also a factor. One girl just arrived from Puerto Rico and speaks no English.
The class moves on to language arts, in English. The subject is tall tales. They are learning about exaggeration.
 
<Transitions Difficult For the Immigrants
 The desegregation suit testimony, which was completed in February, sometimes reinforced stereotypes: All Puerto Ricans are poor. Few speak English. Children born here learn neither English nor Spanish. The difficult transition that all immigrants must make is not being made.
Puerto Ricans in Hartford are indeed poor. They first came from the island's rural poor, recruited by tobacco growers in the 1960's and 70's; 30 percent unemployment continues to drive north those who are least successful at home.
Some adults do not speak English; many are newly arrived. And studies suggest that Hispanic people across the country take an extra generation to make the transition to English, in part because the migration keeps Spanish alive in their neighborhoods.
So there is immediately a conflict of logic and identity when these citizens encounter the expectation that greets nearly all immigrants to the mainland: that to become Americans, they must give up their native language.
"The message is, 'You need to give this up to be part of my society,' " said William M. Ortiz, executive director of the San Juan Center, a social-service agency. "And I say, Why? I speak Spanish and English. I own my home. My children are doing well in school."
Puerto Ricans are also part of the first great wave of immigration that many Americans have experienced. In the 1980's it produced a backlash led by the movement to make English the country's official language.
Sitting in a German restaurant in West Hartford one day, Hernan Lafontaine, Hartford's former Superintendent of Schools, addressed a waitress in German. Turning to his lunch partner, he said, "If people hear me speak German, they will look at me and say, "Look at that cultured man.' "
Mr. Lafontaine, now a professor of education at Southern Connecticut State University, repeated himself in Spanish and added, with a shrug, "If I say the same thing in Spanish, they will say, 'Look at that Puerto Rican.' "
 
Schools' Goals Or Parents' Goals?
 The stated purpose of bilingual instruction is to move children from their native language into English. This transition is eased by instructing them in their native language while they learn English.
If all goes well, children who enter school speaking only Spanish will sit in English-only classes in four to seven years, in the same grade as if they had spoken English all their lives.
That is the theory, but the results are disputed.
Supporters of bilingual education see an opportunity to create magnet schools where English-speaking children learn Spanish and Spanish-speaking children learn English. Failing that, they want to preserve separate bilingual classrooms.
If bilingual classes are moved to suburban schools, they want to insure that they are fully integrated into the buildings, not isolated in basement rooms or distant wings and neglected by unsympathetic principals.
"All the research, and common sense, tells us that the principal is one of the keys to making the program work or not work in a school," said Peter Roos, a lawyer with Multicultural Education Training and Advocacy, a public-interest law firm in San Francisco.
"If you set up a program in the suburbs where you have a principal who has never dealt with these issues and might, quite frankly, be hostile to bilingual education, you can be in trouble."
By contrast, critics say there are good reasons to question bilingual education. Its real value to its supporters, they say, is that it teaches their children their native language. But that stands in the way of its educational goal, the acquisition of English.
"There's no scientific research that says it is more effective," said Prof. Christine Rossell of Boston University, who has testified on bilingual education in several desegregation cases. Studies, she said, show that at best, children taught in their native language do no worse than those taught in English. "The worst outcome," she said, "is that they do a lot worse."
Supporters say bilingual education's results are disappointing because few districts have committed the resources to do it right.
It is also unclear whether Puerto Rican parents want to take a chance on integration. In a survey conducted for the Sheff trial, 45 percent said they would move or resort to private schools if their children were reassigned by a desegregation plan.
The question arises, said Sandra DelValle, a lawyer with the Puerto Rican Defense and Educational Fund in New York, because desegregation cases have largely been defined by blacks.
Puerto Ricans, she said, "haven't been educated on what desegregation means."
"It's a matter of educating the Latino community generally on the fact that a good school may have to be traveled to," she said.
Within Hartford's Puerto Rican neighborhoods, many people say most parents want their own schools improved.

HEADLINE: Fed Neutral in February

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers decided in February to maintain an evenhanded monetary policy and remain equally prepared to raise or lower interest rates as necessary, according to minutes released today.
The Federal Open Market Committee voted 12 to 0 on Feb. 3 in favor of a directive that "did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustment" to interest rates. 
 For most of 1992, policy makers leaned toward lower interest rates in an effort to propel the tenuous economic recovery. In December, the committee noted signs of more vigorous growth and shifted to a neutral stance on interest rates, maintaining it in February.
The Federal Reserve generally seeks to maintain economic growth without adding to inflation. It lowers interest rates to encourage borrowing and spur growth. It raises rates to dampen economic demand and price increases.
In the latest minutes, committee members were split on inflation prospects. Most said "inflation remained quite subdued," the minutes said. But, it added, "A few referred to the recent firming in some commodity prices and the consensus among private forecasters that inflation could drift higher over the next few years." One committee member, who was not named, recommended considering higher rates.

In a sign that it can no longer escape the problems afflicting its parent company, IBM Japan said today that its net income tumbled 45 percent in 1992, its third consecutive decline. Pretax earnings, hurt by a special restructuring charge, plunged 90 percent.
The Japanese subsidiary, which accounts for about a sixth of the revenues of the International Business Machines Corporation, has long been one of the company's biggest money makers. Even now, it is not suffering the losses and sweeping employment cutbacks that I.B.M. is experiencing in the United States and Europe. 
 Still, the moves by customers to small computers and industry-standard software that have hurt I.B.M.'s mainframe business in the United States are starting to occur here as well. Those trends, plus the Japanese recession, have deflated the profits of all computer companies here.
 At a news conference today, Kakutaro Kitashiro, the president of IBM Japan, said the company's sales of computer hardware fell sharply last year. That was offset, however, by double-digit growth in software and services, which now account for nearly 50 percent of revenues.
IBM Japan recorded net income in 1992 of 31.21 billion yen, or about $267 million at an exchange rate of 117 yen to the dollar. That compares with 56.48 billion yen in 1991, or $483 million at the same exchange rate, and is 70 percent below the 1989 level.
The net income figures were bolstered by a change in the method of accounting for income tax. Pretax earnings, which have fallen every year since 1988, plunged 90 percent, to 10.56 billion yen, or about $90 million.
The pretax earnings were hurt by a special charge of 16.21 billion yen, or roughly $140 million, which covered a voluntary retirement program and other restructuring measures. Not counting the special charge, pretax profit, which is called ordinary income, was down 74 percent.
Revenue fell 1.4 percent, to 1.255 trillion yen, or about $10.7 billion, the second consecutive decline.
Sales of mainframe computers, the core of the company's business, fell by double digits, although sales of the largest machines were strong. Sales of minicomputers and personal computers also fell more than 10 percent. But sales of work stations doubled, when measured in yen, and rose 50 percent in terms of units, company officials said.
IBM Japan has been undergoing a restructuring that mirrors its parent's, but is less drastic. It has created some autonomous subsidiaries and is trying to reduce its work force by voluntary retirements.
It even has a new chief executive, although he is an insider, not an outsider like Louis V. Gerstner Jr., who was named I.B.M.'s chief executive today. Mr. Kitashiro, who was named president last year with a mandate to shake things up, also gained the title of chief executive today.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls in Light Day; Russia Termed a Big Worry

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell broadly in light trading yesterday, heavily influenced by technical and speculative pressures, traders said.
Traders were hesistant about making major moves despite a sharp rise in the yield on the Treasury's long bond to 6.94 percent. 
 Ordinarily, the dollar might rise on such news, since higher interest rates make dollar-denominated investments more attractive. But with the political situation in Russia still uncertain, dollar bulls remained recalcitrant about changing their positions ahead of the weekend.
 
'Something May Erupt'
 "The main thing in the market's mind is something may erupt in Russia, though nothing now seems to be," said Lisa Pazer, a currency analyst at MMS International.
Gold slipped in New York after rising overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery closed at $332.40 a troy ounce, off 30 cents. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid of $332.25 an ounce, up 25 cents from late Thursday.
The dollar fell about 1 pfennig against the German mark in European trading amid rumors of a Far East central bank selling a large amount of dollars for marks. In addition, a report of sustained high inflation in Germany dimmed hopes for a significant cut in German interest rates.
In late trading in Europe, the dollar was quoted at 1.6305 German marks, down from 1.6425. Later, in New York, the dollar closed at 1.6335 marks, down from 1.6420.
The Japanese yen, meanwhile, gained for a second day against the dollar, bouncing back from its plunge on Wednesday.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 116.76 yen, down 0.39 yen from Thursday's close. Later, in London, it fell to 116.35 yen and, in New York, the dollar closed at 116.50 yen, down from 117.30 late Thursday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.4905, from $1.4735 late Thursday. A pound traded at $1.4875 in late New York activity, more than $1.4750 late Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday, included: 1.5130 Swiss francs, down from 1.5205; 1,597.00 Italian lire, down from 1,601.00, and 1.2444 Canadian dollars, up from 1.24415.

HEADLINE: First, Bring Troops Home From Europe

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Unfortunately, "A Guide for Pentagon Budget Cuts" (editorial, March 9), a seemingly comprehensive list of suggestions following a Congressional Budget Office report, does not cover a most glaring expense in the defense budget. That is the astronomical cost of stationing 110,000 American service people and their dependents in Europe.
Although the numbers have been considerably reduced and we no longer pump as many billions of dollars a year into the German economy, we still donate huge amounts to Germany, which still has, despite all the difficulties attendant on absorbing the former East Germany, one of the leading economies in the world. 
 How can anyone talk about closing bases in the United States, cutting the deficit or reducing the military in any but the usual slipshod, criminally bureaucratic manner, or most ridiculous of all, of raising taxes, when billions of United States dollars continue to flow into Germany?
How can you condone the closing of bases in the United States when the American taxpayer is helping support a European economy by maintaining American troops there?
I must have been mistaken when I thought the reason the United States had troops stationed in Europe was to offset the threat of invasion by the Soviet Union. But if I, like many millions of Americans, believe that this was true, then what is the reason for the continued stationing of United States troops there?
I thought I read that the Soviet Union had collapsed. If so, then it must follow that the threat that caused the stationing of United States troops in Europe for some 50 years must have collapsed also. Why are they still there? And scheduled to be there through 1995?
Before any of our bases in the United States are closed, before any downsizing of the Armed Forces takes place, I believe that these troops should be brought back home -- now.

The Pride and the Pain Of a Man Burned by Racism

BYLINE: By D. J. R. BRUCKNER

 BODY:
Matt Robinson's project in his new play, "The Confessions of Stepin Fetchit," is to recover history and provoke reflection. Judging from the audience reaction during a discussion period after each performance, he succeeds; some people appear really exasperated.
Mr. Robinson, a veteran writer and producer of "Sesame Street" and "The Cosby Show," is shrewd and economical in his one-act presentation of Lincoln Perry, the creator of the shiftless black comic character of 1930's films who was at first enormously popular and later, under assault from civil rights advocates, reviled. Mr. Robinson knew Perry in the last 20 years of his life, and he lets Perry tell his own story, bringing out amid a lot of laughter the intelligence, pride and sense of injury that gave the best Stepin Fetchit movie scenes their bite. 
 Portraying a gifted performer is a tough assignment for an actor. Here Roscoe Orman -- familiar to everyone who's been a child in the last two decades as Gordon in "Sesame Street" -- brings it off in style. Starting out with a hilarious typical Stepin Fetchit scene and going on to recall Perry's career, and his fate as a rejected symbol of shame, Mr. Orman presents a man who grows larger and more troubling by the minute.
He is all the more convincing because his Perry is so obviously smart, and cunning in the ways of Hollywood, but also a wounded man who is sometimes arrogant, annoyingly superior to other blacks as well as to whites and alienated, in the end, from almost everyone. In gesture even more than in words he conveys an enormous amount of information about the life and the soul of Lincoln Perry in 75 minutes.
And for anyone who has seen enough of the Stepin Fetchit films to be captivated or mystified by what critics in the 1930's called the impression of chained lightning in his feet, Mr. Orman will conjure up warm smiles as he demonstrates the corn lickin' Lulu and knock-kneed Sally dance steps Perry learned from his father, and gives instructions on how to do Stepin Fetchit's shuffles: "Side, back and forward." Finally, having taunted the audience with, "You can't kill Stepin Fetchit; you might shoot part of yourself," he does a nifty line of steps into the wings, a shadowy silhouette on a dark stage in front of a glowing reproduction of the Hollywood sign in the hills above the film capital.

HEADLINE: A Business That Repairs Equipment Damaged in Disasters

BYLINE: By TOM TOOLEN

DATELINE: Totowa

 BODY:
In a society that often discards items too quickly, the Relectronic Service Corporation of Totowa is something of a rarity. It repairs, cleans and restores, electronic and other equipment that was scheduled for the scrap heap after being damaged in fires, floods or other disasters.
 Max Klepp, president of Relectronic since its founding 12 years ago, says the amount of resources being thrown away in today's technological world is a "disgrace." 
 "Often, all the equipment needs is a good cleaning," he said.
 Mr. Klepp, 56, said restoring instead of replacing equipment saves companies millions of dollars and returns them to normal much faster than if they had to wait for new equipment.
 Old habits die hard, he said. "The largest man-made structure in the world is a dump on Staten Island," he said.
 
A Changing Attitude
 With tough economic times, the throwaway attitude is changing, however. Restoring rather than replacing has gained favor with the insurance industry.
 "Rescuing equipment is a whole new ball game," said Dean Brown, general adjuster of Industrial Risk Insurance of St. Louis. "We can now rely on this new breed of disaster troubleshooter, such as Relectronic, to send in teams with the mission of restoring even the most high-tech equipment. This means dramatic savings in otherwise catastrophic insurance losses."
 Relectronic entered the American market 11 years ago. "First we need to make sure we do no harm," said Wilhelm Tondok, managing director of Relectronic, the service corporation's parent company, based in Munich, who was visiting the Totowa plant. "And if the cleanup cost is more than 50 percent of the replacement value, we say replace it."
 Mr. Klepp added: "We can make only one mistake, and that is to say we can clean it up when we can't. Therefore we prefer to err on the side of caution."
 
Sent to Disaster Areas
 Relectronic sends teams to disaster areas, and the work is often dangerous. "We had to use helicopters to get to a factory in Guatemala after the dam broke and the entire factory was under water," Mr. Klepp said. "And we were constantly working under terrifically adverse conditions in the flooding in the midwest, when 400 factories were under water."
 Relectronic is a division of Siemens, the German electronics giant. Its United States and Canada operation had sales totaling $9 million in the 1993 calendar year, up from $5 million in 1992.
 "Unfortunately for some people, the disaster business is growing." Mr. Klepp said.
 Mr. Klepp is a former vice president at Siemens. A native of Austria, he holds a master's degree in electrical engineering from the University of Vienna and an M.B.A. in business from Fairleigh Dickinson University. His wife, Helga, is the company's customer service manager.
 Relectronic has five offices in the United States and Canada, and there are offices in 14 other countries. The employees log thousands of miles a year flying to trouble spots around the globe. Everyone was called in to help the American branches during the Midwest Floods last summer.
 "We were working around the clock in two shifts, and everyone was putting in 20-hour days," Mr. Klepp said.
 The teams of workers were sent immediately to the Midwest to decontaminate and restore thousands of pieces of equipment and computer systems in factories, hospitals and telephone substations. Relectronic worked for more than 400 businesses that were hit by the flooding.
 "Our guys did not come back fat," Mr. Klepp said, pointing out that they were working in temperatures that soared to 120 degrees in some cases.
 In one factory, many of the highly sophisticated computer-controlled machines in the Midwest floods were caked in eight inches of mud. The machines had to be hoisted to higher ground so they could dry out. Mr. Klepp said; then they were decontaminated before they could be restored to their original state.
 Mr. Klepp said his company uses biodegradable water-based chemicals to clean the equipment. "Of course we have to comply with all environmental laws," he said.
 "Our motto," he added, "is to never make a situation worse."
 Relectronic has about 100 employees in Totowa at the North American headquarters, and at branch offices in California, Illinois, Georgia, Florida and Ontario, Canada.
 One of the most dramatic of the company's rescues was in Austria when a technician had to climb a mountain to restore an electronic Alphine weather station whose parts had become corroded by the atmospheric humidity. It helped that the technician was also a mountain climber, Mr. Klepp said.
 Gil Little Bear of Riverdale in the Bronx is in charge of quality control for the company and has flown hundreds of thousands of miles in his 12 years with Relectronic. He said one of his most dangerous trips was the two months he spent in Papus, New Guinea, in 1987, when a fire knocked out a telephone relay center that served many countries on the Pacific Rim, including parts of Australia, Fiji, Somoa and the Solomon Islands.
 "Many nations' communications were affected,and that put extra pressure on our team to get the system back working," Mr. Little Bear said. "It was a big job because we were operating in a very primitive jungle area."
 Mr. Little Bear was one of a team of five Americans, four Germans and several Australians. It took two months to decontaminated and restore the system.
 Getting companies back online and getting people back to their jobs gives Mr. Klepp a tremendous amount of satisfaction, he said. "We really feel we are doing a good deed," he said.

JAPAN THROUGH AMERICAN EYES
The Journal of Francis Hall,
Kanagawa and Yokohama, 1859-1866.
Edited by F. G. Notehelfer.
Illustrated. 652 pp. Princeton, N.J.:
Princeton University Press. $49.50. 
 "OF all the countries in which to win the reputation of a prophet, I would pronounce Japan the most difficult."
Francis Hall -- teacher, bookseller, entrepreneur, world traveler, journalist, philanthropist and amateur botanist -- was modest (and wise) enough not to claim to be a pundit. Which may be why this genial and relentlessly inquisitive man, who founded the leading American trading house in 19th-century Japan and enlightened his countrymen with on-the-spot reporting for Horace Greeley's New York Tribune, is now largely unknown.
It's easy to imagine, then, how surprised F. G. Notehelfer, a professor of history at the University of California, Los Angeles, must have been when he first leafed through Francis Hall's journal. In family hands until World War II, it had been acquired by a California book dealer and then by the Cleveland Public Library, which pursued the possibility of publication. Mr. Notehelfer, called in to advise, quickly determined that "a rather extraordinary discovery" had been made.
The Japan that Francis Hall encountered when he set off in 1859 with some missionary friends was, as Mr. Notehelfer reminds us in his graceful introduction, entering "one of the most turbulent and confusing decades" in its existence. In fact, "Japan Through American Eyes" is a portrait of a society on the brink of revolution, a feudal world reluctantly opening its doors -- but only a crack.
Hall arrived in Kanagawa, near Yokohama, just a year after a few highly restricted treaty ports were designated for foreign residence and trading. We know now that the teetering government of the shogun, the fractious provincial aristocracy and the long-enfeebled imperial court were already locked in a struggle that would result in the Meiji Restoration, a movement that set Japan on the road to modernization. But all Hall knew was what he could see and hear for himself: the news and rumors passed along by servants and acquaintances, the scenes that unfolded before him as he wandered through the countryside. Occasionally he was able to make a brief visit to other trading ports -- or, rarer still, to Edo, the capital city. More often, though, he recorded the daily life of the growing towns of Kanagawa and Yokohama.
Scholars may pore over Hall's journal for its revelations about a pivotal historical period, but for the rest of us the attraction lies in Hall himself. He was the sort of man who wryly noted, on starting out for a walk, the oddity of putting a revolver in one pocket and a copy of Tennyson in the other. He was equally comfortable telling rollicking tales of an expedition to a volcano, conducting a flirtation with a young woman in a graveyard and politely coping with the "indefatigable" attentions of a Government spy.
Despite his detailed notes on politics and economics, his eager cataloguing of the intricacies of Japan's social and cultural life, Hall had a decidedly whimsical streak. During one afternoon jaunt, he introduced an elderly Japanese invalid to the pleasures of a "brandy sting" ("When she had finished it she politely asked for 'just a little more' "), and he was an admirer not only of the excellent Japanese oysters but of the amenities of Buddhist temples, whose quarters he used as lodgings and whose wells he borrowed, on at least one occasion, to cool his champagne.
Better still, the discerning eye he turned on the Japanese ("They had kindness," he observed of the social status accorded to Japanese women, "but not respect") could just as easily be diverted toward his fellow foreigners. He remarked, for example, that the reactions to news of an arson plot against the foreign settlement went "according to nationality. The Dutch are decidedly timorous and full of absurd rumors, the French suspicious but inclined to be defiant, the English disturbed and apprehensive and practicing a caution that smacks of fear . . . the American laughing at the alarm and incredulous of any real danger, showing not a little of his native recklessness."
Hall's early journal entries are the most vivid, packed with enthusiastic accounts of his discoveries. But Mr. Notehelfer has filled out the later years, when business demanded more of Hall's time, with absorbing passages from his newspaper reporting. Whether writing privately or publicly, Francis Hall was always alert to clues about the "hidden nation" whose people charmed, puzzled and sometimes alarmed him. The only times he seems unreliable are the days when the journal simply notes, "Nothing transpires of interest."

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
Modernism and Morality In the South Bronx

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP

 BODY:
Come 1998, a gleaming new police academy building will streak through the center of the South Bronx like a marathon runner dashing toward the ribbon. The academy's architects have designed a modern athletic thoroughbred of a building. With a sleek, translucent facade of steel and glass, curving as it rounds the bend at East 153d Street just off the Grand Concourse, the design looks every inch a champion, and indeed it is one. Last December, the design won a competition for the most important new public building to go forward during the Dinkins administration.
A lot is riding on this project. With a budget of $230 million, the Police Academy is an important civic symbol, a sign that even in hard times, New York can build major public works. Now housed in crowded quarters on East 20th Street in Manhattan, the academy will be relocated to the South Bronx in an effort to erase the borough's image as a metaphor for urban decline. Not least, at a time when law and order promises to become a major issue in the approaching mayoral campaign, this project offers a conspicuous show of support for the city's law enforcement officers. It also offers an opportunity of overpowering importance: a chance to rethink the critical place of law enforcement in American cities today. This is what lifts the project out of the realm of local news and into a national spotlight. 
 For some, the building represents a change in course for architecture. Earlier last year, the city's competition to design the Whitehall Ferry Terminal was won by a post-modern entry by Venturi, Scott Brown & Associates with Frederic Schwartz. By contrast, the Police Academy competition (in which Venturi, Scott Brown was also an entrant) was won by an aggressively modernist design by Ellerbe Becket and Michael Fieldman & Partners. Some interpret this contrast as a sign of a modernist revival.
More likely, the contrast signifies a crisis of faith in the supremacy of architectural esthetics. Underlying the crisis is the belief that architecture ought to do more than it has done in recent years to ameliorate social conditions. But how? How far can buildings make up for society's shortcomings? The Police Academy is a case study in the dysfunctional relationship between esthetic means and social ends. It illustrates the fallacy in thinking that modernist images can revive modernism's utopian mission.
Government officials and architects are not the only ones now reckoning with the place of law enforcement in the cities. As a result of the Rodney King beating and its politically charged aftermath, Americans have never been more aware of the tensions between the public and the police. The King trials will not resolve those tensions, because the beating did not create them. They will persist so long as society expects the police to compensate for its own failure to reframe the social contract. If police behavior is sometimes warped, the public's expectations of law enforcement are also warped. Police are supposed to maintain civil order within a society that has retreated from the moral order once embedded in the public realm.
As those who have followed the trials have witnessed, law enforcement is more than a profession. It is a culture. And a police academy is where that culture is transmitted. Here cadets are trained not just in firearms, arrest procedures and other technical skills but also in the codes of a fellowship: its bonds of solidarity, ideals of heroism and sacrifice, the unstable mix of service and distrust that binds the police to the public, or fails to.
The city's decision to organize a design competition -- in effect, to honor architecture along with the men and women in blue -- gave due recognition to the importance of this project. And the Ellerbe Becket/Fieldman scheme was visually the strongest of the seven finalists. In model form, it is a beautiful piece of architectural sculpture, at once muscular and lyrical, formally assertive but not visually overbearing, its airy translucence a deliberate attempt to avoid a fortresslike impression. With its taut, horizontally stretched skin of steel and glass, the design recalls the work of Erich Mendelsohn, the pioneer modernist who imbued static forms with the quality of dynamic motion.
In this, as in much of his recent work, Peter Pran, Ellerbe Becket's principal designer, is also heavily indebted to Zaha Hadid and to the Russian modernists who have long inspired her. It is delicious to contemplate that in five years' time the capital city of capitalism will be policed by officers trained inside a building that harks back to the Soviet avant-garde.
The shape of the building, and the configuration of the outdoor campus it partly frames, make the best of an awkward site, an irregularly shaped eight-and-a-half-acre parcel that is bordered on the south by an elevated roadway and on the east by commuter rail tracks. Two buildings are enfolded within the academy's broad horizontal sweep. Administration offices are housed in the curved, eight-story tower at the western end, while classrooms are in the wing that stretches 400 feet to the northeast. A library, an auditorium and other public spaces are set at the juncture of the two wings.
The design's elegance derives partly from its tiny footprint. By stacking the functions vertically, the architects were able to shape a block that is linear, not blocklike. At its western edge, the facade rises to a sharp, glittering peak and pulls partly away from the building envelope, as if it were doing stretching exercises before a morning run.
Outdoor athletic areas, in fact, take up the greater share of the campus. Set within the building's curving frame are a running track, basketball courts and two muster decks, platforms where cadets assemble each morning. One of the decks, protected by a sweeping metal canopy, is designed for use in foul weather. On sunny days, the southeastern orientation will take advantage of the maximum solar exposure.
Although the Police Academy will not open its doors for another five years, it has already begun to play an educational role. The design has become a focus for discussions on the contributions the academy could make to the South Bronx. A group of pro-bono architects and planners called Bronx Center has provided the catalyst for these discussions. Initiated by Borough President Fernando Ferrer of the Bronx, and chaired by Richard A. Kahan, a former president of the New York State Urban Development Corporation, the group has come up with some excellent ideas. They include creating new housing, so recruits can live in the neighborhood while they study there, and hiring local construction firms to benefit the community economically as well as architecturally.
Their most exciting proposal is to create a high school that would focus on criminal justice studies, a kind of High School of the Performing Arts for the Commishes of tomorrow. Mr. Kahan envisions a place where recruits would serve as student mentors, helping to bridge the frightening gap between police and public. Naturally, it would have made more sense to hold these discussions before the design competition. Fortunately, the Police Department and the Board of Education have been receptive to the Bronx Center proposals, even though they would reorganize the Police Academy's public spaces and, quite likely, change the building's design.
There's something else at stake in this building, at least for Mr. Pran: nothing less than the very soul of his profession. In a preface to a recent monograph of his work, he depicts contemporary architecture as a Manichaean struggle between the forces of light and darkness. "The main opposition today," he writes, "is between the new authentic modern architecture and the regressive post-modern (unhistoric) historicism." Evidently seeing himself as architecture's answer to 911, Mr. Pran supplies a list of other architects who he thinks fall into line on the correct side of the struggle. It reads like a roll call on his personal muster deck, a line-'em-up inspection of the good guys willing to fight the undesirable post-modern elements that have ruined the old modern neighborhood.
Mr. Pran's buildings may well be progressive, but his thinking is out of date. The post-modern bandwagon passed by some time ago. The movement's most ardent promoters, such as Charles Jencks and Philip Johnson, were among the first to leap off it. And few architects today are eager to crank up another bandwagon. For them, and for much of the public also, phrases like "the new modernism" have the same hollow, promotional ring that turned post-modernism into such a nightmare.
Still, Mr. Pran's anxieties about the state of architecture are widely shared. Many architects today would like to regain the moral authority of the modern movement. They yearn for the solidarity of purpose that once united architects in the cause of building a better world. But what are the means by which those goals can be achieved today?
For Mr. Pran, the means is architectural form. He thinks that "the tremendous heritage of early modern architecture" can be revived by evoking its formal vocabulary. But the Police Academy tells a different story. What edges this project into the utopian dimension of early modernism is the potential of the building program to reduce the tensions between the public and police. While the architects partly developed this potential, the Bronx Center has pushed the hardest to make it happen. And any number of formal vocabularies could be used to accommodate their goals.
Mr. Pran writes that "architecture is about giving people the opportunity to live better lives." That is a fine piece of rhetoric, and so is the Police Academy design. But the moral value of this building depends on how far it can be pushed out of the realm of high-flown rhetoric and into the turbulent South Bronx. This marathon champion of a building could easily be an alien presence, streaking through the neighborhood without looking around.
It is understandable that architects now have such an inflated idea of the moral power of forms. Forms are virtually all they have to work with. In a way, architects are in a position precisely analogous to that of the police. They are expected to provide order and cohesion in an environment that has become fragmented. They are asked to create symbols of a public realm that scarcely exists unless volunteers are willing to provide it.
It is tempting, in fact, to interpret the Police Academy's thin, warped facade as an emblem of this condition. The warp mirrors our warped expectations. The facade is handsome. But it can no more restore modernism's moral order than a fluted column can restore a world of classical harmony.
IF THIS IS A TIME OF CHANGE FOR architecture, it need not be the time for architects to lock-step into another dreary stylistic movement, or to promote themselves by trashing the work of the preceding era. Thus it is regrettable that Mr. Pran singles out for attack the "anti-modern" work of Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown. Mr. Venturi and Ms. Scott Brown did indeed open up paths that some of their followers took in retrogressive directions. But there is nothing anti-modern about their work. In fact, it is hyper-modern. It recognizes that the glass tower and the golden arches are both products of modernity. Painfully aware of the wholesale discrediting of the past that occurred in the heyday of the modern movement, Mr. Venturi and Ms. Scott Brown have no desire to repeat it by throwing out the glass tower.
Nothing could be more "unhistoric" than to fantasize that post-modernism did not happen, or to deny that its best examples shared the creative ideals that Mr. Pran rightly advocates. It is also blatantly unhistorical to equate modernism solely with the pioneering work of Walter Gropius, Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe. If architects want to ground their work more fully in modern history, they must remember what came after the pioneers: the exhausted state of modernism in the 1960's, when Mr. Venturi and Ms. Scott Brown developed their ideas.
By then, modern invention had been reduced to dogma and modern morality to a club for keeping people in line. Modern architects had become creatures of corporate culture but fancied themselves artistic iconoclasts. Does anyone really want to live through that again?
Though different in style, the Police Academy raises precisely the same dilemma that surfaced with the ferry terminal project for Staten Island last year. Admiration for the design must be tempered by the fear that "world class" architecture has become an acceptable way to camouflage poverty-class planning. With the ferry terminal, the city's welcome support for architecture had to be measured against a transportation system that is coming apart at the seams.
With the Police Academy, the dilemma is even more acute. The design's strengths must be weighed against the ravaged condition of schools, housing and entire inner-city neighborhoods where law and order has become a desperate substitute for public life.

HEADLINE: HOW JACK KEMP LOST THE WAR ON POVERTY

 BODY:
Jason DeParle's article on Jack Kemp's ill-fated war on poverty twice describes the former Budget Director Dick Darman as mocking the idea of "empowerment" as a left-wing idea from the 60's ("How Jack Kemp Lost the War on Poverty," Feb. 28). This reflects the state of Darman's regrettable ignorance. The word "empowerment" first appeared in a brilliant 1967 book entitled "Black Power and Urban Unrest," by a distinguished scholar and churchman, Dr. Nathan Wright Jr. Dr. Wright, who had recently been chairman of the National Conference on Black Power, eloquently introduced the idea of empowerment to the Senate Subcommittee on Housing and Urban Affairs on July 27, 1967.
Far from being a 1960's leftist, Dr. Wright was a lifelong registered Republican. His testimony was in support of a bill sponsored by all the Republican senators to help lower-income people become homeowners. He was featured in a cover story in this magazine in 1968 as a black Republican likely to be influential during the Nixon years. (Alas, his wise voice was largely ignored.) 
 Empowerment is a profoundly Republican idea, and Jack Kemp and Jim Pinkerton built on a solid Republican foundation in advocating it. The Republican party is now out of power, in no small measure because of the myopic arrogance of Darman, whose attachment to the party came only from his ambition, not from commitment to any principle.

HEADLINE: Refinancings Balloon as the Rates Slide

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
A WAVE of refinancings and new mortgage applications have swamped lenders in recent weeks as interest rates have slid to record lows.
"It's pandemonium," said Ellen Feldschreiber, a partner with the Manhattan Mortgage Company. "We have people who are refinancing who refinanced last year, and even six months ago." 
 The national average interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell slightly, to 7.55 percent for the week ended March 26, according to preliminary figures from HSH Associates in Butler, N.J., which surveys 2,000 lenders nationwide each week.
The average interest rate had been 7.65 percent at the end of the previous week, but it stood at 7.52 percent for the week ending March 12 and 7.51 percent, the lowest rate since May 1973, for the week ended March 5.
The up-twice, down-once pattern follows 17 consecutive weeks of falling average rates for 30-year fixed mortgages, going back to the week ended Nov. 13, 1992, when the average rate was 8.54 percent.
"The biggest part of the interest rate rally may be gone," said Keith T. Gumbinger, an analyst with HSH Associates. "The probability of rates decreasing is less that it is for interest rates increasing."
Declines in interest rates can save borrowers significant sums. At 7.51 percent, the monthly principal and interest payment is $699.89 on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage of $100,000. For a similar loan at 8.54 percent the payment is $771.75 a month.
Mr. Gumbinger attributed the vacillation of mortgage rates in March to the rising demand for new mortgages and refinancings. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington, refinancing activity reached a record level for the week ended March 12, the most recent week for which data were available. Overall, loan application volume -- for refinancing and new mortgages -- was 11 percent higher than the previous week and 113 percent higher than for the same week in 1992.
More importantly, though, Mr. Gumbinger cited fears of inflation. Consumer prices climbed a moderate 0.30 percentage point last month but "core" inflation rose a more troubling 0.50 percentage point for the second straight month. Many analysts considered the results, combined with a recent jump in producer prices, evidence of rising inflation.
Mr. Gumbinger said that the overall decline in mortgage rates since November had been fueled by a decline in yields in the bond market. Interest rates on 30-year Treasury bonds, which are commonly known as long bonds, fell to 6.72 percent on March 8, the lowest point recorded since the Treasury began selling them in 1977.
The falling yields are attributed to traders' and investors' belief that inflation will remain low; that Congress and the White House will reduce the deficit and that the tax increases the Clinton Administration has called for will slow economic growth and lessen the threat of rising inflation.
Should it appear that significent deficit reductions are not forthcoming, or if inflation heats up, then bond yields are likely to rise, followed by higher mortgage rates.
"The market is kind of politicized right now," Mr. Gumbinger said.
Mortgage interest rates actually began falling in the mid-80's, with zigs and zags along the way since then. They peaked in Oct. 1981 at 18.19 percent for fixed-rate loans and 17.54 percent for adjustable-rate mortgages.
As it was last summer, during the last decline in mortgage interest rates, much of the activity involves refinancing. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, 62.1 percent of all applications for the week ended March 12 were for refinancings.
"Last year homeowners freed up about $16 million in lower debt service due to refinancings and adjustments made to their adjustable-rate mortgages," said Warren Lasko, executive vice president of the association. "We expect similar savings this year."
Refinancing can be a complicated and cumbersome project for many homeowners. In fact, many of the old rules that used to dictate when and how to refinance have changed. In the past, when homes were generally increasing in value, a "2-2-2" formula usually determined whether it made financial sense to refinance. The numbers meant that if borrowers had been in their home at least two years, intended to stay at least two more and refinanced at a rate at least two points lower than their current mortgage rate, refinancing was practical.
TODAY, though, guidelines are more flexible and depend on individual circumstances. Homeowners who qualify for refinancing should calculate how much they will pay in closing costs, fees and points -- a point is 1 percent of the amount borrowed. (Generally, closing costs for refinancing a share loan on a co-op will be less than for a mortgage on a condominium or home.)
Then they should figure how much their monthly mortgage payments will drop and how long it will take before their monthly savings cover the refinancing costs.
Many buyers and those now refinancing, particularly those nearing retirement, are also choosing 15-year mortgages instead of the more traditional 30-year loans. The impetus for a shorter mortgage is to reduce the amount of interest paid out over the life of the loan or, among older borrowers, to pay off the mortgage before retirement.
They are also choosing fixed-rate over adjustable-rate loans. Only about 11 percent of the new mortgage and refinancing activity today consists of adjustable-rate loans.
Borrowers, however, should take a close look at adjustable-rate mortgages, which seem riskier, especially considering the rising interest rates of the 80's. They may be missing out on the savings they could achieve if interest rates stay low. Indeed, homeowners who took out adjustable-rate mortgages in the 80's have watched their monthly payments drop significantly in the last year. And should adjustable rates rise, even to levels higher than today's fixed rates, the savings in the earlier years of the adjustable loan may still keep borrowers ahead.
Adjustable-rate mortgages also tend to be the most beneficial to borrowers who plan to sell their homes in three to five years; homeowners stay in their homes an average of only seven years nowadays.
As for risk, annual and lifetime caps will protect today's adjustable-loan borrowers from sudden high increases.
Average national adjustable rates have fallen to an all-time low of 4.75 percent for the week ending March 26. On Nov. 13, 1992, when the downturn in interest rates began, the rate was 5.33 percent.
Qualifying for refinancing can be difficult, particularly if the home has declined in value, as many have in the last five years, or if the homeowner has encountered credit problems or a decline in household income.
Ms. Feldschreiber added, though, that that many of the new buyers and refinancings were at the high end, where qualifiying problems are less likely to be encountered. She also said that home appraisals, a necessary step in any refinancing, have been higher in the past few weeks.
"It's only been very recently that we have been noticing this,' she said.

HEADLINE: TV Industry Scrambles for Studio Space

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
UNTIL January, you could get to Sesame Street by way of Ninth Avenue in Manhattan. Come July, however, Sesame Street will be found intersecting 34th Avenue in Astoria, Queens.
Having outgrown Unitel Video's Studio 55, at Ninth Avenue and 55th Street, the Children's Television Workshop, which produces "Sesame Street," started searching in 1991 for new space in Manhattan. They needed at least 12,000 square feet, said Marjorie Kalins, the group vice president of production, and clearance of 23 feet to the lights, since the sets must be high enough off the floor to allow the Muppet puppeteers to work standing up. 
 Such space "was absolutely not available," said David Micciulla, vice president and general manager of Unitel, which runs eight studios in Manhattan. "It's not even that it's booked. It doesn't exist."
After a fruitless year and a half, the producers concluded there was no choice but to take "Sesame Street" across the East River to Kaufman Astoria Studios. In 1994, however, "Sesame Street" plans to move again, to the Manhattan Industrial Center on the Chelsea waterfront, where new soundstages will have been built specially for the show.
"Sesame Street" was not alone in its search. Ms. Kalins said that she and a representative of Procter & Gamble were "tripping over one another" as they visited locations. Procter & Gamble produces three soap operas -- "As the World Turns," "Guiding Light" and "Another World" -- in studios on the East and West Sides, and in Brooklyn. For years, it has been trying to find an alternative in New York, while keeping an eye on Los Angeles.
For David Letterman, CBS examined 15 theaters on and off Broadway -- including the Ambassador, Belasco, Cort, Helen Hayes -- before settling on the Ed Sullivan Theater at Broadway and 53d Street, a neo-Gothic landmark that needs millions of dollars of renovation work.
The "Sesame Street," Procter & Gamble and CBS odysseys underscore what many believe to be a critical problem for the television industry in New York City: the lack of large, technically advanced studios, particularly in Manhattan, where performers are more likely to live or stay, audiences to congregate and suppliers to be located.
"I think we need additional state-of-the-art television facilities," said Richard Brick, director of the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting. "I'm of what we call the 'Field of Dreams' philosophy, to quote a recent movie. If you build them, they will come."
Patrick Pleven, the assistant director for broadcasting, said, "Just as we have convention centers, maybe the city should think about having broadcast centers."
ECONOMICALLY, the stakes are high. For example, the Procter & Gamble shows together employ at least 450 people on any given day and about 700 in a week, full- and part-time. The shows generate more than $100 million a year in salaries, rentals, materials and transportation.
"I want work," Mr. Brick said. "I want jobs. I want the economic benefits of more production. If that means creating Manhattan facilities, I'm very much for it."
A key problem is that studios function best horizontally, with broad expanses of space at street level and support services such as the scenery shop as close as possible. But given the cost of land in Manhattan, the premium is on vertical construction. Studios can be reached only through loading docks and freight elevators. And the scenery shops may be far away, where the rent is cheaper.
"The physical asset of a studio doesn't produce enough money to warrant its being in Manhattan," said George S. Kaufman, the developer of Kaufman Astoria Studios.
Mr. Kaufman and his associates believe that producers need look no farther than Queens and they resent the "Manhattan or bust" mentality with which they compete.
"It's not facilities that New York needs -- it needs business," said Hal G. Rosenbluth, senior executive vice president and chief operating officer at Kaufman Astoria. "Facilities are not going to generate business. They make up too small a percentage of the budget. Their impact is so small."
And to the argument that Kaufman Astoria has film stages, not proper television studios, Mr. Rosenbluth pointed out that "The Cosby Show," "Here and Now" and "The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd" were produced there. And the Lifetime Television cable network has two studios in the complex.
One of the biggest questions in the industry is what Procter & Gamble will do. Ann Jenemann Smith, a spokeswoman at the company's Cincinnati headquarters, said it would keep producing in New York as long as it could stay competitive and control costs.
That may be difficult. "Production requirements have grown increasingly more demanding and sophisticated," she said. "The studios in New York City continue to be very limited in space and operating configurations. Comparing them to the state-of-the-art facilities in Los Angeles, New York studios are smaller, less flexible and they're more expensive to manage."
Eight years ago, Mayor Edward I. Koch announced that Procter & Gamble and Arol Buntzman, a developer, would rebuild the abandoned Washburn Wire Company plant on the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, from 116th to 119th Streets, as the new home for the three soap operas. Within a year, however, plagued by delays and cost overruns, the East Harlem project collapsed.
NOTHING else has materialized since then. "The issue becomes one of money," said Philip Dixson, who represents Procter & Gamble in New York as the vice president and managing director of daytime program services at D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles.
"We exist in 13-week and 26-week cycles," Mr. Dixson said. "You can't take that to the bank and get financing. Nobody in today's market can afford to build these things on spec, in the hope that one of these shows will make a commitment."
He rephrased the "Field of Dreams" tagline: "If you build it, I might come."
Ms. Kalins noted that the economics of studio development were such that "it can't be driven unless you have a dedicated client for that space that can provide some guarantee of the percentage of the amortization."
"Sesame Street" came close to being the anchor tenant of the proposed Silver Screen Studios, which are to be created in the five-block-long headhouse of the Chelsea Piers on the Hudson River, between 17th and 22d Streets. The piers themselves would be used as a sports center, including two ice-skating rinks, an indoor track and gymnastics area and an outdoor golf driving range.
The project would be undertaken by Chelsea Piers Management, owned by Roland W. Betts, Tom A. Bernstein and David A. Tewksbury, which would lease the state-owned piers for 10 years.
When Mr. Betts's team was selected last June by the Transportation Department, he said construction might begin in January 1993. But the project has been delayed.
In November, the Hudson River Park Conservancy, a subsidiary of the state Urban Development Corporation, "saw the need to insure that an environmental assessment be done prior to such a major undertaking on West Side waterfront," said its president, Tom Fox. The decision followed by two months a lawsuit against the larger Hudson River Park project by four civic groups on environmental grounds.
"We were all set until the state required an environmental impact statement before they executed the lease," Mr. Betts said. The delay derailed the "Sesame Street" deal, as the show has to begin taping in August 1993.
"Film and television producers want to be here," Mr. Betts said. "Their question to us is, 'When is the E.I.S. going to be finished?' " He said that he still believed the $50 million project could begin this summer.
Another proposal in circulation calls for rehabilitating the New York Coliseum as an international broadcast center, under a 10-year lease, until the site is redeveloped by Boston Properties. The partners in this enterprise are Dick Maitland and Steve Israel.
On March 14, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which owns the Coliseum through the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, requested "expressions of interest" from operators who would lease the Coliseum. It cautioned in that document that the property was under contract for sale and that it would seek a lease term "consistent with the future development of the site."
Procter & Gamble had "some serious interest" in the Coliseum proposal, Mr. Dixson said. But he said the site had "a lot of encumbrances, politically and legally, and I'm not sure those can be dealt with in a way that would allow a producer like myself to go in there and operate economically."
Next year, "Sesame Street" plans to occupy the 10th floor of the Manhattan Industrial Center, on 10th Avenue, between 15th and 16th Streets. That space would be leased and rebuilt by M.T.I., an independent studio operator, and sublet to Children's Television Workshop. The workshop's other show, "Ghostwriter," would remain at M.T.I. Television City, Park Avenue and 106th Street.
Earlier this month, Mayor David N. Dinkins and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo announced $49.7 million in benefits to help CBS rebuild its Broadcast Center at 524 West 57th Street and also to renovate the Ed Sullivan Theater for Mr. Letterman.
The Broadcast Center is a four-building complex between 10th and 11th Avenues, where some 3,200 people work, in and around seven studios. On a recent morning, crews in Studio 41, used by "As the World Turns," were setting up Lucinda's office, a solarium, the McKechnie living room and a grand jury anteroom. In a corridor outside, dozens of people were lined up to get into Studio 45, where the Joan Rivers show was about to begin. Next door, in Studio 44, Harry Smith and Paula Zahn were finishing the "CBS This Morning" broadcast.
AT the heart of this operation is the "routing switcher," an installation that links all the technical equipment -- cameras, control consoles, satellites, transmitters, videotape machines. The existing "switcher" dates to the 1960's. As it grew less reliable, CBS had to decide how and where to replace it. "Unlike a soap-opera studio or a newsroom, those computers can be anyplace," said Edward Grebow, senior vice president for operations and administration.
"We traveled to Westchester, New Jersey and farther afield," he said. "We never wanted to leave New York but we'd be doing our stockholders a disservice if we didn't consider other options." These included the Queens West project in Hunters Point.
CBS was persuaded to stay in place through $31 million in sales-tax waivers on purchases of machinery and equipment, $12.2 million in electric power and $6.5 million in real-estate tax credits. Title to the Broadcast Center will formally be transferred to the city's Industrial Development Agency, which will permit certain tax savings. A similar arrangement was used six years ago when NBC modernized its studios at 30 Rockefeller Plaza.
Capital Cities/ABC has taken a different tack. It plans two new studios, Nos. 25 and 26, on the northwest corner of West End Avenue and 64th Street, adjoining Studios 23 and 24.
STUDIO 26 would have 15,000 square feet, with room for an audience, and might be used for a game show, talk show or situation comedy. "All My Children" would move to Studio 25 from Studio 23, which would be taken by "One Life to Live." That would open Studio 17, at 56 West 66th Street, for news or entertainment use, freeing space elsewhere for the creation of other new shows.
ABC has calculated that 300 new jobs would be created and 170 existing jobs would be retained. Also, because all the scenery for the soap operas and the new entertainment show would be built and stored on site, 122 truck trips a day would be eliminated.
To help offset the estimated $100 million cost, ABC would sell part of its site to a developer who would build an apartment complex in an L-shape around Studio 25.
"We do have to justify this project in-house," said Bruce E. Phillips, vice president for design and development at Capital Cities/ ABC. "Our building costs are higher here than in Los Angeles. We have to come up with an edge, to make this facility competitive."
"This studio will get built," said Richard E. Hockman, vice president for real estate and construction. "What the city process will determine is whether it gets built in New York or Los Angeles."
Originally, the network proposed three towers with 937 units. Objecting to the high density, among other things, Community Board 7 opposed the plan by a vote of 28 to 5. Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan also recommended disapproval.
ABC has since eliminated one of the three towers and reduced the number of units to about 500, all the while protesting that it is unfairly being made to pay the political price for local opposition to the nearby Manhattan West and Riverside South projects.
The matter is now before the City Planning Commission, which is to vote on Wednesday.
ABC seems to share the "Field of Dreams" philosophy. "We believe that if studio space is available, the need will materialize down the road," Mr. Phillips said.
This appears to be a particularly ripe moment for New York, given the proliferation of talk shows, which demand an unending supply of the interesting guests and lively audiences that the city can offer.
On one single block -- 57th Street, between 10th and 11th Avenues -- four talk shows are taped: Joan Rivers and Geraldo Rivera at the CBS Broadcast Center, Sally Jesse Raphael and Rush Limbaugh at Unitel Video.
THE old "Sesame Street" home, Studio 55, was snapped up by the Jane Whitney show, which has moved from Boston. That began a new round of musical chairs because two other talk shows had their eyes on Studio 55, said Bill Vassar of Unitel.
And Bill Cosby is to return in the 1994 fall season with a one-hour light comedy that will be produced in New York, along the lines of "Murder, She Wrote" or "Columbo," an NBC spokesman said.
Meanwhile, other opportunities slip away.
"We are frequently being asked by shows for space that we don't have room for," Mr. Grebow said. "If we had the room, we could do more, because there are a lot of shows shooting in very substandard spaces."
Stephen Burrow, executive director of the New York local of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, said New York had lost game shows as well as a situation comedy, "in part for lack of adequate studio space."
The Borough President's office has begun analyzing how many additional studios might be needed. "It's very much in the city's interest to entertain proposals for studio construction," Ms. Messinger said. "On the other hand, we have to be careful not to mindlessly allow a lot of different proponents of creating studio space to get into an expensive competition for a finite number of films and commercials and programs, because that's a very expensive glut to create."

CHINESE SCHOLARS UNITE
Scholars from the People's Republic of China and from Taiwan will discuss their differences and their future in a day and evening conference at Yale on Saturday. The event is open to the public for a fee of $20 and free to students. 
 The morning session will cover Chinese culture, past and present; literature and media development in Taiwan and the mainland, and the future of Chinese ethical thought, science and technology and institutional reform.
From 1:45 to 5 P.M. the topics will include the future of trade between the mainland and Taiwan; investment possibilities and economic cooperation; political relations and democratization and legal conflicts and the implications for the United States.
Jonathan Spence, professor of history at Yale, will deliver a keynote address at 7:30 P.M., after which there will be a table discussion until 10 P.M.
Among the speakers scheduled throughout the day are Howard Lamar, Acting President of Yale; Chen Yih-young , president of the National Open University of Taiwan; Tu Wei-ming, professor of Chinese culture at Harvard; Duan Ruichun, visiting professor from Beijing University; Chang Xiuze, professor of economics at Nankai University in Tianjin; Hsu Tzong-li, professor of law at the National Taiwan University in Taipei, and other faculty members specializing in Asian studies from American, Taiwanese and Chinese mainland universities.
Some presentations will be in English, others will be in Chinese. Lunch and dinner are available in nearby restaurants, or on campus with special tickets. Registration will be at 8:30 A.M. in Sheffield-Sterling-Strathcona Hall at Prospect and Grove Streets. For more information call 230-9685.
 
MAKING MATZOH
 Most people are familiar with the Old Testament story about how the Jews, escaping from Egypt, baked a kind of bread called matzoh by setting unleavened dough out on rocks in the broiling sun until it was cooked.
At Passover, the Jewish holiday commemorating the Exodus each spring, food markets carry a variety of packaged matzoh, and now, thanks to Beth Israel Synagogue, 40 King Street in Norwalk, anyone can learn how to bake it at home.
Today at 9:30 and again at 10:30 A.M. matzoh-baking workshops will be held in which participants will make the dough, roll it out, bake it and take it home. The event will end with a film on the production of matzoh. All ages, from children to the elderly, are welcome. Admission is $3 to cover the cost of materials. Call 866-0534 for more information.
 
GRANDPARENT STORIES
 Grandparents will be invited to make half-hour videotaped readings of stories or chapters of books to send to their grandchildren in a program that starts Thursday at the Farmington Library. "So many families live far from the grandparents; we found this fills a need," said Lucille O'Connor, who directs the program.
While some grandparents do make such tapings at home, "We find that older people are not fond of fiddling with electronic equipment," Ms. O'Connell said. Besides, the library has a large selection of new books covering the grandparent-grandchild relationship.
The tapes will be played back for the reader and an occasional re-taping may be made if the first one is not satisfactory. Grandparents should bring a blank tape or they may purchase one at the library.
Appointments must be made by calling 673-6791.
 
SCHWEITZER LECTURER
 Jane Goodall, the naturalist who gained worldwide recognition for her work with primates in Tanzania, will deliver the first International Albert Schweitzer Lecture at Yale on Friday at 4 P.M. in Battell Chapel. Her subject will be "Chimpanzees: Living Bridge Between Man and Beast" and admission is free.
The lecture series was established by the International Schweitzer Institute for the Humanities and the Whitney Humanities Center at Yale. Three lectures will be presented each year featuring international figures speaking on topics of concern to Dr. Schweitzer during his lifetime: social justice, medicine and health, human and animal rights, the environment, nuclear disarmament and world peace.
Ms. Goodall will speak a second time on Saturday at 4 P.M. in Hamden, where the Schweitzer Institute's new center is to open at 515 Sherman Avenue on the campus of Quinnipiac College. Her talk, titled "Some Lessons From Our Nearest Relatives," will be presented in Alumni Hall and admission is free.
 
PILOBOLUS WORKSHOPS
 The Pilobolus Dance Theater will hold two two-day workshops at the Mattatuck Museum in Waterbury. Classes from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Saturday and next Sunday will be held, one for those who have had little or no experience in dance movement, and another one for those who are somewhat experienced.
Teaching will focus on improvisational movement for the inexperienced, and on choreography and performance for the more advanced students. Each workshop is limited to 30 people; the instructors will be the artistic directors of Pilobolus.
Drawing from their own interests and experiences, participants will collaborate on creating new dances that they will perform informally on Sunday at 4 P.M. for a public audience.
To register for a fee of $40 for either of the two-day workshops, or to obtain more information, call 868-0538. There will be no charge for those attending the 4 P.M. performance.
Pilobolus will perform next Sunday at 8 P.M. at Central Naugatuck Valley Higher Education Center. Tickets are $15, or $10 for students and the elderly. Call 575-8039 for reservations.
 
SOUNDS CUCKOO
 "Imitazione del Cuccu" for violin and continuo by Walther, "The Cuckoo and the Nightingale" by Handel and "Le Rappel des Oiseaux" by Couperin hint at the genre of music to be performed on Saturday at 8 P.M. in the First Congregational Church of Darien.
It consists of concerti and other works that imitate the sounds of cats, dogs, cuckoos, nightingales, hens and goldfinches, among other wild and domesticated creatures.
Musicians of the Old Post Road, who created the program, perform on authentic period instruments. They include Michael Bahmann, harpsichordist; Suzanne Stumpf, flutist; Dana Maiben and Julie McKenzie, violinists; Anne Black, violist, and Daniel Ryan, cellist.
The church is at 14 Brookside Road and admission will be $10, or $5 for students and the elderly.
 
MALL FOR MALL
 England's restored 18th- and 19th-century shops and shopping arcades are the subject of a talk to be given today at 2 P.M. by Lorella Brocklesby, a professor of architecture and cultural historian from London who is currently an adjunct professor of humanities at New York University. The program will be at the Yale Center for British Art, 1080 Chapel Street in New Haven and admission is $5.
Burlington Arcade and its top-hatted beadles, Covent Garden, The Colonnades in Bath, and elegantly restored Georgian and Victorian arcades in Stanford and York are among the venues to be discussed and compared with the ubiquitous American mall.

HEADLINE: Hartford Whalers' Goal: To Become Connecticut's Team, or Else

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH

 BODY:
SINCE moving to Hartford during the 1974-75 season, officials of the Hartford Whalers hockey club have made it a point to stress that the Whalers are the only major league sports team in Connecticut. And in recent years, as attendance has steadily declined, some club officials have said that although the Whalers carry a Hartford geographical designation, they are, in effect, "Connecticut's team" and worthy of fan support throughout the state.
In truth, hockey fans in most of the state have shown little or no allegiance to the Whalers. Fans in Fairfield and New Haven Counties, for example, tend to root for the New York Rangers, while most hockey fans in the eastern part of the state follow the Boston Bruins. 
 Indeed, even Rick Francis, the Whalers' vice president for marketing and sales, concedes that the vast majority of the team's fans are from within a 25-mile radius of Hartford, which includes the Springfield, Mass. area, and that most of them live in the Farmington Valley.
Now, with the team in dire financial straits and amid reports that the Whalers may move out of state, the Whaler hierarchy is trying to lure fans from throughout Connecticut. "We're a Connecticut team, and we'd like to get more people from Fairfield County and other parts of the state to our games," Richard Gordon, principal owner of the Whalers, said in a recent interview. "And since we are a regional team, we're considering changing our name to the Connecticut Whalers."
 
Breaking the New York Habit
 Mr. Gordon said that the team was faced with a situation where in Fairfield County, for example, a lot of people were more oriented toward New York. "We want to try to attract them and make them aware of the fact that you can drive to the Hartford Civic Center from most parts of Fairfield County quicker than you can drive to Madison Square Garden," he said. "And our prices are a lot cheaper."
The top price for a New York Rangers' game is $39, compared with $27 for a Whalers' game. Parking fees near Madison Square Garden are as high as $20, compared with $4 and $5 at the Hartford Civic Center.
Through 40 home games of this season, with 5 remaining, the Whalers have averaged 10,336 fans at the Civic Center, which seats 15,635 for hockey and has been the team's home since it opened in January 1975. That is the lowest average attendance for the team since it joined the National Hockey League in 1979 after five seasons in the old American Hockey Association, when they were known as the New England Whalers.
 
Millions in Losses
 By any name, the franchise, which has the smallest market of any American team in the N.H.L., is in trouble. Mr. Gordon said the club lost $4.5 million last season and would lose around $7 million this year. "The economy is killing us, what with all the closings and layoffs around Hartford," Mr. Gordon said. "And the team's performance hasn't helped."
Mr. Gordon, a real estate developer who has owned about 75 percent of the Whalers along with a corporate consortium since 1988, was alluding to the Whalers' record of 21 victories, 46 defeats and 5 ties, going into last night's game against Minnesota. That is the worst record in the N.H.L. apart from that of two expansion teams, the Ottawa Senators and the San Jose Sharks.
But the team's plight goes beyond its poor performance and low attendance. When some Whaler officials hinted that the club might have to leave Connecticut for greener financial pastures, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., himself a hockey fan, helped negotiate for the team a $4 million loan last October along with loan guarantees of up to $10 million. Under terms of the loan, the state retains the option for seven years to buy the team itself or arrange for a buyer from within Connecticut. The purchase price would be 90 percent of any offer the Whalers' ownership might get to move the team elsewhere.
 
New Lease a Key
 Seemingly, the key to keeping the Whalers in Hartford is a new lease with the city, which owns the Civic Center. Currently, the Whalers are playing at the Civic Center under a second extension of an old lease, which, in the words of Mr. Weicker, "stinks."
"I've put $23 million into a building that I don't own," Mr. Gordon said. "And unlike other N.H.L. teams, we don't receive any share of the concession or parking revenues. And we get only about half of the rinkboard advertising."
To make matters worse, Whaler games are rarely shown on television, so the club is deprived of television revenues, and its radio network has declined in the last few years from a high of a dozen stations to nine.
Despite all the problems, Mr. Gordon said he was committed to staying in Hartford. "I definitely want to stay, and my bet is that a satisfactory lease will be worked out so that we do stay," said Mr. Gordon, who attends most games, often with his friend, Ivan Lendl, the tennis player, a resident of Greenwich and member of the club's board of directors
 
Hartford Beleaguered by Blows
 This is hardly the best time for the Whalers to be asking for a better deal on their lease with the city. For one thing, the city-owned Civic Center most likely will wind up losing money during the current fiscal year, which ends June 30, for the first time since 1981. And for another, the city administration is confronted with serious budgetary problems. But faced with the prospect of losing the Whalers -- which would be the latest in a series of blows to Hartford's economy and image -- the city is expected to approve a lease that would be more beneficial to the team.
"Everything, including parking and concession revenues, is under review," said Rick Hornung, the executive assistant to Mayor Carrie Saxon Perry. "We have offered various combinations to Richard Gordon, but they have not been acceptable. But we are confident we can work out a deal."
Mr. Hornung said that the Whalers owed $1.5 million in back rent and that Mr. Gordon had asked for free rent under a new lease. At present, he said, the team's annual rent is $1.1 million.
He also conceded it was possible that a study commissioned by the state earlier this year might recommend that the state take over control of the Civic Center. "It's quite possible that the city might go along with such a suggestion," Mr. Hornung said.
 
Opposition to Name Change
 While the city of Hartford seems amenable to giving the Whalers a better deal on a lease, there apparently is strong opposition to a name change, at least in the Hartford area. A recent poll by The Hartford Courant showed that, by a margin of about 6 to 1, respondents favored retaining the Hartford designation.
"Just as Boston belongs to the name Boston Celtics, Hartford belongs to the name Hartford Whalers," Mayor Perry said. "The Celtics are not known as the Massachusetts Celtics, nor should the Whalers be known as the Connecticut Whalers." Mrs. Perry did not note that the National Football League team that plays in Foxboro, Mass., is known as the New England Patriots.
Mr. Hornung said that since Mr. Gordon proposed the name change recently, the Mayor's office has been inundated with calls of protest. "We've lost The Hartford Times, the Hartford National Bank and G. Fox, which is synonymous with Hartford," Mr. Hornung said. "We don't want to lose the name Hartford Whalers, too."
Despite persistent rumors in recent months that the Whalers are destined to leave he state, Mr. Gordon has never threatened to sell the team. But when asked if he were willing to continue losing millions of dollars each year, as he says he has been doing, he said: "No, I'm not. Who would?"
When the Whalers arrived in Hartford in 1975, they found themselves in a city with no hockey tradition, unlike New Haven which has had professional hockey for most of the last 57 years, although it is about to lose its minor league hockey franchise. But the Whalers have hardly helped establish a tradition: The team has won only one divisional title since joining the N.H.L. in 1979 and, over all, has enjoyed only three winning seasons during its 13 years in the N.H.L.
 
Sounds of Silence
 Not only are crowds at the Civic Center relatively small they are also unusually quiet as hockey crowds go, a factor that has drawn criticism from some players over the years, who have suggested that they would welcome more vocal support. Indeed, Mr. Francis, the vice president for marketing and sales, said that when the Boston Bruins, who are the Whalers' main rival, play at the Civic Center, about 5,000 of their fans are on hand to cheer them on. "Bruin fans make up about a third of the crowd, but at times, from the noise they make, you'd think they had more fans in the house than we did," Mr. Francis said.
Attendance at Whaler games has declined steadily since peaking at an average of 14,616 during the 1987-88 season, when the team won the Adams Division title but was then eliminated early in the Stanley Cup playoffs. As recently as the 1990-91 season, the Whalers averaged 12,621 fans. But last season, when at one stretch the team went 14 games without a victory, the Whalers averaged only 10,659. Ironically, they drew even fewer spectators during their playoff series against the Montreal Canadiens, usually a big hockey attraction even in Hartford. At one game against Montreal, only 5,602 people attended, while another playoff game drew fewer than 8,000 spectators.
With five home dates left on the regular-season schedule this season, the Whalers' attendance is bound to be the lowest since the team joined the N.H.L. in 1979. Season ticket sales have been declining every year, to a low of about 7,000 this season. "We've been losing between 1,000 and 2,000 season tickets a year," Mr. Francis said. "But we're only down by 500 this season."
 
Promotion Incentives
 The club has tried a variety of promotional devices in an effort to attract more fans. For instance, the Whalers offered blocks of $27 tickets to a number of Hartford area corporations for $13 and made the same top-price tickets available to season-ticket holders for $10. During the Christmas holidays, the club again offered tickets to college and high school students at half price. In addition, the Whalers have discounted tickets at varying times for veterans and union members. But attendance still has not picked up.
Leases for the plush sky boxes have also continued to decline. This season, for instance, only 31 of the sky boxes -- which range in price from $60,000 to $80,000, depending on the length of the lease -- have been leased.
"We've got to reach out and get more fans from throughout Connecticut, particularly downstate," Mr. Gordon said. "Hartford is not as far away as many people downstate think it is. And even though most of them read New York papers, they're from Connecticut, and I just hope they'll realize that we're Connecticut's hockey team."

HEADLINE: Streetscapes: The Eltinge/Empire Theater;
A Film Restores a Bit of 42d Street -- in Faux Decay

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY

 BODY:
ONLY Arnold Schwarzenegger could have done it. The hopeful have been waiting two, ten, even fifty years for the restoration of 42d Street theaters, without result.
But the star's new movie, "The Last Action Hero," has muscled the cheap plastic and crummy signs off the 1912 Empire Theater, at 236 West 42d Street. 
 Now the worn red granite base course, the aged, rusticated limestone, the elaborate weathered bronze doors and ticket booth have reappeared.
One little problem: It's all fake, and with a slight tap the "stone" rings out hollow. But this masterful display of the art director's skills is as close as anyone has yet come to bringing the theaters back.
The Empire was built by the producer Al Woods as the Eltinge Theater, named after Woods's money-making star Julian Eltinge. By Eltinge's own account, he played a woman in a Harvard production and soon left school for a career as a female impersonator. He was successful enough to perform at Windsor Castle for King Edward VII, who gave him a white bulldog.
In 1911 Woods staged "The Fascinating Widow," written specifically for Eltinge, at the Liberty Theater. It ran four years and made them both rich. The next year he built a theater just west of the Liberty.
It is not clear if Eltinge ever actually played there, but his name lent it luster: in 1912 he was earning $1,625 a week, more than President William Howard Taft's $1,442. He also developed his own magazine (with articles on how he applies makeup and why women should take up "the gentle art of boxing") and his own line of cold cream, whose buyers got a free photograph of him.
The building, designed by the theater specialist Thomas Lamb, has a giant square terra cotta facade with a great central bay, all covered with the customary garlands, cartouches and other details, some in polychrome. Compared to other theaters at the time, it marked a new level of composed, urban grandeur.
According to "Lost Broadway Theaters," by Nicholas Van Hoogstraten (Princeton Architectural Press, 1991), later stage productions at the Eltinge starred such actors as Laurence Olivier and Clark Gable. They were superseded in 1931 by burlesque and then movies.
Eltinge died in 1941 and in 1954 the theater was renamed the Empire. By then the theaters on 42d Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues had been in decline for several decades and there was wishful thinking of somehow returning them to their original cultured vitality.
In the 1960's a series of proposals called for widespread demolition on 42d Street. Nothing came of them.
In 1981 the New York State Urban Development Corporation announced a plan that called for preserving the theaters, but the project has been repeatedly delayed. In 1990 the Durst Organization announced the impending restoration of the Empire and others it then owned. That, too, did not happen, and eight darkened theaters on that block of 42d Street have continued their slide into decay.
But a month ago Columbia Pictures used 42d Street as a set for "The Last Action Hero." On most buildings the changes were minor -- marquees were relit, storefronts cleaned up -- and meant to produce the colorful, if tawdry, 42d Street of a few years ago, before the closings, says John Wright Stevens, the production's New York art director.
It is on the Empire that the changes are enough to reward a visit by the architectural pilgrim. Stevens and Eugenio Zanetti, the production designer for the film, could not salvage the original ground floor, which had been too mutilated, but spent about $80,000 to erect a new facade over it. It looks like solid stone and bronze but -- thonk! thonk! -- it is Hollywood hollow. The deception is so good it will leave anyone who thinks himself an expert agape with shock pleasure.
THE "granite" (made of stucco over plywood) is stained and has been made to look as though it is flaking off from a trash fire. The "limestone" (stucco on plywood) has been made to look cracked and chipped. The "bronze" (fiberglass) ticket booth and figured doors have convincing green corrosion stains.
The whole assemblage has just the right covering of studio-supplied dirt to make it fit in a legitimately dirty 42d Street; it looks a lot more real than the results of many big- budget restoration projects.
Stevens's constructions are being left in place indefinitely and he hopes they will "call attention to these theaters, to have them be recognized for what they were, and saved."
But hurry: The fiberglass is starting to peel, the plywood to swell, and a steady rain of snow-melt comes through the Empire's roof.

Victorian Rehabs for Bridgeport's Needy

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
A HANDFUL of young Bridgeport developers are using a rarely employed Federal tax credit to help finance the rehabilitation of middle-class Victorian homes in the inner city. The resulting units are rented to subsidized low-income tenants.
The credit applies only to properties in historic districts. The work must be done according to specifications of the National Register of Historic Places, consisting largely of restoring the exteriors to their original condition. The owners get a credit of 20 percent of the cost of renovation on their Federal taxes if they do not live in the house themselves. They may, however, live in one unit of a two-family or multifamily building and still receive a reduced credit. 
 "During the early 1980's there were major historic rehabilitation projects throughout the state using the credit," said Linda Spencer, historian at the Connecticut Historical Commission in Hartford.
Developers had a strong incentive to restore the properties because real estate was booming and the credit was 25 percent. On Washington Street in South Norwalk, for example, dilapidated commercial buildings were redeveloped as condominiums, restaurants and boutiques by the Collins Development Corporation of Stamford.
"After the 1986 tax reform the program took a nose dive," said Ms. Spencer. "The credit was reduced and it was no longer available to property owners who made more than $150,000, cutting out important developers."
As the recession deepened, historic preservation dropped to a low priority and in Bridgeport "almost nothing happened between 1986 and 1991," said Charles Brilvitch, the city's Environmental Review Officer. "Until the late 80's every time a house sold it went for a higher price, until the last owner, unable to sell or rent profitably, abandoned it," he said.
He has been acting as adviser to developers who wish to apply for the credit, including Jonathan Rogers, 33, and Paul Edison, 30, former commercial brokers at Coldwell Banker in Manhattan.
"Four years ago we decided to look for rehabs," said Mr. Rogers. "Nothing else in the market was being done because of the economy, and we both had an interest in historic preservation." He had studied the subject while a student at the University of Vermont, and having grown up in Fairfield County he was familiar with Bridgeport and its depressed historic real estate.
They formed McDillon Inc., a contraction of their middle names, and to date they have rehabilitated 13 2- to 5-family homes in some of Bridgeport's worst and most crime ridden, albeit Historic District, neighborhoods. "We plan to continue for another 25 years," said Mr. Edison.
SAM PIERPONT, another 30-year-old developer, has done the same thing with 23 buildings in six years. "I'm living in a boarding house myself," he said, "but I love what I'm doing and I feel like I'm doing some good. In ten years if prices go up I can make money on sales and higher rents."
The three men have acquired a reputation locally and with the state's preservationists as quality developers who are meeting a need for low-income housing. "They are taking the same risks as any developer," said Laura Clark, director of the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation. "We can only encourage them, because our studies show that rehabs in inner cities reverberate and upgrade whole areas."
"We lend actively to the McDillon company," said Barry Rosa, a vice president in the residential mortgage division of People's Bank in Bridgeport. "Some of the housing where they work in the west and south ends is phenomenal-- five or six fireplaces with marble inlays, ceilings with plaster scrollwork that cannot be duplicated today. We support their effort to create affordable housing and we have always taken the position that rehabilitation is a sensible way to do it."
With one of the state's highest tax rates, at $67 per $1,000 assessment, the city has 5 local Historic Districts and 23 National Register Districts with 2,750 homes, hundreds of which are neglected and/or vacant.
In an effort to assist in the redevelopment of historic houses the city exempts them from the first year of taxes at the higher assessment resulting from rehabilitation. In addition, the new tax rate is phased in at 10 percent a year over a 10-year period.
The city also finances streetscaping on blocks where redevelopment is taking place. "Attractive housing is strategically important to new businesses coming into Bridgeport," said Michael Freimuth, Director of Planning and Economic Development.
The McDillon company recently completed a 2-family project at a 100-year-old home on Cottage Street. The block of houses was designed by the Palliser architectural firm of London, imported to Bridgeport by P.T. Barnum, the circus impresario and one-time Bridgeport mayor.
Dana Carter and her five children moved into one unit earlier this month. It has five bedrooms, a large kitchen, a living room and dining room separated by sliding pocket doors, a front and back yard. It rents for $900.
THE property, on a 50- by 100-foot lot, was purchased in foreclosure in 1992 "with $45,000 of our own money," Mr. Edison said. It had been sold for $120,000 in 1989. To finance the restoration McDillon received $28,000 from Neighborhood Housing Services, a local nonprofit agency, $84,600 from People's Bank, and $8,500 from a Community Block Grant. Taxes are currently $1,864 on an assessment of $27,496.
In sharp contrast is the story of Lydia and Dan Klyver, husband-and-wife developers from Southport who had the same idea but on a different and ultimately disastrous scale. Early in 1988 they paid $708,000 for a rundown, 24 room Victorian mansion on Park Avenue, a depressed Bridgeport neighborhood.
They spent an additional $400,000 converting it to six handsome condominiums that they were unable to sell after reducing the price from $142,000 to $100,000. "We rented all the units for $1,000 a month and still couldn't break even," said Mr. Klyver. Only half the units are rented at $700 a month and the Klyvers cannot meet mortgage payments.
"They should have known Park Avenue is not a $1,000 market," said Richard Ruggio, the city's Tax Assessment Engineer. And Mr. Rosa said, "One reason the bank supports the McDillon company is that their understanding of the relationship of cash flow to financing makes sense."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Design/Build;
Pros and Cons of an Under-One-Roof Architects Firm

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
DESIGN/BUILD. It's jargon for a one-stop-shopping approach to architectural services, one in which the same firm designs an office and then builds it.
The list of pros is long. When the architect and construction contractor work for the same firm, they can ram a project through in record time, ordering parts and furniture literally as fast as the designs come off the drawing board. Neither can waffle out of responsibility for a problem by blaming the other. And a designer and builder working together from the first are more likely to devise a realistic budget. 
 But the list of cons is even longer.The temptation to inflate construction budgets can be great without a bidding process. In-process overruns can run rampant without an independent architect riding herd on the project. There's no extra set of eyes to alert the client to design glitches. And more experienced builders never get a crack at the job.
Rocky Meli and John Borrelli, who formed Meli Borrelli Associates in 1991 as the city's first firm to operate solely on the design/build premise, concede that both lists look formidable. But as quickly as clients raise their questions, they tick off their answers.
Worried about cost overruns? They'll guarantee to bring the job in within budget, even if they have to absorb the added costs.
Anxious about inflation in the budget? Sure, the guaranteed maximum price is based on a worst-case scenario, but they work on a flat fee, not percentage of cost, so they say they have no incentive to ratchet the budget up.
And then they offer their coup de grace: Because the contractor and engineer are part of the original bidding process, they are basing their cost estimates on the actual job, not on an architect's best-guess based on similar jobs in the past.
"We can quantify what the tenant will need down to the last nail," said Mr. Meli, the team's construction expert. "We don't present drawings without numbers."
In a sense, the guarantees are a bit gimmicky. Meli Borrelli does post bonds, get letters of credit and provide other financial sureties. But construction mistakes or scheduling problems can run costs up by many millions of dollars, an amount that a tiny architectural firm run by a 34-year-old (Rocky) and a 37-year-old (John) would probably not have access to. A design/build firm has the same opportunity to make kickback arrangements with vendors as does any independent contractor. And clients do sometimes change their mind in mid-stream.
Moreover, Meli Borrelli doesn't come cheap. Where competition has driven architectural fees down to well below $3 a foot, Meli Borrelli usually charges $3.50.
Nonetheless, enough clients have gotten past any angst about high up-front costs and youngish architects to catapult Meli Borrelli to about 80 employees and $140 million in billings in less than two years.
"We operate with tight move-in deadlines, and design/build seemed the only way to meet them," said Tom A. Denis, a member of senior management at Credit Suisse, one of Meli Borrelli's first clients, for which the then-fledgling firm built 106,000 feet of office space at 12 East 49th Street.
Even traditional architects acknowledge design/build's speed.
"If you really need to be building things as they come off the drawing board, then design/ build makes sense," said Matthew Cusumano, a partner in SCR Design Organization, Manhattan architects.
At least one old-line architect has hitched his future to the concept. Last month, Sidney P. Gilbert sold SPGA Group, his 26-year old, 22-person architectural firm to Meli Borrelli.
"I have no question that design/build is the future of this industry," Mr. Gilbert said.
He may be right. With so little building going on, competition among architects for interior design jobs has grown fierce and any firm that offers a guarantee on price and scheduling has an edge.
This is particularly true these days because the staff-paring that has been endemic to most American corporations over the last decade has all but wiped out many corporate facilities departments. The few corporate real estate people who got to keep their jobs generally saw their responsibilities increased, leaving them little time to oversee design projects. With that kind of pressure, it helps when meetings with the architect do double duty as meetings with the builder.
"Having one point of contact is really worth a lot," said Mr. Denis of Credit Suisse.
SO is having a tutored engineering eye looking at designs, added Roger P. Smock, senior vice president of the National Bank 0f Canada, for which Meli Borrelli built two floors at 125 West 55th Street.
He notes how the wiring and setups for microwave transmission were designed in from the start. He points to the raised floor, covered by carpet squares that can be readily taken up, which let the bank hide the extensive computer wiring it uses yet easily reach it when it had to tinker with its systems.
"They even knew how many file cabinets we would need and where they should go," Mr. Smock said. And they brought the project in on time and at the agreed-on budget of $3.65 million.
Actually, neither Mr. Meli nor Mr. Borrelli were unknown quantities to Mr. Smock or Mr. Denis. They, with several other of the firm's clients, had worked with both men when they were employed by Karco-Davis, another New York interior design firm. In fact, several clients moved ongoing projects from Karco-Davis to the new company.
But others, including Alitalia and Burlington, are recent converts. And many tenant representatives are starting to recommend Meli Borrelli to their own clients.
"They give budgets that go to 30 pages, down to the ashtrays, and they give them quickly," said Maurice Solomon, vice chairman of Julien J. Studley.
Those detailed, concrete budgets are the real key to the design/build process. Like most design firms, Meli Borrelli starts a project by cataloging how many employees a client has, what type of office each needs and what sort of equipment, down to the last fax or copy machine, is needed.
At that point, the design/build process veers off on its own.
Meli Borrelli has copious computer programs that match vendor price lists, construction data and floor space requirements with the client's needs. For fees that range from $1,000 to $15,000, it will provide the tenant with data about exactly how much wall space, how many electrical outlets, how much mill work, what sort of cooling or electrical capacity is needed, and the like.
"That way, they don't waste time with inappropriate buildings," Mr. Borrelli said.
ONCE the client has a short list of buildings, a Meli Borrelli team -- an engineer, architect and construction expert -- checks each out and creates a separate budget for building acceptable space in each. It also flags potential glitches (for example, the floor plate in Building X would not allow for enough windowed offices).
The firm has built up formidable laurels, but none it can rest easily on yet. Even its staunchest client fans say they would continue to put future projects out to bid rather than just hand them to Meli Borrelli.
"Their track record says they bring projects in on budget and on time and my gut says they are trustworthy," said Lane Grijns, general manager of NMB Postbank Groep, for which Meli Borrelli designed and built more than 90,000 feet of office space at 135 East 57th Street. "But with these kinds of major expenditures I would start the process from scratch again anyway."
That isn't necessarily bad news for Meli Borrelli, though. Credit Suisse, too, has continued to put new projects out for bid. On one, 150,000 square feet of office space at One Liberty Plaza, it chose Janco Rasic Associates as the architects because they had more experience designing the particular "look" Credit Suisse wanted there. But, it hired Meli Borrelli as construction manager.
"We negotiated a guaranteed price with them, and they're responsible for bringing the project in on budget and on time," said Mr. Denis, who expects the project to be done in a few weeks. "In other words, I hired them to protect me."

Election Battle Rages Over School Superintendent's Changes

BYLINE: By STEVEN HART

DATELINE: PISCATAWAY

 BODY:
NEXT month, voters all over the state will head for the polls to pass judgment on school budgets and cast ballots for board of education candidates. But in Piscataway, the vote will go beyond these standard issues to include what amounts to an unofficial referendum on one man -- the Superintendent of Schools, Dr. Philip Geiger -- and the changes he has brought about in this district of about 5,800 students.
With a total of nine candidates, only two of them incumbents, vying for four board seats -- an unusually high number, caused by the retirement of one member and the resignation of another -- both the pro- and anti-Geiger factions expect the campaign to be active and nasty. 
 "I don't think it's anything that is not known," said Eloise Samuels, who along with a fellow incumbent, Theodore Kornegay, expects determined opposition. "The teachers are running their slate, and it's obvious it's against Phil."
Marge Matthews, a township resident whose job as a school bus driver was affected when the board voted in January to assign transportation duties to a private company, said, "We will be going full force ahead to get rid of the board members who voted with Geiger."
It was the privatization of bus routes -- previously run by the district, with a third of the routes handled by the Barker Bus Company of Somerset County -- that galvanized the community, pitting bus drivers and their supporters, all residents, against a board itself composed of residents.
 
Parents' Choice Allowed
 Among the other changes wrought by Dr. Geiger are a new policy allowing parents to choose which elementary schools their children will attend and a "reading recovery" program offering one-on-one instruction to first graders in the lowest 20 percent of reading ability.
And he has undertaken an ambitious program to install 530 Apple Macintosh computers in each of the district's elementary school classrooms. By placing four computers in each classroom and giving the teacher a larger monitor, Dr. Geiger said, the district will be drawing on customized software and programs provided by the Educational Management Group of Phoenix, which has a six-year agreement costing Piscataway about $2.2 million.
Arriving in Piscataway two years ago, Dr. Geiger brought with him a master's degree from the Wharton School of Finance, a doctorate in education from Columbia University and a briefcase full of ideas like zero-based budgeting -- starting from scratch each year, making each program prove its worth all over again -- that were guaranteed to shake things up.
Citing research that makes the elementary school years most crucial to learning, Dr. Geiger talks of a nongraded approach that would blur the lines between grades. Rather than the current march from one grade level to the next, he wants to see an individualized approach reflecting each child's rate of intellectual growth.
He would even like to see the current grading system reduced to three marks: A, B and I for incomplete.
"When kids get C's, D's and F's, you give kids the privilege of failing," Dr. Geiger said. "You say he's fallen behind, but somehow he's going to magically make up for it next year. Our job is to educate kids, not sort them."
Ideas like those were why, according to the board members who voted on his appointment, Dr. Geiger was chosen to succeed a 12-year Superintendent, Dr. Burt Edelchick, who had come up from the ranks of Piscataway teachers.
Paula Van Riper, the current school board president, said: "The school district had been plodding along, sometimes doing things reactively rather than looking ahead. We knew full well, even during the discussions before hiring him, that there would be a lot of controversy and staff upheaval."
Dr. Geiger's record in that regard was clear. As Superintendent of Schools in Galloway, from 1978 to 1984, he drove his teaching staff hard and stirred animosity by privatizing school custodial services, a move the township has since rescinded. In Lexington, Mass., where he served as Superintendent of Schools before coming to Piscataway, he privatized school food services but gradually lost his supporters on the school committee.
Still, the Piscataway board could hardly have anticipated the uproar caused by Dr. Geiger's drive to privatize support services, a move meant to free up money for new programs by relieving the district of the tab for benefits and salaries awarded in kinder economic times.
A 1991 decision to turn school cafeteria services over to Service America Inc., a Pennsylvania-based company, saved the district about $480,000 this year while increasing student participation to 75 percent from 45 percent of the total student population, said the district's business administrator, Guy Vander Vliet.
The decision affected 55 part-time lunchroom workers, all of whom had been getting $8 to $15 an hour along with $8,000 in health benefits. The board required Service America to give them first pick of jobs, and Mr. Vander Vliet said about half of the old staff chose to stay on at lower salaries and reduced benefits.
The same provision was written into the transportation contract, which was awarded this year to Ryder Pupil Transportation Services, a division of the nationwide Ryder truck rental chain. The company will take over all routes in April, after students return from spring vacation.
Ryder also bought up the district's fleet of 70 buses and smaller vehicles for about $1.3 million, in addition to which the district will save about $1.5 million in operating costs along with salaries and budgets for 65 part-time drivers, Mr. Vander Vliet said.
 
Tumultuous Series of Hearings
 But the bus drivers, unlike the cafeteria workers, were represented by the Piscataway Township Education Association, which brought the community out in force to oppose privatization.
During a tumultuous series of hearings leading up to the privatization decision, signs warning "We'll remember you in April" were a common sight, Mrs. Van Riper said. There were also plenty of personal attacks, she added, on board members in general and Dr. Geiger in particular.
"It got pretty dirty," Mrs. Van Riper said. "Bus drivers would send letters home with children saying this and that will happen if you get an outside company driving your kids."
Dominic Ciardi, a board member who was elected on an anti-Geiger platform, said, "He's been accused of everything anybody can think of." Mr. Ciardi now calls himself one of Dr. Geiger's "greatest supporters."
Despite the controversy, Mrs. Van Riper said that "when the dust settles, even those bus drivers will understand." But Mrs. Matthews, who worked for 30 years as a bus driver, disagreed.
"No, I don't think the bus drivers will ever understand," she said Though she now says she is "very, very impressed" with Ryder, her bitterness toward Dr. Geiger and the school board remains.
"It will never, ever go back to the way it was," Mrs. Matthews said. "We had a rapport with the kids and the parents in town that was second to none. There are still parents in town I won't talk to because they didn't come out to support us."
Michele Martin, president of the 750-member Piscataway Township Education Association, called privatization "a short-term Band-Aid solution, and we're trying to educate the public about this."
As head of the association, Ms. Martin represents teachers, classroom aides, custodians and other employees.
"Where will the privatization end?" Ms. Martin said, noting that there is talk of privatizing custodial services. "The board could decide to privatize every one of the units, whether speech therapists or nurses."
Some of Dr. Geiger's harshest critics acknowledge the value of many of his ideas, but like Ms. Martin they question the speed of the changes. Ms. Martin advocated going slow and, in the case of policy changes like privatization, putting questions to the public in a referendum.
Opposition to Dr. Geiger and board incumbents is expected to come from Piscataway Residents for Excellence in Education, a citizens' group widely viewed as linked with the education association, which does not officially endorse candidates.
 
Dislike of Board's 'Attitude'
 Certainly there is no shortage of anti-Geiger sentiment in this year's field of board contenders.
"I'm not in Geiger's camp," said Frank Cicerale, a self-employed accountant. "There are a lot of things I don't like. I didn't like the attitude of the board -- I don't think they are listening to the people. I'm not happy."
Ed Eodice, who is an executive with Mack Trucks Inc. of Allentown, Pa., was finishing his second board term when Dr. Geiger was coming aboard. Voted out in 1991, Mr. Eodice is now making opposition to privatization one of the themes of his comeback campaign.
"With privatization, I think you lose control," Mr. Eodice said. "We had a good system, good, loyal and dedicated people driving the buses."
And if Mr. Eodice gets on the board this year, will he vote to renew Dr. Geiger's contract?
"I really don't know right now," he said.

ON YOUR MARK
For the 24th year the combination Scarsdale 15K and 4-Mile Runs and the Abe Simon Memorial 15K Run will step off today at 1:30 P.M. from Scarsdale High School on Wayside Lane, weaving through Greenacres and Fox Meadow back to the school parking lot. 
 Participants in the Scarsdale runs are encouraged to cover the distance by walking, if that is their preference. All walkers will receive ribbons. Runners in seven age categories, varying from 14 and under to 60 and older, male and female, will receive trophies for first place and medals for second and third place in all races.
Runners in the memorial portion, named for Mr. Simon, an avid runner and founder of an older persons' running club, will follow the same 15-kilometer course, but they must enter in teams of five men whose minimum age is 50 and three women whose minimum age is 40.
Registration will take place at the high school from 10:30 A.M. to race time. The fee of $15, ($8 for young people through grade 12) covers the cost of refreshments. About 400 runners are expected. Each runner will receive a free T-shirt, and awards will be presented at the finish. Running times vary from last year's winning 15 minutes, 48 seconds to about an hour.
In case of bad weather, a cancellation announcement will be made by the Scarsdale Police Department over WFAS Radio.
 
GARDENING PRIMER
 Barring another blizzard, it's time to get that green thumb working, and the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx will devote next weekend to giving beginning gardeners some substantive inspiration.
From 11 A.M. to 4 P.M. Saturday and Sunday, novices can acquire information covering soil preparation, plant selection, tools and techniques. They will also have an opportunity to view the rewards of good gardening by touring the 16 professionally prepared specialty gardens on the grounds.
Vegetable gardens that are not only edible but attractive will be one of the topics, and a complete list, with costs, of the most appropriate tools, hats, gloves, shoes and sunscreens will be discussed, along with ways to avoid an aching back.
Soil experts will recommend the best ways to incorporate organic material for aeration and drainage, and how to cultivate a continuously blooming array of flowers suitable for cutting. Basic garden design, free- flowing or geometric, the uses of herbs, and how to make compost of the remains of dead plants are other subjects to be covered.
The advice is available with the regular admission of $3, $2 for people 65 and older and students. Admission to the Enid Haupt Conservatory spring floral exhibition, titled "Glories of a Manor Garden," is an additional $3, $2 for students and the elderly. The number to call for directions or more information is (718) 817-8700.
 
IN PRAISE OF PIPES
 A special recital celebrating the installation of a new rank of festival- trumpet organ pipes at the Union Church of Pocantico Hills is scheduled for 4 P.M. today. The church is at 555 Bedford Road in North Tarrytown.
Dr. Norman O. Smith, organist and music director, will be joined by Heidi and Randall Wolfgang, oboists, in a program of works by Bach, Brahms, Saint-Saens, Widor and others.
The organ is one of the finest in the county, and the church's stained-glass windows by Marc Chagall and Henri Matisse are renowned worldwide and at their best in the afternoon sun. Admission will be $5 at the door.For more information, the number to call is 631-2069.
 
THE BEEKEEPER'S ART
 Anyone whose property contains pussy willows, red maples, linden trees, locust trees, tulip trees, goldenrod, clover or alfalfa has a natural habitat for beekeeping, although bees may be raised without them.
Theo Cherbuliez, a math teacher at the Hackley School in Tarrytown and a beekeeper since her teens, will present a program on "Getting Started in Beekeeping" today at 2 P.M. at the Greenburgh Nature Center on Dromore Road off Central Avenue. It is geared for adults and older children.
Ms. Charbuliez says that beekeeping is becoming a popular backyard activity because the bees do most of the work and the honey can be an extra source of income.
She will demonstrate how to work with various types of equipment and show a film on the seasonal activities associated with beekeeping. And she will discuss the economics of producing honey for sale, remedies for bee stings and how to keep the hive's occupants from annoying the neighbors.
Subsequent training sessions may be arranged with the nature center's beekeeper free of charge. Admission to the program will be $3. The number to call for more information is 723-3470.
 
OF DOLLS AND DANCERS

The Westchester Theater of Dance will present two performances of "Coppelia" at 1 and 4 P.M. today at the Mid-Westchester Y.M.-Y.W.H.A. in Scarsdale. Set to the music of Delibes, the story concerns a doll maker, his doll, a young peasant girl and her beau. The production is designed for children of any age.
More than 20 dancers from the school's corps de ballet will perform along with soloists including Anna Weiss, Peter Nevin, Megan Carney and Christine Jackson. Featured in other works are three professional dancers. Mary Jane Houdina will perform an original jazz piece to music of Aretha Franklin; Ellen Kogan will dance in "Klezmerized" with a background of traditional Klezmer music, and there will be a number by Victoria Pasquale, a former Y student who is now a member of the American Ballet Theater.
Tickets are $10 at the door. The Y is at 999 Wilmot Road, and the phone number for more information is 472-3300.
 
RAGS AND 'RAGTIME'
 E. L. Doctorow, author of "Ragtime," will be honored at a benefit for Richard Kapp's Westchester-based Philharmonia Virtuosi on Thursday at 6:30 P.M. at the old Tappan Hill Restaurant, now called Abigail Kirsch at Tappan Hill in Tarrytown.
Dinner and a raffle will be included in the $175 ticket price, but the main attraction will be a reading by Mr. Doctorow from "Ragtime," the locale of which is New Rochelle in the 20's. The reading will be accompanied by a live performance of Scott Joplin rags by the orchestra.
Raffle tickets alone cost $10, or three for $25, and the principal prize is a trans-Atlantic trip on the Queen Elizabeth 2 with a return flight on American Airlines.
Mr. Doctorow's books have been translated into 25 languages, and he has received many awards including the National Book Critics Circle Award, the National Book Award and the Pen-Faulkner Award. The restaurant, a former summer home of Mark Twain overlooking the Hudson River, is at 81 Highland Avenue. The phone numbers for reservations, raffle tickets or more information are 359-4220 or 693-5595.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Betting That the Fix Is In In Japan

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
TO believers in free markets, the idea that a government can manipulate a huge stock market is abhorrent. But this year the Japanese Government seems to have succeeded in doing just that.
With Japanese stocks spurting, foreign money managers are being forced to decide whether the rally is real. More and more are deciding they had better get on board, lest a recovery in the Japanese economy begin without them. The bulls note that Japan's money supply grew last month, for the first time since August, and believe that the long bear market, in which the Nikkei 225 average fell 63 percent from its peak at the end of 1989, is finally over. 
 If so, it comes at a convenient time for many Japanese companies, particularly banks with extensive stock holdings. The Japanese fiscal year ends Wednesday, and stock values on that date will determine just how sick many balance sheets appear to be when financial reports are released.
The Government's efforts to push up stocks have included pouring in Government-controlled retirement money to increase demand while blocking new stock offerings. Westerners reacted with scorn when the moves were announced, but that was before they worked. Now, foreign investors appear to be buying heavily, although some remain skeptical.
"It's against the whole history of the world to think that governments can arrest stock market collapses after huge bubbles," said one of the doubters, Barton Biggs, the director of global strategy at Morgan Stanley. "I don't believe they will get away with it."
For international money managers, being out of Japan when prices are rising and the yen is strong is a virtual guarantee of poor performance. That has led to what Mr. Biggs calls "panic buying," which he thinks could push prices up until late April or May.
It may also have played a role in Morgan Stanley's official recommendation to its clients, which came last week from David Roche, the firm's global strategist. Noting signs the recession is ending, he suggested buying a long list of Japanese stocks. Someone at Morgan Stanley is wrong.
In some ways, the rally in Tokyo is reminiscent of the August 1982 lift-off in New York, when share prices soared months before the recession ended and when few saw signs that the economy might improve. Bull markets, as the old saw goes, are built on a wall of worries. There is no shortage of such worries. Still, buyers now are betting that government manipulation will keep working. It does not look like a safe bet.
Last week's column pointed to a pending bond issue from one of Donald Trump's casinos as a sign that the junk bond market is growing very speculative. Now we hear that the bond, which has little in the way of collateral and will not pay cash interest for eight years, might be priced at 12 percent or lower, rather than the 15 percent we had heard. If so, speculation is greater than we thought.

HEADLINE: Clinton Plan -- Small Businesses Smile

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
FROM the way he talks, President Clinton wants to be Johnny Appleseed for the nation's small businesses. Sow a few tax credits here, sprinkle on some new incentives there and, presto, within a few months small businesses will grow from coast to coast, producing a cornucopia of new jobs.
Some of the President's seeds have already sprouted, as some businesses have rushed to take advantage of the proposed incentives even before Congress approves many of the plan's details -- as is widely expected. After four years of lackluster growth, they are eager to move ahead, caught in the surge of confidence brought by the plan. 
 Thanks to a proposed tax break for capital gains in small companies, Stephanie Harkness, who runs a plastics factory in Santa Cruz, Calif., says she has found it far easier to attract the investors she needs to expand. In a rapid response to the planned investment tax credit, Jim Hambuchen is already shopping for a $20,000 ditch-digger for his electrical contracting company in Arkansas, and John Clark, who owns a pizza factory in Chicago, has his eye on an $80,000 packaging machine. He would also benefit from promised incentives for inner-city businesses.
Of course, no one who sows ever sees 100 percent of the seeds germinate, and Mr. Clinton is no exception. Many small businesses view his proposed tax increases as a chill wind that is pushing them to protect what they have rather than put their energies into expanding. For example, Eamonn McGeady, president of a marine construction company in Baltimore, says the proposed energy tax and higher income taxes will hurt his bottom line, discouraging him from hiring more people.
Like thousands of others across the country, these four executives are already responding to the plan. Sketches of them, their goals and their businesses follow.
Mr. Clinton expects great things from small business -- usually defined as companies with fewer than 500 employees -- and his package pays special attention to it. With the giants of industry laying off workers, he sees small business as the engine of job growth -- and probably his best hope for achieving his goal of creating eight million jobs in four years. Indeed, small business employs 60 percent of the nation's 99 million private-sector workers.
 
The Goal: New Jobs
 "Small businesses have created virtually all of the new jobs in our country in the last 10 years," Mr. Clinton told the nation's mayors this month. "Their inability to create more jobs than larger employers have been shedding is the central cause of stagnant employment in America."
Not surprisingly, his economic package has a raft of provisions targeted at small businesses. For companies with sales of less than $5 million, the Clinton plan proposes a permanent investment tax credit at 7 percent for the first two years and 5 percent in subsequent years. For companies with less than $50 million in capital, it proposes halving capital-gains taxes on investments in those firms that are held for five years or more. As part of his plan to create "enterprise zones" -- hard-pressed areas where tax breaks are offered to encourage investment -- Mr. Clinton offers numerous employment and investment incentives for small businesses in the inner city.
Political handicappers say these provisions stand a good chance of sailing through Congress because they are not very expensive and have a huge constituency. Between 1981 and 1992, the number of small businesses rocketed to 21 million from 13 million. The proposals make conservatives smile because they touch all the right buttons: encouraging entrepreneurship, easing regulations and cutting capital-gains taxes. And they please liberals because they have a populist flavor and will help the folks on Main Street.
But whether the plan will be as big a success economically as politically is open to question. Owners of two dozen small businesses predicted in interviews that the plan would benefit them somewhat, but they did not expect it to produce the explosion of jobs the President envisions.
Their biggest hope is not even pinned to the plan's specifics. Rather, they are counting on the President's overall plan to increase business and consumer confidence and keep interest rates low, which would give the economy -- and small business -- a powerful boost.
"If we get the deficit cuts the President has called for, and if he shows some real leadership, the plan will have a bigger effect for us and for the economy than the dollars that would flow to us directly from the plan," said Frank Clayton, who runs an electrical supply company with eight employees in suburban Cleveland.
With small business as diverse as all America, the proposals would benefit some enterprises far more than others. The investment tax credit would give manufacturers a lot to cheer about, while many service-sector firms would watch the parade pass them by. Start-up businesses looking for investors to help them expand would no doubt benefit more than older concerns because of the cut in capital-gains taxes.
Inner-city businesses, in particular, would gain from proposals to set up enterprise zones, while rural firms might be hurt disproportionately by the proposed broad-based energy tax. And the increase in corporate and personal income taxes would slap the most successful entrepreneurs.
"We appreciate some of the things the President has held out for small business," said Jack Faris, president of the National Federation of Independent Business, which has 600,000 businesses as members. "But the basic problem is the plan takes more tax money and gives it to the Government. Higher taxes mean higher prices for products and less money in consumers' pockets, and that doesn't bode well for small business."
If President Clinton's overall package does run into turbulent waters, some of the small-business incentives may sink or be altered. Last week the Administration, responding to pressure from Silicon Valley firms, agreed to raise the ceiling on companies covered by the capital-gains tax break to $50 million in total capital from $25 million, but many companies want the ceiling raised even higher. And many lawmakers are hoping to tinker with the size of the investment tax credit.
Two developments that were not part of the President's economic package will heavily affect small business. Many welcomed the proposals the Administration introduced March 10 to ease the credit crunch by reducing the paperwork needed to make a loan, easing requirements on property appraisals and making it easier to make character loans. But many small businesses are frightened that President Clinton's health-care proposals will hit them hard, requiring them to provide medical coverage for employees or pay higher taxes to help finance the changes.
In many ways small business's feelings on health reform parallel its views on the economic package. "While we are uncomfortable with paying more taxes, it's fair to say that on the whole, we're willing to pay our fair share if the plan is fair," said John Galles, executive vice president of National Small Business United, with 65,000 members.
Despite some gripes with the Clinton plan, it has made small-business men and women stand a bit taller because it puts so much faith in them.
"We're most enthused that this President has come out of the chute saying, 'Small business is the way out of the economic throes of this country, and I'm going to do everything possible to alleviate the burden on small business,' " said Bennie Thayer, chairman of the National Association of the Self-Employed, which has 320,000 members. "We call him the Small Business President."
 
Stephanie Harkness
Perfect Timing For an Investment
 Stephanie Harkness, a former high school principal, sounds almost surprised that her molded-plastics business has done so well since she set it up four years ago in Santa Cruz, south of San Francisco.
She was convinced that her knack with people and her husband's technical expertise would make her dream work. Today, Pacific Plastics and Engineering has a spic-and-span factory, 26 employees and more than $2 million in annual sales, mostly of disposable medical devices and plastic parts used in electronic equipment.
For Ms. Harkness, President Clinton's economic plan could not have arrived at a better time -- the proposed tax breaks on capital gains have already made it far easier for her to pursue her plans to buy a neighboring company.
"The capital-gains plan makes it more attractive for our angels," she said, from a second-story office above her sprawling factory floor.
Ms. Harkness has her sight on a company that makes golf-course yardage markers. Pacific Plastics is already under contract to make many of the markers, and she predicts that it can rack up $14 million in profits in the next few years if she can sell the markers to 10 percent of the nation's golf courses.
"If we buy that firm, we would be able to expand, and we'd have to hire at least 10 or 15 more people," said Ms. Harkness, a 49-year-old native Californian. She had been concerned about finding the $1 million needed for the acquisition. Now, thanks to Mr. Clinton's plan, far more investors than she expected are knocking on her door.
"It's very attractive for them," she said. "They invest $100,000 to $300,000, hold their investment for five years, and not only do they share in the profits during that time, but they will be able to write off half their gains when they sell it," she said.
Ms. Harkness is also excited about another aspect of Mr. Clinton's plan: the proposed investment tax credit. She says it will encourage her company to buy four $100,000 injection molding machines over the next two years; she had planned to buy three.
She has one big complaint with the President's plan: the energy tax, which could raise her $60,000 annual energy bill by 5 to 10 percent. "It's not going to make it easier for us to compete globally," she said. Her company exports 10 percent of its production. "We run our equipment 24 hours a day, seven days a week."
Not one to rein in her enthusiasm, she clearly supports the President's plan, even though she voted for President Bush last November.
"I'm encouraged by the President's plan," she said. "The mood of the country has shifted, and as long as the plan is implemented, I think America will be a better place than it has been the last four years."
 
Eamonn McGeady
Hopes Scuttled By New Taxes
 With his tugboat captain's license and law school diploma hanging on the wall behind him and an excellent view of Baltimore's Curtis Bay before him, Eamonn McGeady, president of a marine construction company, would seem the picture of success. But his mood is less than buoyant.
Mr. McGeady, a 60-year-old Army veteran who voted for George Bush, sees President Clinton's economic plan as a big negative for small business. He angrily asserts that all the additional taxes will sabotage rather than spur entrepreneurship. In his view, the plan gives him little incentive to buy new tugboats or floating cranes or add to his work force of 58.
"On balance, a small business is going to have the Government's hand in its pocket to a greater extent than it does now," said Mr. McGeady, whose company builds and maintains piers, bulkheads, bridges and underwater pipelines and cables. "Most of us find that objectionable."
For him, the villain of the piece is not the rise in corporate income taxes to 36 percent from 34 percent, but the even bigger jump in personal income taxes on upper-income people. The President wants to raise the top tax rate for families with taxable income of more than $140,000 to 36 percent and put a surtax on incomes of more than $250,000, raising the effective tax rate to 39.6 percent.
Like many small businesses with a handful of owners, Mr. McGeady's company qualifies as an S corporation -- named for the subchapter of the Internal Revenue Code that authorizes it. That means its earnings flow directly to the owners and are subject to personal income taxes, not to corporate income taxes.
Mr. McGeady points out that some years his top effective tax rate would be raised -- to 36 percent from 31 percent. In a really profitable year, it might soar to 39.6 percent.
"If you're a small business with a taxable income at that level, that will be devastating," said Mr. McGeady, who succeeded his father at the company's helm 30 years ago. "It all seems like a very Machiavellian scheme to get the Government's hands on the economic engine of the nation, and that's small business."
With the economy picking up, he said, his company, Martin G. Imbach Inc., could soon surpass the boom year it had two years ago, when it earned $550,000 on $9.25 million in sales. These profits are divvied up among him and his two brothers -- the company's sole shareholders -- and represent the capital needed to buy new equipment.
The tax increases, he said, would more than offset the main incentive the Clinton plan offers him, the investment tax credit. He has repeatedly written to President Clinton, urging him to make more spending cuts instead of increasing taxes.
"Right now I need to hire four or five additional people," he said. "But at the moment I'm hesitating because I assume that employees in general will cost more as a result of all these things -- including the possibility of higher health care taxes." Still, he has one big hope from the program: that some of the increased infrastructure spending will come his way.
 
John Clark
Defying the Odds In the Inner City
 Running a factory in a South Chicago neighborhood where many people are afraid to walk at night is not for the faint of heart. Insurance costs are steep and finding well-trained workers is not easy. And energy costs in Chicago are higher than for many competitors in other parts of the country.
Defying the odds, John Clark, the 50-year-old president of Reggio's Pizza, has in 20 years built a successful business that produces more than one million frozen pizzas a year. Although he describes himself as a conservative, Mr. Clark backs President Clinton's plan not only because it offers many goodies for inner-city companies but also because he believes it will strengthen the economy and cut the budget deficit.
The President's plan includes special investment incentives and employment tax credits for companies in 50 enterprise zones. The as-yet unspecified areas would presumably include the South Side.
"It would definitely make it less costly to do business here," Mr. Clark said. "When you're a small-business person, you have to take advantage of all these things because they can make the difference whether you remain a viable business."
Among the inducements for inner-city companies are special accelerated depreciation measures, writing off in one year the first $75,000 of an investment, and a 25 percent tax credit on the first $15,000 in wages paid to workers who live in the enterprise zone. The goal is to cut double-digit unemployment in inner-city neighborhoods.
"If you have two people equally qualified, one with the tax credit and one without, you don't have to be a genius to figure out which one I'm going to hire," he said.
For Mr. Clark, who has 86 workers and high employee turnover, these measures could add more than $50,000 to his bottom line. Although many economic studies argue that enterprise zones do little to turn around urban areas, Mr. Clark is confident that the new incentives will help South Chicago businesses expand and hire new workers.
He feels a personal frustration over one aspect of the plan -- the investment tax credit. During the last two years, he made the biggest investment of his life, buying a 30-year-old Seven-Up factory and installing $1 million worth of equipment, including an automatic sauce and sausage depositor.
He curses his luck that the 7 percent tax credit was not in place for those investments. Nonetheless, he hopes to use it this year for an $80,000 packaging machine.
In contrast to many of his small-business colleagues, Mr. Clark hardly seems to mind that the Clinton plan includes several tax increases, because he is confident that the plan will give the economy a lift.
"When Reagan took office in 1980 the Federal debt was $1 trillion, and when Bush handed over the reins it was $4 trillion," he said. "That wasn't working, and we have to try something else.
"As long as I feel that the tax burden is distributed as fairly as possible, I don't have a real problem with paying it," he added. "I'm an American citizen, and the Government has to be strong."
 
The Hambuchens
Mom and Pop, Ready to Grow
 GiGi Hambuchen is finally starting to admit it: her eight-year-old I.B.M. 286 desktop computer is too slow to meet the demands of her cluttered lighting-fixture shop in Conway, Ark., 30 miles north of Little Rock.
Her husband, Jim, who runs an electrical contracting firm from a crowded office in the rear, has started to think it is time to replace his clumsy ditch-digging machine dating from 1974. If ever a small business was ripe for President Clinton's proposed investment tax credit, it could be the Hambuchens' mom-and-pop operation.
"I've been thinking of buying some new vans and some new equipment, so the credit will be very helpful to me," said Mr. Hambuchen, who does wiring for new homes and electrical repair work.
He has begun snooping around for a $20,000 ditch digger, as well as a $2,000 jackhammer, and Mrs. Hambuchen has become a lot more receptive to salesmen's pitches for more powerful computers.
The 7 percent credit proposed on equipment purchases might even persuade Mr. Hambuchen to add a seventh van to his fleet, which would enable him to add two workers to his force of 14. The business, founded by his father in 1946, already owns six vans, but he is embarrassed to admit his newest van is five years old.
"If we could get this economy going, and if we could get some of these tax benefits through, I think I'd really buy some new equipment," he said, almost amazed at hearing himself sound like a big spender.
The Hambuchens, who voted for Mr. Clinton last November, say that as Governor he worked hard to make businesses feel welcome in Arkansas. "Our business has been growing slowly but surely," said Mr. Hambuchen, who noted that a decade ago he had six employees. "Clinton has helped us along. He's helped the state; he's brought in a lot of new businesses."
The past few months, his business has been going like gangbusters, thanks to a boom in home-building resulting from the lower interest rates brought about, at least in part, by Mr. Clinton's deficit-cutting package. Mr. Hambuchen's easygoing manner and eagerness to chat up acquaintances certainly helped his efforts to win new business.
"I see things opening up," he said. "I think Clinton's going to get the economy running. But he's going to have to move pretty quick because people could run out of patience after what's happened the last few years."
He has one bone to pick with the President: the energy tax. "That will affect us very much," he said. "All these vans get only about 10 miles to the gallon."
But one thing he doesn't mind is raising taxes on the rich. "I'm not in the $180,000 bracket," he said.
Mr. Clinton's economic plan has been Topic A in the lighting-fixture shop recently. While there has been grumbling about tax increases, Mrs. Hambuchen said, the plan has received generally favorable reviews.
"Whether or not people voted for him," she said, "they say they are ready to do their part to get rid of the deficit so long as he really does something about getting it down."

I.B.M. Forsakes Techies for a Cookie King 

It was the biggest talent search ever in American business, made doubly difficult because some prime candidates took one look at the job and wanted none of it. I.B.M., a giant beyond imagination, had taken an unimaginably giant fall, and there's no telling when, or if, anyone can pick up all the pieces. Among the industry heavyweights who removed themselves from contention were John Sculley of Apple and George Fisher of Motorola. So in the end I.B.M. made what would seem an unlikely choice to succeed John F. Akers, a choice from far beyond the computer industry: Louis V. Gerstner Jr. of RJR Nabisco. True, he is one of America's most respected executives, and is said to be an extraordinarily quick study. But it's an awful long way from mastering cookies to mastering computers. And one of I.B.M.'s tasks is clear: it has not been able to keep up as the focus of technology shifted from multimillion-dollar mainframes to smaller machines. But then again, perhaps I.B.M. has plenty of technology lying around and what it needs is business savvy -- maybe such an unlikely choice could prove to be the right path. "What I.B.M. needs is a business architect, not a technology wizard," one industry expert said.
 
Baxter Had the Wrong Friends
 
It's hard enough to sort out enemies and friends in the Mideast. That goes double when you try to reach into that powderkeg and come up with a neat set of standards for American business. Are our friends' enemies our enemies? Can they be friends if they treat our friends as enemies? Get out the computer flow charts. The 1977 law that bars American companies from cooperating with the Arab boycott of Israel has been a nightmare to enforce. But maybe Baxter International went too far. Last week, in the stiffest punishment ever meted out under the law, Baxter agreed to pay a $500,000 fine and other penalties. Baxter admitted that it violated the law by providing Arab nations with details of its dealings with Israel.
 
POST SLAYS OWNER (Almost)
 
It happens so often: one day something deeply offends the public sensibility, the next it is the answer to every prayer. Rupert Murdoch, roundly blasted for the flamboyance he imposed on The New York Post, was forced to sell the paper five years ago because he also owned a local television station. But such niceties melted away in an instant last week when he stepped forward and, even though he lost $150 million the last time out, offered to buy the paper back. Gov. Mario Cuomo and others quickly sought to sidestep the cross-ownership rule. The reason was clear: The Post has turned into a sad, surreal circus -- with the editor, Pete Hamill, setting up shop in a diner and saying all his paychecks have bounced. But this gets tricky: From whom does Mr. Murdoch buy the paper? Abe Hirschfeld owns it, sort of, though his bizarre stunts may at last be over. The bankruptcy court owns it, sort of. In a truer sense, though, perhaps it's the city that owns it now.

A Marriage Made at Microsoft
 
All work and no play has made William Gates a rich man. (No, "rich man" doesn't do it: if he had forests, rivers and a flag, he'd be a rich country.) And so fabled is the killer business instinct of Microsoft's chairman that some software competitors have wished that Mr. Gates would get married, have children, soften up -- and then perhaps ease up on his rivals. Well, that theory will be put to a test. Mr. Gates, 37, plans to marry Melinda French, 28, a Microsoft executive.
 
Chrysler's Back: Look at Its Pay
 
Even with all the uproar over executive pay, when times are good companies often go all out to reward top managers. Chrysler came back from yet another brink last year, with its new models a hit and its stock selling for about four times what it was 18 months ago, and Lee Iacocca was not forgotten. His 1992 pay was four times what he got in 1991 -- $12.2 million in salary and other compensation. But he's retired now -- not that he wanted to let that chairman's title go -- so he'll have to get by as a $500,000-a-year Chrysler consultant. His successor, Robert Eaton, didn't do badly either: $7.4 million in total pay in 1992.
 
Merck to Clinton: What Profits?
 
In the pantheon of Clinton villains, drug prices rank high. A prime White House target is what it sees as drug makers' fat profits. Merck's answer: We're not doing that well, so ease up. Merck said last week that its profit growth was slowing, and drug stocks were punished. It was in large part a political message: Merck's chairman, P. Roy Vagelos, said the industry "certainly does not need price controls" -- and he dramatized the woes by saying he and his top executives would take a 10 percent pay cut.

Daimler Plays by U.S. Rules
 
Naturally, the New York Stock Exchange wants to list big foreign companies. Otherwise it risks losing its status as a financial hub. But when Daimler-Benz knocked, the S.E.C. jumped in, demanding certain disclosures. German companies, it seems, can set up secret reserves, stuffing cash into the mattress in fat years and pulling it out to prop up profits in lean ones. But the S.E.C. said that wouldn't do for a Big Board company: how would an investor know what was going on? The S.E.C. apparently won the day, for Daimler said last week that it expected to be listed -- and it is likely to provide most of the required information.
 
Beers Across the Border
 
As the beer industry goes global, everything is changing: taste, economics, trade laws. A few weeks ago Miller introduced something revolutionary, a beer with strong taste. And last week Anheuser-Busch paid nearly half a billion dollars for 18 percent of Grupo Modelo, the Mexican brewer that makes Corona and other brands -- the type of deal expected under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Where will it all lead? Will beefy football fans soon be bellying up for a pint of lukewarm Guinness? Or will "lite" beer take over the world?
 
Sony One-Note? No Way!
 
There's no disputing it: To get to the top, you've got to eat, sleep and breathe business -- especially in Japan, land of the endless workday. So how is it that Norio Ogha, Sony's president, is also such an accomplished musician that he will soon conduct at Avery Fisher Hall? Well, he eats and breathes Sony; he just doesn't sleep. Trained as a musician, he at first worked for Sony by day and sang opera by night -- until he fell asleep waiting to sing his part in "The Marriage of Figaro." Now, to pursue his passion for conducting, he studies scores from 2:30 till 5 each morning. But clearly, the work ethic weighs heavily. "That way it's on my time," he explains, "not Sony's time."
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
A Predator's Ball, Up-Tempo
 
Some pairings are naturals: when they happen, there's a blinding flash of light and you wonder why it took so long. Laurel and Hardy. Rodgers and Hammerstein. Now, Michael Jackson and Michael Milken. Just count the similarities: first name, fame, bankrolls, life style, hairdo . . . . Mr. Milken has secured the backing of Mr. Jackson to form an interactive educational television network, but whether Mr. Jackson's backing will be financial or creative remains unclear, and no deal has been reached. But Mr. Milken, just out of Government custody and now required to work 1,800 hours of community service in each of the next three years, said his philanthropic foundations would start the educational network with Mr. Jackson's help.
 
If It Quacks Like a Truck . . .
 
When there's pent-up anger, it pokes out in odd places: a husband and wife battle about teacups when all of life is the true topic. And so with Bill Clinton's spat with Japan. Yes, he's irate about the lopsided trade, about what he calls a closed Japanese market, but his fury last week focused on mini-vans. He said he wanted to levy tariffs as if they were trucks, not cars, and Japan shot back that he'd have a battle on his hands if he did. Here's a simple solution: Peek inside a mini-van and see if it's full of people or plumbing supplies. Then decide if it's a car or a truck.

Exploring The Murky World of Drug Prices

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
LAST week an advisory panel of the Food and Drug Administration recommended approval of Tacrine, the first drug to treat Alzheimer's disease, and health economists are quaking to see how much it will cost patients. Although the drug produces slight or no benefit in most patients, Warner-Lambert has indicated that its price was likely to be well over $1,000 a year. And since there is no other treatment for Alzheimer's and Warner-Lambert has the sole right to produce it, patients or their insurers are expected to pay.
Now that the Clinton Administration has chastised the pharmaceutical industry for excessive prices and profits, health economists have found themselves wondering how to settle on a fair drug price. At the heart of the debate is the inherent tension between patients who feel entitled to medicines at an affordable price and drug manufacturers whose first allegiance is, after all, to their shareholders and who will sell drugs for as much as they can. 
"These companies are not charities -- they are charging what the market will allow them to charge," said Sam Peltzman, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago. He notes that under current law, drug companies are granted monopolies to sell new drugs at any price they wish for over 10 years, so "of course they are going to try to maximize their profits," he said.
Drug companies have generally refused to explain how they price individual drugs, but cite high research and development costs as well as the saving new drugs offer in explaining their charges. "Drugs save the health care system money," said Jeffrey Warren, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association. "They are cheaper than alternative therapies. They avoid hospitalization and surgery, and keep people out of nursing homes."
Following this logic, the manufacturers have argued that a dose of a drug to treat the lungs of premature infants is worth the hundreds of dollars that it costs, since the treatment decreases the children's need for even more costly intensive care.
 
The Ethics of Price-Gouging
 But others disagree. "If someone who finds a pill that would save babies from some dreadful fate says, 'I'm charging an outrageous amount but it's worth it,' I would say that's morally corrupt," said Dr. Paul Meier of Columbia University, who is a frequent consultant to the Food and Drug Administration. "There's a limit to how much we should play the market."
Even avid defenders of free markets admit that current market forces have not worked well to keep drug prices reasonable. "A fair price normally gets set in a market where there are many well informed buyers and many sellers and no subsidies or taxes or patents to distort it," said Dr. Alan Garber, a medical doctor and economist at Stanford University. "In health care none of these conditions exist."
Dr. Meier uses his own experience to prove how the market has failed. For many years he has suffered from dandruff, that he now controls with a prescription shampoo for which he pays $3 through a drug plan; the real price of the shampoo has recently risen to $25. "If it were my $25, I would be back to some other remedy," he said. "But I have no incentive to take the cheaper drug and my doctor has no incentive to prescribe it."
Critics of the industry say there are many methods that the Government or insurers could use to determine if a drug price was fair. Dr. Peter Arno, a health economist at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, suggests that drug prices could be set by comparing the price of a new drug to others that perform the same function or to the drug's price in other nations.
For new classes of drugs, Dr. Arno said, prices could be set to cover the cost of drug development "plus a reasonable rate of return." Such "cost-plus" pricing has been used to established reasonable rates in many regulated industries and to reimburse defense contractors.
 
Secret Costs of Production
 But drug manufacturers have avidly guarded their production costs as proprietary information. And even if they were revealed, Dr. Peltzman says, that strategy would not work well in the pharmaceutical world. "If you tie the price of the drug to the cost of developing just that product, you miss the essence of pharmaceutical development, where nine out of ten products fail," he said. Some economists have suggested that a company's total research costs could be factored into setting the price of its successful product, but Professor Peltzman said: "If we say we're are going to pay for all the losers, that encourages waste in the system and mediocre research."
Instead, he and others think the answer lies in reinvigorating market forces that have lain dormant while drugs prices have risen: companies must face more competition, and those who purchase pharmaceuticals must become conscious of price.
Professor Pelzman suggests that patent protection could be cut to five years. Although a company might decide to charge very high prices for the first few years of a drug's life, competition from other quarters would quickly bring down the price, he said.
Dr. Garber said the strategy of managed competition, in which all patients become members of large health maintenance organizations could also hold down drug prices if the groups bargained with drug manufacturers to get the best price for their customers. In the last two weeks the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association has endorsed this approach as preferable to outright price control, Mr. Warren said, understanding that "it will probably result in more competitive prices."
Unfortunately when a company has a monopoly on a drug, there is currently little room for bargaining, and virtually all the drugs costing hundreds of dollars a dose are still under patent. "When there is a unique drug, we face some really tough choices," Dr. Garber said. "It's much easier when you're talking about a drug with 14 close substitutes."
Dr. Garber believes that insurers and health maintenance organizations would have to be able to refuse to pay for treatments that they deemed too costly; otherwise, "any company with a unique product can say the sky's the limit, and we can't afford that." He added that Canada and Australia already tell manufacturers that they won't purchase certain products unless they are priced reasonably.
To draw these lines in the sand, Dr. Garber predicts, health economists will have to become better at determining a drug's cost effectiveness. "Payers are going to have to be able to say there's a price that just not worth it," he said.

HEADLINE: Those Who Pay Health Costs Think About Drawing Lines

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
THEY don't like the word even in Oregon, the state that thrust it into the news. "I certainly don't use the term rationing unless someone forces me to," says Jean I. Thorne, director of Oregon's Medicaid program, which this month received Federal permission for a plan in which poor people will not be covered for low-priority treatments while basic health benefits are extended to everyone.
Americans are worried about health costs, which now soak up 14 percent of the gross national product, surveys show, and want the Government to do something about them. But one thing Americans emphatically do not want, these same surveys find, is rationing of medical care. The idea that someone might be denied, say, an organ transplant that might save his life just because it costs so much is abhorrent. 
 Nor is it part of American medical tradition. "Twenty years ago, when making ward rounds with my students, I'd say that we'll go on trying the next test or treatment and the next one until there is no hope of helping the patient," said Dr. William B. Schwartz of the University of Southern California. That approach -- do anything that might help whatever the cost -- still prevails today, though it often does not benefit the uninsured. It is implicit in laws that, for example, require the Government to license new drugs that promise the slightest benefit, without regard for their sometimes astronomical prices.
"If we want to continue to teach that philosophy, it's going to be incredibly costly," said Dr. Schwartz, who has for years argued that rationing is inevitable if the country wants health spending to level off. "That is a societal decision."
But do not expect any politician, this year or next, to use the dreaded word in the debate over health costs. Instead, watch for the phrase "cost-effective," and read the fine print telling how it will be applied. In those two words lie the seeds of wrenching change.
Already, medical researchers are trying to reduce ineffective or harmful procedures by developing guidelines on, for example, which patients will benefit from operations like coronary bypass. Insurers, through "managed care," have also tried to weed out procedures and hospital days that are not medically necessary.
Pruning out inappropriate care is only sensible -- but it is not rationing. Refusing to pay for something, not because it is ineffective but because its costs greatly outweigh potential benefits, would be the great departure.
Not every expert agrees that rationing is needed in the forseeable future, even if the country adopts a ceiling on spending. After studying the results of many procedures, including coronary bypass, angioplasty, hysterectomy and gall bladder operations, Dr. Robert Brook and his colleagues at the Rand Corporation concluded that one-quarter to one-third of all medical care in the country is either inappropriate or carries risks that equal potential benefits. "We have to get rid of all that before we talk about rationing," Dr. Brook said. "We have at least 10 years before we have to think about rationing."
Another optimist is Dr. Paul Ellwood, a physician and health economist in Jackson Hole, Wyo., and a father of the "managed competition" model favored by President Clinton and his task force, which is expected to issue recommendations in early May for restructuring the health care system. "The health system has overshot," said Dr. Ellwood. "It's doing more with patients than will benefit them."
 
Cutting Waste
 Under managed competition, most doctors and hospitals would join prepaid plans like health maintenance organizations that would compete for the business of large consumer groups. By rewarding doctors for prudent care and publicizing comparative medical results, he said, the approach should help "move medical care back to where most things that are done to patients actually improve their health." By drastically reducing waste, he said, "we can avoid or at least delay rationing."
Dr. Schwartz counters with harsh mathematics. The inescapable truth, he said, is the relentless upward trend in medical costs, compounded annually and driven mainly by new technology and the aging of the population. He is all for stopping useless care, but once those savings are achieved, then the upward trend resumes, scarcely dented. "Maybe for five years real costs increase by 4.5 percent instead of 6 percent," he said. "That's wonderful, but then you're back to the full trend of 6 percent."
While some advances, like vaccines, cut medical costs, many more add to them, Dr. Schwartz said. Many wonder drugs control rather than cure disease: AZT is not just expensive in itself, but in keeping AIDS patients alive encourages extra treament at huge expense for infections and anemia.
Other advances bring incremental gains for a high price. An example: Injected contrast mediums, used in diagnostic imaging about 10 million times a year. The commonly used medium is inexpensive but causes death in a tiny percentage of those cases, about 300 fatalities a year. A new, safer medium being adopted, Dr. Schwartz said, will save those 300 lives at a cost of $1 billion a year.
 
Hope for a Price
 This month, a Federal advisory panel, prohibited by law from considering cost, recommended licensing of Tacrine, a drug that may lead to modest improvements in cognition for one in five Alzheimer's patients who take it. But there is no way to identify those who will benefit or to easily measure the benefits, so many of the country's four million Alzheimer's patients may take it, and Medicare and private insurers will pay. Costs for the drug and required monitoring of side effects may be several billion dollars a year.
Dr. Schwartz says medical resources must somehow be directed to where they give the best returns. He cited the use of $1,000 magnetic resonance imaging scans for patients with head injuries. High priority would go to patients in a stupor or confused state suggesting a 50-50 chance of a life-threatening but treatable blood clot. The cost would be $2,000 per life saved.
But in patients who merely complain of a few bad headaches and some dizziness -- many of whom today are receiving scans just in case -- the chance of finding a dangerous, treatable condition like a clot may be one in 2,000, Dr. Schwartz said, which means the expenditure of $2 million for each life saved.
"As a physician I hate this idea, but we can't afford to spend $2 million per case," Dr. Schwartz said. "When that one fatal case is missed there will be pain and misery. It's a social trade-off. We lost that 1 in 2,000, but what about environmental pollution, or education?"
If the day of reckoning does come, how should rationing be done? Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University, said there are basically two approaches.
One is the "civics textbook" approach, in which government makes open and formally stated choices. The second is to "muddle through elegantly," decentralizing rationing with "ad hoc decisions in the trenches." The latter approach may not satisfy the civics books, he said, but it may be the more realistic route.
Oregon's plan of "prioritization," as officials there prefer to call it, which has involved exhaustive public hearings and creation of a formal ranking of diseases and treatments, is the epitome of approach No. 1. Its evolution also suggests that Dr. Reinhardt may be right about the difficulty. As finally approved, the plan hardly deserves to be called rationing; almost all the excluded treatments involve self-limiting conditions, cosmetic procedures and therapy of unproven value. By drawing the cutoff so low, the state has been able to gain wide support and Federal approval, but it expects to save only about 3 percent of its Medicaid costs over time, Ms. Thorne said.
Oregon officials "did not get into serious consideration of cost-effectiveness," she said; they lacked data and "did not want to be in the position of attaching dollars to a person's life." A few things clearly of slight benefit and extreme cost, like aggressive care for advanced, terminal cancer patients, were ranked near the bottom. But expensive organ transplants of proven value will be paid for. Some of the hardest decisions with huge financial impact -- when to put critically ill patients into intensive care and on artificial life support -- were largely left where they are now, in the hands of doctors and patients.
In what could become a forum for overtly balancing costs and benefits, advocates of managed competition call for a national board that would set guidelines for appropriate care, based on research. But for now at least, such guidelines should not bar beneficial care, Dr. Ellwood said. "I'd like to delay that as long as we possibly can."
Dr. Reinhardt doubts, in any case, that a public body could ever articulate and enforce such explosive trade-offs. 'Do you think there is a political body strong enough to say we are not going to do hip replacement surgery on a 90-year-old man or woman?"
The messier, more realistic way to ration, he said, involves capping the funds available for care, and limiting expensive investments like M.R.I. machines and intensive-care beds. Doctors would have to make new judgments, sometimes subconsciously, in seeking to provide the best care in a setting of limited resources. If there was a waiting list for the M.R.I., the patient with mere headaches would be given reassurance rather than a referral for a scan. If the intensive care unit was overflowing, the cancer patient with few weeks to live anyway would not receive cardiac resuscitation.
Something like this already happens in Canada and Europe, where costly equipment is more restricted. How deeply the rationing would cut into care would be determined by the level of spending, which is higher by far in the United States than in any other country.
In the United States, no one envisions a system that would prevent wealthier individuals from buying extra care with their own money, even if insurers refused to pay.
Dr. Reinhardt's invisible rationing would work best if doctors and patients were in H.M.O.'s, which must work within annual budgets, he said. In fee-for-service medicine, perversely, doctor and hospital both make more money by keeping a doomed patient alive an extra week or two.
"No physician in America would ever say that money even vaguely affected his decisions," Dr. Reinhardt said. "They may never even admit it to themselves."
But eliminating perverse incentives and forcing medicine to operate within clear limits would make a difference, he is sure. "They'll tell the family, 'Look, this just doesn't make sense.' "

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
In Aid to Yeltsin, Damage Control for the West

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WEIGHED down by sagging economies and bulging budget deficits, the Western industrial nations have lost some of their ardor about lavishing billions of dollars in aid on Russia. Eager to cut their deficits and put their domestic houses in order, officials from many countries are not exactly doing cartwheels at the prospect of providing Russia with the $30 billion to $40 billion in aid that many experts say Moscow needs this year. The sums being talked about are considerably more than last year's $24 billion aid package.
Though such amounts are large, they could be modest compared to the price that the West would pay if Russia's President Boris N. Yeltsin were ousted and replaced by a hostile, ultra-nationalist regime. Such a government would probably not seek to start a new cold war with the West, but its focus might be on taking back parts or all of some other former Soviet republics, especially areas with large Russian populations. And that alone would be a formula for renewed nuclear threats and renewed tensions with the world's industrialized democracies. 
 A right-wing Russia intent on rebuilding its empire not only might put an end to the cuts in defense spending here and in Western Europe, but might cause Pentagon spending to climb again. "I think we would rethink a lot of the cuts," said Richard Ericson, director of the Harriman Institute, a center at Columbia University that specializes in Russian studies. "And," he added, "we might reconsider putting resources into the Strategic Defense Inititiative," the proposed anti-missile system pushed by President Ronald Reagan
Thanks largely to the end of the cold war, the Clinton Administration has proposed cutting the Pentagon's budget by $88 billion more over four years than President George Bush had proposed. If a reversal in Russia caused the Administration to cancel those cuts, the expense would dwarf the $700 million the Administration plans to spend this year to help Russia. That sum will actually help finance several billion dollars worth of aid, because much of the assistance will take the form of publicly insured export credits..
In short, many Western officials see aid to Mr. Yeltsin as an expensive investment but a wise one, that could help prevent the economically and psychologically costly resumption of a cold war.
Little wonder then that Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany said on Friday, after meeting with President Clinton, "Both of us are aware that any type of setback" in Russia "would be more expensive than any type of assistance we are discussing."

California Environmentalists Cut a Deal, Hope for the Best

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
FOR years environmentalists have fought to save endangered animals and plants with almost religious fervor, waging a war against the forces of nature, developers and governments in which compromise was scorned but victory usually elusive. Now they have begun to make pacts with the devil, and many of them are not sure it will work.
The latest Faustian pact came Thursday when major environmental leaders stepped onto a podium in Washington and shook hands with their devil, the big land developers of Southern California, the folks who -- if they could -- would turn almost every last acre of scrub between Los Angeles and the Mexican border into manicured tracts of fake Spanish-style suburban homes. The matchmaker was Bruce Babbitt, the new Interior Secretary, a former Governor of Arizona and a respected environmentalist himself but a politician who knows the value of compromise. 
 The instrument of this particular pact was a small songbird, the scrub-dwelling California gnatcatcher, a potential spoiler for the developers. As Southern California's voracious human population has swelled to more than 15 million, the gnatcatcher's numbers have dwindled to fewer than 3,000 mating pairs. To environmentalists, the pact represented a means of stopping further development; to the developers it merited no special protection, given how many jobs were at stake and that the gnatcatcher has plenty of cousins in Mexico's Baja California.
But both sides, recognizing political and economic realities, put aside some of their convictions and agreed to enter into a California state-sponsored program, called the Natural Communities Conservation Planning Program, whereby developers and local government would set up a dozen preserves meant to save not only the gnatcatcher, but also its full ecosystem, which is host to 30 or 40 other sensitive species. The catch: the developers get to bulldoze the rest of the coastal sage scrub habitat.
The agreement came just a week before President Clinton's planned journey to Oregon to broker another bitter environmental dispute, over the old-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest. But those forests, and the endangered northern spotted owl that inhabits them, are so far gone that a gnatcatcher-like compromise is not considered a model for saving timber jobs. Rather, the President is considering public works jobs for unemployed loggers and shifting the industry to forests farther east.
But backers of the gnatcatcher compromise used words like "innovative," "milestone" and "unprecedented." In fact, it was only the latest, albeit most ambitious, plan of its type. Known as habitat conservation plans, they have been used in several parts of the country as a means of heading off species-by-species conflicts over endangered plants and animals while allowing a measure of development -- particularly in fast-growing urban areas of the West.
Such plans were originally authorized by amendments to the Federal Endangered Species Act in 1982, and the first was used to save two rare butterflies on San Bruno Mountain, just south of San Francisco. But the pace of activity has picked up markedly over the last few years, in desert areas of California under attack by the metastasis of Los Angeles, in San Diego County, in the Las Vegas area, in central Texas near Austin and in Brevard County, Fla.
 
Most in California
 There are about 60 plans in various stages, mostly in California, taxing the Fish and Wildlife Service's administrative capacity, according to Michael J. Bean, chairman of wildlife programs for the Environmental Defense Fund in Washington. They have come under increasing scrutiny as the Endangered Species Act comes up for renewal in Congress this year amid pressures to find some way to ease its putative dampening effect on jobs and development. Some environmentalists have favored them because they offer the potential of more conservation bang for the buck than the old way: setting aside entire habitats that could preserve several species at once.
But so far it is hard to pronounce major successes. The butterflies on San Bruno Mountain are thriving, but there is much conflict over other plans, particularly over defining the boundaries and rules for development in protected areas of Riverside County, where the Stephens kangaroo rat is endangered.
There are high hopes for the Texas plan, known as the Balcones Canyon Land Conservation Plan, which would set aside up to 29,160 acres of limestone ridges and caves west of Austin, where two songbirds -- the black-capped vireo and the golden-cheeked warbler -- have been listed as endangered. Last August, voters approved a $22 million bond measure to acquire land. If the Fish and Wildlife Service approves, developers would get the green light to develop similar terrain in the area.
 
'A Lot of Reservations'
 "I have a lot of reservations about these plans," said Pamela P. Eaton of the Wilderness Society in Washington. "We have not seen any that are particularly good so far. In many cases that they are starting too late and the flexibility to make these trade-offs with developers are very limited."
The hope here at least is that there is room in the gnatcatcher case for the devil to get his due. It all depends on the details of the preservation plan offered by a special panel appointed by the California Resources Agency due next week. That agency is claiming much of the credit for the new plan, but the same agency two years ago refused to designate the gnatcatcher as endangered under state law; it was only the threat of Federal action that brought the developers to the table with the environmentalists. On Thursday, Secretary Babbitt declared it "threatened" rather than the more serious "endangered," giving the flexibility for the compromise plan.
In concept at least, the gnatcatcher habitat conservation plan is broader and geographically wider than any other such plan in the country, and differs markedly in that it will allow developers to proceed under special interim guidelines while the preserve boundary lines are drawn. "It's all in the follow-through," said John McCaull, California legislative director for the National Audubon Society. Said Ann Notthoff, senior planner with the Natural Resources Defense Council in San Francisco, whose petition for endangered status forced the new compromise: "It's not a foregone conclusion that the developers are not going to get their way."

For a Moment, a Senate Majority of Clintonites

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IT was only one pace in a long journey. But the Senate's approval on Thursday of the general outline of the Clinton economic program, just 36 days after the President proposed it, left no question that the Government is on its new course.
Taxes are going to rise. The military faces deep spending cuts. And Washington is prepared to spend more in areas that were allowed to languish in the Republican years, areas like education, civilian research and public works projects. 
 Approval of the plan by the House of Representatives the week before last was a nice coup for the President. But the House Democrats started with advantages. They have a large majority, well-disciplined ranks and rules that permit the party leaders to ride roughshod over Republicans and dissidents.
Approval in the Senate, on the other hand, was a milestone. There is hardly a headier lot anywhere than Democratic Senators. Each has an agenda. Many, no doubt, think they and not Bill Clinton should be President. Yet, when the final vote was taken, all but three of the 57 -- all except Bob Krueger of Texas and Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, who voted "no," and Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii, who was absent -- voted with the President, while all 43 Republicans were against him. Even Lyndon B. Johnson in his heyday did not enjoy such unity in his party.
Mr. Clinton was jubilant. "Finally," he told Senate leaders in a telephone conversation after the vote, "we've done something to break the gridlock."
Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic leader, was also elated at the way his troops held ranks, but he cautioned them that "the hard part lies ahead."
The measure the Senators approved, called a budget resolution, is only the first step in the Congressional budget process. It sets overall figures for Government spending and revenues. Over five years, the resolution would raise taxes by a total of about $300 billion and reduce Government spending by about $200 billion. On an annual basis, it would bring the Federal deficit, now about $300 billion, below $200 billion by the fiscal year 1997, the last of Mr. Clinton's term.
But budget resolutions do not make the nitty-gritty determinations about which taxes will be raised and which cut, or about how much money will be spent on which Government programs. The Democrats' discipline will be harder to maintain when the lawmakers have to vote for real, as they did last week in a test vote, on such politically touchy aspects of the Clinton program as his proposal to require middle-income retirees to pay higher taxes on their Social Security benefits.
As a matter of fact, just after the budget vote, when Mr. Clinton's proposal to spend an additional $16 billion over the next two years to stimulate the economy and create jobs came up, the Democratic senators started squabbling.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
The Center of Gravity Moves West in Canada

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH

DATELINE: TORONTO

 BODY:
CANADA'S West Coast has always been an anomaly, an enclave on the other side of the mountains with its own special customs and manners, a place ignored by the rest of the country and seeming to prefer it that way.
Its distance -- three time zones from Ottawa -- and its often eccentric leaders fostered the notion that British Columbia was not to be taken seriously. John Smith, the province's premier from 1872 to 1874, changed his name to Amor de Cosmos because it "tells what I love most: order, beauty, the world, the universe." 
 Now British Columbia -- the size of California, Oregon and Washington combined but with only 3 million people or one-tenth their population -- is shaking off its long insularity and could even become the tail that wags the rest of Canada.
Psychologically, the distance from Ottawa could be dramatically shortened if, as polls suggest, Avril Phaedra Campbell, who adopted the nickname Kim as a 12-year-old Vancouver student, is chosen to become Canada's first woman Prime Minister and its first born and bred on the West Coast.
The cello-playing Defense Minister is the odds-on favorite to succeed Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who announced last month that he is stepping down in June after eight years in power marked by unpopular economic policies. If confirmed as leader of the Progressive Conservative party at a convention in June, Ms. Campbell, who last week announced her candidacy for the post, would complete Mr. Mulroney's term as Prime Minister and have to call elections before December.
Although the country yet knows little about her ideas for running the Government, she is the new political face from the baby-boomer generation that many Canadians are apparently seeking for their leader. At 46, she is the same age as President Clinton. Last week she told an Ottawa daily that she once smoked marijuana when she was a university student "and I inhaled the smoke." Like Mr. Mulroney, she speaks French. She also speaks Russian.
Her campaign for Tory delegates could stumble before the June party convention, or she could blow the national election. But for now, an Angus Reid/Southam News poll has found that with her leading the party, the Tories would vault to an 18-point lead over the currently front-running Liberals led by Jean Chretien, 59.
Yet even before Ms. Campbell's stock began to rise, British Columbia was doffing some of its Lotusland stereotypes and becoming more assertive on the national scene.
Thanks to its links with the Pacific Rim, its balmy temperatures and a constant influx of new residents from both Asia and the rest of Canada, British Columbia has become the fastest growing of the provinces, both in population and economic output. Last year, as Canada worked to climb out of a long national recession, economic activity spurted 2.4 percent in British Columbia, against less than 1 percent in the nine other provinces and two territories. This largely reflected B.C.'s expanding research and information industries and its rising trade with Asia, which buys more than a third of the province's exports.
The industrial mix is similar to California's. The difference is that British Columbia doesn't have a big defense industry. Defense cutbacks have ravaged California, and thousands are leaving for jobs elsewhere, just the reverse of what's happening up the coast.
B.C. still produces less than Ontario or Quebec, the two biggest provinces, which have heavy manufacturing bases and two-thirds of Canada's 27 million people. But the province's increasing economic clout has inevitably given it a stronger voice.
Vancouver, a snow-capped jewel on the Pacific that is closer to Asia than any other major city in North America, has 1.5 million people, a third of whom are immigrants. Twenty percent of the immigrants are either from China or Hong Kong.
The city, which ranks third in population in Canada after Toronto and Montreal, had its coming out seven years ago when Expo 86 drew 21 million visitors. Next weekend it is scheduled to play host to the summit conference of President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia.
 
'A Leader, Not a Follower'
 "Historically we were at the back end of the country, where the railroad stopped," said Michael A. Goldberg, dean of commerce and business administration at the University of British Columbia. "Now we're in the middle of the global economy, the same distance from Tokyo as from London. Because the kind of economy that is emerging is so different from what we have enjoyed up to now, we see ourselves as a leader, not a follower."
In the referendum defeat of a proposed constitutional overhaul last year, British Columbia was already playing a leadership role. It was loud on the "no" side, and its commentators, like the Vancouver talk radio host Rafe Mair, helped sway votes in the rest of the country.
The proposed overhaul, known as the Charlottetown Agreement, sought to provide guarantees to Quebec to keep it from bolting from the Canadian federation. British Columbians, who paradoxically share with Quebecers a sense of alienation, declared Quebec's price too high and voted 2-to-1 against the changes, the biggest margin for the "no" side in any province or territory.
Quebecers voted no as well, saying the agreement did not go far enough to meet their autonomy demands.
What especially angered British Columbians was a commitment that Quebec, now representing a quarter of the country's population, would always have a 25 percent vote in Parliament, meaning that British Columbia, as the fastest-growing province, would be shortchanged.
Lorne Seitz, the senior representative of the British Columbia government in Ottawa, said the referendum showed "the feeling that the interests and vision of people on the Western seaboard aren't adequately recognized." With Kim Campbell as Prime Minister, he added, B.C. may begin to be seen as "not just as one of eight other provinces, but on the level and status of Ontario and Quebec in the Canadian federation."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Those High-Tech Jobs Can Cross the Border, Too

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
IN theory, it is an attractive proposition. Mexico, with its low wages, would lure away only the low-skilled, easy-to-do jobs. The complicated, skilled work, requiring more training and education, would remain in the United States, at higher pay. The rub is that Mexicans are quickly learning to do the high-skilled, complicated jobs. Contrary to expectations, those are also being exported.
That is a painful revelation for Americans. South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Spain, Singapore and Thailand have all demonstrated how rapidly a nation bent on industrialization can master complicated tasks that once seemed reserved for Japan, Germany or the United States. Oceans and tariffs had shielded Americans from the full force of this trend. But now Mexico, just down the highway, is struggling to industrialize. And the North American Free Trade Agreement is about to dismantle what is left of the barriers that protected American jobs. 
 "Ultimately, we will adjust to this transfer of jobs abroad, just as we adjusted to the migration of our farm population to the cities," said Frank Levy, labor economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "But while it is going on, you have to be concerned for the social peace of the country."
The Clinton Administration is just beginning to acknowledge that its principal measure for preserving jobs -- a $37.8 billion outlay over four years for schooling and for endless on-the-job training -- might not be sufficient.
True, American workers gaining skills from education and training will qualify as machinists, mechanics, computer experts, repair people and electricians -- the elite of the manufacturing work force. But over the past decade, the Mexican Government has greatly expanded the education and training of its young people for these same tasks. And when it comes to on-the-job training in Mexico, American companies setting up shop there are finding that it is far less costly than in the United States. The trainees earn only $1 or $2 an hour, a fraction of the wage for a beginner in a factory in the United States and far below the average American manufacturing wage of $11 an hour.
"What we can train here, they can train there for much less money," said Richard Freeman, a Harvard labor economist.
 
A Loss of 8 Million Jobs?

Acknowledging the Mexican competition, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich argued that, quite apart from training, the United States offsets the Mexican job lure in other ways. A growing economy will create a continuing demand for skilled American workers at good wages, he said. What's more, there are advantages for companies remaining at home, among them the extra sales that come from being close to customers and the savings that result from operating in the United States, with its many suppliers and its far better communications and transportation infrastructure than Mexico's.
"History suggests that the number of high-paying jobs increases as the economy expands," Mr. Reich said in a recent interview. "The real question is the dislocations over the short term, and that blow will be softened by the advantages offered by our superior infrastructure and being close to customers."
No one knows how many American jobs could slip away to Mexico as it becomes an ever larger manufacturing center for the United States market. But a conservative estimate offered by labor economists -- a "ballpark figure," as Mr. Levy put it -- is that 7 million to 8 million jobs, or 7 percent of the American work force, are in danger.
These are factory jobs, among the best paid in America. They are held mostly by non-college graduates, but also by some college-educated engineers. They range from the engineers and highly skilled machinists down through maintenance people and computer programmers to assembly line operators. Already, nearly 600,000 jobs have disappeared to Mexico, most of them at the low-skill end of this spectrum.
 
The Challenge of Innovation
 But the maquiladoras, the assembly plants that employ these workers, are slowly becoming automated and much more like standard American factories. More important, state-of-the-art factories are blossoming in Mexico: a Nissan car factory, a Ford engine plant, an A.T. &T. plastic molding operation, an automated Mexican paper mill.
This evolution is hardly a new phenomenon, but in the 1960's and 1970's it proceeded more slowly. Corporations in industrial nations would locate well-established, relatively low-skilled technologies in developing countries -- raw steel production, for example -- but would hesitate to transfer the more difficult technologies and skills involved in manufacturing, say, a transmission or a car engine. "You were not sure these countries were up to such tasks, but now you know they are," Mr. Levy said.
Certainly Mexico is. Harley Shaiken, a labor economist at the University of California at San Diego, asserts that the Japanese could duplicate in Mexico today "the technology and skills at every Japanese factory that was located in the United States over the past decade."
The work force for such factories is lining up in Mexico. More than 145,000 people are being graduated annually from that country's expanding network of publicly funded universities, technical institutes and secondary schools dedicated to preparing young people for skilled jobs.
"They are people who are overqualified for the jobs they now can get," said Hector Nunez Martinez, director of Chihuahua's Institute of Technology, which trains engineers, technicians and the Mexican equivalent of M.B.A.'s. "The supply of skilled workers is still greater than the demand for their skills," he said.
Whatever their skills, they fall short on one very major point. Mexican universities are not research institutes. That is still the preserve of the United States and the other advanced industrial countries. America's researchers and scientists are not yet an endangered species. Similarly, the factories in Mexico -- whether they are Mexican owned or foreign owned -- are not innovators. The machinery and the technologies employed there were first developed in the United States or Europe or Japan. A General Motors Saturn plant, with its innovative techniques, would not be placed first in Mexico, although someday soon such a plant might be copied there.
"We do well if we keep innovating," said Paul Osterman, an expert in job training at M.I.T.'s Sloane School of Management. "Mexico is clearly going to take some jobs away, and we have to come up with a strategy to create new ones."
Innovation is one solution. Upgrading jobs in the huge service sector is another. Retailing, after all, is a captive industry. New Yorkers or Midwesterners might buy products made in Mexico, but they won't shop for them there. But how do you upgrade an auto salesman? "I do not know," Mr. Freeman said. "We have not really thought about this issue."

HEADLINE: LETTER EXPLAINED MOTIVE IN BOMBING, OFFICIALS NOW SAY

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
Law-enforcement officials said yesterday that the suspects in the World Trade Center bombing mailed a letter around the time of the attack claiming responsibility and attributing the action to deep resentment against United States policy in the Middle East.
The officials said they had determined late last week that the letter from a group calling itself the Liberation Army Fifth Battalion was authentic and that it provided the first insight into what might have prompted the attack.
 
A Warning
 The letter, mailed to The New York Times and turned over to the authorities, warned of additional actions against American civilian and military targets, including what they described as "Nuclear targets." Such attacks, they said, would be forthcoming unless the United States met a series of demands, including an end to diplomatic relations with Israel and an end to interfering "with any of the Middle East countries interior affairs." 
 The claims and threats were contained in a letter that described deep resentment over United States policies in the Middle East and said that Americans themselves were responsible.
 
'People Must Know'
 "The American people must know, that their civilians who got killed are not better than those who are getting killed by the American weapons and support," said the letter, which was written in occasionally faulty English.
"The American people are responsible for the actions of their government and they must question all of the crimes that their government is committing against other people," it continued. "Or they -- Americans -- will be the targets of our operations that could diminish them."
The letter was delivered to The Times four days after the bombing of the World Trade Center. It was turned over to the New York City Police Department's Chief of Detectives, Joseph R. Borrelli, who immediately passed it on to a Federal and city task force that is investigating the terrorist attack. The task force was meeting in Mr. Borrelli's office when he received the letter.
 
Found to Be 'Authentic'
 Investigators determined that the letter was "authentic" and that it had been prepared by one of the five men now in custody, law-enforcement officials said yesterday. But the officials declined to say precisely how the determination had been made, saying that it could compromise the investigation. They also would not say which of the suspects is believed to have written the document.
The investigators could have reached their conclusions through analysis of the handwritten return address on the envelope, a comparison of the printed text with typewriters or computer printers found in searches of suspects' homes or from comments made by one or more of the suspects. Copies of the letter might also have been found during the searches. A senior investigator said that none of the five arrested suspects had provided information about the others in the group.
"There is no question that the letter was prepared by a member of this cell," a senior investigator said, referring to the five suspects.
The evidence tying the suspect to the letter is "incontrovertible and it's not speculation," the investigator said. "It's the kind of evidence admissible in court."
Another New York City newspaper, which was not identified by investigators, apparently also received a letter from the group.
In the one-page letter, the group said the bombing of the lower Manhattan complex was a response to "the American political, economical and military support to Israel the state of terrorism and to the rest of the dictator countries in the region."
The letter, with a garbled return address in Arabic, demanded that the United States stop "all military, economical and political aids to Israel"; that it end diplomatic relations with Israel, and that it refrain from interference "with any of the Middle East countries interior affairs."
The Feb. 26 bombing, which killed 6 people and injured more than 1,000, has been investigated round the clock by hundreds of Federal and local investigators. Last week, Egyptian authorities turned over to United States officials Mahmud Abohalima, 33, whom investigators have portrayed as a prime suspect in the case.
Government officials in Washington said they had not previously heard of the Liberation Army Fifth Battalion. A private database maintained by the Rand Corporation, a business research group in Santa Monica, Calif., showed no previous indication of the group nor that a group by that name had ever claimed responsibility for a terrorist attack.
In the month since the bombing, the authorities have been able to follow an almost amateur's trail of clues -- telephone calls, a joint bank account, common addresses -- to arrest a small circle of five Middle Eastern immigrants, who all profess their innocence. A sixth suspect is still being sought. But while investigators believe they have found the core group of the conspiracy, until now they had not found any suggestion of the group's thinking or anything tying it directly to Middle Eastern politics.
 
Anger Is Shown
 The letter from the Fifth Battalion Liberation Army, however, clearly links the bombing of the World Trade Center to anger over the United States' support of Israel. Setting out the group's rationale for the explosion, the letter argued that "the terrorism that Israel practices (Which is supported by America) must be faced by a similar one."
It said United States citizens should question the "crimes" their Government is committing against others.
The letter said that the Liberation Army has "more than 150 suicidal soldiers ready to go ahead." It warned that if the group's demands were not met, it "will continue to execute our missions against military and civilian targets" in the United States and abroad. It specifically mentioned "some potential Nuclear targets."
The document also warned the United States to stop supporting secular Arab nations in the Middle East, which it described as "the rest of the dictator countries in the region."
It was unclear whether the writer of the letter was responding to any specific events in Israel or other Middle East countries, or any particular policies. But the overall thrust of the document indicated deep concern over the economic and military aid that the United States provides to Israel and its longstanding role as Israel's sponsor.
The United States also provides almost an equal amount of annual aid to Egypt, whose secular authorities are opposed vehemently by fundamentalist Islamic groups with which the bombing suspects have been associated.
 
Similar Roots
 Two of the suspects arrested and charged in connection with the bombing, Mohammed A. Salameh, 25, and Nidal A. Ayyad, also 25, came from Palestinian families displaced during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Mr. Salameh often spoke so passionately and angrily about Israeli policies and the fate of Palestine that a roommate asked him to move from their Jersey City apartment. The roommate, Ashraf Moneeb, said that to force Mr. Salameh to move he falsely told him he was getting married and needed the room.
Another suspect, Bilall Alkaisi, 27, left several addresses with United States immigration officials, claiming to be either from Lebanon or Jordan. The fourth suspect, Mr. Abohalima, was born in a mill town outside Alexandria, Egypt, and the fifth, Ibrahim A. Elgabrowny, 42, was born in Port Said, Egypt. All have said they are innocent of the bombing.
Many of the suspects were also fervent supporters of El Sayyid A. Nosair, who was tried for the assassination of Rabbi Meir Kahane, whose anti-Arab stance was so extreme that his Kach party was banned in Israel as racist. They showed up at Mr. Nosair's trial and have visited him at Attica state prison. Mr. Nosair was acquitted of the murder, but he is serving a maximum of 22 years on assault and weapons-possession convictions stemming from a second shooting just outside the midtown hotel where Mr. Kahane was slain.

HEADLINE: U.N. Is Developing Control Center to Coordinate Growing Peacekeeping Role

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 27

 BODY:
In a windowless office on the 30th floor of United Nations headquarters here, with maps of Somalia and Mogadishu taped on the walls, an Egyptian major, a Zimbabwean major and a Pakistani captain watch television and wait for the telephone or the fax machine to ring.
They are part of a seven-officer team that keeps in touch with the American-led force in Somalia. But they are also the embryo of the new command and control center the United Nations plans to create here over the next few months to keep headquarters linked day and night with all its peacekeeping operations around the world. 
 There are now 60,000 peacekeepers in the field at an annual cost of some $2.8 billion, carrying out 13 operations stretching from El Salvador to Angola to the former Yugoslavia to Cambodia. And with the Security Council voting Friday to start the largest operation yet, in Somalia, and another huge assignment, in Bosnia, on the horizon, the United Nations is engaged in a sweeping overhaul of how it runs these efforts. The goal is a 24-hour-a-day "war room" and access to intelligence and troops from United Nations members.
The overhaul, long sought by the United States, began several months ago while Marrack Goulding, a former British diplomat, was in charge of peacekeeping. It is gathering pace under his former deputy, Kofi Annan, a 55-year-old Ghanaian who took over the top peacekeeping job at the start of the month. Mr. Goulding now looks after the United Nations' peacemaking efforts in Europe, Asia and the Americas.
 
No More 'Gifted Amateurism'
 "Our operations are now so large and complex that we are redesigning the whole department," said Mr. Annan. "The days of gifted amateurism are over."
In the past, the United Nations has run peacekeeping operations on a shoestring budget, using a handful of officials, most of whom have no military experience. Communications have frequently been poor and intelligence about conditions on the ground sketchy at best.
Now, four major changes are under way:
*The peacekeeping department is being reorganized and given a permanent planning unit to prepare operations.
*The United Nations is negotiating troop standby agreements with countries willing to provide units on short notice for peacekeeping duties. Mr. Annan hopes such commitments will enable him to put an advance guard on the ground within 24 hours of a Security Council decision to start a new operation, and to cut the force build-up time from the current three-to-four months to two months or less.
*An operations center with secure voice and data communication with all the peacekeeping operations around the world is being set up. "The days will soon be over when force commanders ring me up at home during the weekend for instructions and find the phone is busy," Mr. Annan said.
*The United Nations and its field commanders are making arrangements to receive military and political intelligence from the United States and other countries willing to share it. "We have to be careful because the big powers only give us what they want us to know," Mr. Annan said. "But in difficult places like Somalia and Bosnia we need all the intelligence we can gather."
As the United States prepares to hand over the Somalia operation to a United Nations force, it is planning to sell the organization an intelligence system that receives American satellite photos and political analysis. United Nations commanders in Bosnia are also expected to get intelligence from the United States and its allies.
 
The Most Ambitious Efforts
 The changes come at a time when Mr. Annan is preparing to launch the two most ambitious peacekeeping efforts the United Nations has ever attempted: dispatching some 30,000 soldiers and civilians to replace the American-led force in Somalia, and, if a peace agreement is reached in Bosnia, sending 50,000 or more NATO troops there to insure that the warring factions stick to the settlement.
Both operations would break new ground for the United Nations. In Somalia, a United Nations Secretary General will be assuming direct command for the first time in the organization's history of a well-armed force empowered to use force if necessary to carry out relief operations. The Somali factions agreed tonight to disarm and form a transitional government for the country.
"This will be first time the United Nations has had command and control of an enforcement action under Chapter 7 " said Mr. Annan, referring to the portion of the United Nations Charter allowing the Security Council to impose its orders by force.
If the leadership of Bosnia's three warring factions sign a peace agreement, the United Nations will find itself commanding a second enforcement operation. For the peacekeeping army it plans to send there will also be ordered to use force against what Mr. Annan calls "pockets of local resistance and rogue elephant commanders" who refuse to abide by the peace settlement's terms.
While details are not settled, Mr. Annan thinks NATO's southern command probably will be asked to take overall control of United Nations military operations throughout the former Yugoslavia, with Gen. Philippe Morillon of France remaining in command of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Both would report to Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and through him to the Security Council.
Both operations would thus differ from the Korean and Persian Gulf conflicts, when the United States was authorized to lead a coalition into war and made key decisions itself. They would also be more comprehensive than in the Congo operation in 1960, when peacekeepers were allowed to use force only to prevent civil war and remove mercenaries.
Mr. Annan's enthusiasm for improving the United Nations peacekeeping operations is no surprise. Only two years ago he proposed what he calls "a modest extension of the United Nations' peacekeeping role," suggesting that the Secretary General send specially trained units of unarmed soldiers from member nations to disaster areas such as Somalia to help distribute relief supplies.
But the idea of giving the United Nations a kind of humanitarian rapid intervention force was killed by Javier Perez de Cuellar, then the Secretary General, who feared governments would see the plan as an infringement of their sovereignty.
 
U.N. Role Is Changing Fast
 These days Mr. Annan, who has degrees in management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and economics from the Institute des Hautes Etudes Internationales in Geneva, laughs softly when he remembers that initiative. "Just look where we've got to now," he said. "A force of heavily armed soldiers is keeping order and distributing food in Somalia, and another 25,000 armed soldiers are doing similar work in the former Yugoslavia. Who would have believed that two years ago?"
Since then, of course, the collapse of the Soviet Union has freed the Security Council to intervene in disputes around the world and also allowed it to become increasingly intrusive in its handling of civil wars and other disasters. No longer does a hostile Kremlin fearing Western influence invoke the inviolability of national sovereignty as a reason for stopping the Western powers from acting in troubled countries.
Mr. Annan believes the United Nations must become increasingly inventive in designing peacekeeping operations to meet the constantly changing needs of individual crises. "During the cold war days we developed a theology of peacekeeping which was perceived as very successful," he said. "But success breeds its own hubris. We need to expand the range of options so we can deal with new challenges."
The list of countries that may soon need some form of United Nations intervention is also lengthening. Mr. Annan sees two African countries, Rwanda and Liberia, as the most likely candidates for peacekeeping forces after Somalia and Bosnia.
But in a recent article in the journal Foreign Policy, Gerard B. Helman, a former American representative to the United Nations in Geneva, and Steven R. Ratner of the Council on Foreign Relations warned that the United Nations may soon find itself involved with such "failing states" as Ethiopia, Zaire and Georgia.
In addition to the larger changes under way to prepare for such missions, Mr. Annan is doubling his personal staff from 27 to over 50, and he envisions a permanent staff in the "war room" of over 100 officers. He is also considering asking Defense Ministries to send troops on peacekeeping missions as part of their regular training.
As the demand for peacekeeping has grown sharply, the Security Council seems more willing to mount forceful interventions. Mr. Annan sees the trend as reflecting a growing intolerance of despots, wars and disasters and impatience with the idea that national sovereignty is inviolable.
"The Security Council is moving towards greater interventionism because in many tragedies public opinion perceives a human imperative that transcends everything else," he said. "We are using more force because we are encountering more resistance."
 
More Willingness to Use Force
 In a lecture at Oxford University this month, Mr. Annan's predecessor, Under Secretary General Goulding, also noted that the Security Council seems increasingly willing to use force these days. He said one reason is that the Security Council now frequently finds itself dealing with "armed groups outside the control of recognized political authorities with whom the United Nations can conclude the necessary political and practical agreements." Somali warlords and rogue commanders in the Balkans are cases in point.
In Mr. Annan's view, the rising bill for peacekeeping creates a link between his work and Mr. Goulding's new responsibilities as a peacemaker, which involve sending mediators and fact-finding teams to trouble spots in a bid to resolve disputes before they lead to war. "Somalia will cost $1.5 billion a year, Bosnia about $3 billion," Mr. Annan said. That means the world's peacekeeping bill could double this year after increasing fourfold in the last three years. The answer, he said, must be more "preventative diplomacy" aimed at stopping potential conflicts before they erupt into violence.
Mr. Annan, married with three children, has spent his whole career with the United Nations, starting at the World Health Organization in Geneva and rising to head the Office of Program Planning, Budget and Finance in New York before becoming Mr. Goulding's deputy a year ago.
He is also chairman of the board of trustees of the United Nations International School in New York, a job he is having trouble giving up. When he tried to resign last year the trustees invited him to a dinner for a valedictory presentation. But the plaque they gave him thanked him for his work as chairman between 1987 and 1997, implying he has another four years to go.

HEADLINE: USAIR SUPERVISORS FALSIFIED REPAIRS

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27

 BODY:
USAir said this week that company supervisors at two airports had falsified records to certify plane repairs when they were not made and that Federal officials were investigating mechanics' accusations of broader abuses.
The company said a USAir maintenance supervisor in Charlotte, N.C., allowed a jet to fly with a defective warning system because he wanted to save the airline money. The company suspended and demoted the employee and said the problem had been eliminated. 
 In Indianapolis, USAir said it had found a "small handful" of similar problems at its maintenance center. Those repairs, it said, involved equipment like water systems that did not affect flight safety.
The airline acknowledged the incidents when questioned by The Associated Press, but described the problem as "confined." Jim Lloyd, the airline's general counsel, said USAir had aggressively investigated all of its maintenance centers over the past six weeks and found no current problems beyond those in Indianapolis.
 
Anonymous Calls
 Mr. Lloyd said investigations by the airline and the Federal Aviation Administration were prompted by anonymous calls by USAir mechanics to the aviation agency.
The mechanics union staged a short, bitter strike against the airline last fall.
The F.A.A. forbidss an airline supervisor to sign off on repairs that are not complete, and instances of such violations are considered very rare, said an agency spokesman, Fred Farrar.
He confirmed that the agency was investigating accusations of maintenance violations in Indianapolis but declined to confirm any other investigations.
Three senior mechanics, who spoke on condition they not be identified, said aviation agency investigators had recently been at Indianapolis, Pittsburgh and Greensboro, N.C. The mechanics said maintenance violations had occurred in all three cities.
In Greensboro, they said, a foreman threatened to punish mechanics if they did not sign off on certain repairs that had not been performed. Mr. Lloyd denied the accusation, saying it was a case of angry mechanics making exaggerated complaints about a young and aggressive foreman.
 
'Cooperating Fully'
 In a statement released Wednesday, USAir said it was "cooperating fully" with the Federal investigation. "At USAir, safety is always the top priority, and the airline stands firmly behind the excellence of its maintenance operation," the statement said.
The mechanics asserted that the maintenance problems arose from middle managers' desire to help cut costs. The mechanics said they had no evidence that the activities were sanctioned by corporate headquarters.
Documents obtained by The Associated Press show that the Charlotte supervisor who was demoted told Federal inspectors that the company's desire to cut costs influenced his decision to let a jet fly with a defective warning system.
The supervisor, Everette B. Tate, said he allowed the Boeing 737 to fly with passengers from Charlotte to Jacksonville, N.C., on March 29, 1992, after mechanics failed to repair the jet's system that warns of danger of an engine stall.
USAir suspended Mr. Tate for 10 days without pay and transferred him permanently to the sheet metal shop. The chief pilot on the flight, William F. Higgs, was suspended for 30 days.
The company said it planned to discipline the two foremen in Indianapolis who signed for repairs that were not done or signed repair records that should have been signed by mechanics under them.
Battered by the weak economy and last summer's fare wars, USAir has lost more than $600 million since 1991. Last week, the Clinton Administration gave British Airways permission to invest $300 million in the company, America's sixth-largest airline.

HEADLINE: Pact to Return Aristide to Haiti Is Called Near

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, March 27

 BODY:
Backed by strong diplomatic pressure from Washington, United Nations negotiators are close to announcing a settlement of the Haitian crisis that would return the country's exiled President, diplomats familiar with the talks say.
Under the proposed accord a consensus Government would be announced in a few days, and the central power broker of the country since the coup in September 1991, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, would resign as commander of the army. The settlement calls for the return of the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in six months. 
 United Nations diplomats are negotiating the choice of a new prime minister who would be a compromise figure between the populist President and members of the deeply conservative economic elite. "The choice of a prime minister is crucial, and they are trying to do it as quickly as possible," said a diplomat who is familiar with the discussions. The list of possibilities has been winnowed down to a handful of names.
Several diplomats familiar with the talks said they had been advanced by strong support from the Clinton Administration for the United Nations initiative and Washington's insistence on Father Aristide's quick return.
On a visit to Haiti last weekend, a special adviser to Mr. Clinton on Haitian affairs, Lawrence Pezzullo, was reported to have bluntly warned the Haitian military and the de facto civilian Government that they had to accept quickly an agreement on Father Aristide's return. Mr. Pezzullo was accompanied by Gen. Jack Sheehan of the Marines, who delivered much the same message in discussions with the Haitian high command. The insistence on rapid movement was repeated this week by Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who said that Washington "would accept no delay" in negotiations for Father Aristide's return.
To help secure broad support for a negotiated solution and insure social peace after a new Government has been set up, diplomats said, a two-day conference on aid to Haiti is scheduled to start on April 6 in Washington.
The Haitian economy, the poorest in the hemisphere, has been shattered by the effects of a hemispherewide economic embargo imposed shortly after the coup against Father Aristide.
Under the emerging settlement the United Nations would play a large role in ending a reign of terror by soldiers in the countryside and, later, preventing revenge attacks by Father Aristide's supporters. A United Nations mission that could grow to 500 people would also oversee the reconstruction of an impartial judiciary and the creation of a professional police force. In recent weeks, 140 human rights observers have been sent to Haiti by the United Nations and the Organization of American States.
Negotiations on the political future of the country resumed on Monday, when a special United Nations envoy to Haiti, Dante Caputo, arrived here. The talks had been stalled for months over the refusal of many in the political elite and military to concede anything more than recognition in principle to the deposed President, whom they insisted had to remain in exile indefinitely. Father Aristide had insisted that General Cedras be exiled or punished for presiding over the coup.
Although other diplomatic initiatives aimed at restoring democracy have appeared to be near success, only to fade, people close to the discussions say Washington's repeated hints of sharply increased pressure and Mr. Clinton's personal interest in the crisis have given the renewed effort much greater chances of success.
"The people here honestly thought that the past Administration was sending mixed signals on Haiti and was willing to wait until 1995 for new elections," a diplomat said here. "Pezzullo and the general told them this time that with Clinton it's serious, and they've been hearing the same message in a thousand other ways, too."
The sense of movement here was shared by Haitians, as well. "The support of the international community has never been so strong as now," an adviser to Father Aristide, Micha Gaillard, said. "We cannot let this opportunity pass."

HEADLINE: Congressional Memo;
No Perk Too Small to Be Overlooked by Rebellious Freshmen

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27

 BODY:
It may not be Lexington and Concord or the siege of the Bastille. But on Tuesday, the freshman Democratic rebels in Congress will make their first frontal assault against perks and pork.
At stake is nothing less than the hundreds of free parking spaces at National Airport. 
 The House bank scandal and the growing perception that lawmakers were spoiled by privileges like subsidized meals and haircuts helped produce the largest Congressional turnover in modern times and the expectation of a revolution. In the past few weeks, the 64 Democratic House freshmen have been caucusing feverishly, trying to put together a package of changes they will propose for enactment by the whole House.
If the most rebellious backbenchers get their way, lobbyists, political action committees and dictatorial committee chairmen will be condemned to the dust bin of history.
 
Small Perks at Risk
 But because of divisions in the newcomers' ranks, and the resentment of their elders, little is likely to be swept away beyond such picayune perks as personal use of frequent flier mileage acquired on official trips.
"Reform is one thing," said Representative Jolene Unsoeld, a three-term Democrat from Washington state, "but that doesn't mean you have to take a machine gun and mow it all down."
One proposal on the table would reduce to $50 the $250 annual cap on gifts lawmakers can accept. Another would require stricter accounting on the expenses of lobbyists. And a third would replace the current House schedule, typically a three-day work week, with three five-day work weeks followed by a week off.
Senior members are not exactly trembling, but they are expressing concern. In a meeting with freshman leaders this week, Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington requested that if they must attack the privilege of House members to park at National Airport, they should remember that members of the Senate and Supreme Court get free spots, too.
"The sense was if you take us down, take them all down," said a freshman member who spoke on condition of anonymity.
 
Happy to Get Along
 Actually, most Democratic freshmen have been firing less threatening weaponry. Many fear they could divert momentum away from the Clinton economic program, and several are happy to get along and go along with the leadership.
"It's going to be difficult to reach consensus," said Luis V. Gutierrez of Illinois, a freshman Democrat calling for radical reform. "I will pray, I will keep my fingers crossed, but I will not hold my breath."
To this point, the Democrats have mostly left the heavy lifting to their 47 Republican freshman colleagues. The backbench Republicans have served as the vanguard to cut Congressional spending and extinguish four select committees that do not legislate. Within their party caucus, the Republicans managed to persuade their elders to accept their demand to set term limits for committee ranking members. In an effort to kill pork-barrel politics, they are calling on the House to abolish the Appropriations Committee.
On Thursday, the Republican freshmen held a news conference to demand that Attorney General Janet Reno revoke her request that the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia, Jay Stephens, resign along with all other incumbent United States Attorneys. They were taking a cut at Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, who is under investigation by Mr. Stephens.
 
Wants to Clear Air
 "Most of us campaigned to clean up the barn," Representative Bill Baker, a Republican freshman from California, told reporters. "Let's clear the air around Congress."
The Democratic freshmen, many of them experienced in state or city government, generally speak of the institution with more respect. Still, some have also made waves. Representatives Gutierrez and Eric D. Fingerhut of Ohio introduced legislation to freeze member salaries next year, a proposal the leadership quickly embraced as their own and enacted.
Representative Carrie Meek of Florida, the daughter of sharecroppers, and a handful of other black women freshmen, have been raising eyebrows among their elders in the Congressional Black Caucus by meeting themselves to plan revitalizing the mostly moribund group.
 
'A Gardening Exercise'
 Representative Karen Shepherd of Utah, a co-chairwoman of the Democratic freshman task force that is drafting the package, compared her work to "a gardening exercise" of weeding out arcane procedures and wasteful perks. Her pet peeve is the way the House schedules its time, with the constant interruptions of committee hearings and meetings with staff and constituents by repetitive and essentially meaningless votes on procedures. "It's like a floating craps game," she said.
But Ms. Shepherd and other reformers are meeting heavy resistance within their own ranks. Minority members tend to defend the seniority system, as do members from heavily Democratic districts, because they feel they have a chance of becoming chairmen themselves someday. And while most women members are strong advocates for campaign finance reform, most want to protect Emily's List, an organization that helps finance the campaigns of women candidates from new restrictions on political action committees.
Like several minority members of the class, Representative Alcee L. Hastings, a freshman Florida Democrat, views the reform movement with suspicion. "Parking is not a perk," he said. "It's a necessity. I have six of the best minds in America crowded into a cubbyhole that is called an office, and America is led to believe that I'm up here living in the lap of luxury."
The class radicals are still pushing, but they are beginning to see that they are probably on the losing side of the revolution. Reflecting their growing frustration, a caucus meeting of a few of the rowdier freshmen last week deteriorated into talk of taking the law into their own hands: one suggested tearing up the brass railings from the chamber's grand staircases and replacing the marble floors with asbestos to poison royalists. (Conspirators would not reveal the name of the hothead.)

HEADLINE: Making the Easy Military Cuts

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27

 BODY:
In unveiling its proposed military budget for 1994, the Pentagon has adopted a holding pattern.
The $263 billion spending request announced by Defense Secretary Les Aspin today did not cancel any major arms programs. Nor does it require any fundamental restructuring. Many spending cuts in the proposed budget have been achieved by accelerating reductions that the Bush Administration had planned for later years. 
 Mr. Aspin acknowledged as much today when he told reporters at a Pentagon briefing that the spending plan was "a holding budget" pending a comprehensive Administration review of military requirements.
"This is a cautious budget on the weapons side -- very cautious," said Mr. Aspin, who added that the Defense Department was essentially "treading water" on buying weapons and research and development.
 
What Direction Next?
 The main question is not so much how the 1994 budget will be received by Congress but where the Pentagon will go from here in refashioning the American military.
Clearly, the proposed 1994 budget is but a small down payment on much greater cuts to come. Even before the election, the Bush Administration was planning to reduce American military spending. The proposed 1994 budget cuts the 1993 spending authority by $10 billion, and the Clinton Administration is planning to cut an additional $88 billion from what the Bush Administration proposed in spending reductions from 1994 through fiscal 1997.
According to current Administration plans, the military budget would drop to $246 billion in 1997 from $273 billion in 1993. Those totals include Pentagon spending authority as well as Energy Department money for developing and handling nuclear weapons.
But though it is a given that the military will shrink, the Clinton Administration is just beginning to grapple with the issue of what it will look like after the reductions are made and what that will mean for the country's international military image.
 
Awaiting Full Review
 In his Pentagon briefing today, Mr. Aspin stressed that the Clinton Administration needed a chance to conduct a comprehensive survey of military needs, an assessment the Pentagon has called the "bottom up review."
The review, which is to be completed by late summer, will consider issues like duplication among the services.
A crucial issue to be settled, Mr. Aspin said today, is how many regional conflicts the United States military needs to be prepared to fight at the same time.
The possibility of simultaneous American military action in trouble spots around the world is not an abstract consideration: the regime of Saddam Hussein is a continual thorn in the side of Washington; there is a possibility of peacekeeping operations in Bosnia; American troops are still in Somalia, and North Korea has decided to withdraw from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty.
Mr. Aspin underscored this point today, noting that with the breakup of the Soviet Union, judgments about regional dangers are what "really shapes and sizes the defense budget."
 
Budget as Driving Force
 Mr. Aspin did not provide any clues today of how the issue might be resolved, saying it would reflect a political assessment by the Administration about trouble spots around the world.
But though the Pentagon has sought to portray the "bottom up review" as one that will be driven by an evaluation of threats around the world, it seems clear that it will also be circumscribed by the budgetary decisions already made.
When President Clinton decided in advance how much money should be cut from the military budget over the next four years, the number of regional wars the Administration thinks the United States military should be able to fight at once may simply be the number the White House decides it can afford to fight.
However the Administration resolves the question of regional conflicts, the review promises to be a contentious process for the military services.
According to the 1994 spending plan, the number of Navy carriers will drop from 14 to 12, but one carrier being eliminated was for training. The number of active Army divisions is to be cut to 12 from 14. The number of Air Force active and reserve fighter wings is to be reduced to 24 from 28.
 
Spending on Training
 But the budget proposal includes a high rate of spending for maintenance and training, including flying time for pilots and steaming time for ships at sea.
"What we are proposing now did not cause any real gnashing of teeth," a senior military official said. "The real fight will come when we try to decide what to do from 1995 to 1999."
By keeping weapon production lines open, the 1994 budget also cushions the economic impact of President Clinton's plan to shift resources from the military to domestic programs, if only for the time being.
Even with many important decisions on hold, the 1994 budget does signal some new points of departure.
The "Star Wars" program has been changed, downgrading space-based defense of the United States while stepping up systems to defend against missile strikes on airfields and troops overseas. And for the first time, a small amount of money has been earmarked for peacekeeping operations as well as efforts to restrain the spread of weapons of mass destruction.
Taking note of these programs, Mr. Aspin proudly proclaimed the 1994 budget "the first truly post-cold-war budget." But military officials and experts on Capitol Hill agree that the toughest decisions lie ahead.

HEADLINE: Mississippi Campaign Reflects the Rights Struggle

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VICKSBURG, Miss., March 26

 BODY:
The special election here next week to fill a vacant Congressional seat has attracted a bevy of Democratic candidates who seem to symbolize the stages and philosophies of three decades of black political evolution in Mississippi.
But three white candidates are also in the eight-way race, and they are emblematic of both the longstanding racial tension within the state's Democratic Party and of the vigorous Republican Party, which has wrested important elected offices away from the Democrats in the last decade. 
 The voting on Tuesday is to fill the seat that opened when Mike Espy was appointed Secretary of Agriculture. Mr. Espy had held the seat since 1986, when he became the first black member of Congress from Mississippi since Reconstruction.
Because so many threads of the state's recent political history are intertwined in this contest, it has become highly volatile, local analysts say, and there is even a possibility that one of the whites might end up representing the state's only Congressional district with a black majority.
 
Runoff Is Expected
 Leslie McLemore, a political scientist at Jackson State University, said it was unlikely that any candidate would win an outright majority. A runoff, if needed, will be held April 13, and Mr. McLemore said he expected it would pit a black Democrat against one of the white candidates. In neither election will the ballot give party labels.
"And because of the animosity generated by this campaign among many on the Democratic side," Mr. McLemore said, "I don't see those finishing lower being enthusiastic about throwing their support behind the black Democrat who does make the runoff."
Although 58 percent of the voting-age population is black, the district has a history of low black voter turnout, he said. That suggests the possibility that Mississippi, with a 35 percent black population over all, could end up with all five of its Representatives white.
The Second Congressional District hugs the Mississippi River and its fertile flood plain for more than 200 miles, encompassing all or part of 24 rural counties, where there is a contrast of wealth and poverty that seems frozen in time from the days when local plantations were worked by slaves and cotton was king. It is one of the poorest Congressional districts in the nation.
 
Time for Victory
 Mr. Espy's 1986 victory came after the Justice Department supervised the redrawing of the district lines and increased the number of black voters in the district, and after another black candidate had, in two unsuccessful runs, helped to build black registration and confidence. After Mr. Espy won, he began reaching out as much to the white landowners and agricultural businesses in the district as he did to the largely poor black majority.
At times he was accused of deserting his core of support, but others applauded him as a coalition builder and an example of the nonracial politics that was needed to improve the state's economy and unify the Democratic Party. While he rarely got more than 20 percent of the white vote in the district, that alone was a significant breakthrough, said Ed Cole, the state's Democratic chairman.
The race to succeed Mr. Espy has attracted, for one, his older brother, Mayor Henry Espy of Clarksdale, who is president of the National Conference of Black Mayors. He is unabashedly running as the brother of the Agriculture Secretary and as someone who has a pipeline to the White House. He campaigns with the same reassuring, coalition-building tones that his brother favored, but the main thrust of his campaign is his connections.
 
Washington Tools
 "A state Mississippi's size with just five Congressmen needs all of the clout it can get," said the 50-year-old Mr. Espy. "My motto is, 'He who has the tools, let him use them.' "
The race has also attracted some names identified with the state's civil rights past, when coalition-building among blacks and whites was rare. There is James H. Meredith, 59, who integrated the University of Mississippi in 1962 but who is not given much chance of winning. There is also Unita Blackwell, the 59-year-old Mayor of tiny Mayersville for 26 years, who is a veteran of civil rights and voting rights drives.
Although Ms. Blackwell is an inspirational figure who is well known nationally, she is not considered politically strong in the district. Still, she has financial backing from Emily's List, which aids female candidates nationally, and her commercials feature the voice of the actor James Earl Jones.
Also running is Bennie Thompson, a 44-year-old Hinds County Supervisor, who is associated with yet another era in the state's political evolution: the effort to consolidate black political power in the years after the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Mr. Thompson, a former Mayor of Bolton, helped organize the state's first association of black mayors and later its first association of black county supervisors. .
 
Past Battles Recalled
 Mr. Thompson has tapped into his background of organization and activism to win support among Democrats in the district, but some people, particularly whites, say his history has made him a reminder of bitter black versus white battles over the years.
"Bennie Thompson is confrontational," said Stephen Golding, a white Vicksburg businessman who held a fund-raising event one night this week for Henry Espy at one of the city's antebellum mansions. "Henry Espy is more of a moderate, more appealing."
The other black candidate is Brian H. Neely, a 32-year-old Democrat and lawyer from Greenville who has not run for elected office before.
Two white Democrats are running. One of them, Dr. Steve Richardson, a 52-year-old Grenada dentist, is broadcasting commercials that show him in his white smock, holding a clump of just-picked cotton and saying, "I want to be your cotton-picking Congressman." The other, State Representative David M. Halbrook, 65, is a 20-year veteran of the State Legislature from Belzoni.
Neither is considered a strong candidate, but their presence on the ballot could draw votes from the remaining white in the race, and the sole Republican, Hayes Dent, a 31-year-old aide to Gov. Kirk Fordice.
 
Unruly Democrats
 Mr. Dent won the right to represent his party in an elimination caucus.
But disputes arose at a similar Democratic caucus, with some of the contenders withdrawing their pledge to support the caucus selection, so that party's field was not narrowed.
Critics of Mr. Dent say he has little in his favor beyond being the sole Republican and the recipient of about $300,000 in contributions, money that might prove crucial in a contest that will turn on how many people vote. In that sense, Mr. Dent said, his main competition is Mr. Thompson, with his extensive contacts and organization.
Mr. Dent does not buy the argument that the Second District should be represented by a black. The real issue, he said, was getting people to work together, "and I don't think it matters whether you are black or white to do that."

HEADLINE: The Architecture of Those Called Homeless

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

 BODY:
Pepe Otero's place evolved slowly, as so many building projects do.
It began as a rudimentary shell made from skids, the wood platforms used for delivery of heavy goods that have become the makeshift building blocks of the street. Time passed. And in a grim symbol of the seeming permanence of his situation, Mr. Otero's shell grew. 
 Mr. Otero's quarters, in one of Manhattan's poorest neighborhoods, represents a kind of architecture of the dispossessed in New York City. Tucked into the city's most forlorn corners and tenuously echoing a remembered idea of home, these illegal structures are inadequate, but increasingly elaborate, self-made alternatives to the city's shelter system.
For thousands of people living on the streets, such fragile dwellings, now being chronicled in museum exhibitions, are a last-ditch effort to carve out a precious, brittle piece of privacy on inhospitable urban turf.
 
A Shadow of a Home
 Like those of his dozen or so neighbors on a formerly vacant lot on the Lower East Side, Mr. Otero's shell has taken on the illusion of home. White bedposts and perforated orange bread crates form an entrance gate; plexiglass and refrigerator shelving set into diamond-shaped frames form windows. Mr. Otero, who is admired locally for his handiwork, has even built a marquesina, or portico, over the front walk.
"I had plenty of time," Mr. Otero, 67, explained recently, sitting in a small room filled with the smell of kerosene that he was burning against the cold. "I had to live someplace."
No one knows their numbers, which fluctuate with the thermometer, night by night and day by day. But in cities across the country, the growing ranks of homeless people and the overburdening of shelter systems have resulted in an increasing number of street builders like Mr. Otero.
They are among New York City's most vulnerable citizens. The weather this winter has been particularly grueling for those trying to build precarious dwellings in the city's shadow places: beneath highways, on piers, amid garbage in vacant lots.
The resemblances to home are superficial, bitterly so. Mr. Otero is living in conditions commonly associated with third-world countries. He has no plumbing or heating. He bathes in a pail of water hauled from a nearby fire hydrant and heated over a gas burner. His toilet is a white plastic bucket lined with a garbage bag, tucked inconspicuously into a corner and emptied twice a day.
 
The Metaphors
'The Architecture Of Despair'
 Margaret Morton, a New York photographer and an associate professor at the Cooper Union School of Art who has spent three and a half years documenting these structures, including Mr. Otero's, said they represented "the architecture of despair." To her, they reflect "the profound need to create a sense of home, no matter how extreme the circumstances."
Advocates for the homeless say the numbers of such shanties are growing nationally, a physical reflection, like the Hoovervilles of the 1930's, of an intractable social problem.
Mary Brosnahan, the executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless in New York City, said that of the 90,000 people her organization estimates to be homeless in the city, about 15,000 have rigged makeshift structures for themselves.
The street builders of New York City, she said, are fiercely independent and overwhelmingly male. "They are the ones who have a working knowledge of building," she said. "They are also familiar with the laws of the street and can protect their areas from predators."
To John Michael Vlach, the chairman of the American studies department at George Washington University, such bleak icons of domesticity have come to make up a "landscape of the powerless." But he said the transformation of anonymous, often harrowing urban spaces into personal ones, with no resources and against all odds, was a form of self-empowerment that went beyond basic survival.
"People make spaces to maintain their sanity," he said, "no matter where they are."
 
The Building Process
Found Objects, Fond Memories
 "This is not a house," said Thomas Davis, who lives under the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive along the East River in a plywood frame insulated with cardboard, to which he has meticulously added a mailbox, a roped-off deck, a fish-shaped wind gauge and -- most notably -- wheels.
"It's a refuge from the elements," he said. "A shack. A box."
Creating a street structure is "a survival situation," Mr. Davis said, adding, "You improvise."
One day, he said, he was taking apart automobile parts when he noticed the radiator fan and thought, "Maybe I could use this for something." Mr. Davis remembered a whirligig he had seen as a child in a springtime flower bed. "The wings would be moving," he recalled.
The sight of blimps floating above the East River and people fishing in summertime gave him the idea of building a "flying fish in the wind."
To the uninitiated, who often view them from moving vehicles, structures like Mr. Davis's don't look like living quarters. "They are looked on as a dump spot, an eyesore," Douglas Anderson, 32, said one frigid morning, as embers from the skids he was burning for warmth in an oil drum turned to ash in the wind. "But if you saw this place up close, you would see it's a home, with a personal touch."
 
Repelling Rain and Rats
 It took him more than two months and "nails, hammers and manpower" to put up his structure, a plywood frame with a pitched roof covered by a tarp "so the rain runs right off." The bottom is lined with scavenged Formica panels, prized by street builders because they repel rats and water. He arranged an outdoor sitting area out of weatherworn office chairs found in trash bins, tacking a faded Oriental rug to the wall behind them.
"You should try to think you're living indoors as much as you can," he said. "If you've got to live out here, you want it to be comfortable, to do the best you can. If you wander around thinking, 'My God, I'm homeless,' you're finished."
Maria Foscarinis, the director of the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty in Washington, said the structures were growing in number as homelessness increased nationally. "Homeless people are relying on their own resourcefulness to address a problem that is not being adequately addressed by society," she said. "These are measures intended to be temporary that are now becoming permanent."
 
The Chroniclers
What Academics And Cameras See
 A palpable yearning for permanence pervades both the structures and Ms. Morton's photographs of them, which are the subject of exhibitions at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in Manhattan and the NAME Gallery in Chicago, as well as "Transitory Gardens," a book that Ms. Morton wrote with Diana Balmori, a landscape historian; it is to be published this year by Yale University Press.
Ms. Morton noted that the structures, which their builders often refer to as "my place," tend to change seasonally and are continually being improved, sometimes to reflect the homelands of those who live in them.
Mr. Otero, for example, came to New York from Puerto Rico to seek employment as a typesetter and wound up with a job fixing lamps. Unable to make ends meet, he gave up his rented room and moved to Tompkins Square Park in early 1990, preferring his own shelter to one with a squalid shared bathroom.
That summer, Mr. Otero began building his structure in a nearby settlement that is known by its occupants as "Bushville," erecting an umbrella for shade and adding an open porch with a turquoise-and-white striped canopy. In November of the next year, he enclosed the porch. Last spring, he began extending the roof. His construction ideas come "from here," he said, pointing to his head.
Over time, encampments like Bushville, with its public walkways lined with skids and touches of ornament, form "unknown cities within the city," in the words of Richard Sennett, a professor of humanities at New York University. "The foundation of self-respect in our society is not having cash, but a place to live," he said, adding that the structures "are inexpressibly sad symbols of the way society has abandoned them."
 
The Government View
There's No Code For Wiring Shacks
 A piece of plywood tacked with cardboard, or a frayed strip of carpet placed outside to define a front yard, is homelessness made visible. "This isn't housing," said Marsha Martin, the director of the Mayor's Office on Homelessness and Single Room Occupancy Housing Services. "There is no standard to evaluate a Sterno can in a cardboard box."
Michael Kharfen, head of the Mayor's Community Assistance Unit, said many street builders represented the "hard-core homeless population" of New York City. Many are drug or alcohol abusers, he added. The city's concern over the encampments, the target of periodic removals, or "sweeps," has focused on health and safety issues, he said, particularly the use of kerosene and other flammable materials to generate heat.
The encampments typically exist on marginal property on the periphery of the urban mainstream. Ms. Martin pointed out that in a legal sense, the structures are not buildings and are thus not monitored by the City Building Department. If a safety or health or sanitation concern arises, or if threatening conduct occurs in the street, the city will consider intervention case by case, she said.
Since Ms. Morton began photographing the structures, five of her subjects have died. One, Yi Poi Lee, was killed. Mr. Lee, who lived in a hut bound together by yellow cloth tied in knots -- no nails were used -- died last spring when arsonists set fire to "The Hill," an encampment at the foot of the Manhattan Bridge in Chinatown. So he would not be buried in Potter's Field, Ms. Morton and a colleague organized the funeral.
 
The Quest for a Haven
Ever So Humble, But It's Private
 Security is a big concern among street builders. A reason commonly cited by homeless people for rejecting the city's shelter system is a lack of security. Settlements like Mr. Otero's, ad hoc though they be, are arranged to foster security, often with a "day watchman" standing guard.
But the big reason people build may be more compelling. However fragile, the presence of four walls "affords them the same security and sense of privacy that our homes afford us," Ms. Brosnahan said.
"It's a place to cook, a place where friends can visit and lovers can stay overnight," she said. "It is a rejection of the institution of the shelters, where your soul is checked at the door."
She added that the structures held a message for those planning future housing for the homeless. "At the bare minimum," she said, "we're talking about a small, secure room with a door that locks."
 
The Worldwide Problem
 Amos Rapoport, a professor of architecture at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, said "spontaneous settlements" built by homeless people, like Bushville in New York and the Mud Flats in Miami, suggest the "no-tech" shanty settlements throughout the third world: the hillside favelas of Rio de Janeiro, the villas miserias of Argentina, the barrios clandestinos of Colombia, the gecekondus of Ankara, Turkey, and the bamboo riverside huts near the mouth of the Ganges in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
Such settlements, whose hallmarks are often bits of flattened cardboard and corrugated metal roofs weighed down by rocks, have resulted largely from the rural displacement and rapid urbanization that followed World War II, he said.
Among all displaced builders, "the sense of control is important," he said, adding: "Even if conditions are worse than a city shelter, they have still made choices regarding their environment."
 
The Implacable Weather
 In the northeaster in December, Mr. Anderson was trapped inside his structure and had to break through a wall to escape flooding. Most of his belongings were swept away. He briefly went to a shelter, but, he said, "I didn't feel comfortable with it: too many different personalities."
He said with some pride that the northeaster had not destroyed the structure itself, unlike "those houses in New Jersey" that appeared on the news. Still, nature's wrath took a toll. "If you could have seen this place before that, you would have liked what you saw," he said. "There were no cracks. All this wood was meshed together. It was looking real good."
Mr. Anderson said he grew up in East New York, Brooklyn. The house he lived in as a young child burned down. The things he remembers most about it are the long kitchen table, where the family could be together, and the fact that to enter, "you stuck a key in the door."
He is now unemployed, and he vacated the $120-a-week room he had rented with money from a temporary job, because of "the overhead."
 
Across a Street, Out of Reach
 He is realistic about his present living situation. "That," he said, pointing to a brick apartment building across the street, "is definitely better than this. Everyone should have some decent roof overhead. We're all entitled to that."
He sometimes thinks about what a real house would be like. "At night, you'd see the stars," he said, "and during the day, the light would just flood the room."
But he feels good about the structure he built, which he considers a "launch point."
"Everything we needed, we solved," he said of the community that he and his neighbors have built and that Ms. Morton has recorded. He is proud of Mr. Davis and his flying fish. "We call his place Little House on the Prairie," Mr. Anderson said. "He's so good you can't walk past his place without saying, 'Wow!' "
"You know something?" he continued, pressed about his own dwelling. "It took character to build that. A lot of feeling went into it. Building it shaped my attitude. You realize you can do things for yourself. People who build for themselves have an interest in themselves. As long as you don't forget, you're not forgotten."
Mr. Anderson knows what a home is. "A home," he said, "is the idea of who you are."

HEADLINE: Heavy Turnout in Bridgeport for a Casino's 'Job Fair'

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, March 27

 BODY:
Hundreds of unemployed workers flocked to an all-day "job fair" in Connecticut's largest and poorest city today to find out about a campaign by Mirage Resorts, which is trying to gain support to build casinos in Bridgeport and Hartford.
More than 1,000 people entered the Cardinal Sheehan Center on Main Street within the first hour, and more than 5,000 were expected by the end of the day. 
 Two large television screens were set up at the fair, with public relations videos depicting the success of Mirage in Las Vegas and describing how it might work here. Forty Mirage employees walked around with buttons that read, "Ask Me About Jobs and We Will Help Train You."
Most job-seekers appeared to leave the event today strongly supporting the construction of casinos and said they would be asking their legislators to push for approval. Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. has opposed further expansion of gambling in the state and has promised to veto any bill approved by the Legislature because he believes it would cause social harm.
But those at the job fair said the Governor should reconsider. "Is he going to give me a job?" asked Kenneth Pellicci, a 44-year-old unemployed construction worker from Trumbull with a wife and three children. "If not then I think he should look at this again. I think this is a fantastic idea, it's the first time in months that I have any hope there may be a job for me."
Mr. Pellicci said he hasn't had any luck finding a permanent job since the Bridgeport construction company where he worked for 10 years went out of business two years ago.
Denne Epps, a 38-year-old mother of three, said she's been on welfare for more than 10 years and went to the job fair because she was desperate. "I need a job real bad," she said, "but there's no jobs in Bridgeport at all. I think this could be good for a lot of people like me who have been out of work a long time."
Luis Gomez, a 36-year-old Bridgeport restaurant worker, said he went to the job fair because he has been without a job for six months and that has taken a big toll on his wife and three children.
What Mirage is promising to do is create 22,000 jobs in Connecticut by investing $350 million in what it calls urban entertainment centers, which would include casinos, hotels, restaurants, movie theaters, bowling alleys, skating rinks and convention centers.
"If you asked me about this six months ago I would have said it was doubtful we would ever be supporting this kind of proposal," said Paul S. Timpanelli, president and chief executive officer of the Bridgeport Regional Business Council, which represents more than 1,300 businesses.

HEADLINE: Pollution Costs Torment a Town Already Reeling

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: THOMASTON, Conn.

 BODY:
It is not enough that the old mills along the Naugatuck River here are fading, and that unemployment in this Litchfield County town stands at 14.1 percent, the highest in Connecticut.
No, amid hard times, a raft of environmental problems have come along. Sewerage. Landfills. Even the water supply. It sometimes feels as if Thomaston is wearing out. 
 "You just don't know how much more of this a town can take," said Michael D. Rybak, the town's lawyer. "And you're going to have these problems. The town is probably a minefield of environmental problems if you want to go drilling over every square foot of it."
For residents, the recession is the greatest concern, the one they cannot help thinking and worrying about. But the other problems, they know, all translate into money, and they wonder where the state agencies that enforce environmental laws think Thomaston will get the money.
"They're more worried about paying for it," Brian Dayton, co-owner of Red's Hardware, said of residents' concerns. "The state mandates all these things, and then it doesn't help the town out."
 
Waiting in Line for Help
 The First Selectman, Eugene McMahon, has asked the state for help, putting his town of 7,000 people, a slice of apple-pie America with an opera house dominating Main Street, in line for aid behind better-known distressed cities like Bridgeport.
But he knows how Thomaston is likely to get the money to fix its environmental problems: by borrowing. "I don't want the town living on plastic for the next 25 years, but I don't know any other way around it," he said.
Water is the common element here, fittingly enough for a mill town that owes its life to the river rushing through it. The clockmaker Seth Thomas built a factory on the banks of the Naugatuck in 1813, and over the years more mills and a growing town crowded into the narrow, pretty valley.
Almost everything essential to Thomaston could be found by the river: the old brass mills and the new tool-and-die shops that employed residents, and the town dump and sewage-treatment plant that cleaned up after them. For decades the Naugatuck was an industrial sewer.
 
Cleaning Up the River
 The state, enforcing the Clean Water Act, now insists that Thomaston and other towns upgrade their sewage-treatment plants. The goal: reopening the river to fishing and swimming. Thomaston's cost: $14 million, or $2,000 a person.
In 1983, also at the state's urging, Thomaston closed its landfill and took its garbage to state-approved ones in Beacon Falls and Naugatuck. A few years later the state closed those, saying they were polluting the river.
Now big corporations, including Uniroyal Chemical and B. F. Goodrich, are suing Thomaston and other towns to help them pay for the $70 million Superfund cleanup of the landfills.
Then last November, the Connecticut Water Company shut down its three wells in Thomaston. The wells, which serve most of the town, were threatened with contamination from gasoline, the company said. The source: fuel tanks at the town garage.
The water company said it planned to recover its costs, including $1,000 a day to buy replacement water, from the polluter. It estimated the potential cost at $2.5 million.
 
'All Coming Down on Us'
 "It just seems to be all coming down on us at once here," Mr. McMahon said.
Bad luck plays a part. Thomaston officials say the leaking gasoline came not from the town's tanks, but from earlier tanks owned by a fuel vendor. In other cases, they say the town is being penalized for following the state's rules. Thomaston did what the state told it to do about its landfill, and is now stuck in a Superfund lawsuit.
Town officials support cleaning up the Naugatuck River, but right next to their sewage-treatment plant is a hazardous-waste processing company, Envirite, that was brought to Thomaston by state officials.
Before Envirite shut down, its activities ensnared the town's plant in Federal regulations, polluted its land and cost it $429,000 in legal and consultant fees and other expenses.
Douglas Cutler, an under secretary in the State Office of Policy and Management, is arranging a meeting between officials from Thomaston and the state's Department of Environmental Protection.
 
'All These Other Things'
 A former first selectman, Mr. Cutler says he has never seen such an array of environmental problems facing a single small town. And then there are the town's economic problems. "Everyone knows about the Superfund case," he said, "but here they have all these other things."
Two factories closed last year, and Plume & Atwood, a mill founded by Seth Thomas in 1852, has laid off most of its workers.
"I remember when we first opened, that mill was going three shifts," said Cathy Russ, whose family has owned the Vi-Arms Restaurant on Main Street since 1963.
Now, she said, "You work in the bar, and every day someone will come in and say, 'Well, I just got laid off,' or 'I just closed my shop,' or 'I've got two more unemployment checks left.' It's so disheartening. They look and they look and there's nothing there."
Thomaston natives like Mr. McMahon vow that these hard times will pass as employers discover the attractions of a small town with skilled workers who hold to small-town virtues. They point to the old clock factory on South Main Street, nearly empty in the mid-1980's, now filled with small businesses from metal finishers to antiques shops.
 
Watching How Money Is Spent
 Meanwhile, every dollar counts, and in small towns the people whose property taxes provide those dollars can easily see how they are spent. Mr. Rybak regrets the legal fees -- the Superfund suit has cost $54,000 for lawyers so far, including $33,000 for a specialist in Washington -- but other things stir resentment, too.
In February, three students embarrassed Thomaston by breaking into the high school to steal a test. Besides the bad publicity, some residents resent having to spend $3,000 to repair and change the school's locks.
Teachers are also suspect. The state's mandates and binding-arbitration system have raised their salaries, making them an economic elite in blue-collar towns like Thomaston. Factory workers who might get two weeks of vacation, if they had a job, can't help matching the teachers' $50,000 salaries against the 180-day school year.
"There's a lot of stress," said Henry S. Osowiecki Jr., a building contractor whose work force stands at 6, down from 24 a few years ago. "Not only do we feel it," he said, "but we can see it, we read it, and now we can taste it."

HEADLINE: N.C.A.A. TOURNAMENT: WEST;
Chaney Looks Just Horrible, He Feels Worse, but Loves It

BYLINE: By TOM FRIEND, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, March 27

 BODY:
John Chaney's larynx is so overused, his voice is alternately hoarse and soprano. But not even the din of a large Kingdome crowd can drown him out.
Late Friday night against Vanderbilt here, the knot on Chaney's tie was loosened to midchest, the pants around his waist needed hitching or a tighter belt and his Temple Owls were skittishly ahead, 62-59, with 14.1 seconds left. 
 A Temple freshman center, Derrick Battie, had two free throws coming and, inconveniently, the power to alter Chaney's life. Chaney had two choices: hoarse or soprano.
"Of course I yelled at the kid before he took the shots," Chaney said later, with big eyes. "I was screaming at him, 'Time to grow up. Time to grow up.' "
 
Curtain Call for Cosby
 Battie's free throws dropped, Temple won by 67-59, and Chaney is now one victory from reaching his first National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament Final Four. The same disheveled necktie he wore Friday night he will wear again Sunday for the West Regional Final against No. 1 seeded Michigan -- "Superstitious, buddy," he said -- and he will bring alumnus Bill Cosby again, too.
Chaney and Cosby are predictably the team's two role models. Chaney wakes up his players each morning for practice at 5 o'clock, ushers the underachieving ones to class, calls referees "the law" and is living proof that a one-time bow-tied, cafeteria bus boy -- whose Jacksonville, Fla., home would flood after only an hour of rain -- can amount to something. Cosby has an equivalent story, publicized 10 times over, though Cosby admiringly returns to North Philadelphia and relates it to the team personally.
Cosby insists that Owl players call him "Bill," and he flew in for Friday's game wearing an "Owl Club" blazer and cherry-colored alumni suspenders.
 
'A Boy's Man'
 "I went to that school," Cosby said late Friday night, "and we're more about Philadelphia than most schools there. We have people who are lower, middle economic, but not lower education or lower intelligence. We're on the subway train to take clases, and we have cab drivers taking classes. We have people who already have jobs at what they're getting their degrees in.
"And that John Chaney, he is a boy's man. For many of these kids, coming into college is a real shock to their system. They need a disciplinarian, and that's why John'll practice at 6 in the morning. The first thing they see is their father -- the boy's man."
If Chaney, now 60, likes you, he will chastise you. At today's news conference, he called two of his starters -- forward Aaron McKie and guard Rick Brunson -- "the worst defensive players I've ever had" to their faces. It was only a half-serious jab, but also meant to galvanize them subtly for Sunday.
Chaney has been destitute enough that he can relate to the plights of his players. His two premier scorers on this year's team, McKie and Eddie Jones, were Proposition 48 casualties: ineligible as freshman because they did not maintain 2.0 grade point averages and score 700 on their Scholastic Aptitude Tests. Each scrounged up loans to pay for their initial year of school, and Jones said today, "Aaron and I sat in the stands for their N.C.A.A. tournament game that year against Georgia Tech, and almost cried. We at least wanted to be on the bench."
 
Sometimes Under Scrutiny
 Chaney accepts Proposition 48 players for the sake of giving them an ample chance in life. On the down side, he is scrutinized for it, and often maligned -- as when senior center Frazier Johnson flunked off the team in January or when freshman William Cunningham was arrested for an alleged carjacking incident in October. He still plays while awaiting a May trial.
In that sense, this team's ascension is gratifying to Chaney. Temple, on Feb. 7, was lambasted at home by Wake Forest, 106-69, and its record was once a mundane 10-10. Chaney gives away his neckties after defeats -- one Philadelphia writer now owns five of them -- and the Owls' losing streak had Chaney running daily to the store to buy new, striped ones. Moreover, senior guard Vic Carstarphen was out with a broken leg, which meant Temple's top nine players were two juniors, Jones and McKie, sophomore Brunson and six freshmen.
But Chaney did not put restraints on his offense and who ordered up a hyper, matchup zone on defense. The Owls won 10 of their last 12 games, and Jones, who notched 26 points against Vanderbilt, is improved and unafraid of Michigan's sneering Chris Webber. "The two teams I wouldn't want to play is Princeton and Temple," Webber said, wary of Chaney's so-called "amoeba" defense.
Webber also said today the Wolverines -- who defeated Temple by 7 in last year's N.C.A.A. tournament first round -- "looked like a bunch of junior high school kids the other night" against George Washington. Michigan, unless it upgrades, might well be vulnerable Sunday.
"I gave my Temple guys a good line tonight," Cosby said Friday."I said, "A wolverine has to come out of a hole. But an owl sits in a tree waitin' for them.' They liked that."

A Test You're Apt to Flunk

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN

 BODY:
Here's a quiz for industrial policy buffs: Which of the following products and production processes discovered in the last 35 years produced the biggest economic gains?
A computer control system? An electronic device for using videotape? A new type of primary metal? A process for producing aromatic chemicals? A new stain remover? A household cleaning device? A new type of thread? 
 If you picked the high-tech innovations -- computers, electronics and science-intensive production processes -- you are fashionably wrong. The right answer, according to Prof. Edwin Mansfield of the University of Pennsylvania, is low-tech: new thread and stain removers. By driving down prices of consumer goods, these innovations raised living standards for millions of Americans.
Dr. Mansfield's research serves as a sober warning to industrial policy enthusiasts, including President Clinton. Who sitting in Washington circa 1960 would have had the foresight, and guts, to propose spending taxpayer money to discover a better thread for sewing kids' jeans?
Mr. Clinton is on safe ground when he proposes across-the-board subsidies for research and development. Studies by Dr. Mansfield and others show that such investments -- by raising workplace productivity -- often throw off big gains to society. The trickier question is whether Washington ought to target specific industries or projects.
At the core of industrial policy proposals is the idea that there are investments that produce huge benefits for society but aren't undertaken because they generate only meager profit for the private investor. This happens, for example, when investors discover a product that is easily imitated; the initial investor reaps little profit even though the product proves to be a smashing success with consumers. If the Government could predict these cases, it could provide subsidies -- tipping the entrepreneur toward undertaking the investment.
But, as Dr. Mansfield's research suggests, there's little reason to believe Washington will be able to make accurate predictions. The high-tech investments in computer control systems and machine tool production did well; but investments in mundane consumer products did much better -- raising annual output in the overall economy by as much as three times the size of the original investment.
Mr. Clinton's idea that jump-starting high-tech investments will reverse the productivity slowdown is unproven. But it need not be discarded. What if Washington created a small fund -- perhaps a few billion dollars a year -- from which would-be investors could seek help for promising projects too risky for them to undertake on their own?
Sure, much of the money would probably go for naught as Washington picked the wrong projects or the process became corrupted by politics. But there's also a chance that the policy could turn up the next-generation computer chip -- an intoxicating possibility. As long as the program is kept small, it will leave plenty of money in private capital markets to bring Americans most of the 21st-century thread and stain-free clothes they crave.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Japan, Or So It Seems

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
From the aggressiveness of businessmen here, you'd never guess that Japanese politicians and officials have few competitors in the art of being laid-back and hardly worrying about anything, or so it seems.
North Korea, no friend of Tokyo, is building a nuclear bomb. China, Japan's historical nemesis, is booming and will revolutionize Asia's strategic landscape. Russia, a major counterweight to Beijing, is imploding, adding to the specter of a future Chinese colossus. And the Clinton Administration is beating Tokyo over the head about reducing its trade surplus with the U.S. and donating billions in new aid to the Russians. 
 Big matters all, yet most Japanese leaders say that everything is just fine. To them, there's practically no foreign policy crisis that can't be fixed in 5 to 10 years of quiet diplomacy.
The Chinese, so the Japanese tell me, are now great guys and will take care of the North Korean nukes. Bill Clinton is a great guy and will be even greater after he learns about Japan's open markets and grows older. And "Mr. Gelb, you are a great columnist, famous for your knowledge and insight." They also revere my age compared with Mr. Clinton's.
I think the Japanese are great, too. And I tell them I'm planning on moving here to hear more about how much they like my column.
All my conversations with officials in Tokyo were off the record, so I can't share much more inside information.
But since the economy is not off the record, I can inform you that the Japanese are definitely not mellow on that subject. Japan Inc. is in a recession, and the Government is trying to pump-prime it with tax breaks and public works projects, so far without clear success.
If pump-priming peters out, the Japanese might actually do the unthinkable and reform their rotting, stalemated political system. Serious reform isn't likely in this don't-rock-the-boat land. But for the first time since Douglas MacArthur set Japan on the road to democracy, it is possible. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party must be worried about that, and about losing power, but its actions betray no panic. L.D.P. leaders seem to think that if they can get the economy back on track, all will be well.
This time, however, their calculations may be off, because the public is outraged at recent revelations of corruption. For one, the authorities raided the home of Shin Kanemaru, the L.D.P.'s Mr. Fix-It, and found $50 million in unreported cash and 250 pounds of gold bars. For another, public prosecutors just found that construction companies have been providing handsome bribes to L.D.P. bosses for years. To the amusement of Japanese wags, Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa wasn't considered powerful enough to be on the "Special A" list of recipients.
Mr. Miyazawa is very much in the mold of L.D.P. prime ministers -- dubious about being able to change much of anything, a roller with the punches of life, philosophically passive.
This passivity is at the very core of Japanese foreign policy. They even have a word for it -- gaiatsu. It means "waiting for foreign pressure and using it to overcome domestic resistance to needed policies." Put another way, it's like dousing yourself with gasoline, tossing a match to a friend, and saying, "The devil made me do good."
Gaiatsu is no way for a great nation like this one to run a foreign policy. It absolves Japan of responsibility and hands it all to others, particularly America.
Japanese officials say they want a new "global partnership" with the U.S., and the Clinton Administration is eager to oblige. It will keep squeezing on economics, but will also support Tokyo's quest for permanent membership in the U.N. Security Council and, in the meantime, consult with Tokyo as if it were a full member.
No one knows the problems with gaiatsu better than the Japanese. They realize they got little credit for the $12 billion they contributed to the Persian Gulf war because it was pulled out of them. And they see the same reaction coming if they don't step forward on their own with aid to Russia.
Nobody likes being a nag. And Japan, a great power facing historic choices and challenges -- whether or not the Japanese acknowledge them to a foreigner -- shouldn't wait to be nagged. Or so it seems.

HEADLINE: Workers Need Place in the Economic Sun Again;
The Company Store

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The prescription of Richard B. Freeman and Joel Rogers for saving the labor movement (Op-Ed, March 10) would wind up killing it. They advocate that Federal law banning company unions be modified to permit employers to set up so-called "employee participation committees," which would "not engage in traditional collective bargaining over wages, hours and benefits," but "would have enforceable rights to information and consultation with management over labor policies." 
 This program overlooks a simple truth, embodied for nearly 60 years in our Federal labor law, that worker participation without worker power neither protects workers nor serves the country's good.
In the 1920's, company unionism was a significant force for preventing the growth of real unionism. Advocates of the so-called American Plan encouraged employers to set up phony organizations that gave workers the illusion of having a union, but that remained under the control of the employer. When the great wave of unionization swept through American factories and offices in the 1930's, with few exceptions, company unions had to be destroyed to allow formation of real, independent unions. The 1935 National Labor Relations Act therefore outlawed company unions.
Since then, that law has too often been amended by Congress or reinterpreted by the Labor Board and the courts in a way that eliminates worker rights by curbing union power. But the law's ban on company unions is untouched. It is ironic for Mr. Freeman and Mr. Rogers to advocate "labor law reform" be carried out in one of the few areas that still meet the act's original promise, guaranteeing workers the right to have free and independent unions of their choice.
Much needs to be done to restore the law's great promise. The problems facing labor and the country are not what they were 60 years ago. But we should not be blind to history and its lessons. We need true worker participation in developing corporate America's labor policies, but real unions, with real power -- not schemes to give companies tax breaks for an illusion of worker participation.

HEADLINE: Q and A

 BODY:
Post-Bankruptcy Prospects 
Question: In 1990, we were forced to file for bankruptcy. Now we are finally back on our feet financially and would like to purchase a small home of our own. Can we get a mortgage? . . . Fernando Carrion, the Bronx.
Answer: Yes, but it won't be easy. According to Beryl Riley, a mortgage manager with Chase Manhattan Bank in New York, your best bet may be secondary lenders, such as Champion Mortgage, which may also charge you a higher rate. Mortgage brokers may also help you find a lender. Some banks, such as Chase Manhattan, will consider an application from someone with a bankruptcy on his credit report, but only if there is a full discharge of the bankruptcy and the borrower has established good or secured credit. Further, two years should have elapsed since the bankruptcy discharge, three years if there is a down payment of less than 20 percent. Also, it should be documented that extraordinary circumstances caused the bankruptcy, such as an extended illness that was not covered by health insurance, and that the event is not likely to occur again.
 
Escrow Accounts
Question: I recently refinanced my mortgage, a fixed rate on a private single-family residence. My bank, however, has refused to give me a current escrow analysis. Who regulates escrow accounts? Can I ask my bank for a complete escrow analysis more than once a year? . . . Randy Hunt, Locust Valley, L.I.
Answer: No. According to Clare E. Sykes, a spokeswoman for the New York State Department of Banking, escrow issues are governed by the Federal Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, which describes how escrow accounts are done, including how often escrow analyses can be requested. She added that analyses must be given annually, but no more often unless the lender desires. If the loan is refinanced by the same lender, the same rule applies. If a new lender refinances, then a new analysis is made.
 
Security Deposit
Question: My security deposit for my apartment is in a savings account under the name of the owner. I have a letter from her bank verifying that this account is separate from the owner's other accounts. But who is entitled to the accumulated interest? Also, the owner lives on the West Coast and travels extensively. How can I make sure that my deposit will be returned? Can I not pay my last month's rent? . . . K.A. Hanson, Manhattan
Answer: Maybe. According to Michael Finder, a Manhattan lawyer, when a landlord takes a security deposit it must be placed in a trust account and segregated from other money. Technically, he added, the account also has to be in the tenant's name.
 He said that if the building had six or fewer units the owner did not have to pay interest. But if it has more than six units the tenant is entitled to the interest in the account, minus a 1 percent administration fee, which goes to the landlord. The interest can be accrued or paid annually; it's the landlord's choice. If the apartment is a New York rent-stabilized unit, the tenant can request that the interest be paid annually.
 Mr. Finder said that, in New York, landlords had to return a security deposit within a reasonable amount of time; no exact number of days is prescribed. And though not paying your last month's rent is a violation of your lease, it has also become an almost customary practice. The landlord then keeps your security deposit and, if necessary, pursues a legal action to recover any damages. "It is common to not pay the last month's rent to get a security deposit back," he said.
 Technically, Mr. Finder added, a landlord could sue for nonpayment of a last month's rent and the tenant would be responsible for the landlord's legal fees. This rarely occurs, though. And as for any possibility of eviction during the last month, it couldn't be accomplished within 30 days, at least not in New York, he said.
 Should you decide to pay your last month's rent, Mr. Finder recommended contacting your landlord before your lease expires and reminding them that you are expecting your deposit back. If you don't receive it within 30 pays, pursue legal action.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 28, 1993, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An answer in the The Q & A column on March 28 referred incorrectly to the choice of whether the interest on a tenant's security deposit is paid annually or is accrued. Generally the choice is the tenant's, not the landlord's.

THE ELEPHANT VANISHES
Stories.
By Haruki Murakami.
Translated by Alfred Birnbaum
and Jay Rubin.
327 pp. New York:
Alfred A. Knopf. $21. 
 FEW cultures excite or upset the American imagination as tenaciously as Japan's. News of life on that leapfrog of islands streams relentlessly through our televisions and newspapers, alternately offending and enthralling us. What kind of country is this, we wonder, that can produce Noh drama and cram schools, zen gardens and Nintendo games? American writers can't seem to get enough of Japan, which has become for some -- Jay McInerney, Brad Leit hauser and John Burnham Schwartz among them -- a magnet for expatriate adventuring. For writers like Michael Crichton, on the other hand, Japan is a predator nation out to destroy the American way of business -- a convenient scapegoat in a melodrama of economic espionage.
The Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami provides a different point of view in "The Elephant Vanishes," his first collection of stories. (He is also the author of the novels "Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World" and "A Wild Sheep Chase.") These stories, ably translated by Jay Rubin and Alfred Birnbaum, show us Japan as it's experienced from the inside. What is exotic to foreigners -- oyster hot pot or pillows filled with buckwheat husks -- is here the stuff of ordinary life; but so are McDonald's, steak and Julio Iglesias. Indeed, Mr. Murakami's Japan is such an unquestioned hybrid of tradition and export that one has to read 11 pages into the first story before the most casual reference to a "Tokyoite" signals that we aren't in America. His narrators -- young, urban, downwardly mobile -- are as likely to eat spaghetti as soba noodles. They listen to Wagner and Herbie Hancock, but disdain "stupid Japanese rock music. Love songs sweet enough to rot your teeth." They read Len Deighton novels and "War and Peace," not Kobo Abe and "The Tale of Genji." Their universe is Japanese, but their cultural reference points are almost exclusively Western.
This is a Japan characterized by a peculiar spiritual torpor. Bizarre events take place regularly, but fail to generate much reaction or curiosity. In "The Wind-Up Bird and Tuesday's Women," for instance, a young man's search for a missing cat leads him into a closed-off alley that passes between the backyards of parallel houses, a path "neglected and untrafficked, like some abandoned canal." There he encounters a sunbathing teen-age girl who, like the alley itself, seems both of the ordinary world and strangely apart from it. But their rambling conversation is too lazy to be truly flirtatious.
Similarly, in "A Window," another young man, this one a writing teacher who works for a correspondence school, pays a visit to one of his pupils, a married woman in her early 30's. Their few hours together eating hamburger steak and listening to Burt Bacha rach linger for years in the narrator's memory. "The weather was lovely that day," he recalls, "and over the railings of the building's verandas hung a colorful assortment of sheets and futons drying in the sun. Every now and then came the slap of a bamboo whisk fluffing out a futon. I can bring the sound back even now. It was strangely devoid of any sense of distance." Again, nothing happens. The wife and the teacher are "like two would-be passengers who had missed the same train," linked not so much by a shared passion as a shared sense of absence.
Most of Mr. Murakami's stories have a fabulistic edge. "The Dancing Dwarf" takes place in one of those impressively efficient Japanese factories we're always hearing about, only in this case the factory manufactures elephants: "Assigned to the ear section that month, I worked in the building with the yellow ceiling and posts. My helmet and pants were also yellow. . . . The month before, I had been assigned to the green building, where I wore a green helmet and pants and made heads."
In "TV People," human mutants "reduced" by 20 or 30 percent -- "figures that look far away even close up" -- invade the narrator's home and office. "From the time the TV People come into the apartment to the moment they leave," he tells us, "I don't budge. . . . Not to excuse myself, but you have people right in front of you denying your very presence like that, then see if you don't doubt whether you actually exist."
And in the haunting title story, another elephant mysteriously disappears, along with its keeper, from the enclosure where it has been kept as a kind of mascot for a Tokyo suburb. Again, the solution to the mystery hinges on questions of perspective and proportion.
In fact, all the stories in "The Elephant Vanishes" take place in parallel worlds not so much remote from ordinary life as hidden within its surfaces: secret alleys that afford unexpected -- and unsettling -- views. Mysteries are offered that defy solution or analysis. Their purpose, rather, is to point out not only how much we don't know but how much we can't know. As a result, the tendency of certain people and situations to defy description -- to most writers a bane -- becomes for Mr. Murakami something to revel in.
In the story called "Sleep," for example, a young woman suddenly discovers that she no longer needs it. Awakened literally and figuratively, she observes that there is something strange about her husband's face, but finds herself at a loss to articulate the source of this strangeness. "Honestly," she observes, " 'strange' is about all that fits. . . . The one thing I could remember was that his face looked strange."
Likewise, in "The Second Bakery Attack" a young man discovers that his wife keeps a shotgun and ski masks in the car, even though "neither of us had ever skied. But she didn't explain and I didn't ask. Married life is weird, I felt." One recalls the maxim given by the correspondence-school writing teacher in "A Window," who says to his student: "Don't try so hard to be the penetrating observer. Writing is, after all, a makeshift thing."
Makeshift indeed. Yet even in the slipperiest of Mr. Murakami's stories, pinpoints of detail flash out: pull tabs from beer cans lying in an ashtray "like scales from a mermaid"; shotgun shells rustling "like buckwheat husks in an old-fashioned pillow"; melted ice working its way through a cocktail "like a tiny ocean current."
"After I gave up sleeping," the narrator of "Sleep" observes, "it occurred to me what a simple thing reality is, how easy it is to make it work. . . . Like running a simple machine. Once you learn to run it, it's just a matter of repetition." In this observation she reveals her kinship with the narrator of "The Elephant Vanishes," who continues, after the disappearance, "to sell refrigerators and toaster ovens and coffee makers in the pragmatic world, based on afterimages of memories I retain from that world." Yet he, like his sleepless contemporary, doesn't live there anymore.
It's as if a kind of social schism has taken hold in this culture so intent on efficiency and productivity, a schism between the visible street and the hidden alley that resists simple resolution. In Mr. Murakami's view, "people are looking for a kind of unity in this kit-chin we know as the world. Unity of design. Unity of color. Unity of function." The problem, as he notes in a story called "The Last Lawn of the Afternoon," is that "no matter how hard you try to put everything neatly into shape, the context wanders this way and that, until finally the context isn't even there anymore. You're left with this pile of kittens lolling all over one another."
No metaphor could suit more exactly these stories in which animals -- elephants, kangaroos, windup birds, even a tragically mistreated "little green monster" -- figure so crucially. These stories, like the kittens themselves, are "warm with life, hopelessly" -- and, I would add, wonderfully -- "unstable."

HEADLINE: Where 'Boys Will Be Boys,' And Adults Are Befuddled

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAKEWOOD, Calif., March 26

 BODY:
It was lunchtime at Lakewood High School and the big men on campus were strutting their stuff at the local Taco Bell.
Eric Richardson, a 17-year-old football star, swaggered in, a T-shirt reading "No Crybabies" stretched taut across his pectorals. 
 "I got the power! I got the finesse! I got everything!" Eric declaimed to no one in particular.
Eric and eight of his friends, members of a group called the Spur Posse, had spent the last few days in jail, accused of molesting and raping girls as young as 10.
 
A Heroes' Welcome
 Now all but one had been released, while investigations continued. And the boys returned to school this week to a heroes' welcome, their status enhanced and their scrapbooks thicker by several press clippings.
The tale of the Spur Posse in some ways sounds like an old story about bad boys and fast girls, about athletes who can do no wrong and the people who fawn over them. But it comes as codes of sexual conduct are colliding with boys-will-be-boys mores and as unemployment and broken marriages are troubling the still waters of this piece of suburbia southeast of Los Angeles.
Lakewood's Mayor, Marc Titel, said he hoped the town would use its notoriety as an occasion for introspection. But he said he was not optimistic, because the boys seem unrepentent, the parents lenient and the other students inclined to lionize the athletes and vilify their accusers.
 
'Real Problems'
 "We need to look at what kind of values we are communicating to our kids," said Mr. Titel, a father of seven. "We have some real problems here, and promiscuity is one of them. For too long, we've accepted that that's the way it is. Well, that kind of resignation sends a message to kids that nothing's wrong with it."
Eric Richardson and his friends say they have heard that message. "They pass out condoms, teach sex education and pregnancy-this and pregnancy-that," the boy said, after polishing off a Nacho Supreme and necking with his girlfriend in a booth at the Taco Bell. "But they don't teach us any rules."
The exploits of these boys, who are also implicated in nonsexual crimes here, have laid bare the underbelly of life in this suburb, where a tract-house development dwarfing Levittown was built among bean fields in the 1950's for workers in the fledgling aerospace industry.
This is a predominately white community of 73,500 where virtually every block has its own baseball diamond or gridiron, where the boys are athletes and girls cheerleaders from the age of 6 or 7 and where most fathers are part-time coaches and mothers are "team moms."
 
Shaken by Divorce and Debt
 But these days, the 50's suburb is plagued with 90's problems.
Many members of the Spur Posse, which counts 20 to 30 boys as members and is named for the San Antonio Spurs professional basketball team, come from families shaken by divorce or financial crisis. One boy's parents are divorced, people here say, but continue to live together because they cannot afford to move. Another comes from a family repeatedly evicted from their home. A third stares back blankly when asked what he has been doing since high school. "Partying," he mumbled. "Playing ball."
Several are also being investigated or have been arrested on charges of burglary, assault, intimidation of witnesses and other crimes. The sexual charges stemmed from a meeting at school, when the sheriff's department invited 22 families with boys in the Spur Posse to come and discuss what their children were up to. Only seven parents came. One of them said rapes had been committed.
When sexual-abuse investigators began looking into the matter, they discovered that one complaint had already been filed, by a girl whose father, a former police officer, discovered she had had an abortion. The girl told her father she had been forced to have sex with several boys. Other girls were interviewed, and six more told similar stories. None have been identified.
 
'We Didn't Do Nothing Wrong'
 Many of the boys have acknowledged having sex with scores of underage girls as part of a competition. But the girls were willing participants, the boys said, and were known throughout the school as "sluts."
"We didn't do nothing wrong 'cause it's not illegal to hook up," said Billy Shehan, 19, using the local slang for sexual intercourse, which he says he has had 66 times, making him the group's top scorer.
In fact, sexual intercourse with a minor is a felony, even if the girl consents. But it is rarely prosecuted and the Los Angeles District Attorney, upon releasing most of the boys, said it was a "social" issue "better left to churches, schools and parents."
A few of the Spurs' parents are downright boastful about their sons. Take Don Belman, a salesman, who graduated from Lakewood High in 1963, married a hometown girl and had three strapping boys, all star athletes. "Aren't they virile specimens?" Mr. Belman said the other night as he watched them skating noisily through the neighborhood.
One of Mr. Belman's sons, 20-year-old Dana, founded the Spur Posse. A member of the Lakewood Youth Hall of Fame, Dana is awaiting trial on unrelated charges of stealing guns, credit cards and jewelry and trying to run over several girls with a pickup truck.
Another son, 19-year-old Kris, is the oldest of those who were arrested on the sexual charges. Four of the eight boys set free from jail remain under investigation, although it could not be learned which ones. A ninth boy remains in custody, charged with lewd conduct with a minor.
 
A Spur Who's 'All Man'
 On the night of Kris's release, Mr. Belman said his son was "all man." The girls that Kris had sex with were "giving it away," Mr. Belman added. "There wouldn't be enough jails in America" if all boys were imprisoned for doing what his son was accused of, he said.
Other parents are more bewildered than boastful.
Joyce Shehan, for instance, said she was mortified that her son Billy, not among those arrested, bragged of leading the Spurs in conquests. "It was like somebody kicked me in the stomach when I saw his face talking on television," Mrs. Shehan said.
She said she told Billy, "No means no, no matter how far you've progressed." But Billy says he recalls no such conversation.
Mrs. Shehan, a secretary, added that she knew Billy was sexually active from the time he was 14 years old and stocked his room with "rubbers from the Price Club."
Now, she said, her confidence in her parenting skills is shaken. "What should I have done different?" she asked.
There are also gradations of opinion among the 4,000 students at Lakewood High.
A few students said they were troubled by the boys' behavior, but they would discuss it only anonymously because they feared retaliation or wanted to stay in favor with the in-crowd.
"They're like bullies," said a tiny 10th-grade girl, who was waiting her turn at cheerleading tryouts. "They say stuff like, 'Oh, come on, I'm in love.' They pretend to be real sweet and then they tell everybody afterward and give out her phone number. Sometimes a bunch of them even go and take turns."
But far more students defended the Spurs and said their accusers were promiscuous girls who got what they asked for.
"These girls were all willing; they even bragged about it," said an 11th grader wearing red and white hair ribbons and carrying tissue-paper pompoms. "I know one girl who did every Spur, and she was proud of it. I'm not saying the boys are perfect angels. They take advantage of girls and treat them like crap in the morning. But they didn't rape anyone."
 
'Not the Prettiest' Victims
 At the D & D Sporting Goods store near the high school, two members of the Spurs and one of their girlfriends speculated about the motivation of these so-called fast girls.
"They're not the prettiest, you know," said Matt Nielsen, 18, a recent graduate of Lakewood High. Matt's divorced mother works a double shift as part-owner of D & D and as the overnight cashier at the supermarket next door.
"So they take whatever they can get," added Athena Morales, Matt's girlfriend and one of the many Lakewood students who wore black wristbands this week to protest the arrests.
Matt's 15-year-old brother, Scotty, chimed in: "That's how they're trying to get popular, by doing my friends." Scotty added that his best buddy was still in jail and set to go on trial next week for lewd conduct with a minor. The girl might actually have been 10, Scotty asserted, but she claimed to be 15.
In tabulating their sexual exploits, the boys in the Spur Posse make reference to the uniform numbers of the sports stars who are their heroes: "I'm 44 now -- Reggie Jackson," or "I'm 50 -- David Robinson."
And Bill Shehan, Billy's father, said, "I don't see these kids acting much different from professional athletes, like when Wilt Chamberlain came out in his book and said he had 20,000 women."

HEADLINE: Consumers Finally Respond To High Credit Card Interest

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
After a decade of self-deception, Americans have finally begun to face the truth about how much interest they actually pay on their credit cards. And now, for the first time, many consumers are shopping for a card that will charge them a lower rate.
For years, many consumers were drawn to Mastercards and Visa cards issued by banks mainly on the basis of which one offered the highest credit limit. Studies show that the vast majority of card holders simply told themselves that they did not pay any interest, when two-thirds of them did. Thus they were undisturbed by interest rates that stubbornly remained around 19 percent even as other rates fell sharply.
 
 
'More Honest With Themselves'
 "People used to say to themselves, 'I may pay interest once in a while, but that's not really me because I'm going to pay it it all off next month,' " said Ruvan N. Cohen, director of card marketing at Citibank, the nation's largest bank and largest issuer of credit cards. "In the last year people began to be more honest with themselves. They admit they pay interest and have started to read the rate disclosure boxes. We have to respond to that." 
 And now the slide in credit card rates shows no signs of stopping. Citibank will announce today that it is lowering rates to 15.4 percent, from 19.8 percent, on nine million cards -- including "affinity cards" linked to merchants, like the widely held cards that offer frequent-flier miles from American Airlines.
Last year Citibank lowered the rate for another nine million regular and gold cards for customers with good credit records. After today's rate cut, 70 percent of Citibank's 27 million cards will have rates below 19.8 percent, the industry standard since 1981.
 
 
Low Rates to New Customers
 And for the first time, Citibank will offer the low rates to new customers. Last week, it mailed 30 million solicitations offering a 9.9 percent rate for six months to customers who transfer their debts from another bank.
The Norwest Corporation noticed in the middle of last year that many customers who were heavy borrowers were transferring balances to lower-rate cards. "It became clear that our customers had fundamentally changed," said Brian O'Hare, the head of credit cards for the Minneapolis-based bank. Last summer Norwest dropped its rate for most customers to 15 percent from 19.8 percent.
This change in psychology is largely because the economic downturn has forced many consumers to look more closely at their finances. "The recession has had a profound impact on people's idea of value," Mr. O'Hare of Norwest said. "People are choosing to spend less and save more."
Another factor was simply the publicity given to interest rates. In 1986, Congress voted to phase out the deductibility of consumer interest, and in 1991 the Senate passed a bill introduced by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, to cap interest rates for credit cards.
"Here were 30-second sound bites right from the halls of Congress, and lo and behold, 80 percent of the people know what their A.P.R. is," said Thomas Lynch, head of credit cards at Chase Manhattan Bank, referring to annual percentage rate. "Two years before only 30 percent did."
Immediately after Senator D'Amato introduced his bill, in fact, calls began to pick up at Bank Card Holders of America, a group that sells lists of credit cards with low rates. Last year the group sold 2,500 of the lists a week for $4, double the rate of the year before. "With rates for home mortgages and car loans dropping to 20-year lows, consumers were beginning to ask why they were paying almost 20 percent for a credit card," Gerri E. Detweiler, the group's director, said.
Just two years ago, 70 percent of the money owed on credit cards -- nearly $200 billion -- was at rates higher than 18 percent. Last year that portion fell to 44 percent, according to a new study conducted for the Congressional Budget Office by Ram Research. At the same time, the portion of credit card debt with rates of 16.5 percent or less increased to 38 percent from 7 percent.
 
 
Variable Rates
 Most banks have quietly shifted to variable rates -- usually about 9 percentage points above the prime rate -- so this savings may not last when the prime, now 6 percent, rises. Even though that rate is still far higher than the best deals available on credit cards, last year the lower variable rates saved consumers more than $2 billion on the more than $30 billion paid annually for credit card interest payments.
But while the banks are responding, they are not doing so cheerfully. When customers did not shop for interest rates, the profit margins on credit cards were as high as 4 percent of the amount lent, far higher than those on other bank products. In 1990, banks earned more than $4 billion from credit card lending, one-quarter of the profits of the entire banking system. Some of the largest banks might not have survived their losses from bad real-estate loans if they had not been buoyed by earnings from cards.
Now losses from bad credit card debt have risen just as annual fees and interest rates have fallen. As a result, credit card earnings fell to 2.5 percent of assets in 1990 and to 1.5 percent of assets today, according to Salomon Brothers.
Banks, of course, can still demand higher rates on credit cards than on other types of consumer loans, because consumers are willing to pay for the greater convenience that cards offer. Nonetheless, with industrial companies like A.T.& T. and General Motors sponsoring very successful new card programs -- and offering discounts on everything from phone calls to new cars -- many banks are finding that their best defense is to cut rates.
 
 
Discounts Produce Growth
 Indeed, most banks are seeing the fastest growth in their card business when they offer the most aggressive discounts. The Wachovia Corporation, which offers a rate as low as 8.9 percent (with a $39 fee), saw its charge card loans grow by 33 percent last year. And the Bank of New York, which offers a card with no fee and a rate of 11.9 percent, grew by 27 percent, Ram Research found.
The banks that have cut rates more aggressively, along with the new nonbank card issuers, have been taking market share from the traditional issuers, like Citibank, which actually lost customers last year.
As a defense, most large card issuers switched last year from fixed rates, generally 19.8 percent, to variable rates that now are about 15 percent for at least some of their cardholders. Rates for gold cards are generally a few points lower. Those that did not offer lower rates found they were in trouble. General Electric, for example, introduced a credit card with great fanfare last fall but had to eliminate the annual fee and lower the interest from 18.4 percent to as low as 14.9 percent after it did not catch on in the marketplace.
The average standard card was offered to new customers with a rate of 16.63 percent last fall, down two full percentage points from the year before, according to a study of direct mail offers by BAI Marketing Research.
Even Sears's Discover Card, which offers a cash rebate and no annual fee with a 19.8 percent rate, is under pressure. A survey last year by another firm, Brittain Associates, showed that 25 percent of Discover card holders felt the rate was too high. In January, Sears slashed its interest rate to 14.9 percent for customers who charge more than $1,000 a year.
While it hardly seems surprising that rates on charge cards should come down as most other interest rates have plunged, that was not the case in the 1980's. At that time, as the prime rate dropped below 8 percent from 16 percent, the rate charged on most credit card borrowings remained firmly wedged at nearly 20 percent.
"Consumer sensitivity to interest rates was virtually nonexistent," said Donald J. Auriemma, a credit card consultant. "They didn't know their annual percentage rate and they didn't care."
What consumers focused on was whether their cards had high credit lines, and then opted for those that had no annual fee, even when paying $20 a year up front could save hundreds of dollars a year in interest. "People don't focus on how much they are revolving and what the dollars and cents consequences will be," said Robert G. Skolnick, executive vice president of BAI.
It was not until last year that offers of cards with lower rates started to attract more customers than no-fee cards, Mr. Auriemma said.
Amid the increased scrutiny from consumers, banks have tried to appear as if they are offering lower rates than they they really are. Some banks, including Citibank, offer the new lower rate only on purchases made after a cut is announced. Existing balances are billed at the higher rate.
Others, like Discover and American Express's Optima card, give the best rate only to customers who charge more than a certain amount in a year.
And many issuers now will raise rates on customers who miss payments or exceed their credit limits. Bankers say this policy appeals to consumers as fair and helps bankers compensate for their higher-risk customers at a time when credit losses have soared.
 
 
Banks Offset Costs
 The fact that the banks themselves are paying much less for the money they borrow has largely offset the cost of reducing their charge rates. To get the money to make fixed-rate credit card loans, banks typically sell certificates of deposit or bonds with three-year to five-year maturities, the average life of a credit card loan. Since they moved to variable-rate credit cards, banks are now financing their charge card loans with shorter term deposits, which cost them three or four percentage points less.

HEADLINE: Horror for Hollywood: Film Hits a Nerve With Its Grim View of Hometown

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 28

 BODY:
Over the years, Hollywood has offered many portraits of its home territory, from a paradise of turquoise pools to apocalyptic visions like "Blade Runner." More knowingly than most moviegoers, Angelenos could shrug off the distortions as just illusion.
But now a film has struck a nerve in Los Angeles. The city is in an uproar over the Warner Brothers hit "Falling Down," a tale of a laid-off military worker played by Michael Douglas, a middle-aged man who mentally snaps in a freeway jam, leaves his car and embarks on a violent journey through a hostile city, much of it graffiti-splattered and ethnically threatening. 
 Korean-Americans objected to being portrayed as gouging shopkeepers. Hispanic residents recoiled at Mexican-American youths as murderous thugs. Even unemployed military workers said the film could hurt their job hunts.
On another day, such a film might not have caused a ripple. But Southern California, once considered the bright future of America, is in the grip of its worst economic slump since the Depression and is collectively wondering if it has any future at all. Moreover, the film comes shortly before the anniversary of the rioting last spring and during the Federal trial of the four white police officers who beat Rodney G. King.
 
Good Reviews in the East
 "Falling Down" had generally good reviews in the East, but not here. The Los Angeles Times has published seven negative articles about it, including three on the front page of its entertainment section on March 15. Then came three commentaries last Monday including a spirited defense by Mr. Douglas's father, Kirk Douglas, who argued that critics had misinterpreted the movie as making a hero of the "prejudiced, middle-class nerd" portrayed by his son.
All seem to agree that the film is entertaining and riveting, but few agree on its social message. A Los Angeles Times columnist, Peter H. King, retraced Mr. Douglas's steps in the movie, walking from downtown to Venice Beach. He reported that despite some "moments," the trek was uneventful.
" 'Falling Down' is the Los Angeles of late-night news and boilerplate sociology," Mr. King complained. "A city of drive-bys and Hare Krishnas and 'Will Work for Food' signs, of absurd wealth and wretched poverty and little in between. In short, it is the new mythical L.A., which has supplanted the old mythical L.A. of endless summers."
A week later, Mr. King's colleague, Bob Baker, a veteran reporter of urban issues, warned against more of "this simple-minded sociology."
"Last spring's riots created a wave of Hollywood interest in exploiting Los Angeles as a pressure cooker of horrors," he wrote. "From now on, anything goes. You want urban insanity as a backdrop? Set your screenplay here. Any portrait of the city, no matter how grotesque or overstated, can be justified by a simple wave of the producer's hand toward the temporary insanity of the riots."
Mr. Baker suggested that it was the likes of the film's character who had brought in these urban problems, by voting in 1978 for the tax-limiting Proposition 13, which resulted in "horrid" public services, crime and gangs.
The film's director, Joel Schumacher, argued that the negative local reaction meant the film was all too true. "Obviously, this movie struck a nerve," Mr. Schumacher, who moved from New York in 1971, said in an interview. "When you hit a nerve, people will scream."
Mr. Schumacher pointed out that the film was written and almost completely filmed before the riots, and he said it was not meant to exploit the black-Korean tensions.
"This is not a movie that decided to single out L.A.," he said. "It could easily have been about Chicago or New York or Miami. My experience is when people protest too much you've hit the nail on the head. The problems that led to the riots exist in most major cities. Those problems have not been addressed.
" 'Falling Down' waved a red flag and said, 'Hey, we've got serious problems here.' Denial of that is not going to help. I know there are armies of hard-working law-abiding people in L.A., but that's not all.
"The whole point of the movie is that it may seem like an option to act out. Everybody is buying guns, and acting out by ordinary people seems to be the order of the day. I wanted to make a film by a man acting out."
Mr. Schumacher added that the Douglas character is the film's villain.
That was not how many Angelenos took it. At recent screenings, many in the audiences applauded when the crazed character played by Mr. Douglas beat up a Korean merchant for charging too much and then vandalized his store; when he shot a Mexican-American gang member; when he terrorized a fast-food restaurant after clerks refused to serve him breakfast a minute or two after the cut-off time.
As audience reactions suggest, the film did tap a reservoir of anger here, and perhaps no group is more concerned about that than the 200,000 Korean-Americans, who were frequent targets in last year's riots.
Korean groups say that since February eight Korean-American merchants in Los Angeles County have been shot, five fatally. A white man swinging a belt and shouting anti-Asian epithets was arrested March 13 for vandalizing a liquor store in suburban Anaheim. As in the film, the man left the shop without stealing.
 
A Desire for Balance
 Speaking of the movie, Robert Park, program director for the Korean Coalition, said, "I could not believe they were showing this." The film also fed stereotypes, he said.
Members of the coalition met with studio executives and Mr. Schumacher, about two weeks ago, and those who attended said the meeting was cordial and fruitful.
Asian-Americans are not seeking censorship but want balance, said Stewart Kwoh, executive director of the Asian Pacific American Legal Center here. "It showed only the negative side of life in L.A.," he went on.
At City Hall, Mayor Tom Bradley has not made an issue of the film. But Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani has called the movie "effective" and "entertaining" and said it "did express the frustration of living in any major city, not just L.A."
Mr. Fabiani also found a political lesson, saying the Douglas character was probably a Reaganite who voted to cut taxes and public services.
"But the Mayor's view," he went on, "is that complaining only creates more of an audience for it."

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Using 'Kids' to Push Fight on Poverty May Obscure the Issues, Critics Say

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28

 BODY:
Fortified by Chinese takeout food and tapes of the Grateful Dead, a dozen young workers labored overtime last week in the basement of a Capitol Hill town house, packaging social need.
They filled 5,000 envelopes with a report that says the United States increasingly consigns its children to lives of violence, poverty and failure. They relayed background footage to a satellite and produced localized sound bites for television stations in every state. 
 If experience holds true, the effort to gain attention will succeed beyond what its publicist, Tony Podesta, calls his "wildest imagination": the report was featured in about 1,400 of the nation's 1,600 daily newspapers last year and prompted editorials with sympathetic headlines like "Suffer the Children."
Today's release of the report, Kids Count Data Book, an annual profile of American children by the Annie E. Casey Foundation and the Center for the Study of Social Policy, two not-for-profit groups, is an example of the many public campaigns now selling a vision of activist Government beneath the face of a child. The movement's thesis is that American children as a whole are imperiled and in need of special help, especially Federal help.
Or, in the advocates' vernacular, "kids" are "at risk," but more "investments" can produce "better outcomes." As an example, the advocates argue that money spent on the Head Start preschool program saves money that would later accrue from crime, educational failure or welfare.
But skeptics say the talk of "kids" is really an effort to promote antipoverty policies that would meet greater resistance if labeled as such. And though some advocates disagree, their critics argue that little can be done to eliminate the poverty of children without confronting the complex forces behind the poverty of adults. After all, most poor children come attached to poor families.
Calling on the country to care about its "kids," they say, can sentimentalize and obscure the underlying issues.
 
Report Paints Bleak Picture
 Whatever the ideological intent, the numbers put forth in the Kids Count report are disturbing to many people. The report says about one of every four American children lives in a single-parent family and about one in five lives in poverty. In surveying trends in 10 categories of child well-being since 1985, the report found conditions worsening in six of them.
And whatever the underlying agenda, "kids" are selling. The success of the report, a state-by-state statistical compendium, has produced imitators in 37 states. They, too, issue annual reports, breaking the data down to the local level.
In California, an advocacy group called Children Now has placed public service advertisements on network television and recruited Wall Street barons like George Roberts to its board. Among the group's slogans is "Children. They're the only future we've got."
In Washington, the nation's most prominent child advocacy group, the Children's Defense Fund, is enjoying unprecedented political influence. One of its former chairwomen, Donna E. Shalala, is the Secretary of Health and Human Services; another is Hillary Rodham Clinton.
 
Problems for Poor and Rich
 The leaders of most of these organizations deny they are engaging in a bait-and-switch marketing strategy that simply uses children to promote antipoverty policies. Social conditions are worsening for most American children, they say, not just poor ones.
Some of their examples are compelling. They note a common culture of violence in music and television, drops in academic achievement, increased sexual activity and the ever-widening breakup of the American family.
"The problems we worry about are not exclusively concentrated among the poor," said Douglas Nelson, executive director of the Annie E. Casey Foundation.
Like most child advocates, Mr. Nelson is quick to add that poor children do suffer such problems disproportionately.
In an interview last fall, Marian Wright Edelman, the president of the Children's Defense Fund, similarly argued that children of all economic classes face common problems like "crass materialism," "the proliferation of guns," and "polluted air and the ozone problem."
"I worry so much about my kids having so much -- too much," Ms. Edelman said. She added, however, that children living in blighted areas faced a "heck of a bigger struggle."
James Steyer, the founder of Children Now, goes even further in arguing that the problems facing children cut across class boundaries. "My friends who went to Exeter with me -- they're worried about their kids," he said. "They're not sure they're going to have health care for their kids."
While the advocacy groups promote a vision of activist Government, there are important nuances in the language they use. The Children's Defense Fund, for instance, emphasizes a confidence in what it calls proven Government solutions, like Head Start.
The Kids Count report, by contrast, stresses the need to "rethink many of the public efforts." It is careful to stress that recent increases in spending have brought little improvements in problems like teen-age pregnancy, violence and family breakup.
Still, the general call for an activist Government has prompted criticisms from conservatives, who call the children's movement a front for higher taxes and more social programs.
But some liberals also offer critiques, saying talk of "children" is an imprecise way of framing a social problem. Christopher Jencks, a sociologist at Northwestern University, says the movement's rhetoric "is problematic partly because it talks its way around the problem of poverty, and partly because it implies that you can separate the problems of kids from the problems of their parents."
While some programs, like Head Start, focus directly on children, an effective antipoverty program must confront the web of cultural and economic forces at work in the larger society.
 
Negatives Increase
 But Mr. Jencks calls his remarks quibbles with a movement that he basically admires for its ability to get the public thinking about policy questions. "On balance, I'm mildly for these folks," he said.
The Kids Count data on teen-age years was especially negative. Births to single mothers grew, as did the percentage of children not graduating from high school and the percentage dying violent deaths. The arrest rate for violent crimes (rape, homicide, robbery and aggravated assault) rose by 48 percent.
While some conservatives have accused child advocates of blaming Government rather than parents, the Kids Count report is careful to talk about family formation. A new statistical measurement, called a family risk index, paints a portentous view of the future by assessing the percentage of American families that begin under adverse circumstances, increasing the likelihood that their children will experience poverty or other problems.
The authors found that 45 percent of the children born into new families had one of three disadvantages: either their mother had not finished high school, was not married or was a teen-ager. The report said 24 percent of the new families had two of these disadvantages and 11 percent had all three.
In virtually every category, minorities fared worse.
 
Spending and Results
 The report is distributed by Podesta & Associates, a public relations firm based on Capitol Hill that specializes in work for not-for-profit groups. One of its founders, John Podesta, is now staff secretary to President Clinton.
Though the report is careful to note that higher spending does not always produce desired results, such distinctions often do not carry through to press accounts. "It is truly a matter of pay now or pay later," reported a Columbia, S.C., television station after last year's report. A station in Orlando, Fla., quoted advocates saying that for a decade, the country has "cut every important program" serving children.
A series of public service advertisements produced by Children Now carry a similar endorsement of more public spending. They feature stark pictures of children under arrest, passed out on bathroom floors and peering hopelessly through a chain-link fence. "When will we pay for our children's future?" one advertisement asks. "Now or later?"
Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, a research organization, notes that spending on many children's programs, including Head Start, has risen sharply in recent years.
"In a lot of dimensions, society isn't turning its back on kids -- it's spending more than ever," he said. "So this is a bogyman of this literature."

HEADLINE: U.S. Suspects Iran Is Helping Iraq To Evade Embargo on Oil Exports

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28

 BODY:
United States intelligence agencies have expressed concern that Iran and Iraq may have struck a deal calling for Iran to buy oil from Iraq in violation of United Nations sanctions, senior Clinton Administration officials said today.
Such an agreement between the two Middle Eastern adversaries would undermine international efforts imposed after the Persian Gulf war to deprive Iraq of oil revenue, the officials said. They said they were worried that the two countries' common enmity toward the United States may have caused the them to set aside years of animosity, at least partly. 
 An estimated 300,000 Iranians died in the eight-year war with Iraq, which ended in 1988; total military and civilian casualties have been estimated at more than a million. But both nations have also shown some willingness to cooperate in combatting efforts by Western countries to isolate them.
 
Reports of Big Convoy
 The Administration officials said they had no direct evidence that an oil-buying agreement had been reached. But they said they were troubled by intelligence reports indicating that a convoy of dozens of tanker-trucks recently carried a large shipment of Iraqi oil to Iran.
A report of the delivery appeared today in The Washington Post. A senior Administration official confirmed today that last week, Washington complained to Iran about the oil delivery and was considering whether to raise the matter with the United Nations. Because the United States does not have diplomatic relations with Iran, the protest was relayed through Swiss intermediaries, another official said.
The Iraqi Government in Baghdad has been seeking secret markets for its oil ever since it was banned from selling it under the punitive sanctions imposed by the Security Council after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
Some Iraqi oil is already believed to have been shipped abroad through Jordan. But United States officials have long been concerned about more extensive shipments through Iran, and Government experts said today that Baghdad and Teheran may have begun to discuss such an arrangement as early as 1991. It is believed that Iran, itself a significant oil producer, would re-export any oil that it got from Iraq, and pass the revenues on to Iraq.
The experts declined to estimate how much Iraqi oil may have been shipped to Iran, and said it was impossible to know what motivated Teheran to break the sanctions. But they noted that Iran had shown itself willing to assist Iraq in thwarting the West, most notably in permitting Baghdad to move military aircraft to Iranian airstrips during the gulf war.

New York Magazine: Bucking Trends

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
On March 4, New York magazine was all set to run a cover story titled "All the Pretty Young Things" about the latest, coolest, "most divinely decadent," beautiful young people in New York. That afternoon, word came that an arrest was imminent in the World Trade Center bombing.
In the next 18 hours, a 3,000-word article on the bombing was written and edited, and a new cover delivered to the printer. By Saturday afternoon, right on schedule, more than 400,000 copies with "The Arab Connection" on the cover were on their way to subscribers and newsstands. 
 Edward Kosner, the editor and president, declared: "When Arabs blow up the World Trade Center, the trick is to use it, to be topical, to change the cover, to respond. You just have to be prepared to throw out something, to reschedule -- otherwise the magazine just becomes a monthly." A magazine also has to have the money and technology for such quick turnarounds.
 
Success in a Weak Economy
 It is this sense of urgency and responsiveness to the city's quirkiness that has kept the magazine vital when other city magazines have found themselves unable to weather the recession and its aftermath. Many, more vulnerable than most because of their heavy reliance on local retail advertising, have ceased publication. New York City, for example, has lost Manhattan,inc., 7 Days and New York Woman since 1990.
Even American Express Publishing has given up on city magazines. Three years ago, it intended to build a stable of regional publications. Not only did it abandon plans to expand, but in December it put its three city magazines up for sale. Two of those, Atlanta and D, which covers Dallas, are still on the block. L.A. Style was purchased by Buzz, a rival Los Angeles publication, which closed it.
New York, though, has been profitable for 12 years and intermittently before that, Mr. Kosner said. K-III Magazines which bought New York from Rupert Murdoch in 1991, has just substantially increased the editorial budget, he said, enabling him to hire some new people.
Its circulation of 437,866 is its highest since 1985. But advertising has been weaker the last three years, reflecting an industry-wide trend. This year through the March 23 issue, ad pages are down 8.5 percent .
 
How Relevant? How Local?
 Some critics think the magazine is less focused on New York than it once was, less of an insider's journal. Others say it has become a sort of habit, one of the obligatory weekly rituals.
"I think it's gone from a 'must read' to a 'must skim'," said Alexandra Penney, editor in chief of Self, a health and fitness magazine. "But an important part of the equation is that a lot of other magazines went from a 'must read' to a 'forget it.' "
Even the severest critics, though, praise Mr. Kosner for putting out a consistently readable publication.
"It's become like everyone's relative; it has insinuated itself in our lives," said Betsy Carter, new executive editor at Harper's Bazaar, who founded New York Woman. "It has kept up with New York and the neuroses of New York. It's one of those things that you may not remember reading -- but I just don't think of not reading it."
Tomorrow night, K-III will give a dinner at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in honor of Mr. Kosner, a former editor of Newsweek who has led the magazine since 1980. It will be the first of several celebrations for the 25th anniversary of the magazine, which was founded as an independent publication in 1968 by Clay Felker. Mr. Felker was editor of New York when it was a Sunday supplement of The Herald Tribune and later of the short-lived World Journal Tribune, which ceased publication in 1967.
 
Wistful Beginnings
 The magazine's early days in a fourth-floor walk-up on East 32d Street are part of the city's journalism lore. Mr. Felker used his $7,500 severance pay to buy the title, then set out to raise more. George Hirsch, the publisher, ran sweepstakes that included lures like "Dinner with Mayor Lindsay (your house or his) to Tell Him How to Run the City."
"I loved the beginnings so," said Gloria Steinem, who describes herself as the sole "girl" on a team that included Tom Wolfe, Pete Hamill, Jimmy Breslin and the art directors Milton Glaser and Walter Bernard. "We sat around trying to think of the best name for the magazine," she said. "Tom Wolfe suggested 'New York Moon', and we had visions of trucks, even if empty, racing around the city and people crying, 'The moon is out!' "
Mr. Felker said: "I don't think that any magazine that changes editors will have the same vision. Magazines like The New Yorker, Esquire, Vanity Fair very much reflect the individual editor. I think Ed has done a very professional job, and it looks wonderful."
Mr. Kosner still depends on the Felker formula -- a mix of longer articles on trends, personalities and pop culture; detailed service pieces, like "Finding the Best Bank for Your Dollar," and short, attention-getting gossipy sections like Intelligencer, Fast Track and Best Bets. Critics are also part of the magazine's core.
 
Underground Gourmet Surfaces
 Mr. Kosner noted that in his 13 years as editor New York had gone through phases, requiring it to keep changing pace. During the 80's boom, it emphasized consumption. With the recession, the focus shifted to "how to survive" and service articles.
"You don't have to reinvent the magazine," Mr. Kosner said, "but rather use the array of possibilities and the cycle of issues that have always been part of the genetic code of the magazine. It's just a different emphasis at different periods."
Whatever the emphasis, a trademark remains strong writing, and the best writers are always in demand. Asked if New York paid writers well enough to keep its own stable of talent -- a well-publicized recent departure was that of the political columnist Joe Klein to Newsweek last summer -- Mr. Kosner said he paid competitively with magazines like Esquire.
For important pieces, he said, "we pay very, very well." He did not provide figures.
Joe Klein, he said, left for Newsweek because it has a national circulation of three million, compared with New York's 437,000-plus.
 
Somewhat Different Audiences
 Mr. Kosner shrugs off criticism that the magazine is now less focused on the city. He also rejects suggestions that The New Yorker is breathing down New York's neck.
"When I took over the magazine," Mr. Kosner said, "they had 4,000 ad pages and we had 1,800." In 1992, New York had 2,198 ad pages to The New Yorker's 2,018. The advertising bases, however, are not really comparable. New York has 72 percent of its circulation in the metropolitan area; The New Yorker's circulation is predominantly national.
"If we do what we are supposed to do, nothing can affect us," Mr. Kosner said. 'But if we falter, if we lose our way, if we start chasing every little trendlet, then we can put ourselves at risk."

HEADLINE: Clinging to Thin Hope In Debris of Hurricane

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOMESTEAD, Fla., March 28

 BODY:
At first glance, it appears that Hurricane Andrew demolished the house just yesterday. Wooden roof beams are still exposed, windows have not been replaced and huge piles of debris clutter the driveway.
But it has been seven months since the storm hit, and George Vargas, a 37-year-old butcher, has spent nearly every day supervising the painfully slow reconstruction of the home he shares with his wife, Amy, and their 6-year-old daughter, Isabel. He can afford the time because the storm also destroyed Homestead Meat Market, the business he and his father, now 65, operated for more than 20 years. 
 "Until I finish this house, I am not going to do anything else," said Mr. Vargas, whose wife is now supporting the family as a bank teller. "The business is gone, and it's not coming back, because my father just can't imagine starting all over again at his age."
For Mr. Vargas and the other residents of his block on 152nd Court, these may be even worse times than the days immediately after the hurricane. Through the late summer and fall, they were buoyed by the presence of the military and by national concern about their plight.
 
Hope Fades With Time
 But that interest has receded, and they say they feel isolated and tired -- even more so since the Clinton Administration announced plans to close Homestead Air Force Base, the town's economic bedrock until it was destroyed by the hurricane. In the days just after the storm, President George Bush promised to rebuild the base.
Having survived the winds and rain, they now find that Federal and county agencies, insurance companies and contractors often provide as many obstacles as help. What is worse, they can see no quick solutions or end to the upheaval, and no one can tell them when they might expect to resume normal lives.
"Andrew came and went in a few hours," said Margarita Rodriguez, Mr. Vargas's neighbor. "But living with the damage the storm did, and trying to recover from it, is something that just goes on and on and on."
 
No Inspiration in a Dump
 Since last August, Mrs. Rodriguez, her husband, Ricardo, her son, Ricky, and his wife have been living in a small rented apartment 40 minutes from their home. To save money, she has acted as her own contractor. Every day after work, she stops by to see what progress the construction crew has made, or to urge them to speed up their work, or to complain to the county that their trucks still have not hauled away the foul-smelling mounds of debris that have become home to assorted vermin.
"Since the hurricane, the most depressing thing has been to see all the debris piling up," said Mrs. Rodriguez, who grew up in Queens and moved to Homestead hoping to find a calmer, safer way of life. "It really brings you down. People ask themselves what is the use of reconstructing if the entire neighborhood is a dump."
Down the block, Lazaro Roque has already moved back into his house, after living with his family in a small trailer in his driveway through much of the fall. But his insurance settlement did not give him enough money to replace ruined furniture, and it did not cover the tools that someone stole from his house when he and his family stayed briefly with relatives in Hialeah in the days after the storm.
 
Jobs Also Blew Away
 Mr. Roque, a 31-year-old father of a 2-year-old son, John, and a daughter, Ashley, born a month after the hurricane, is also without a job. The gas station where he worked for a dozen years was destroyed by the storm and then sold to a new owner, who wanted to hire his own people.
Before the storm, Mr. Roque and his father supplemented their incomes by selling ice cream from a pair of trucks during the summer. But the storm smashed both vehicles, on which the insurance had recently lapsed, and Mr. Roque has not been able to replace them. He now spends most of his time caring for his children so his wife, who has a Dade County job with health benefits, can continue to work.
 
Government Adds to Woes
 "I don't think you can ever completely come back from something like this," Mr. Roque said. "Everything has changed for all of us, even for the baby. Many of the neighbors have left, and a lot of the good jobs are gone, too."
In a meeting last week with Dade County mayors, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Henry G. Cisneros did not hold out much hope for a quick improvement in conditions here. "It's possible we are looking at four to five years to get it back to where it was," he said.
Other hurricane-related woes have recently complicated the rebuilding effort. The worst was the Pentagon's announced this month that it intends to shut down Homestead Air Force Base, which employed 8,800 people, nearly half of them civilians, and contributed $430 million a year to the local economy.
"First my house gets torn up," said Ray Runshe, a 62-year-old military retiree, "and now they say the base is going to close." As he spoke, he stood in the yard of his newly rebuilt home here, just a mile from the remains of the base, which the Government deems too expensive to rebuild. "They are pulling the rug right out from underneath us."
Homestead's City Manager, Alex Muxo, said the likely closing of the 50-year-old base had been a blow to morale that even the hurricane's destruction could not match.
 
'Why Should I Stay'
 Emilio Pages expects to lose $100,000 a year in business from the base itself, which ordered paint, carpeting and tile from the decorating service he ran here, and an even larger amount spent by the base's employees. But he said what rankles most about the decision to shut the installation is that it negates the impact of the hundreds of millions of dollars in Federal assistance that has poured into the area since the hurricane.
"It feels like they sent us all this help right off the bat, and now they are leaving us and just taking off," Mr. Pages said. He is worried that with the Federal Government appearing to bail out, other people here will say, "If Homestead is not good enough for them, why should I stay?"
A week after the base closing was announced, the Homestead area was struck by the same devastating winter storm that later hit the Northeast. Winds of up to 80 miles an hour overturned trailer homes, killing one woman, and blew down a tent city that had opened the first week in March to provide shelter for some of the estimated 5,000 people still homeless from the hurricane.
Bruce Netter, director of the tent city, which is operated by Dade County and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Miami, said that many of the families flocking to camp had recently been evicted from storm-damaged apartments by landlords who had received insurance checks and wanted to rebuild. Others had been ordered by county inspectors to leave their homes because they were unsafe.
 
Discouraging Odyssey
 Dianna Ackerman and her two sons, Joseph and David, were among the people who sought shelter at the camp as soon as it opened, moving into a brown canvas tent she mockingly calls "our penthouse." That decision was made only after a long, discouraging odyssey.
At the time of the hurricane, Ms. Ackerman was working at a fast-food restaurant and living in an apartment with her children and a friend who had signed the lease. When the building was destroyed, the friend decided to leave town. Ms. Ackerman took her remaining belongings and moved into a trailer camp operated by the Federal Emergency Management Administration.
But a few weeks ago, she said, she was told she was no longer eligible for the housing because she could not prove she had been living in the hurricane zone at the time of the storm. "I didn't have enough documentation, so they told me I had to leave," she said. "They gave me 48 hours to move out."
In some respects, Ms. Ackerman said, moving into the tent city came as a relief after the trailer camp, where she frequently heard gunfire and was robbed six times, losing a microwave oven, a coffee maker, dishes, linen, a bicycle and her children's video games.
"That was what hurt the most, losing the kids' stuff," she said. "And when somebody broke in just before Christmas and stole the presents from under the tree, I just snapped. I threw the tree out of the trailer, I was so angry."
But when residents of the tent city were evacuated to a local high school auditorium on March 12, she was robbed again. "I went to help set things up, and I left my purse on my cot," she said. "When I came back, somebody had rifled through it and taken the $165 I had saved up since the hurricane."
Ms. Ackerman said that while she hopes her lot will improve in the tent city, she still has moments of doubt.
"There are times I just have to go into the tent, close the flap and cry," she said. "It seems like this is never going to end."

"It really brings you down." (Keith Meyers/The New York Times)

HEADLINE: France's Conservatives Drive Home Their Victory

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, March 28

 BODY:
Confirming its strong showing in the first round of voting last weekend, France's main conservative coalition completed its trouncing of the governing Socialist Party today by winning a huge parliamentary majority in a runoff election.
Projections based on nearly complete results gave the Union for France coalition 487 seats in the 577-member National Assembly, reducing the once-powerful Socialists to an almost marginal 67 seats. The Communist Party and its allies won 23 seats, while the far-right National Front and an environmental alliance won no seats. 
 President Francois Mitterrand, whose second seven-year term ends in May 1995, is expected to name a conservative Prime Minister early this week. The favorite is Edouard Balladur, a former Finance Minister whose neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic is the single largest party in the Assembly.
The new Government's main challenge will be to revive France's flagging economy. At home, it plans to privatize many state-owned corporations. Abroad, it is committed to defending French agriculture in global trade talks, a stance that could bring it into conflict with the United States.
 
Largest Majority Since 1815
 Although the conservative coalition was the first choice of only 39.5 percent of the voters last Sunday, it will control more than 84 percent of the seats in the National Assembly as a result of the country's unusual two-round voting system. That is the largest parliamentary majority enjoyed by any political group in France since 1815.
The neo-Gaullist leader, former Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, who hopes to succeed Mr. Mitterrand in the Elysee Palace in 1995, said tonight that "our responsibility is now as large as our success." He pledged that the Union for France would govern with "determination, moderation and tolerance."
The debacle for the Socialists is in turn expected to result in an uneasy "cohabitation" between the country's 76-year-old Socialist President and a conservative Government that is determined to exercise its powers to the full. Mr. Mitterrand, who was also forced to cohabit with a conservative Prime Minister from 1986 to 1988, is to address the nation on television Monday evening.
Tonight, Laurent Fabius, the Socialist Party's leader, said the left had experienced "a very severe defeat" and he blamed rising unemployment, corruption scandals, a feeling of insecurity and fatigue with the ruling party. "I don't think our ideals have been sanctioned, but rather some of our practices," he said.
The party suffered a particular setback in the runoff today when Michel Rocard, a former Prime Minister who has been considered the front-runner to become the Socialists' presidential candidate in 1995, lost his parliamentary seat to a little-known conservative challenger in a district of Les Yvelines outside Paris.
Last month, Mr. Rocard tried to raise his party's spirits by promising to form a broad new movement from the ruins of the Socialist Party after its widely predicted defeat. Tonight he said he remained a presidential contender, but his political standing has been badly undermined. "The left has lost and I have lost with it," he said.
Several other prominent Socialists also lost their seats in the Assembly, among them Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, former Education Minister Lionel Jospin, Justice Minister Michel Vauzelle, Industry Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Civil Service Minister Michel Delebarre and Kofi Yamgnane, the Integration Minister.
But some key Socialists whose political future had been in the balance held on to their districts, including Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy, Culture Minister Jack Lang, Interior Minister Paul Quiles, Urban Affairs Minister Bernard Tapie and Mr. Fabius, the party leader.
The only well-known Socialist to emerge untainted from the debacle, though, is Jacques Delors, who currently heads the European Community's executive commission in Brussels and who was not a candidate today. Mr. Rocard's defeat has boosted Mr. Delors's hopes of winning the party's presidential nomination in 1995.
Among other political groups, the long-time Communist Party leader, Georges Marchais, won re-election, benefiting along with almost two dozen other party candidates from a concentration of Communist and anti-conservative voters in specific industrial districts.
 
Le Pen Loses in Nice
 But the leader of the extreme-rightist National Front, Jean-Marie Le Pen, lost with 40.5 percent of votes in his district in Nice, and Marie-France Stirbois, the only National Front lawmaker in the outgoing Assembly, was narrowly defeated. The only two environmentalist candidates eligible to take part in the runoff were also beaten.
The conservative sweep was signaled last Sunday when 80 conservatives -- and no Socialists -- won their seats outright with more than 50 percent of the vote, leaving 497 seats to be decided today. To take part in the runoff, candidates had to take more than 12.5 percent of the registered vote in the first round.
As the results came in tonight, Socialist, Communist and National Front leaders all complained bitterly about a voting system that so strongly favors a dominant party. "This assembly is not in the image of the country," Mr. Lang said. Mr. Le Pen, whose party ran third in the popular vote last Sunday, said the results of the runoff had confirmed the "glaring injustice" of the system.
Although the Union for France ran single candidates in all but 69 districts, its two main parties, the Rally for the Republic and the center-right Union for French Democracy, were nonetheless competing today for the right to nominate the new Prime Minister and assume the mantle of France's largest party.
 
Chirac Gets Edge Over Rival
 Projections gave Mr. Chirac's party 247 seats against 217 seats for the Union for French Democracy, which is headed by former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing. Other conservatives won an additional 23 seats. The results will also give Mr. Chirac a head start over Mr. Giscard d'Estaing in their already open race for the coalition's presidential nomination in 1995.
After the stunning defeat of the Socialists last Sunday, Mr. Chirac called on Mr. Mitterrand to "assume the consequences" and retire from office, paving the way for early presidential elections that polls say the neo-Gaullist leader would win. But Mr. Giscard d'Estaing pointedly reaffirmed Mr. Mitterrand's constitutional right to finish his term.
Two opinion polls taken last week to measure whether the public wants Mr. Mitterrand to leave office came up with contradictory results: the poll by Sofres said 51 percent wished him to remain in office; the B.V.A. poll said 55 percent hoped he would retire.
The President himself has made it clear that he will serve out his term if his health permits. He is suffering from prostate cancer, but remains active and visited Washington and Moscow this month. He also intends to exercise his constitutional right to determine French foreign policy.
Significantly, Mr. Rocard, who blamed Mr. Mitterrand two weeks ago for the Socialist Party's unpopularity, said tonight that he looked to the President to play "a fundamental role in preserving our institutions." He added: "He knows that he will have the support of everyone in France who values democracy."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Secondary Market Is Sought

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Lawmakers in the House and the Senate are mapping out divergent paths to a common objective: creating a secondary market in which small-business loans can be bought and sold in much the same fashion that mortgage-backed securities are traded.
Advocates of a secondary market for small-business borrowings say it could unleash a flood of investment capital that would wash away the biggest obstacle facing many small companies: a lack of credit. 
 The point of creating a secondary market is that a bank that makes a loan to a small business will have a way to sell that loan, at a profit, to investors around the country. And the cash that the bank gets from the loan will enable it to make additional loans. So the secondary market is, in effect, a way to bring more people into the business of lending to small businesses and, at the same time, spread the risk of these loans.
 
 
Fundamental Difference
 But there is a fundamental difference between the approaches being offered by two New Yorkers, Representative John J. LaFalce, an upstate Democrat, and the state's Republican Senator, Alfonse M. D'Amato. The House proposal would establish a Government agency to sponsor the transactions, while the Senate bill would just clear away some of the legal underbrush and let private business and finance manage the market.
Some bankers oppose the LaFalce bill, which would set up a Venture Enhancement and Loan Development Administration for Small, Undercapitalized Enterprises -- an elaborate name devised to produce the acronym Velda Sue, which would join a family tree of nicknamed Federal loan backers, like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, Sallie Mae and Farmer Mac. The Independent Bankers Association of America contends that Government subsidies, even implicit ones, would undercut banks making traditional loans.
There are doubters of the D'Amato approach, too, including the North American Securities Administrators Association, a body of state regulators. In the association's view, the Senate proposal would not go far enough to standardize commercial loans before allowing investors to buy and trade them, and the resulting market would not be regulated enough.
Still, proponents of a secondary market say that whatever approach is adopted, it would carry enormous potential.
Marianne K. Smythe, director of the division of investment management at the Securities and Exchange Commission, said the commission had not endorsed a particular approach but thought that creating a secondary market was "probably the best -- and quite possibly the only -- technique for really ending the credit crunch that has afflicted small business across the country."
The S.E.C. has already freed some commercial lenders to package and resell certain loans, exempting them from some securities laws' provisions.
 
Shape of First Offering
 Already, the first such offering is being shaped. A thick prospectus now sitting on the S.E.C. shelves describes a share offering of the Fremont Small Business Loan Master Trust. What investors would be buying are shares in a pool of commercial loans made by a big lender, the Fremont Financial Corporation, to small businesses.
But the prospectus repeatedly emphasizes the drawbacks. "There currently is no secondary market" for the securities, "and there is no assurance that one will develop," Fremont cautions.
Despite the commission's decision last fall to exempt offerings like Fremont's from the burdens of the Investment Company Act of 1940, many legal and practical barriers remain to making the practice widespread. In particular, it is hard for banks to package and resell loans under current regulations, which for example can require the banks to retain capital to protect against loan losses even after the loans have been resold to other institutions or investors.
 
Government Guarantees
 A Government guarantee can go a long way toward removing the barriers, as is shown by the experience of the Small Business Administration. Last year, private lenders who arranged S.B.A. loans, which are 90 percent guaranteed, resold the guaranteed portions of the loans for $2.1 billion. Altogether, there are some 35,000 such loans worth $7 billion on the secondary market. The original lender increases its profits by holding onto the unguaranteed part of the loan and collecting service fees.
Other Government-sponsored organizations that sell securities backed by loans include the Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae), the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac) and the Resolution Trust Corporation.
But the complexity of doing so with ordinary commercial loans seems daunting, experts have testified in a series of hearings in recent weeks.
"Commercial loans are not standardized in either documentation or in terms of their underlying collateral," said Kenneth J. Bacon, director of Resolution Trust's securitization office, which has used asset-backed securities to work off $35 billion in mortgages previously owned by bankrupt savings and loans.
 "For some types of business loans, the appropriate credit analysis is much more complicated than it is for others, and credit rating agency criteria are much less developed. The servicing is complicated, because most commercial loans take the form of a line of credit. This means that principal balances can change radically from month to month as borrowers either make payments to or advances against their line of credit."
And the debt of small companies would, especially at first, seem like the kind of investment that keeps people awake at night.
Unlike a $20 million package of mortgages, which might spread the risk across 200 borrowers, a similar-size package of small-business loans might involve only a handful of borrowers. Investors would look closely at the borrowers, and the shares would probably be priced and traded more like corporate bonds than like mortgage-backed securities. Rating agencies, meanwhile, might be very conservative in grading the securities. It is not clear that the borrowers' costs would go down under these circumstances.

HEADLINE: Shoreham Plant Is Proposed As Terminal for New Ferry

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WADING RIVER, L.I., March 25

 BODY:
When the Shoreham nuclear-power plant was built here more than a decade ago amid protests and fears of a nuclear accident, no one envisioned it as a peaceful ferry terminal.
But a deep canal built to draw water from Long Island Sound to cool the nuclear plant's reactors may now become safe harbor for a new class of high-speed ferry service to Connecticut. 
 With the controversial $5 billion plant being decommissioned for possible conversion to a gas-powered electric generator, state planners are looking for ways to use the rest of the site.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo envisions a privately operated ferry service from Shoreham to New Haven, using high-speed vessels that could carry cars and tractor-trailers. The service would cut travel time across the sound to less than an hour and would ease some of the traffic congestion on the Long Island Expressway, the Throgs Neck Bridge and the New England Thruway in the Bronx, Westchester County and southwest Connecticut.
 
Advocates and Opponents
 A ferry terminal would be built at the end of the 12-foot-deep Shoreham canal, which could be widened at one end for the ferries to turn around. And since Shoreham occupies about 80 acres of a 449-acre site owned by the Long Island Lighting Company in the Town of Brookhaven, there would be plenty of space for parking and ferry support buildings, said Richard Kessel, chairman of the Long Island Power Authority.
But the ferry project is not without its opponents, and it would require approval of state and local officials in both New York and Connecticut, as well as Lilco, which still owns much of the property around Shoreham.
So far, Connecticut officials have agreed to cooperate with New York in developing the project, and Lilco has taken a wait-and-see position. The power authority, which bought Shoreham from Lilco for a dollar under a state plan to decommission the nuclear plant, is one of the biggest advocates of the ferry proposal.
Mr. Kessel recently led a group of local officials and six potential bidders for ferry service around the site. They walked over landfill to the edge of the canal and peered out over two manmade jetties that extend northward into Long Island Sound.
Mr. Kessel said Long Island had suffered over the last decade because of the Shoreham controversy. "It's been a noose around our neck," he said, "but an alternative use like this would help ease that tragedy, as well as the economic drain on the Island."
 
Bids for Conversion
 He said Mr. Cuomo wanted to consider all alternative uses for Shoreham. And while the state would not subsidize a ferry service, he said, the Urban Development Corporation would help with the financing.
Mr. Kessel said the process of decomissioning Shoreham was several months ahead of schedule and could possibly be completed by the end of this year. He said that three consortiums had filed bids to convert the plant to a gas-powered electric generator and that the power authority would decide on the matter soon.
Among those touring the site was Capt. Brian McAllister, president of the century-old Bridgeport-Port Jefferson Steamboat Company. He said he was concerned that a Shoreham-New Haven ferry service might take away at least 50 percent of his current business and that he would like to make some runs from the Shoreham terminal to hold on to those passengers. His line, founded in 1883 by a group of businessmen, including P. T. Barnum, carries about 700,000 riders a year.
Mr. Kessel said, "The last thing the state wants to do is hurt other businesses." He suggested that perhaps a consortium might be interested in developing the new ferry terminal so that more than one line could use it.
Henry L. Peryebrune, assistant commissioner of the New York State Department of Transportation, said the question about the impact on the Bridgeport-Port Jefferson line had come up in Connecticut. He that it would be up to private investors to determine that impact and risk and that neither state could be expected to subsidize a new ferry line.
A terminal at Shoreham would be linked directly with the William Floyd Parkway, which runs south to Fire Island, crossing the Long Island Expressway at mid-island. Besides the Bridgeport-Port Jefferson line, the only ferry service across Long Island Sound is at the eastern end between Orient Point and New London, Conn., which also serves as a hub for summer service to Block Island and Fishers Island.

HEADLINE: In Russia, It's Business as Usual

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
As they watched the tug-of-war between President Boris N. Yeltsin and Russian lawmakers unfold last week, American companies with operations in Russia went stoically about their business, even as events reinforced the risk and uncertainty of functioning in a country at odds with itself over the pace and direction of economic change.
In part, the lack of reaction reflected a realization on the part of many businesses that nothing much of substance could be done in a situation that was changing by the hour. 
 "We don't think there is much need to react quickly, because our products are part of daily life, and daily life goes on," Rudy Kunert, the senior vice president in charge of Central and Eastern Europe at the Otis Elevator Company, said in a telephone interview from his Paris office.
Otis has four joint-venture companies in Russia, the newest of which began work on March 1.
Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, companies doing business there have come to see developments at the municipal level as having more immediate relevance to their operations than power struggles in the central Government. "Many companies have made their deals with regional authorities, so what happens in Moscow has little effect on them," said Robert Hormats, vice chairman at Goldman Sachs International.
"That is certainly true in cities like St. Petersburg and Volgograd, which are moving further toward reform than the reformists in Moscow," he said. "The fact is that the role of Moscow in many regional decisions has declined substantially. I don't know if that is reversible, even if a hard-line group resistant to foreign investment and foreign companies came in."
And then, too, companies that have operated in the country for some time said events of the last week carried with them a very real sense of deja vu.
"We had tanks moving past our office during the 1991 coup, but in Moscow our office stayed open and helped customers," said Andrew B. Somers, executive vice president and general counsel at American Express, which has offices in Moscow and St. Petersburg and has been doing business in the country since the late 1800's except for a period during Stalin's rule. "We are used to the uncertainty of the system."
Despite Russia's vast commercial potential, the thought of operating amid continuing crisis has kept all but the hardiest from venturing in. And even though the pace of commercial exploration by American companies seems to be picking up, at this point it remains well below that in other Eastern European nations.
 
200 Joint Ventures
 As of now, there are 200 joint ventures involving American companies in Russia, according to the U.S.-Russia Business Council, a Washington-based trade association established earlier this year. The council estimates total direct investment by American companies over the last five years to be only a bit more than $400 million.
During that time 300 companies have opened offices in Russia, the council says, up from 40 just two years ago. Still, the level of activity pales in comparison with what could be expected in a country with 150 million inhabitants and vast oil and natural gas reserves.
In Hungary, which has a population of 10.5 million, Western companies invested $1.5 billion in 1992 alone.
"The uncertain political and legal environment are the big problems in Russia," Mr. Hormats said. "It's not so much that the country is in a deep recession that borders on a depression. It's knowing whether or not the entity you are dealing with is speaking with authority."
 
Oil Companies Waiting
 Indeed, Western oil companies scrambling to nail down deals in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union, are holding up what are likely to be tens of billions of dollars worth of investments until critical legal issues are resolved.
Phibro Energy Production, a subsidiary of Salomon Inc., is one oil company that did not wait. But its experience is a testament to why Mobil, Exxon, Shell and Marathon remain on the sidelines.
In the two and a half years since it received approval from the Soviet Government to begin development drilling in three oil fields in western Siberia, Phibro has sunk well over $100 million into its White Nights joint venture.
But Phibro maintains that new tax laws have completely undermined the economic viability of the project. The most significant is an export tax on hard currency earned, a tax that Brian Lavers, the chairman of Phibro Energy, says takes away 30 percent of gross revenues.
 
Tax Exemption Delayed
 Heavy lobbying by then-Ambassador Robert S. Strauss persuaded Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar to exempt Phibro last July from the tax. But late last year Mr. Gaidar, a leading advocate of economic change, was forced out, and Phibro's exemption has not yet been implemented.
"We have submitted documents to various committees for the past nine months," Mr. Lavers said in a telephone interview from his home in Sussex, England, "and all indications are they have everything they need and we will get the exemption in the next few weeks. Present events could crater all of that."
Once the export tax is exempted, Mr. Lavers said, "we should have enough money to slowly but surely build up our production further and get into the black."
Mr. Somers at American Express said the Russian Government's progress toward developing a legal system "in tune" with modern commerce was slow and erratic.
"An enormous amount of work remains to be done," he said. "But they are trying and have extremely bright and able lawyers and judges. I am optimistic that over the next few years they will have developed a commercial framework that will make it easier to operate."

PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES SCRAMBLE FOR MONEY
As states reduce aid to higher education, public universities, especially those in the Northeast, are having to become more competitive in private fund-raising, once largely the domain of private universities.

Elgabrowny, said the equipment was confiscated shortly after the F.B.I. arrested his client earlier this month at his home in Brooklyn when, they said, he interferred with a search. B3.
 
WACHTLER'S FRIENDS OUTLINE HIS CASE
It all began with a hang-up, say friends of Sol Wachtler, who have been suggesting what his defense will be to Federal charges of extortion, mailing threatening letters to Joy A.

HEADLINE: Machine Tool Orders Rise on Stronger Export Demand

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Machine tool orders rose sharply in February, in part because of strong export orders, the industry's trade association will report today.
The data provide further signs, along with recent figures that showed stronger factory orders, higher production and longer workweeks, that the health of American manufacturing continues to improve. 
 Machine tool orders, which tend to swing wildly from month to month, surged 61.5 percent in February from January, to $283.6 million, according to the Association for Manufacturing Technology in McLean, Va., which plans to release the figures today.
A better gauge of the underlying trend is that for the first two months of 1993, orders were 5.9 percent ahead of those in the corresponding period last year. Shipments, meanwhile, were down 5.1 percent from January, to $236.2 million, but up 17.5 percent for the year to date.
Machine tools are metal-cutting and metal-forming machines that are used in the production of most capital equipment, from aircraft to bulldozers to generators, as well as automobiles and appliances. Forecasters watch the $7 billion machine tool sector because its ups and downs can signal trends in business investment and exports. Exports account for about one-sixth of the market for American tools.
While the report is upbeat, it hardly suggests a boom or an imminent spurt in hiring. Orders so far this year are not running ahead of shipments the way they did last year. And order backlogs are a shade below the average for 1992. The pattern hints that equipment spending for the United States market remains robust, but that it may not necessarily keep rising at the 14 percent annual rate of last year's final quarter.
Prospects for machine tool exports, however, seem to be brighter. Export orders were up 14.5 percent in February, to $39.5 million. For the year to date, export orders were 70.5 percent higher than for the corresponding period last year and were running slightly ahead of shipments abroad.

HEADLINE: Trade Growth Rate Rises

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: GENEVA, March 28

 BODY:
The growth rate of world trade increased in 1992 for the first time in four years as North America emerged from recession and large developing countries maintained their strong demand for imports, the governing body for world trade says.
In its annual world trade report, to be released Monday, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade said the volume of world merchandise trade increased last year by 4.5 percent. That was 1.5 percentage points more than in 1991 and was the first time a slowdown in growth had been reversed since a global recession began in 1989. The overall value of trade rose by 5.5 percent, while trade in commercial services -- including transportation, telecommunications, banking and insurance -- grew by 8 percent. 
 GATT said North America, mainly the United States, and Asian countries excluding Japan were the best-performing regions for both export and import growth. Imports grew sharply in large Latin American states and in the Middle East.
Although there were signs the overall trend would continue this year, the report warned that economic problems in Western Europe and Japan could darken the outlook.
"If the forecasts of a modest pickup in world economic growth in 1993 turn out to be correct, it is plausible to expect an expansion of world trade in real terms of at least equal to the 4.5 percent recorded last year," the report said.
But it said there was a widely shared perception, partly based on a slowdown in trade expansion in the second half of 1992 when the rate was well below the average for the year, that "much of the risk was on the downside."
The report said that the countries expected to show relative strength in 1993 were in North America and Asia, particularly Hong Kong, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Health Plan: Sweeping Yet Selective

BYLINE: By LISA BELKIN

 BODY:
The sweeping plan to change New York State's health care system, unveiled by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo on Saturday -- with its proposed regulation of doctors' fees, limitations on high-cost technology and encouragement of primary care medicine -- was perhaps most significant for what it did not say.
The Governor and his advisers faced a complex spectrum of options, many of which have been tried in other states and all of which are before the health care task force forging a national policy in Washington. What Mr. Cuomo chose and did not choose is a measure of the political and emotional status of the debate, a prediction of what the Clinton Administration will propose, and an attempt to respond to the health care crisis and influence the outcome of the debate.
 
Philosophy and Economics
 He did not, for instance, propose that the state insure all its citizens. Hawaii, the only state that currently takes on that responsibility, has been doing so for 17 years, by requiring employers to pick up the cost of insurance premiums for any person working more than 20 hours a week. Vermont, which has the only Governor who is a doctor, has passed a plan that would provide universal health insurance by 1995. And Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey has proposed the state subsidize private-health-care groups, like health maintenance organizations, to pay for the uninsured. 
 Philosophy, as well as economics, led to the decision against state-financed univer sal health care, said Michael J. Dowling, the Governor's director of Health, Education and Human Services.
"That's the job of the Federal Government," Mr. Dowling said in a telephone interview. "If they leave coverage to the states, then we're all in trouble."
The release of the Cuomo report five weeks before the Clinton Administration is scheduled to complete its own report will ideally communicate that message to Washington, Mr. Dowling said.
"We did think of that, yes" Mr. Dowling said. "We would hope the President would look at this."
Something else the Cuomo proposal does not do, which the Clinton task force is believed to be leaning toward doing, is to require a system of managed competition under which organized networks of doctors and hospitals compete for large groups of consumers and businesses by offering low prices and high quality.
Perhaps the best known model of this plan is in California, where the California Public Employees Retirement System, or Calpers, represents more than 875,000 state and local employees and their families. Calpers shops for the best deals from insurance companies, and last year kept its rate increase to 3.1 percent when the state average was 13.2 percent.
 
A 40-Page 'Blueprint'
 The 40-page Cuomo proposal is described as a "blueprint" rather than a detailed plan, but it seems designed to encourage managed competition, not require it.
"We will encourage health-care professionals to join with one another to coordinate a whole range of health-care services for their patients," the report says. "Further, we will encourage professionals to join with institutional providers of care to create comprehensive service organizations or consortia, called 'Preferred Health Networks.' "
The argument against requiring patients and doctors to band into negotiating groups is two-fold, Mr. Dowling said. Most important, he said, competition does not apply to medicine as it does to the marketplace. When two neighboring hospitals compete, he said, they create a "medical arms race" paying ever higher salaries to attract doctors and ever more equipment to attract patients.
Competition has been the rule, he said, "for 100 years and so far it hasn't worked."
In addition, he said, requiring patients to join a health maintenance organization does not sit well with many patients, who polls suggest cherish the ability to choose their doctor. The potential requirement that patients join a health maintenance organization is one of the most controversial topics before the Clinton task force.
"You've got to find a balance between saying to the public this is where you go and who you see," Mr. Dowling said, "but at the same timing keeping some control over the situation."
 
Shift Away From Specialists
 The control in the Cuomo proposal takes three forms. First, it encourages a shift from the higher priced specialists, who currently make up 70 percent of doctors in the state, to lower priced primary care doctors, like internists, family practitioners and pediatricians, who currently account for the other 30 percent. Mr. Cuomo's plan would attempt to flip that ratio by encouraging doctors to go into primary care with such incentives as higher reimbursement for primary care treatment, state assumption of the medical school loans of primary care doctors, and grants to medical schools that emphasize primary care.
Second, the plan would whittle at what the report calls the "overuse" of medical care. Noting that there are more Magnetic Resonance Imaging machines in the eight counties of Western New York than in all of Canada, the Cuomo administration would require the state to approve purchases by doctors of equipment costing more than $400,000. In addition, the state would try to monitor the impulse of doctors and the demands of patients to use new drugs and new machines simply because they are available.
The phrasing of the part of the proposal aimed at reducing such overuse is yet another example of what Mr. Cuomo chose not to do. The Governor did not propose a rationing system similar to the one in place in Oregon, where 688 medical procedures are ranked according to their effectiveness, and the state refuses to pay for any procedures ranked below 568. The money saved by not paying for those categories will provide Medicaid for 120,000 Oregonians who would otherwise have no insurance.
The problem with the Oregon model, Mr. Dowling said, is that it only addresses overuse among Medicaid recipients, and does not touch most of the highest costs of care.
 
Regulation of Fees
 Which leads to perhaps the most controversial part of the Cuomo proposal -- the regulation of all doctors' fees. The capping of fees would be phased in slowly, and the Governor has said that outpatient surgical rates would be the first to be regulated, beginning as early as 1996. The rates could be set either specifically or in ranges and would vary by region. Eventually the state could control all doctors' fees for all procedures and all patients, regardless of how patients were insured.
It is unclear whether doctors could learn to work around the limits. Medicare currently caps fees, but an industry has grown up to help doctors work the system to best advantage -- computer software, for instance, that determines how best to describe a procedure so that it qualifies for the highest possible reimbursement, or breaking up a procedure into several parts, the sum of which is reimbursed at a higher rate than the whole.
It is also unclear whether, and in what form, the Cuomo proposal will finally be approved. Action from Washington might make many of its provisions moot. The Democratic-controlled Assembly has, in the past, favored a system of state-financed universal health care and may quarrel with its absence from the Governor's plan. The Republican-led Senate, in turn, has long been considered a protector of physicians and hospitals and an opponent of regulation.
What is clear is that the plan, if adopted, will make New York the only state with such widespread cost controls.

Madness That Goes Past March

BYLINE: By IRA BERKOW

 BODY:
THE Knight Commission recently released its bold analysis of intercollegiate athletics and told us everything that is required in order to wreak reform: The presidents of the universities, of all people, should take control of their institutions, and they, along with administrators, faculty, coaches, students, athletes, boosters, parents, and, presumably, the librarians, the book sellers, the volunteer fire fighters, the chimney sweeps and the bartenders, among others, must also strive together to advance the notion of "academic integrity, financial integrity and accountability through certification."
And all along most of us thought that that's what these universities were supposed to be up to, to begin with. 
 And the timing of the release -- a four-year study, in fact -- was perfect, at the height of March Madness, when television networks pay billions of dollars to universities to show their scholars chasing basketballs all across the country. For some, this passes for the pursuit of higher education.
And it appears highly unlikely that anything will change significantly. The reason is, few in charge truly want to make major changes or have the courage to do so.
The Knight Commission, as Barbara Bergmann, an economics professor at American University and a former president of the American Association of University Professors, said, was "essentially a cheerleader for the whole regime."
"What we have to deal with, and what wasn't dealt with by the Commission," she said, "was fake students taking fake courses. We have professional athletes on college campuses, and everything flows from that."
The inherent evil in all this is that it corrupts the whole notion of the values and ethics a university is supposed to be teaching. The university essentially holds itself up as a model of virtue. Many, in fact, are a model of hypocrisy. And high-stepping at the head of this parade of 76 trombones plus a trio of 7-footers from the basketball team and a passel of 300-pounders from the football squad is the school president.
What wasn't said by the Knight Commission, a "blue-ribbon panel" funded by the Knight Foundation, is that big-time athletics must be corrupt, or, at least, a distortion of the purpose of a university. How can it be otherwise when, for example, the basketball coach is paid so extravagantly?
Basketball coaches often earn twice the salary of professors in less visible arenas, like a chemistry lab. With other incentives provided and allowed by the university, like lucrative shoe contracts, a basketball coach like Rick Pitino of Kentucky makes close to $1 million a year.
The demands on the time of big-time student-athletes, meanwhile, from practice to travel to weight room, are so great that they can only be the best athletes they can be, not the best students. And this is the emphasis by the coaches, regardless of rhetoric to the contrary. It is a long chain: the best athletes, dreaming of making the pros that only a handful realize, make the best teams, which make the coaches profitable, which puts a glow on the cheek of the athletic director, which makes the president purr, which gets the trustees to puff out their chests, which makes the governor count his votes for reelection.
A small item in the papers last week reflects just how far the "new model for intercollegiate athletics," as the Knight Commission calls its study, has to go:
Pat Foster, the basketball coach at the University of Houston, is taking the job at the University of Nevada at Reno, after that school fired Len Stevens for -- what else? -- not winning enough games. Besides Foster's base salary of $115,000, Nevada will pay him $1 a head for each fan over an attendance of 4,500 at home games. The Wolf Pack last year averaged only 4,427 fans in its 11,140-seat arena.
Surely, Nevada hopes to fill seats the way its in-state rival, that institution of athletic rectitude, U.N.L.V., has. The Nevada-Reno president signed off on this, of course. How does he expect Foster to fill the seats? With a better team. How does Foster get a better team? He recruits it. And who, dear heart, will he recruit? Members of the National Honor Society?
The electricity of March Madness and April Apoplexy is provided by professional entertainers. The last point was not raised in the Knight Commission report. In fact, the only way for legitimate change is for the players to either be paid and retained as students as they themselves decide, or for the schools to return athletics to its original intent, a basic recreation.
The rest, as they say in academia, is cheerleading.

HEADLINE: Big Insurer's Path to Crisis Is Study in Mismanagement

SERIES: Lost Millions: The Empire Blue Cross Story -- First of three articles

BYLINE: By JANE FRITSCH with DEAN BAQUET

 BODY:
Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, the nation's largest nonprofit health insurer, has lost tens of millions of dollars over the last decade through a series of management mistakes that have mired the company in financial crisis and undermined its dominant role in New York's health care system.
Empire, which can turn no customer away, has complained loudly of the battering it takes from giant commercial insurance companies, who can pick and choose their customers, offering policies to the healthiest and rejecting the sickest. And commercial insurers concede that their goal is to find the youngest and healthiest pool of customers.
 
Quality Customers Lost
 But an examination of Empire's management, including internal company reports and state audits, and interviews with 16 current and former high-ranking executives, shows that many of the company's problems are of its own making. 
 It lost more than $100 million on what officials concede was a poorly conceived health maintenance organization. Major corporate customers, the gravy of the health insurance industry, have defected from Empire over complaints about poor service. And Empire has created a public-relations nightmare for itself, angering legislators and attracting auditors by spending millions on perquisites and politically connected consultants and lobbyists.
At the core of Empire's problems is a series of computer fiascos that have spanned nearly two decades. Empire's inability to build a computer system that could keep track of tens of millions of claims, the heart of any insurance company's business, has cost it millions of dollars and fostered a reputation for poor service.
 
Costly Computer Problems
 In the mid-1980's, for example, Empire was forced to write off $50 million that had gone uncollected or unbilled because of computer problems dating to the mid-1970's, according to an internal report obtained by The New York Times.
One glitch involved a computer system that could not understand bills of $100,000 or more. A $103,000 premium, for example, would be interpreted as only $3,000, and the smaller amount would be billed to the client. That failure occurred 29 times and cost Empire $3 million, the report said.
Albert A. Cardone, Empire's chief executive officer, said such problems are ancient history. Empire is in financial trouble, he said, because it has stuck to its mission of providing insurance to as many people as possible, despite a national health care crisis.
"Empire deserves an enormous amount of credit for fidelity to a mission that is in the best interest of New York State," he said. He called Empire the "safety net" of the health-care system. "God help us if the safety net breaks," he added.
The problems of Empire are not unique among the 71 companies that make up the nationwide Blue Cross and Blue Shield network. Last year more than a dozen Blue Cross plans were on a financial watch list for failing to meet the reserve requirements of the national Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association.
 
Under Mounting Scrutiny
 And in recent months, Federal and state regulators have raised questions about the business practices of many of the companies, including the payment of high salaries and pensions to top officials of financially ailing plans. Congressional investigators, who have already looked into Blue Cross plans in several states, are in the initial stages of an inquiry into whether mismanagement contributed to Empire's recent losses.
Empire officials say they have worked mightily to resolve the technical problems that have led to complaints about service. The company spends millions of dollars each year to survey customers to pinpoint problems. And it has recently increased supervision of its customer-service staff.
Still, the computer problems persist. An expensive new electronic system for handling claims -- being developed by a former board member -- was expected to be finished about 18 months ago, but is not likely to be completed until later this year.Empire has invested $17 million in that venture.
Another failed computer system -- purchased from another Blue Cross and Blue Shield organization -- was a primary reason for the huge losses of Healthnet, Empire's health maintenance organization. But more than that, the problems have caused an exodus of some of Empire's most valued customers, and created a lingering aura of incompetence.
The financial troubles of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield organizations have emerged just as the Clinton Administration begins to assess the role insurance companies will play in a reshaped health- care system.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, saying that New York cannot wait for Washington to act, Saturday proposed sweeping changes in the state's health care system that would have a major impact on the way Empire and its commercial competitors do business. Under one part of the plan, every health insurer in the state would have to offer coverage to everyone, as Empire does now.
 
The Threat
Depleted Reserves A Major Concern
 By the late 1980's, Empire found itself in a weakened position, just as big commercial insurers were making significant inroads in luring customers in New York. The increased competition for young, healthy customers, combined with Empire's own mistakes, has depleted the company's reserves and caused it to lose $250 million in the last two years.
By law, Empire should have more than $500 million in reserve, the financial cushion deemed essential by regulators, but in recent years, the state has waived the requirement for Empire. The company ended 1992 with about $40 million, and turned to the state for a 25 percent rate increase and a one-time rebate of $100 million from a state insurance fund.
"I would say that they're in a position where nobody's going to cut them any slack," said Salvatore R. Curiale, the state insurance superintendent. He said he agrees with Empire's assessment that the company's financial problems are largely the result of bruising competition from commercial insurers.
Mr. Curiale said he had met recently with Thomas Kinser, the executive vice president of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, to discuss Empire's fate. He quoted Mr. Kinser as saying that Empire is in danger of being thrown out of the national organization. Losing the affiliation would further damage Empire's image and destroy its ability to share business with other Blue Cross plans.
 
A Nationwide Burden?
 Mr. Curiale said, "The national members, the various Blue Cross and Blue Shield associations out there, are scared to death that here we have a seven-million-plus-subscriber company, the biggest of the plans, that somehow if it fails, they will be saddled with that responsibility."
Mr. Kinser said the association had told Empire that it must bring its reserves to $90 million by the end of 1993.
While acknowledging the financial difficulties, Mr. Cardone said: "We never missed a beat; we never missed a claim payment; we never missed a payroll. We have experienced some incredible distractions around here with all of these barbs coming at us that we're mismanaged."
State officials acknowledge that a health care system without Empire -- something once unimagined -- could have a disastrous effect on a system already in crisis. The Legislature has hired Arthur Andersen & Company to determine whether Empire is well managed.
Some legislators have accused the state Insurance Department of not being more aggressive in overseeing Empire.
 
A Special Mandate
 Mr. Curiale rejects the criticism. "We were regulating the company to the extent that we're permitted by law," he said, "and also to the extent of our expertise. We can't go in there and say, 'This is what you should do with your computer system, this is what you should do with your marketing.' "
Empire provides insurance for 8.5 million people in 28 counties from the New York City area to Albany. Eighty-five percent are in large group policies sponsored mostly by big corporations and labor unions. These are Empire's best customers because they include many young and healthy people.
But 15 percent of the policies are in the individual and small-group markets. These are the customers commercial insurers have long avoided by charging them high rates or simply denying them coverage. The state's health insurance system is built around Empire's promise that it will accept any customer who can afford its premiums, no matter how sick, and set rates without regard to sex, age, or medical condition.
In return, Empire does not have to pay state or city taxes, including property taxes on the skyscraper it owns in midtown Manhattan. Most significantly, it pays hospital charges that are 24 percent lower than those paid by profit-making insurance companies.
But last year Empire complained that the commercial insurers were siphoning their best customers. In response, the Legislature passed a law, which will take effect Thursday, requiring insurers that sell policies to small groups to take all customers, regardless of their health or occupation.
 
The Background
A Merger Creates A Troubled Match
 Although Empire did not begin losing money until 1989, the seeds of its present crisis were planted in 1974, when the state forced the marriage of two nonprofit health care insurers, Associated Hospital Service, which handled hospital claims, and United Medical Service, which handled claims for doctors' bills. The new company became known as Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Greater New York.
The state hoped that Associated Hospital would shore up the financially troubled United Medical. While the new company did well financially, the merger created lasting problems involving the handling of claims for doctors' bills. For doctors, claims filing is a haphazard affair. Many still resist using computers, and their rates vary widely. By contrast, hospitals have entire departments devoted to filing accurate and standardized claims.
For the last 20 years, the company has been engaged in a costly, frustrating and largely unsuccessful struggle to build a computer system that can handle these claims efficiently.
In addition to the $50 million write-off in the mid-1980's, Empire encountered another major computer problem involving the handling of claims for New York-based corporations with workers scattered around the country.
 
Massive Computer Problems
 Typically, an Empire customer outside New York sends a claim to the local Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan, which pays the claim and sends the bill on to Empire for reimbursement. Empire then bills the employer. The system began to break down in 1984. The new computer rejected claims missing trivial information, like ZIP codes, creating a backlog of claims worth tens of millions of dollars.
As the company tried to catch up, it double-billed some employers and failed to bill others, according to an internal report prepared for the company by Louis A. Craco, a lawyer hired in 1988 to investigate allegations of mismanagement lodged by the company's former treasurer, Gustave O. Mattia. Altogether, Empire lost as much as $80 million because of the computer problem, company records show.
In a 1989 interview with state regulators, Empire's controller, Stephen B. Bell, said the big corporations became increasingly frustrated with the foul-ups. Some dropped Empire and signed up with other companies.
 
The Medicine
A New Venture Leads to Big Losses
 One of Empire's most troublesome problems in recent years has been Healthnet, the health maintenance organization that has lost more than $100 million. It was set up in 1985 in response to commercial insurance companies that were flooding New York with their own HMOs. Under most HMO plans, customers pay a fee that covers virtually all the medical services they may need throughout the year.
Dr. Michael Bihari, Healthnet's former medical director who left Empire in September 1992, said Healthnet failed for a variety of reasons, including poor planning and bad timing. Despite the popularity of HMOs in other parts of the country a decade ago, he said, New Yorkers were skeptical and preferred to stay with doctors they knew.
But one of Healthnet's chief problems was its computer system, he said. "Anything that could go wrong with a computer system went wrong."
Over the objections of some Empire computer experts, the HMO managers decided to use a system created by the Michigan Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan, according to a former high-ranking executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
 
A Costly Failure
 The executive, who was familiar with Empire's computer operations, said the system could not keep track of the complex formula used to calculate payments to doctors who participated in Healthnet. Within two years, Empire had scrapped the system and turned to another computer.
From its inception, Healthnet was headed for problems, Dr. Bihari said. For several months, until Dr. Bihari was hired in 1986, it had no medical director. As a result, when more than 10,000 doctors applied to join Healthnet, the staff was overwhelmed and had trouble evaluating the doctors.
Some doctors lost interest in Healthnet because it became clear that it could send them far fewer patients than it had promised, said Dr. Bihari, who now works for a health care network in Connecticut. And each one required enormous paperwork. "It was a huge network with very few members," he said.
At its peak, Healthnet had about 6,000 doctors and about 120,000 patients, a far smaller ratio than Healthnet had hoped for, Dr. Bihari said. About one-third of the doctors were primary care physicians who, in a normal practice, would have had between 1,000 and 3,000 patients, he said. Instead, they had 60 or 70 patients each.
 
Learning From Mistakes
 Eventually, Healthnet got into a "death spiral," Dr. Bihari said. Because it was losing money, the company had to raise premiums. But the higher premiums drove away the healthiest customers. That left sicker people in the plan, who where more expensive to treat, so rates had to be raised.
He said Empire has learned from its mistakes at Healthnet and used the knowledge to form a second managed care network called Empire Blue Choice.
After a year, it is meeting its early goals and has 58,000 patients and about 6,000 doctors, 2,000 of whom are primary care physicians, the company said. It is expected to lose money in the first years, but could undergo significant expansion if, as expected, the Clinton Administration's health-care proposals include an emphasis on managed care.
Mr. Cardone acknowledged the losses to Empire, but said the harm to the company might have been greater if Healthnet had not been created. Commercial insurance companies, he said, might have lured away even more of Empire's customers.
Mr. Cardone said Empire is "perfectly positioned" to play a major role in an overhauled health care system because of its historic focus on providing insurance to as many people as possible. "Our culture is not to find how to dump people," he said. "It is to find how to insure them."
Despite all of Empire's internal problems, Mr. Cardone said the company was making money until the commercial insurers began their "cherry picking" assault on the company in the 1980's.
"We are up against competitors who are misbehaving," he said.
Empire says it has lost 30 percent of its small-group customers and 35 percent of its individual accounts over the last three years. And these were the healthiest customers, according to the company. The average person who left had $1,590 a year in medical bills, compared to $2,820 for those who stayed, leaving Empire with a customer base that is sicker, older, and more expensive to treat.
Empire said the problem has worsened because commercial insurers have become sophisticated at identifying and luring away low-risk customers. Some refuse to take on high-risk professions, like people who handle hazardous waste, the company said. Others are far less blatant, opting instead to offer the sick and elderly exorbitant rates.
 
Seeking Healthy Customers
 Mr. Cardone said the Guardian Life Insurance Company of America is one of the worst cherry-pickers. But Edward K. Kane, senior vice president and general counsel of The Guardian, said that Empire is looking for a scapegoat for its problems by putting a sinister cast on an essential business practice.
The heart of insurance underwriting, he said, is risk selection, which means going after the healthiest customers.
"We've been doing this for 35 years," he said. "Why are they complaining now. Nothing has changed in the last three years. All the tax breaks they get is to make up for the fact that they do not do risk-selection. I think Empire's financial problems run far deeper."

HEADLINE: How to Break Food-Stamp Cycle

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Food Stamps Users Up Sharply in Sign of Weak Recovery" (front page, March 2): 
 One reason for the continuing growth of food stamps that you do not mention relates to the working poor, who head more than one-quarter of all food-stamp households. A higher proportion of workers are poor than in the past, largely because there are fewer better-paying industrial and unionized jobs. Fewer jobs offer wages based on the value of the employee to the employer, and more and more are based on what an employee will accept as an alternative to no job at all, which is not much of a choice.
But it goes beyond that. Economists, politicians and journalists talk about our market economy, but most ignore the market effects of the food stamp program. Wage levels do not just happen. They are based on what an employee is willing to accept. Thanks to food stamps, a low-wage employee can accept less. The less an employer pays, the more food stamp program pays proportionally.
Each year more and more wages are set at artificially low levels, and the taxpayer makes up the difference, in effect subsidizing employers. That is one reason food stamp costs have risen 50 percent faster than the food stamp population. Unemployment compensation benefits have also been depressed, as well as the wages of many not on food stamps.
The crisis in food stamps has been building since median income started falling 20 years ago. Presidents Carter and Reagan responded by reducing benefits; but this merely lowered the real poverty standard and made more people poor. More than 10 percent of Americans now collect food stamps. Something has to be done.
There is a good solution available, and that is to raise the minimum wage, for example to $8 an hour. This would accomplish several things: It would reduce the effect of food stamp benefits on wages; it would reduce food stamp disbursements without hurting recipients; it would reduce the deficit significantly; it would stimulate the economy; it would reduce crime and social problems.
The costs, which I won't go into here, are well outweighed by the benefits. Note that it should preferably be done in conjunction with a proper trade policy that protects our people from unfair sweatshop competition from overseas, which is brutal to people in this country and abroad.
Our fiscal and economic crisis presents a special opportunity for our Government to change its focus away from disbursing funds and toward passing laws that make the private sector fulfill its responsibilities. It is also a chance to switch from "trickle-down" economics to an economics in which demand is increased from the bottom up.
The 1980's demonstrated that increased demand (from the middle and upper class) was not inflationary, despite what economists have always claimed to the contrary. This was because the economy has plenty of capacity. It is time for the Clinton Administration to learn from this and start solving problems in ways that are fair and cost-effective, and that also work.

HEADLINE: Change in Puerto Rico Will Affect Mainland

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Hurricane Bill Threatens San Juan" (Op-Ed, March 11) by Rafael Hernandez Colon, former Governor of Puerto Rico:
Puerto Rico will not be the only victim of a Clinton Administration plan to wipe out tax incentives to companies that build plants in United States commonwealths and territories. The proposal's impact will ripple clear up to New York City. 
 As Governor Colon points out, studies by two respected accounting organizations foresee widespread and devastating economic havoc sweeping Puerto Rico when American pharmaceutical companies leave the island in response to the demise of these tax breaks.
Where do unemployed Puerto Rican workers look when their luck turns sour? Northward to New York City. Through this century, economic downturns in Puerto Rico have spurred large-scale migrations. New York may be in relative economic doldrums, but from the climate of a perpetually struggling economy like Puerto Rico's, these difficulties often seem slight by comparison.
New York City, Chicago, Orlando and other United States cities, which are ensnarled in their own fiscal woes, are ill equipped to provide thousands of new immigrants with jobs, housing and social services. These cities always have embraced new residents, but the added strain of a significant new migration on the social service system would be a great burden on their budgets.
United States cities must bear that burden if called on to do so. But all their residents, old and new, can do without further diluted city services. It would be a shame if President Clinton's generally constructive economic plan inadvertently weakens, rather than strengthens, the economy of the cities.

HEADLINE: Back to School for Honda Workers

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MARYSVILLE, Ohio

 BODY:
For the 5,400 workers who assemble the popular Honda Accord at a factory here, the unthinkable finally happened. Tougher competition from the Big Three and tepid demand for cars have forced the Honda Motor Company to trim production significantly for the first time in the plant's 10-year history.
Organizers from the United Automobile Workers union, which waged an unsuccessful campaign to organize the plant, had warned years earlier that if Honda ever slipped, workers would suffer without protection of a union contract. 
 But instead of laying off hundreds of workers until business improves, or spreading the pain by imposing a holiday on everyone, as American car makers often do in similar situations, Honda is using the extra time to intensify training.
"We've never guaranteed there won't be layoffs," Roger Lambert, a Honda spokesman, said. Nevertheless, "when we decided we would have to reduce output, we didn't see this as a way to cut 200 workers, we saw it as 5 percent more time for training."
In Big Three plants, workers who are laid off receive what amounts to a paid vacation under their union contracts. Honda decided to use this time to teach its workers new skills, reasoning that it would be an investment in future productivity.
Honda says its commitment to training is a strategy for enlarging the capability of its work force so that its rebound will be magnified when tough times improve. For Honda and other Japanese auto makers operating factories in the United States, constant training has been a key tactic in their battle against American auto makers. And it is no coincidence that improved training is a part of the Clinton Administration's program for revitalizing American manufacturing.
"It's hard to find American companies that are going the training route, but they must if they want the flexibility that will allow them to absorb the shocks of the economy and the market," said Harry Katz, professor of industrial relations at Cornell University.
For example, Mr. Katz said, teaching workers concepts that help them analyze their jobs may allow them to spot potential trouble spots before problems occur, reducing scrap and lost production time. Richard L. Cowan, a Honda instructor who also teaches mechanical engineering at Ohio Northern University, was teaching a dozen workers corrosion theory during a recent visit. "Unlike students, these people ask pointed questions because they have real-world experience," he said. "For them, the answers address specific problems."
Many of Honda's classes are as short as an hour, covering technical subjects like pneumatics, hydraulics and electronics. Much of the material is aimed specifically at professional engineers, but many skilled workers also attend. Honda calls many members of the latter group "engineers," though they lack formal degrees.
 
 
More Than 600 Courses
 The course listing, with more than 600 entries, also offers nontechnical subjects like Japanese, export marketing and the methodology of the J. D. Power & Associates quality survey. Every course indirectly reflects Honda's ethic of constant self-improvement, which the auto maker believes is vital to accomplish outsized manufacturing feats like changing new models without stopping the assembly line.
In the course of Japan's steady encroachment on the American automotive market, few years were like 1992. Successful new models like the Jeep Grand Cherokee, higher Japanese prices, soft automotive demand and "Buy American" fever helped the Big Three battle Japan's seven auto makers to a standstill. As a group, the Big Three gained market share, while the Japanese lost. In 1992, the Ford Taurus displaced Honda's Accord as the best-selling car model, a title the Accord had held for three years.
When Accord sales dwindled, many workers at the plant worried. "Our people always thought of Honda as this invulnerable object," said Steve Bishop, assistant plant manager and a former high school shop teacher.
Last fall, Honda announced it would build 110,000 Accords in the first quarter of 1993, down almost 11 percent from the 123,483 built in the first quarter last year. The rate translates to about 200 fewer cars a day. Rather than stopping production, Honda slowed assembly slightly -- which allowed it to move people from the assembly line to the classroom.
Last year, Honda workers attended an average of about 5,000 hours of technical training every quarter; in the current quarter, the down time on the assembly line has allowed Honda to increase technical training to 10,000 hours.
Honda will not say how much training costs. But experienced assembly work costs the company about $16 an hour. By contrast, Big Three auto makers are paying workers nearly their full salaries when they are at home on layoff. When Ford's Dearborn, Mich., assembly plant closed for a week earlier this month, nearly all of the 2,000 workers were at home. The company said that none of the workers were in class.
 
 
Shifting Production
 Among Japanese transplants, Honda is the first to grapple with a significant slowdown. The others have been spared, partly because their parent companies are slowing exports to the United States and shifting more production from Japanese to American factories because manufacturing costs have become very competitive in the United States. Even so, the Subaru-Isuzu assembly plant in Lafayette, Ind., has prepared for slack production by hiring temporary workers, who are more easily let go when orders wane.
If aggressive training at transplants has improved the competitiveness of some American workers, the factories themselves have made life difficult for the Big Three and the U.A.W. In the early 1980's, the United States auto industry and organized labor argued that cars and trucks should be built here if they are sold here, prompting the Japanese to adopt voluntary export restraints.
With every Japanese auto maker except Daihatsu now teaching their methods to American workers, the Big Three's political rationale for keeping the Japanese out has weakened. The Secretary of Labor, Robert B. Reich, has argued that the nationality of a company is far less important than the nationality of workers who learn world-class skills. This line of thinking was reflected when the Big Three decided not to pursue dumping complaints against the Japanese industry in January.
Honda's plant here, 30 miles northwest of Columbus, has undoubtedly raised educational horizons for many whose job prospects were once dim. Honda requires only a high school diploma and a good attendance record from prospective employees. Eventually, however, Honda workers and those at other transplants are pushed to learn more and accept more responsibility.
 
 
'More Thought'
 "Working in a Japanese company requires much more thought, evaluation and planning," said Jim Woroniecki, vice president of human resources for Subaru-Isuzu of America who once worked for Ford.
Workers at Honda must study inspection, cleanliness, safety, low-level maintenance and even the jobs held by co-workers.
Big Three plants are mimicking this training, but are held back in some cases by union contracts that prevent workers in some job classifications from being trained in other specialized tasks. At the same time, many Big Three executives concede they have not been as ingenious as they could be in devising training that would increase workers' skills.
Consequently, transplant workers suffer less from the boredom of assembly work than their American counterparts, one reason that Doubleday & Company listed Nissan's operation in Smyrna, Tenn., as one of the nation's 100 best companies to work for.
The training also gives transplant workers multiple skills: at the Nissan plant, for example, workers are able to switch from the truck assembly line to the car line, depending on where they are needed -- a practice that is far less common at American auto companies.
 
 
'Running' Changeover
 Transplants can also try manufacturing feats that the Big Three are just beginning to learn. Workers at the Subaru-Isuzu plant will perform a "running" changeover this autumn, replacing the current Subaru Legacy model with a new model without stopping the assembly line for a single day. Most Big Three assembly plants, whose traditional work forces are only beginning to wrestle with added responsibility, must close for weeks or months, replace machine tools, and hire numerous outsiders for model changeovers.
Back in Marysville, Honda will try a simultaneous running changeover for three new Accord models: sedan, wagon and coupe. Although running changeovers are routine in Japan, no auto maker in this country has ever tried it on three models simultaneously. Ford, however, has accomplished a running changeover for one truck model.
The heightened training ethos of Honda, Nissan and others has not been lost on the Big Three. "It's gotten more competitive; we're planning better," said Larry Seltz, Ford's supervisor of new-model introductions. Mr. Seltz vowed that Ford would bring out its 1996 Taurus without stopping at plants in Atlanta and Chicago. "I've got launch plans through 2001," he said.

HEADLINE: CLINTON CONSIDERS STOPPING MEDICAID UNDER HEALTH PLAN

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28

 BODY:
As part of its health-care plan, the Clinton Administration is considering a proposal to dismantle the Medicaid program and integrate low-income people into the same networks of doctors, hospitals and private insurance companies that would serve more affluent people, Administration officials say.
But poor people would probably receive medical and social services beyond the standard package of health benefits to be guaranteed to all Americans, the officials said. These might include additional dental care, transportation to a doctor's office and translation services for people who do not understand English. And the Government would help pay the insurance premiums and other health costs of low-income people.
 
'Really Serious Problems'
 Confidential work papers from Hillary Rodham Clinton's Task Force on National Health Care Reform say that maintaining a separate Medicaid program "would perpetuate segregation of the poor in the health-care system, with the associated adverse implications for access to and quality of care." 
 How to care for the nation's 35.7 million poor people is one of the most important moral, political and policy questions facing the Administration as it drafts a legislative proposal for sweeping changes in America's health-care system.
Drew E. Altman, president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, which is sponsoring a major study of Medicaid, said: "There are really serious problems in putting Medicaid into the new system, but that's what we ought to do. A separate program for poor people will always be a poor program, underfunded and neglected."
 
Questions Regarding the Poor
 Mr. Altman, a former Commissioner of Human Services in New Jersey, said he worried about how poor people, members of minorities and those with special medical needs would fare under the new system. For example, he asked, "How will a drug-abusing pregnant woman fare in a system of managed competition built on competitive bids, lowest price and a minimum-benefit package?"
While no final decisions have been made, the shift of millions of people out of Medicaid and into the networks of doctors and hospitals would probably occur over several years. Established in 1965 to finance health care for low-income people, Medicaid now provides care for more than 30 million people, including several million with incomes just over the official poverty level. It has become one of the fastest growing programs in the Government. The Federal Government expects to spend nearly $80 billion on Medicaid in the current fiscal year, while the states plan to spend $60 billion.
But many people, in and out of the Government, question whether the differing needs of poor people and the middle class can be adequately addressed within the same networks of doctors, hospitals and insurance companies. Doctors say poor people are more likely to have special health needs and problems, ranging from AIDS to drug abuse, tuberculosis, diabetes, high blood pressure and birth defects.
Throughout the work papers of the task force, it is assumed that Medicaid recipients "will be integrated fully or partially" into the new system, which the Administration calls managed competition.
Under that system, huge consumer groups, health insurance purchasing cooperatives, would buy health care from large networks of doctors and hospitals. Advocates of this proposal say the buyers will command so much economic power in the medical marketplace that they can get high-quality care at reasonable prices.
In most states, Medicaid recipients can now generally go to any doctor or hospital that will accept them. The doctors and hospitals are typically paid for each service or procedure they perform. But many doctors take only limited numbers of Medicaid patients, and some doctors and private hospitals do not take any.
Under Mr. Clinton's plan, more people would be enrolled in health maintenance organizations and similar groups. Government agencies and employers would pay a fixed amount, set in advance, for each patient. Rather than having unlimited freedom to use any doctor or hospital, consumers might have to go through one doctor, a "case manager," who would approve their use of specialists and hospitals.
Proposals for Medicaid do not imply any immediate changes in Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly. But the task force's working papers show that the Administration is considering changes in Medicare so it would eventually be compatible with the new health-care system for people under 65 years old.
 
'No Decisions' Yet
 Mr. Clinton has said he will send his health plan to Congress by May 3. He says it will control health costs and guarantee coverage for all Americans. Medicaid now covers fewer than half of the nation's poor people, mainly because of limits on income set by state laws regulating eligibility. For at least five years, states have been complaining about the crushing financial burden of Medicaid, which they say has limited their spending on education and other urgent needs.
Robert O. Boorstin, a spokesman for the health task force, confirmed that the Administration was considering ways for Medicaid recipients to enroll in health insurance purchasing groups. "Those options are on the table," he said. "But no decisions have been made. The details of such a change are incredibly complex."
The work papers list several options for shifting people from Medicaid rolls to the health insurance purchasing cooperatives, or H.I.P.C.'s. One option describes the demise of Medicaid this way: "As people leave Medicaid eligibility for any reason, they are enrolled in the H.I.P.C. No new eligibles enter Medicaid. Medicaid ends when its membership reaches X percent, with the remaining people shifted to the H.I.P.C. en bloc."
The documents say the Government may temporarily have "a residual Medicaid program for certain beneficiaries (e.g., those in institutionalized long-term care)," like nursing homes or institutions for the mentally retarded. Last year 1.5 million Medicaid recipients, or 5 percent of the total, used nursing homes, but they accounted for 26 percent of all Medicaid spending.
At a meeting with the staff of the health-care task force last week, Mr. Clinton affirmed his desire to continue providing and perhaps expand coverage for long-term care, not just for the elderly, but also for younger people who are disabled or chronically ill.
Administration officials said Mr. Clinton's proposal would emphasize care provided to people in their own residences, rather than in institutions. But the officials said Mr. Clinton had not decided how to control the cost of long-term care or how to pay for this or any other part of the health plan.
Ira C. Magaziner, the coordinator of Mr. Clinton's health task force, outlined the Administration's thinking at a meeting last week with four Governors. Gov. Howard Dean, Democrat of Vermont, who attended the meeting, said he received a clear impression that the Administration wanted to "mainstream the Medicaid population," enroll poor people in health insurance purchasing groups and "split off long-term care."
Mr. Dean, a doctor who serves as co-chairman of the health policy committee of the National Governors' Association, applauded that approach.
 
Additional Steps Possible
 Outlining his proposal then, Mr. Clinton said that most people would get private insurance coverage through their employers or insurance purchasing groups. Without giving any details, he said, "We will fold Medicaid into this program for private coverage."
In its work papers, the staff of the task force says managed competition by itself "may not adequately address the special needs" of people now receiving Medicaid.
Accordingly, the Administration may require the networks of doctors and hospitals to establish links with community health centers and other clinics serving poor people in inner-city or isolated rural areas.
Under Mr. Clinton's plan, as described by Administration officials, the Government will prescribe a comprehensive package of health benefits that must be provided by all employers and insurers. But the work papers show that the Administration is considering "supplemental benefits" for low-income people.
Federal and state officials say they assume that under Mr. Clinton's plan states will be required to spend at least as much on health care for low-income people as they now spend through Medicaid. For example, the work papers say, states may have to help the Federal Government subsidize the cost of enrolling poor people in health maintenance organizations or other networks of doctors and hospitals.

Hillary Clinton to Miss Talks
 LITTLE ROCK, Ark., March 28 (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton will not attend the first public meeting of the President's health-care task force in Washington on Monday, remaining here with her ailing father, aides said today. Mrs. Clinton, chairwoman of the panel, missed two health-care forums last week to be with her father, Hugh Rodham, 81, who has been hospitalized after a stroke. She will be replaced Monday by Vice President Al Gore.

HEADLINE: Cease-Fire in Bosnia Holds for a 2d Day, And Sarajevo Basks

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, March 29

 BODY:
A cease-fire across Bosnia and Herzegovina held for the second day today with only minor violations, encouraging the United Nations military commander here, Gen. Philippe Morillon, in his belief that the truce may be the beginning of the end of the year-old war.
Heavy gunfire broke out shortly before dusk in the bitterly contested western districts of Sarajevo, close to the airport, and there were reports of sporadic exchanges of tank, artillery and small arms fire elsewhere in the former Yugoslav republic. 
 But United Nations military officers in Sarajevo said the cease-fire was holding better than any of the previous cease-fires, which have rarely lasted more than a few hours.
The truce permitted the evacuation of 2,300 desperate Muslims from Srebrenica, the eastern Bosnian town that has been under siege since last May. But two children were killed in the crush and four other refugees died on the way. [Page A6.]
The stilling of the guns over most of Sarajevo was accompanied by the return of sunny weather after several days of heavy snowfalls, and the capital was filled with people strolling casually down roads that have been devoid of pedestrians for months because of the risk of sniper fire.
Some people took their walks along the embankment of the Miljacka River in the center of the city, an area completely open to Serbian gun positions on the nearby mountains, where scores of people have been killed or wounded by sniper and artillery fire.
For some, the sight of the snowbound mountains sparkling in the spring sunshine brought back poignant memories of the time that many Sarajevans cite as the best of all seasons here, the late winter of 1984, when the Olympic Games were held here in an atmosphere of camaraderie among Bosnians of mixed faiths and nationalities.
People sitting in the few cafes still open reminisced about their experiences at a time when Muslims, Serbs and Croats worked together running the Games with little expectation of the bitter nationalist war that has virtually destroyed much of the city.
"Oh, but you should have seen this city then!" said Ademir Kenovic, a director who has spent months gathering film of the war for a documentary that he plans to show this year at film festivals in Europe and the United States. But like many, Mr. Kenovic mixed his remembrances with foreboding about the future.
"Does General Morillon really think that the people on the hills have gone this far to stop now and start conforming to cease-fires and peace plans?" he asked.
A spokesman for General Morillon, Maj. Pepe Gallegos, said the French commander was "pleased with the cease-fire so far" and believed there was a good chance of extending it into a permanent truce.
 
General Expresses Confidence
 General Morillon, who was instrumental in negotiating the cease-fire, has long maintained that personal contacts with Serbian leaders and persistence in negotiating with them, rather than threats of force or increased pressure by the United Nations, would eventually end the Bosnian war.
On his return here on Sunday from Srebrenica, the general left no doubt that he regarded the cease-fire and Serbian guarantees of an end to attacks on Srebrenica as vindication of his approach.
"I'm crossing my fingers like everybody in the world at the present time," the general told reporters. "But I'm more confident because it's the first time in a year here when all three sides in the war have reached the conclusion simultaneously that they can benefit from an end to the fighting."
But many at the United Nations headquarters remain deeply skeptical, fearing that what General Morillon has achieved is less an end to Serbian territorial ambitions than a realization among Serbian leaders that their recent attacks in eastern Bosnia had raised international condemnation to a danger point.
These officials said they suspected that Serbian leaders had resolved to reduce tensions by curbing their attacks for the time being while remaining ready to resume their offensives when international attention wanes.
 
For Diplomatic Advantage
 Similarly, the officials said, they are doubtful that the Government's Army has accepted that the war is over.
Senior Bosnian commanders who gave President Alija Izetbegovic clearance last week to sign a peace pact drawn up by the United Nations and the European Community made it clear beforehand that they considered the plan, which provides for 10 provinces functioning as ethnic enclaves, amounted to a repudiation of their fight for a multi-religious, multi-ethnic state.
The commanders said, in effect, that Mr. Izetbegovic should sign the pact for the diplomatic advantage it would give him in his dealings with Western nations, not because they expected to have to abide by it.
One of those who seemed uncertain that Serbian military ambitions had been permanently curbed was Viktor Andreyev, General Morillon's civilian counterpart in the United Nations hierarchy in Bosnia.
"I have my personal doubts," Mr. Andreyev said when asked if he believed the war would end. "I think we will see ups and downs."
Mr. Andreyev said recent pledges by Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia, that he would press Serbian nationalists in Bosnia to end the fighting were "probably another little step in the right direction." But in general, Mr. Andreyev said, "unfortunately, I'm not very optimistic."
United Nations officials said the general had set a meeting of military commanders from the three warring armies at Sarajevo airport on Wednesday to discuss a proposal for "safe corridors" across the siege lines around the capital. The general has frequently urged the plan on the opposing sides, only to have it thwarted each time by renewed fighting.
The corridors would allow people to leave and return to the city, and they would also link Serbian territories on the periphery of the city that are separated by the fighting.
 
 
 
BALKAN UPDATE
Tuzla, Bosnia
The evacuation of wounded, ill and hungry Muslims who were cut off from aid in enclaves in eastern Bosnia is a mission of mercy that has proved treacherous to some of the very victims it was intended to help. The evacuees, including children, are being crushed and smothered as refugees fight for a space on the crammed flat-bed trucks bound for Tuzla.
 
Sarajevo, Bosnia
After a series of fragile cease-fires in Balkan fighting, forces in Sarajevo were adhering to their promises with only a few exceptions yesterday on the second day of the agreement.
 
Belgrade, Yugoslavia
While the Yugoslav Government awaited the Bosnian Serbs' decision on a peace plan, Serbian commentators on state television said negotiations on the terms might be possible after the plan is signed.
 
Zagreb, Croatia
The Croatian Government of Premier Hrvoje Sarinic resigned after six months in office, the Associated Press reported. Observers said economic failures and rivalries in the governing party played a part.
 
United Nations
The Secretary General asked the Security Council to approve the peace plan and urged Bosnian Serbs to sign it, while Lord Owen, a mediator, said the threat of lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia could put pressure on Bosnian Serbs to join the plan.

HEADLINE: Groups Laud Health-Care Reform In Theory, but Clash on Practice

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
After long clamoring for access to President Clinton's health-policy team, spokesmen for the elderly, doctors, dentists, chiropractors, hospital officers, insurance executives and other groups today fired a fusillade of proposals to remake the nation's health-care system.
At a daylong hearing of the President's Task Force on National Health Care Reform, the witnesses offered support for the general idea of a vast overhaul. But they frequently criticized details of the ambitious plan being devised by the Administration for submission to Congress in early May. 
 Many witnesses warned of major practical problems in the changes contemplated by the Administration. But their advice amounted to a crazy-quilt patchwork of conflicting ideas, a jumble that highlights the difficulty of changing the way Americans receive their health care.
The chairman of the American Medical Association, Dr. Raymond Scalettar, supported Mr. Clinton's proposal to require employers to provide basic health benefits for their workers, but he opposed price controls as unwarranted and unworkable.
Small-business owners, on the other hand, denounced the idea of a Federal requirement for employers to provide health insurance; one said such a mandate would be un-American.
Insurance companies warned the Administration not to regulate or limit premiums, saying such limits would threaten their solvency.
Chiropractors said one of the best ways to control costs was to "expand access to non-M.D. health-care providers," like chiropractors. Nurses, psychologists and social workers asked for a bigger role, saying they should be allowed to handle tasks now generally performed only by doctors.
Nursing home executives urged greater use of private insurance to cover the costs of long-term care. But the American Association of Retired Persons warned that "a system based on private insurance will increase total costs and leave millions uncovered."
Raul Yzaguirre, president of the National Council of La Raza, an advocacy group for Hispanic Americans, urged the Administration not to forget undocumented aliens. "These individuals live and work in this country," he said. "Their illnesses can pose a health risk for others in the community."
The hearing, described by the White House as the first formal meeting of the 12-member panel, was held in a basketball arena at George Washington University here. Vice President Al Gore presided over part of the hearing in place of Hillary Rodham Clinton, the chairwoman of the task force.
 
A Diversity of Interest Groups
 The meeting underlined the complexity of the task now facing Mr. Clinton, as well as the diversity of interest groups passionately concerned about health care in America.
The witnesses generally applauded the Administration for its efforts to control health costs and guarantee insurance coverage of all Americans. But many also expressed reservations about features of Mr. Clinton's plan, some details of which emerged during the Presidential campaign last year and in subsequent consultations with Congress.
In speaking against any Government requirement that employers provide insurance for their workers, Stephen Elmont, a vice president of the National Restaurant Association, said, "Mandates really are oppressive for small businesses," and he went so far as to say that "the concept of mandates is un-American."
Mr. Gore observed that restaurants were already subjected to mandates like food safety and sanitation standards. But Mr. Elmont said those mandates were different; he fears, he said, the possibility of "about $3,000 to $5,000 a year in insurance premiums for mandated health-care costs" for each employee in the restaurant industry. "We can't absorb those costs," he said.
The Administration summoned more than 60 witnesses to testify at the 13-hour hearing. The witnesses were organized by industry or constituency group into 12 panels of five or six members each. Each witness was given three minutes to make an opening statement, and each panel responded to the task force's questions for 35 to 45 minutes. When one panel was through, another was immediately called.
 
Ignoring the Cost
 No panel was devoted to the question of how to finance coverage for 35 million uninsured people, or how the nation could afford to guarantee all Americans costly benefits like long-term care and prescription drugs.
One group, the National Federation of Independent Business, which represents 600,000 small businesses, turned down an invitation to testify. Terry Hill, a spokesman for the federation, noted that White House officials had already said the President wanted to require employers to provide health insurance for workers. "It would be futile for us to testify," Mr. Hill said. "Their mind is already made up."
Doctors, insurers, hospital executives and drug makers urged the Administration not to impose price controls. The coordinator of the task force, Ira C. Magaziner, had said Mr. Clinton might ask Congress for the authority to impose such controls temporarily.
But Dr. Scalettar, of the A.M.A., said: "Effective cost control has never been achieved in this or any other economy through arbitrary caps on spending, or price controls. They did not work in the 1970's, only delaying natural price increases and impeding the supply of necessary goods and services."
G. Kirk Raab, president of Genentech Inc., speaking for the Industrial Biotechnology Association, said that if the Government set limits on prices of new biotech medicines, it would "dry up capital investment in our industry." Without that investment, he said, "we will not be able to discover cures and effective treatments for such expensive diseases as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, cancer and AIDS."
But Mr. Gore said the Administration intended to "stop drug overcharges and excessive profiteering."
"The days of business as usual are over," the Vice President said. "We are determined to bring this country sweeping and comprehensive health- care reform." Moreover, he said, "everyone who has been making lots of money off health care in the last 10 years will need to sacrifice in order to make the system work."
Mr. Gore said the Administration was "determined to help doctors by reducing paperwork and administrative costs and by doing something to curb malpractice suits." He said Mr. Clinton wanted to "encourage general practitioners instead of specialists," but he did not say how this goal would be achieved.
 
Fearing 'Managed Competition'
 Several witnesses expressed reservations about the strategy of "managed competition," through which Mr. Clinton hopes to encourage networks of doctors, hospitals and insurance companies to compete for the business of large consumer groups.
Dr. Richard O. Butcher, president of the National Medical Association, which represents black doctors, said this strategy might leave many people without medical care. "There has been no competition for the uninsured, the homeless, lower-income people, ethnic minority populations and the mentally ill," said Dr. Butcher. "It is unreasonable to expect a middle-class delivery system to embrace these populations."
Dr. Butcher said the Government should require businesses with 25 or more employees to provide workers with basic health benefits.
But Samuel A. Carradine Jr., executive director of the National Association of Minority Contractors, said such a requirement was not feasible in his industry.
"The nature of the construction industry demands mobility of workers from site to site and often from employer to employer," said Mr. Carradine. "The cost of employers' continuing to cover their workers in periods of down time or having to frequently cancel and reinstate workers would be financially disastrous."

HEADLINE: Talking to the Task Force on Health: Experts Give Their Views: Physicians;
Doctors Know That Change Is a Necessity

 BODY:

 Dr. Raymond Scaletter
 chairman of the board of trustees of the American Medical Association
I'm Ray Scaletter, chairman of the board of the American Medical Association, and we appreciate this opportunity to state once again our commitment to reform of the nation's health-care system. As we have said publicly the last several years and privately in the constructive opportunities we've had to discuss our views with representatives of the Administration and this task force over the last few months, America's physicians know that change is necessary. 
 As the patients' advocate, we know that far too many of our patients have no health insurance coverage. The hassles of providing care and the burden of paperwork and bureaucratic second-guessing frustrates physicians as well as our patients. And the costs of health care are rising too quickly for our patients and the good of the nation. We have not, do not, and will not defend the status quo.
You have asked what can be done to insure immediate control of health-care costs while insuring quality care and physician choice.There are direct workable solutions that can be implemented immediately.
An employer mandate to provide a federally established essential benefit package with community rating. Before I speak of them -- and our written statement expands on them -- I respectfully ask the task force to do one thing: look at experience. Contrary to perceptions, this nation does have experience in both health-system reform and controlling costs. One lesson to be gained from experience is that true effective cost control has never been achieved in this or any other economy through arbitrary caps on spending or price controls. They did not work in the 1970's, only delaying natural price increases and impeding supply of necessary goods and services. They also will not work in health care.
Price controls, or global budgets, mean arbitrary decisions that will, without basis, limit our ability to deliver needed medical care to our patients. We have suggested a better way, a partnership between government, physicians, employers, and others. By working together to isolate the costly failures in the health-care system, true budget predictability can be brought to this nation's health-care costs without limiting patients' access to medical care.
Another equally important lesson is that health-system reform has already been demonstrated to work in the United States. We are puzzled that more attention is not given to the successes in Hawaii and Rochester, N.Y.

 	 	 		. . .	 	VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE Let me just open it up by asking this question, and invite you to respond. What is the most important element of a new health-care system which can ensure patient choice of their doctor? Whoever wishes to respond.
 
John Tudor
President, American Academy of Family Physicians
I believe the most important is having a personal physician who would provide continuity, and, as Dr. Pearson said, if physicians are involved in more than one plan, even though economic benefit may shift from one plan to another, the option to stay with the same physician, even though you change plans, is an individual choice that families should have. Their personal care, their records, their availability to other specialists -- even the health-care team that works with them, allied health professions -- would all be coordinated under one focus, or medical home, as the pediatricians call it.
 
Dr. Jane Orient
Executive director, Association of American Physicians and Surgeons
The most important thing is to allow the patient to have control over his own money in an individual medical savings account instead of turning it all over to the third party. We believe that medical costs could be decreased probably by 25 percent just by instituting individual medical accounts for all Americans.

HEADLINE: Clinton Soothes Senate Anxiety Over Spending

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
For three sleepy days, nobody in the Senate wanted to vote on the spending plan President Clinton had proposed to stimulate the economy. Now, suddenly, they can't vote fast enough.
Spurred by a soothing letter from the President, Democratic lawmakers patched up one spat among themselves, shelved another with Republicans, and began serious legislating over Mr. Clinton's $16.3 billion grab bag of job-making public-works projects. 
 After a comparatively quick 90-minute debate, voting began on a series of Republican amendments, all aimed at restricting the spending package and most doomed to defeat. The threat of a Republican filibuster still exists, but Democrats expressed hope that they could pass the legislation as early as Tuesday.
 
Vacation Looms
 Time is precious. The lawmakers must vote on the spending package and a politically unpopular increase in the Federal debt ceiling before leaving on a two-week vacation, set to begin Friday.
The stimulus package has been stalled since Thursday, in part by the filibuster threat. But the real obstacles were conservative Democrats, who questioned the political wisdom of rushing to add $16.3 billion in public projects to the Federal deficit before voting on the less pleasant spending cuts proposed in Mr. Clinton's budget.
Conservative Democrats had sought to delay spending about half of Mr. Clinton's stimulus funds until the budget passed, probably this summer. "Let's make sure we don't eat the dessert without eating the spinach," Senator David L. Boren of Oklahoma said today, alluding to the relative appeal of approving public-works programs and reducing the debt.
 
Conservatives Reassured
 Mr. Clinton has argued that the economy needs a jolt of Federal spending before summer, but he defused the conservatives' objections today by saying in a letter that he shares their concern. In it, he pledged to seek additional Federal spending cuts if Congress passes a budget that does not meet his goals for reducing the deficit.
Mr. Clinton also noted that much of the stimulus spending will not occur until after the budget becomes law anyway, making the conservatives' objections more or less moot.
Another conservative Democrat, Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, hailed the letter, saying it went "a very long way to giving me the confidence" that Mr. Clinton was serious about cutting the deficit.
 
Republicans Not Swayed
 The Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, was unmoved.
"It's reassuring to have a letter from the President of the United States saying he agrees with people who didn't want to cut spending all along," Mr. Dole said sarcastically.
He is not the only angry Republican. Democratic parliamentary maneuvers have left Republicans the worthless option of trying to amend a version of the stimulus bill that will be tossed out and replaced by Mr. Clinton's package, when the final vote is taken.
Until today, Republicans rejected that option and threatened a filibuster. But tonight they put aside their displeasure and began offering amendments, led by a proposal to prohibit spending on a variety of parks and recreation projects for which cities are seeking Federal stimulus money.
Republicans argued that the projects are pork-barrel items not worthy of being called Federal emergencies, and in fact, Mr. Clinton has publicly agreed. Democratic leaders nevertheless moved tonight to kill the amendment but lost by 48 to 44. The Democrats will try again to kill it on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Clinton Likely to Seek Even More Russian Aid

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Mar. 29

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration is likely to ask Congress to increase direct American aid for Russia next year from the $700 million previously proposed to more than $1 billion, and to direct the assistance to Russian farmers, entrepreneurs and military officers, senior Administration officials said today.
Several key lawmakers involved in foreign aid said they would be inclined to go along with the increased spending for Russia if the President is willing to make the case to the American people. 
 The additional aid would very likely go to pay for housing loan guarantees to build prefabricated homes for demobilized Russian troops returning from Eastern Europe, a fund to help Russian entrepreneurs start up companies, and as food aid that the Russian Government could convert into a program to promote new industries.
All three proposals are on the list of aid programs President Clinton is expected to offer President Boris N. Yeltsin at their April 3-4 summit in Vancouver, British Columbia. The increase in direct aid would be in addition to American proposals to increase the amount of assistance, primarily in loans and loan guarantees, directed to Russia by the International Monetary Fund. The Administration last week said the I.M.F. should increase its aid to as much as $13.5 billion a year.
The direct aid from the United States would be separate from American efforts to increase credit assistance for Russia under the aegis of the International Monetary Fund and joint programs of the major industrial democracies known as the Group of Seven.
Politicians say that even if Mr. Clinton makes a big push for Russian aid, any package would face difficulty winning approval in Congress.
"Any foreign aid bill this year is going to be an uphill battle because no one wants to vote for foreign aid in the same year when we are voting to cut most U.S. domestic programs," said Sen. Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Senate Foreign Operations Subcommittee, which oversees foreign aid.
Senator Leahy said that "there are many of us who would back him all the way" if the President made a strong case, but added that "there is no way they can do all they want to do for Russia for less than $1 billion."
 
A Tough Sell?
 Administration officials said probably the biggest chunk of any additional aid to Russia next year -- over and above the $700 million already being sought -- would likely be in the form of "Food for Progress," an Agriculture Department program in which the United States takes wheat that it has purchased from American farmers to maintain domestic price levels and gives it away overseas. The main cost to the foreign aid budget is the price of shipping the wheat to Russia.
Senator Leahy has suggested to the White House that the United States give such wheat to the Russian Government, which would then sell iton the local market and spend the proceeds on opening bakeries or on other industries or use it to improve the country's food distribution system.
Last year the Congress and the Bush Administration agreed to spend $400 million in fiscal 1993 and in fiscal 1994 on technical assistance and humanitarian aid programs for Russia as part of the Freedom Support Act. In his budget for 1994, Mr. Clinton proposed an additional $300 million to bring the total to $700 million in the coming fiscal year, and now he is considering going even higher, aides said.
Mr. Clinton acknowledged today that increasing aid to Russia could be a tough sell, but that he is ready to propose do so, probably in a speech he is planning to give Thursday to newspaper editors in Annapolis, Md.
"Foreign aid is unpopular in every country in the world," Mr. Clinton told reporters in Little Rock today, where he was visiting his gravely ill father-in-law. "It's always been unpopular here. And I haven't really had a chance to talk much directly to the American people about what's going on there, what our stake in it is, and what their stake in it is."
Asked how members of the House might react to a request for additional assistance for Russia, Rep. David Obey, a Wisconsin Democrat who is chairman of the House Foreign Operations Subcommittee, said the amounts being discussed were not "out of line."
"We have got to make clear to the folks in Russia who say that the West is playing games and not really interested in helping them, that they are dead wrong," he said.

Farmers Cannot Afford Insurance

 BODY:

Nancy Danielson
Legislative representative, National Farmers Union
To put it very simply, farmers cannot afford not to have health insurance because they risk losing their entire farm, and yet the costs have become so high that this is one of the No. 1 issues any time we go out to a farm meeting. 
 Our principles are universal coverage, which has been a priority for us since 1938, affordability, a cap on the costs, choice of doctor and hospital, access in rural areas, preventive care and long-term access.
Unfortunately, in rural areas, we have a problem with access to physicians and hospitals. In fact, the average age of the rural doctor is 60 years of age, and this is even older than the average age of the average farmer.
Also, it's difficult and expensive to recruit doctors to the rural areas, and hospitals are moving to more and more expensive guarantee plans in order to get any doctors to come to their areas. In rural areas where they're not so lucky to have a hospital, it is even more difficult to recruit.
There are also vast differences involved in the amount of area that we have to travel for emergency care and for day-to-day care, and the Medicare reimbursement rate, which is slowly being equalized, has been a problem for us because rural areas are just as expensive to serve as urban areas.
We fear that managed competition may have some problems for the rural patient. First of all, we just don't have the number of H.M.O.'s to allow for the idea that is supposed to work with managed competition. Also, an aging population is less suited to the economics of H.M.O.'s and the cost savings may not occur.

HEADLINE: Hughes Shift Will Be Blow To California

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 29

 BODY:
In the latest blow to California's ailing economy, the Hughes Missile Systems Company said today that it would move its engineering and product-line management, including 2,000 jobs, from several sites in Southern California to its headquarters in Tucson, Ariz., by the end of next year.
The move, which follows Hughes Missile's $450 million acquisition of the General Dynamics Corporation's missile division last August, will also mean the elimination of an additional 2,000 engineering and management jobs, mainly through layoffs, in California and Arizona. 
 At the time of the acquisition, Hughes Missile had said that it intended to consolidate the company's five missile manufacturing plants under one roof in Tucson, ending major California production activities in San Diego, Pomona and Rancho Cucamonga, as well as production in Camden, Ark.
 
 
'Operating Efficiencies'
 But, until today, the missile company had left open the possibility that engineering and management operations could remain in California. Hughes Missile officials said simply that "operating efficiencies" dictated that the engineering and product management for missiles be consolidated in Tucson, where it would cost between 5 and 10 percent less to run those operations than in California.
In effect, today's announcement means that Hughes Missile will shut all its missile operations in California, except for its Sycamore Canyon facility near San Diego, where the company does loading and fueling and employs 500 workers.
The parent of Hughes Missile, Hughes Aircraft, is a unit of GM Hughes Electronics, a subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation. The earnings of Hughes Electronics are used to calculate the per-share earnings of General Motors class H common stock, which lost 12.5 cents a share on the New York Stock Exchange today, closing at $25.
Hughes Missile currently employs about 12,000 workers. Tucson has 4,200; Pomona and Rancho Cucamonga, 3,500; Canago Park, Calif., 1,900; San Diego, 1,600, and several other locations, about 1,000. The company said that when consolidation of its manufacturing and engineering operations was completed, it expected to have about 8,000 employees in Tucson at the end of 1994. When Hughes Missile acquired General Dynamics' missile division, the combined company had about 14,600 workers.
While Hughes Missile officials said that there was little that California could have done to convince them to remain, the officials nevertheless sharply criticized the state for doing little to keep businesses from leaving.
"Although the primary consideration for this move was the consolidation of our missile business into a more efficient operation, a part of this consideration is the economic environment in California," said C. Michael Armstrong, chairman and chief executive of Hughes Aircraft. "California is no longer a competitive place to do business."
Hughes Aircraft, the largest industrial employer in Southern California, announced plans last year to eliminate about 9,000 jobs in the region.
 
 
'Not as Easy' Decision
 At a meeting today with reporters at a Pasadena, Calif., hotel, Michael T. Smith, Hughes Missile's chairman, said that the decision to move to Tucson was "not an easy one but very necessary to successfully merge the two operations and make them competitive." He said that the company would lay off about 2,000 workers in the engineering and product-line management operations and that more than 6,000 jobs ultimately would be eliminated.
For California, which is suffering from its worst recession since the 1930's, the move is just the latest setback in a string of bad economic news. Under the Pentagon's latest proposal for base closings, California would lose 113,000 jobs. The state already has lost more than 200,000 aerospace and weapons jobs in the past five years.
Mr. Smith said that California was an undesirable state to do business for a number of reasons, including a very high cost of living, unreasonable environmental regulations and an expensive workers compensation system.
A spokeswoman for the California Trade and Commerce Agency said the state was developing a program of incentives to retain companies. She also said the state had saved 1,200 jobs at another Hughes unit by negotiating lower electricity rates for the company.

HEADLINE: Talking to the Task Force on Health: Experts Give Their Views: Small Businesses;
The Ruination Of Restaurants, Or a Benefit?

 BODY:

Stephen Elmont
Vice president, National Restaurant Association
Our industry is consumed and concerned about health-care reform. For the past few years, restaurateurs have struggled with staggering inflation and health-care premium costs, with cancellations, with denials of coverage, and now with the frightening prospect of mandates. We are not engaged in hyperbole when we say that mandated employer-provided coverage or higher payroll taxes to pay for health benefits would literally sound the death knell for many restaurants and discourage other restaurants from ever opening. 
 You have asked us to discuss the best ways to insure that employees of small businesses get health-care coverage. We believe the most essential element of health-care reform is cost containment. We adamantly oppose employer mandates, price controls and global budgets. Instead, we support many of the concepts upon which build the strengths of our free market system.

 	 	 		. . .	 	The concept of mandates is un-American, the concept of mandates of anything. We're in a free enterprise system where if one employer wants to do one thing that he or she feels is going to benefit either their customer and/or their employees, they're going to do it. And another employer may look at them with a jaundiced eye and say that's not going to improve my bottom line. So that we all sitting here are successful because we make decisions every single day on what's going to improve the customer experience, what's going to improve the employee experience. And so we oppose mandates for that reason.

 	 	 		. . .	 	VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE You have inspection of your food-preparation facilities and your sanitation and health standards and so forth?
A. Of course.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Is that voluntary?
A. No.
Q. Is it mandated?
A. Yes.
Q. Does it make sense?
A. Does it make sense? I think it makes sense, but there aren't enough resources to do a good job so we employ our own inspection agency.
Q. Would you describe it as un-American because it's mandated?
A. No, that's protecting the consumer.
Q. Well, the point I'm making is that some things when applied universally make sense, even if they're mandated, such as the inspection I'm talking about. You get a benefit from having this mandated health inspection because you don't have to compete with some other restaurant that cuts corners and doesn't provide the minimal standards, and your entire industry gets a reputation with the public of being safe. And you don't have to run the extra risk of some bad actor in your industry cutting corners so much that it gives the whole industry a black eye. So all that's a benefit to your industry from that mandated approach, isn't it?
A. If you want to talk about wellness in that way as compared to catastrophic illness, yes.
 
SECRETARY DONNA E. SHALALA Well, would you talk about Social Security that way? I mean, Social Security clearly is a mandate for the public good. Is there something fundamentally different between Social Security and health care?
A. It's because if I give an inch, I am terribly, terribly concerned about the cost of that inch, and that's why I'm so paranoid in talking about mandate versus not mandate.

HEADLINE: Italy's 'Moral Crumbling'

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME, March 29

 BODY:
If only a half or even a quarter of the allegations against them are true, Italy's leaders these last few decades have lived in a twilight world with a "B" movie plot.
Consider, for instance, some of the scams that have emerged from the 13-month-old investigation into political corruption: 
 *The World Cup soccer tournament came to Italy, arguably a great national honor. But when the contracts were awarded for the stadiums for this sporting extravaganza, they immediately became arenas of corruption, with construction companies paying bribes to politicians.
*As a land that has often boasted an increasingly plausible empathy for the third world, Italy draws up a foreign aid budget. But of the funds sent out from Rome for contracts to build highways for the poor in Bangladesh or Ethiopia, a little has stuck to the fingers of the politicians and officials administering the program in Rome.
*An earthquake struck south-central Italy, and more than 2,700 people died. Reconstruction became a free-for-all of diverted funds.
 
Many Draw From the Well
 All that, some veterans of Italy's Machiavellian politics will argue, is no more than was assumed by the country's 57 million people, many of whom drew some sustenance or other from the well-springs of illicit earnings controlled by the political bosses.
In a land where traffic lights, one-way street signs, income tax laws and even the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church are viewed more as challenges than binding instructions, it might have been foreseen that corners would be smoothed, obstacles circumvented, advantage taken where offered.
But with disclosures culminating this weekend in the still unsubstantiated assertions that former Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti and two other former Christian Democrat officials, Antonio Gava and Paolo Cirini Pomicino, associated with the Mafia, the plot has moved from "B" movie to "The Godfather."
This is the land that claims for itself the industrialized world's fifth largest economy, the land that prided itself on a rise from wartime ruin to postwar riches rooted in energy and inventiveness and competitiveness. Now, for some Italians, the vision is different, the bubble has burst.
 
'A Moral Crumbling'
 "There's a moral crumbling that starts at the top and has spread to the very bottom," said Franca Rame, an actress whose satirical monologues draw enthusiastic crowds.
Mr. Andreotti was and is far more than a player in the byzantine world of Italian politics. Before his political demise after elections last year, he was the world's longest-serving office-holder, a central player on Europe's postwar stage, a conservative link-man for the United States in the cold war battle against Communism. Many Italians suspect he is still the keeper of most of the nation's darker secrets.
Up to now, magistrates has uncovered illicit ties between businessmen and politicians. But in recent days, their inquiries have crossed a watershed to confront the politicians and businessmen's ties with the mob -- in Naples, Reggio Calabria and Sicily.
Mr. Andreotti was notified that he was under investigation by magistrates in Palermo, the stronghold of the Cosa Nostra, on Saturday. One day later, Mr. Gava, the Christian Democrat party boss in southern Italy, and Mr. Pomicino, also a Christian Democrat, were told they were being investigated by magistrates in Naples, where the local organized crime syndicate is called the Camorra.
Like Mr. Andreotti, both men denied the charges, but the news nonetheless propelled Italy's scandals into a new phase since it was the first time such high-ranking officials had been accused of affiliation with gangland figures associated with the killing of officials, narcotics smuggling, gun-running and extortion.
 
Focus on the South
 Moreover, it shifted the focus of attention to the relatively poor South, where for decades billion-dollar flows of Italian and European Community aid have built a symbiotic relationship between the politicians who dispensed the aid, the businessmen who won the contracts and the mobsters who offered their protection.
"In the South, a bribe bought you everything: the contract, subsidies and complete protection from competitors," Augusto Graziani, an economist, said.
The South is widely known as the Christian Democrats' electoral fief, but the virus of corruption seems to have infected other parties, too. In Naples, apart from the charges of connections with organized crime, magistrates are investigating allegations of fraud against a former Liberal Party official, Francesco de Lorenzo, and Vincenzo Scotti, a Christian Democrat who was prominent in the fight against organized crime when he was Interior Minister.
Even the deputy head of Italy's parliamentary anti-Mafia commission, Carlo d'Amato, a Socialist, is among a score of politicians under investigation for purported vote-rigging in Naples, where magistrates also suspect fraud in the awarding of contracts for garbage removal and the building of a World Cup soccer stadium.
The overall thrust of the allegations over the last 13 months -- even though many of them are formally unproven -- is that Italy's public visage masked an underworld where real power was transacted between those who were supposed to frame the law, those who disdained it and those whose motives were solely profit. A front-page cartoon in the newspaper La Repubblica depicted Mr. Andreotti removing the mask of his own face to reveal a death's head.
"The gods of the republic are disappearing," said Giorgio Bocca, a respected Milan commentator, "even Giulio Andreotti."

HEADLINE: Talks on Haiti Shift the Focus to Aid

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Sept. 29

 BODY:
As part of an emerging settlement of the 18-month political crisis in Haiti, support is being marshaled from international donors to quickly mount the largest aid program this impoverished country has ever seen.
Diplomats close to political negotiations aimed at securing the return of the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, say the assistance is vital to social peace in a country badly torn by poverty and deep class antagonisms. 
 These diplomats and aid experts describe the still embryonic program as a broad effort to rebuild or build from scratch everything from roads, power plants and water systems to a new police force and judicial system and a smaller, professional Army.
"For the first time we are going to have to create something like a real government for this country," a senior Clinton Administration official said. "It is going to be a full-court press. You will see a push to fill need right across the board."
 
$1 Billion May Be Just a Start
 During a recent meeting with Father Aristide, President Clinton used the figure of $1 billion to be spent over five years in Haiti, of which about one-fifth would be direct United States assistance. Already, however, officials are saying that given the breadth of Haiti's needs and the long odds of making a break with violence and poverty, more may have to be spent.
If a settlement can be reached soon, the aid effort will begin officially next Tuesday in Washington at a special two-day meeting of international donors to Haiti. In a measure of the urgency, however, the senior American official said "a lot of heads are kicking in on this right now."
In recent days, diplomats here have spoken with growing assurance that a settlement is near and that it would include Father Aristide's return. The terms would include the resignation of the Army leadership and the military-backed Government, and internationally supported protection from reprisals for the deposed President's supporters and opponents.
After the formation of a broad-based Government headed by a compromise figure of Father Aristide's choice, the plan calls for the President's return to Haiti within six months, buoyed by a bustle of economic activity.
Diplomats and experts on Haiti have long seen the country's stark poverty and a power-hungry Army that consumes over 20 percent of the national budget as the keys to Haiti's seemingly perpetual instability.
"The way things have been working here for so long, it is as if people were on the sinking Titanic," a diplomat said of the economy. "Instead of trying to mount a rescue, everyone has been arguing about which cabin they will sleep in."
The program would pour millions of dollars into an economy that has been shattered by years of instability and by an international embargo imposed to punish the supporters of the coup against Father Aristide in September 1991. It is intended to help secure the cooperation of the country's deeply conservative economic elite, which has bitterly opposed the populist President, and give hope and relief to Haiti's impoverished masses.
While the wealthy few are often fabulously rich, most of Haiti's six million people live without running water, electricity, schools or basic health care.
Some money would also be spent on a trained civilian police force and on the retraining of the armed forces, many of whose troops would be moved out of the capital to handle reconstruction.
"You are talking about the country that was already by far the weakest economic in the hemisphere," one development expert said. "There is just nothing to jump-start here."
Experts say reconstruction efforts will quickly face a shortage of trained Haitians untainted by corruption and intrigue. Father Aristide's first Government faced this problem, diplomats here say, when a combination of inexperience and infighting and overwhelming offers of assistance meant that few projects were undertaken during his eight months in office.
Already, these experts say, plans are being drawn up to recruit Haitians abroad to do everything from staffing ministries and overseeing development projects to investing capital in privatization and setting up new enterprises.

HEADLINE: Uproar Over Killing in China's 'Model' Village

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 29

 BODY:
Until the slaying, Daqiuzhuang was China's model village, the kind of boom town that the newspapers praised and officials made pilgrimages to. But model workers are not supposed to kill people. More important, model villages are not supposed to defy the Government and protect killers.
Daqiuzhuang is China's richest village, where people live in two-story houses and the per capita income is $22,000, a bit higher than in the United States. The confrontation there, in which the village kept out hundreds of police officers trying to arrest the suspects, is the hottest mystery in China. 
 The Government has not explained what happened in Daqiuzhuang (pronounced dah-cheeyoh-JWAHNG), and it has banned Chinese newspapers from writing about the episode. Chinese and foreigners alike are forbidden to visit the village, about 80 miles south of Beijing, and telephone links to Daqiuzhuang have been disconnected, except through special operators who screen all calls.
But from bits and pieces gathered informally from officials in Tianjin and Beijing, and information obtained from the village itself, it appears that a man was killed in Daqiuzhuang around the middle of February. Apparently he was a worker at one of the village's biggest enterprises, the Wanquan Group, which runs several factories including a steel processing operation.
Villagers say company officials discovered he had stolen 29,000 yuan, or about $5,000, from the accounts. The officials reportedly then confronted him -- with their fists.
"They beat 23,000 yuan out of him," said a villager who recently came to Beijing. "It's not that they intended to kill him. It's just that, well, it's possible that he wasn't in good health. And he hadn't eaten in a few days."
The dead man was from nearby Hebei Province, according to Gong Tieying, an official at the Tianjin city foreign affairs office. Daqiuzhuang administratively falls under Tianjin.
Since the men believed to be the attackers were natives of Daqiuzhuang, the village authorities moved to protect their own by blocking a huge posse of Tianjin police officers, a villager and two other Chinese familiar with the incident said. Mr. Gong denied reports that up to 1,000 policemen were involved, but said that 400 took part.
Daqiuzhuang has 4,400 inhabitants, and it came up with a police force that outnumbered the posse. The village police even confiscated the guns of the Tianjin police in a standoff that lasted three days, said another villager, a man in his 20's.
The dispute has apparently been eased by a complex compromise. The Daqiuzhuang authorities say that the four suspects have vanished, and the village has admitted a small team of detectives to investigate the killing.
The rest of the Tianjin police force withdrew from the area, although the Tianjin police maintain a road barrier about six miles from the village and check all cars leaving the area.
Daqiuzhuang itself is a bit of a mystery. Forsaking Communism long ago, it organized itself like a corporation, ran sweatshops with at least 7,000 cheap laborers from outside the village and leaned on its connections between the village's Communist Party secretary, Yu Zuomin, and officials in Beijing. It is widely believed to have a protector in the central Government, probably in Li Ruihuan, one of the seven members of the Communist Party Politburo's standing committee.
The village now has 280 enterprises, some of which are joint ventures with foreign partners who have pledged $34 million in foreign investment.
In a sign of its growing prestige, Daqiuzhuang apparently was on the agenda for a visit by China's senior leader, Deng Xiaoping. But after Mr. Deng's advance team investigated the conditions of the village, they decided that someone had to repave a 45-mile road, the village's only link to Tianjin, a Chinese journalist in Beijing said.
But Tianjin refused to pay for the repaving, causing friction between the village and the city even before the killing. Now, with the village's new-found notoriety, Mr. Deng is unlikely to visit. "The effects on us have been enormous," the Daqiuzhuang villager in Beijing said with a moan.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Makes Rounds Of Fund-Raising Parties

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Although Mayor David N. Dinkins has not yet officially announced his candidacy, his campaign was nonetheless in full swing last night as more than 270 supporters opened their homes to hold so-called "House Party" fund-raisers.
Officials of the Committee for David Dinkins said that no specific target amount had been set for the parties last night, but that each host was asked to set a fund-raising goal of $1,000. Guests were asked to contribute amounts ranging from $5 apiece at some parties to $500 at more lavish settings, campaign officials said.
 
Dinkins Attends 3 Parties
 The Mayor managed to attend three events, and he delivered a short speech which -- borrowing a technique from President Clinton's campaign -- was transmitted through a conference call to each of the homes. In his speech Mr. Dinkins outlined the themes that were likely to be at the centerpiece of his campaign, namely that he has been a diligent steward of the city's fiscal affairs during a crushing recession. 
 "I won't be satisfied until our economy is not only recovering, but thriving," the Mayor said. "We've stabilized our city. We've weathered the storm and laid the foundation for growth. But now we've got to better. Given the chance, I know I can lead our city into an even better, brighter future."
The house parties gave the Mayor an opportunity to conduct some vintage campaigning. One of the parties the Mayor attended was at the Upper West Side apartment of James M. Lebenthal, the chairman of Lebenthal & Company, a Wall Street securities firm. There Mr. Dinkins kissed babies and grandmothers while guests nibbled on mini crab cakes and radishes stuffed with cream cheese and chives.
 
'I'm With Him'
 Further uptown, at the Harlem apartment of Raven P. D. Dennis, a 25-year-old caterer, nearly 40 guests ate baked chicken, macaroni and cheese and green beans while they listened to the Mayor, whose voice could barely be heard on the small speakerphone. Mr. Dennis said his guests paid $25 each to the Dinkins campaign.
"Even though my home is small, I just wanted to find some way to show that I'm with him," Mr. Dennis said.

HEADLINE: The Fragile, Beleaguered Biotechs

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, March 29

 BODY:
These have been bleak days for the biotechnology industry.
President Clinton's public criticism on high drug prices has prompted fears that health-care reform will weaken the industry's profitability. Two high-profile drugs have failed to perform as expected in clinical trials. And Amgen Inc., the industry's largest, most profitable company, recently reported a slowdown in sales and earnings growth. 
 Any one of these factors would have been enough to frighten investors, who only returned to biotech stocks in November after shunning them for most of 1992. Together, they have prompted a huge selloff that has eliminated 33 percent of the industry's value since Jan. 1 amid a general market rally.
 
Little Profit, So Far
 While pharmaceuticals and indeed all health-care stocks have taken a hit while investors await the Administration's health-care proposals, the decline is most threatening to biotech companies. Few of the biotech companies make money yet, one reason they feel wronged by the President's criticism.
The lack of profitability means the biotech companies must rely more on equity capital than traditional drug companies do. If the public stock markets remain closed, many of these companies will not survive. "The industry is very fragile," said Henri Termeer, chairman and chief executive of the Genzyme Corporation in Cambridge, Mass. "Its needs and how it has been created have not played on anyone's minds in Washington."
Even the good news the industry received earlier this month had little impact on investor sentiment. An advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration recommended approval of the Chiron Corporation's Betaseron treatment for multiple sclerosis; a denial would have been devastating.
Chiron's shares closed up $1.50 in Nasdaq trading today at $47.75. But that was still well below the 52-week high of $63, and the rest of the group is also depressed.
"What's missing now is investor confidence," said Mr. Termeer of Genzyme. "One way to turn that around is for the industry to come up with some successful products." Otherwise, he said, given the biotech companies' voracious appetite for cash, "this industry would have to be dramatically restructured within the next 12 to 18 months."
A handful of biotech chief executives who have met privately with the President and other high-ranking officials seem reassured that the Administration appreciates the indus try's contribution to job creation, exports and even to the reduction of health-care costs. But they fret over the lack of public support from President Clinton.
"Many of the things that Clinton has been rightly or wrongly accusing pharmaceuticals manufacturers of are not true of biotech," said Stephen A. Duzan, chairman and chief executive of the Immunex Corporation in Seattle.
For instance, the President has accused drug manufacturers of spending more on marketing than on research and development. But because most biotech companies have no products, all their spending is on research and development. The President has also called some drug prices "shocking," implying that the drug industry is gouging customers to keep profit margins strong. Yet only a handful of biotech companies have any profits.
"The issues being taken on in health-care reform have to do with too many me-too drugs and marketing practices devoted to promoting me-too drugs," said Brook Byers, a partner in the venture capital firm of Kleiner Perkins Caulfield & Byers, which has financed many prominent biotech companies.
"The biotech industry is not about me-too drugs at all," Mr. Byers added. "It is about finding the fundamental molecular basis of a disease at the cellular level and intervening at that level by using an exquisitely specific drug with fewer side effects."
The approach has produced some notable successes. Amgen's Epogen, which raises red blood cells in chronically anemic kidney disease patients, has returned thousands of bed-ridden individuals to active life. Genentech's Protropin growth hormone has allowed children affected by dwarfism to grow to normal height. And Chiron's hepatitis-screening technology has vastly improved the safety of donated blood.
At the same time, biotech executives and some analysts say that the industry's failures must be viewed in context. Two drugs that recently proved disappointing in clinical tests, Centocor's Centoxin and Synergen's Antril, were for the treatment of septic shock, an often-fatal syndrome sparked by a runaway bacterial infection that afflicts surgery and wound patients. Sepsis patients are already gravely ill from the underlying condition, making it unlikely that any single drug can be the remedy, biotech executives say.
Curiously, however, until it became politically inexpedient, biotech executives routinely said they aimed to become fully integrated pharmaceuticals companies. Indeed, a corporate partnership with a big drug concern has long been a rite of passage. And leading biotech companies are adopting some of the techniques of medicinal chemistry at the same time the pharmaceutical manufacturers are embracing genetic engineering.
The recent spate of bad news alone is not the only source of the biotech industry's malaise. The sheer numbers of companies seeking public financing has also contributed.
 
$7 Billion in Investments
 Public investors poured nearly $6 billion into 1,000 biotech companies between 1991 and the first two months of this year. Private financings added an additional $1 billion.
"The market was confused by all these offerings," said Sanford R. Robertson, president of Robertson, Stephens & Company.
Still, biotech retains a fascination for investors. In January, before the recent bad news, a record 1,800 investors, up from 1,400 last year, attended the Hambrecht & Quist Life Sciences Conference, the industry's big annual gathering. Venture capital firms, including Kleiner Perkins, the Mayfield Fund and Institutional Venture Partners, financed record numbers of biotech start-ups in 1992 even while the public markets were closed.
But all that investment is predicated upon the assumption that some of these companies will produce drugs and begin earning the healthy gross- profit margins enjoyed by drug manufacturers.
"The public markets have to assume these companies are going to be profitable," said Kirk Raab, president and chief executive of Genentech. "If there are price controls on new drugs, people assume they won't be profitable."
Yet the Administration's position on price controls, some in the industry believe, may not even apply to biotech drugs. They note that even in those countries that regulate drug prices, the constraints typically apply only to price rises on existing drugs, not on introductory prices. The price of only one biotech drug has increased since introduction, Amgen's Neupogen for raising white blood cell counts in chemotherapy patients, and it rose only modestly.
 
'A Gross Overreaction'
 "To me it's been a gross overreaction on the part of Wall Street," said James McCamant, publisher of the Medical Technology Stock Letter. He argues that many biotech drugs actually lower health-care costs. Treatments under development for rheumatoid arthritis, for example, could eliminate the main cause of joint replacements, a costly procedure, he said.
But if Wall Street remains spooked, biotech companies will have to look elsewhere for financing. Already some venture funds are reluctantly providing cash to needy public companies. The cash-rich pharmaceuticals manufacturers are likely to buy into, and in some cases buy up, fledgling biotech concerns. In the last six years, the large drug companies have put close to $400 million into minority equity investments in biotech companies, according to Mark Edwards of Recombinant Capital, a San Francisco market research firm.

Chicago Names Professor As Business School Dean

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 29

 BODY:
The University of Chicago today named Robert S. Hamada, a leading professor of finance at its Graduate School of Business, to succeed John P. Gould this summer as the school's dean.
Known as the home of the "Chicago school" of economists, whose advocacy of free markets dominated political thinking in Washington during the Reagan and Bush Administrations, the business school has in recent years gained a reputation as a center for research and teaching on quality control and technology transfer and for training in leadership skills. 
 A recent survey by Business Week of business school graduates and the executives who hire them ranked Chicago second in the nation, behind the Kellogg School at nearby Northwestern University; four years ago it was ranked 11th.
Mr. Gould, who said in a recent interview that he had not yet decided whether to return to "serious academics" when he retired June 30 from administration, has led the school for 10 years. Among his accomplishments has been a quadrupling of the endowment, to nearly $64 million.
 
Trained as an Engineer
 Mr. Hamada, 55, was born in San Francisco, grew up in New Rochelle, N.Y., and was trained as a chemical engineer, with degrees from Yale University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He shifted to finance while pursuing his Ph.D. at M.I.T. and joined the Chicago faculty in 1966.
He has focused much of his research on the effect of risk and taxes on corporate finance and the connection between corporate finance and strategy. He has also worked extensively on international business issues and financial futures markets.
During his years at Chicago, Mr. Hamada has also won several teaching awards, served as director of the school's Center for International Business Education and Research, and held several administrative posts, including deputy dean for faculty from 1985 to 1990.
"One of my strengths is that I know the faculty well," he said.
 
Busy Outside the School
 Outside the school, he has edited journals and been a director of the Chicago Board of Trade. He is on the boards of the A. M. Castle Corporation, the Manville Corporation and the Riverwood International Corporation, Manville's packaging subsidiary, the Northern Trust Corporation and the National Bureau of Economic Research.
Mr. Hamada said the biggest change facing Chicago and other leading business schools in recent years had been that entering students had worked first and were older and more experienced. Businesses expect graduates to be able to "hit the ground running," he said, so schools must provide more chances for them to gain practical experience.
Mr. Hamada and his wife, Anne, have a son, Matthew in the Peace Corps, and a daughter, Janet, studying for a career in social work.
Does Mr. Gould have any advice?
"A dean is not a chief executive and you don't get to run things by announcement," he said. "The faculty is like a bunch of independent entrepreneurs working in one place and you are dealing with people who are by training skeptical. My first line of strategy has been to try to at least convince people not to block innovative activities by others."

HEADLINE: For Clinton, 'Managed Trade' Is Emerging as Policy Option

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28

 BODY:
Four years ago, when even Japanese ministers were calling for their country to buy more American goods, the Bush Administration shied away from setting targets because it feared that such action might look like managing trade.
In the Bush Administration lexicon, "managed trade" meant inefficient Government meddling that inevitably did more harm than good. 
 Much has changed since. Although President Clinton professes to share the Bush Administration's admiration for free markets, when he and his senior officials talk about trade they talk about ways Government intervention can help, not hurt. Managed trade is seen as "comparable access" to foreign markets and "aggressive unilateralism" to expand international commerce.
The result is a new and more confrontational tone for American trade policy. Like President Clinton's high-technology subsidy programs, the new strategy is based on a renewed confidence in the ability of Government to step in effectively where unregulated markets appear to produce unsatisfactory results.
 
Evident at News Conference
 That tougher stance -- and the greater emphasis on the need for intervention -- was evident at the President's news conference last Tuesday. Mr. Clinton volunteered that the persistent trade deficit with Japan showed that "the possibility of obtaining real, even access to the Japanese market is somewhat remote." The Bush Administration, in contrast, had emphasized differences in the two countries' economies.
But if the President has been vocal about the need for change, the details of the new trade policy remain blurred and conflicting. The Administration's shifting statements on trade reflect internal policy disputes, a deliberate effort to keep negotiating opponents off balance and a tendency to tell each audience what it wants to hear.
One early signal of Mr. Clinton's activist approach to trade policy was the appointment of Laura D'Andrea Tyson to the chairmanship of the Council of Economic Advisers. She is an advocate of more confrontational trade practices to help American high-technology industries. While free trade is ideal, she said in a recent interview, it is better to expand commerce through managed pacts and "aggressive unilateralism" than to allow barriers to suffocate trade altogether.
 
A New Slogan
 "I would draw a distinction between managed trade arrangements that reduce trade and ones that increase trade," she said.
The new trade policy even seems to be acquiring a new slogan: "comparable access," a term used frequently in various permutations by Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative. Apparently adopted from a controversial European Community rule on government contracts, the new term goes beyond the traditional American goal of seeking reciprocal concessions.
The strategy assumes that the United States has a more open market than its trading partners -- as most studies have indicated -- and means that further American concessions must be matched by much larger foreign concessions.
Access is measured by the market shares of American companies in foreign markets. Mr. Kantor, for example, has criticized Japan in recent days because American car makers and computer chip makers have smaller shares of the Japanese market than they do in Europe.
 
The Auto Parts Issue
 And on Friday, Mr. Kantor told Japan's Trade Minister, Yoshiro Mori, that the Clinton Administration expected Japanese auto manufacturers to double their purchases of foreign auto parts by the end of 1994. The Japanese car makers set this as a voluntary goal when President Bush visited Tokyo in January 1992, but Mr. Kantor referred to it on Friday as a "pledge." Though definitions of managed trade vary, almost all include governments' setting market shares for imports.
The new approach has delighted some American industries facing import competition, like Detroit's car makers. But trade experts concerned about the risk of a tit-for-tat trade war are alarmed.
"This should be the spring of hope and instead we might get nuclear winter," said Jagdish Bhagwati, an economics professor and trade specialist at Columbia University. "I think it is going to lead to managed trade."
Foreign trading partners are also bewildered by what appears to be a mix of conciliation and confrontation. "We're all groping in the dark -- they say one thing and do another," said the foreign minister of one of the European Community's 12 member nations, in reference to American trade policy. "I don't expect to get any definitive picture this year, so it's going to be a series of ad hoc negotiations stretching off into the future."
 
Kantor Sees Consistency
 But Mr. Kantor insists American policy is consistent. "The fact is, we know where we're going," he said in an interview. "We're going to lead global growth -- trade is going to be an integral part of our economic plan."
The constant shifts in rhetoric, depending on the audience and the issue, have also given new life to a long-simmering debate over whether American trade policy should be clear and consistent, with Democrats supporting their President's weaving pronouncements while Republicans express alarm.
Senator Max S. Baucus, the Montana Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee's trade panel, contended on the Senate floor on Friday that the new unpredictability was an asset. "Do we really want to be predictable as we sit down to negotiate with our trading partners?" he asked. "Do we want them to know exactly what we'll do -- and when? Or do we want to keep them guessing and get the best deal for our exporters?"
But Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative for the Bush Administration, said that the Clinton Administration's recent swerves in policy were dangerous. "The business community worldwide hates uncertainty, our trading partners loathe uncertainty and frequently miscalculate when the signals are not clear," she said.
The danger perceived by Mrs. Hills and other Administration critics is twofold: that trading nations will blunder into a trade war through miscalculation and that companies will make bad investments and other business decisions because of inaccurate forecasts of international competition.
"You don't want our own business community going down paths that are cul-de-sacs," Mrs. Hills said.
Members of the Clinton Administration also continue to tailor pronouncements on trade to their audiences, much as the candidate did during the campaign, which also produces apparent inconsistencies.
For example, President Clinton vehemently criticized European aircraft manufacturing subsidies in front of cheering Boeing workers on Feb. 22, saying, "We're going to change the rules of the game."
But on Friday, at a news conference with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, President Clinton praised the existing trans-Atlantic rules on subsidies and said that he hoped that the current agreement on subsidy limits would remain in place.
Part of the murkiness in the Administration's trade policy does reflect genuine policy divisions over how aggressively the United States can proceed without undermining trade rules and stifling commerce.
Some officials, mainly at the Treasury Department and State Department, believe respect for existing rules is so fragile that harsh actions could provoke devastating trade wars. Lawrence H. Summers, named to be Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, has led opposition to managed trade ideas in interagency meetings on those grounds, several Administration officials said. Mr. Summers declined to comment.
 
Aggressive Action Sought
 Other officials, including Mr. Kantor, scoff at such warnings, contending that so many countries rely so heavily on exports and imports that any trade dispute would fizzle before it seriously restricted international trade. These officials contend that the world's economy has changed since the 1930's, when tariffs throttled trade and worsened the Depression.
Mr. Kantor and his allies contend that aggressive action is needed to claw back some of the many trade concessions made during the cold war to insure the allegiance of allies.
Most recently, the split has been reflected in the issue of whether imported mini-vans and sport utility vehicles should be labeled trucks instead of cars, which would raise tariffs on them to 25 percent from 2.5 percent. President Clinton said last Tuesday that the issue was under review, and added that the Bush Administration decision to classify the vehicles as cars was "a $300-million-a-year freebie to the Japanese for no apparent reason." Mr. Kantor said on CNN's "Evans & Novak" a few days earlier, "I'm sure we'll have a decision in the near future."
But a Treasury Department official said last week that the review was an investigation of the technical details of how vehicles were classified rather than a process that might eventually change policy.
Policy divisions alone do not explain the sharp swerves in recent American trade rhetoric and bargaining tactics. To a considerable extent, they also reflect the personal style of Mr. Kantor, who has dominated much of the new trade policy.
Two close associates of Mr. Kantor said he relished throwing his opponents off balance by alternating charm with pugnacity in negotiations. Mr. Kantor acquired this tactic as a lawyer in administrative law cases in California and is now applying it to foreign governments, they said.
 
 
 
STYLE AND SUBSTANCE ON TRADE
 Often tough but sometimes conciliatory, the Clinton Administration has left business leaders and trade officials wondering whether the United States is changing its approach to trade disputes.
President Bush, an ardent opponent of government interference in international commerce, left negotiations to his trade representative, Carla A. Hills. President Clinton focuses on the problems as well as the benefits of free trade. His trade representative, Mickey Kantor, talks as tough as the President but has refrained from confrontational actions so far.
Here are the Bush and CLinton administrations' approaches to five simmering trade issues

 MINIVANS: The Bush Administration's Treasury Department ruled in 1989 that minivans and sport utility vehicles should pay the 2.5 percent import tariff for cars instead of the 25 percent levy on light trucks. President Clinton criticized the decision during the campaign and said last Tuesday that he remains opposed to it.
AIRCRAFT: Mrs. Hills negotiated an agreement requiring that future European aircraft manufacturers to repay government subsidies, with interest, but did not require Airbus, a four-nation joint venture, to repay past subsidies. President Clinton criticized European aircraft subsidies in February, but praised the agreement on Friday.
SEMICONDUCTORS: Mrs. Hills negotiated the informal 'expectation' that imported computer chips would take 20 percent of the Japanese market by the end of 1992, a target that Japan met. Mr. Kantor calls the 20 percent figure in the 1991 semiconductor agreement a "commitment" and praises the suggestion that similar figures be used in other negotiations.
NAFTA: Mr. Bush endorsed the North American Free Trade Agreement, which would eliminate trade barriers among Canada, Mexico and the United States. Mr. Clinton has called for three side agreements covering labor, the environment and possible surges of imports that could threaten domestic industries. Negotiations started on March 17.
GATT: In talks on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the major international trade agreement, the United States and the European Community agreed in November to limit farm subsidies. Mr. Kantor has said the Administration might not immediately accept that agreement but on Friday, Clinton praised it.

The price of Treasury bonds and notes shot higher in late but light trading yesterday, after a sharp selloff on Friday raised doubts about whether the 1993 rally could continue.
The sudden rise sent the price of the 30-year bond up 21/32 point and the yield down to 6.89 percent, from 6.94 percent on Friday. But traders said there was little to make of the price rise because it did not make up for the Friday selloff and was caused by technical trading and rumors about some possible Federal Reserve actions later in the week. 
 Even with the drop in the yield on the 30-year bond, it is still above the 6.85 percent level of Thursday and well above the low for the year of 6.72 percent, set on March 8. The price of the 30-year bond dropped one point and 6/32 on Friday.
Traders said two factors might have contributed to the sudden rise in prices at the end of the day. One was the fact that some dealers and speculators had bet that prices would decline more yesterday. But when the market held relatively steady, some of the people who sold short to take advantage of falling prices decided to buy back Treasury securities, which sent prices rising.
In addition, there was talk in the market for most of the day that the Ferderal Reserve would be buying Treasury notes and possibly bonds later in the week as part of an effort to assure that seasonal fluctuations in the availability of dollars do not drive short-term interest rates higher than the central bank would like.
As will be the case all week, traders and investors will focus on the employment data for March that are to be released on Friday. The picture of the economy that these data provide will help determine if interest rates will move lower again, stay in a tight range or move higher.
 
New York City Sale
 New York City will sell about $770 million in bonds today and use the proceeds to pay off older, higher-interest-rate debt.
The issue will include no New York City "mini bonds" -- bonds with a low face value that can be more easily purchased by individual investors. The lead underwriter is Merrill Lynch.
In addition, the much-talked-about sale of New York City bonds in Japan, denominated in yen, will not be done until May, because it could not be included among an all-tax-exempt refunding issue. The sale of so-called Samurai bonds will total $150 million to $175 million and will be part of a sale of bonds to raise new funds that will total $750 million to $800 million, according to Darcy Bradbury, the Deputy New York City Comptroller for finance.
The sale comes at a time when interest rates have moved above their recent lows, which means the city may have to pay a little more in interest than it might have. In the three weeks since the Treasury market hit its lows of the year, the yields on tax-exempt municipal bonds have moved up about a third of a percentage point.
But one underwriter involved in the issue said that slightly higher interest rates could actually help an issue by making it more attractive to investors.
City officials deny that the sale was delayed by the process of selecting a new syndicate of brokerage firms to sell the securities, which involved detailed investigations on the firms' dealings in South Africa.
"We don't believe there was any delay," Ms. Bradbury said. "It is still a great market and you can't hit every low."
Despite these problems, New York will get the lowest interest rates on its bonds in years. The price talk late yesterday was that long-term bonds over 15 years would have yields of about 6.30 percent. The range of maturities will be from 1993 to 2015.
Ms. Bradbury said it was originally thought that the new money issue and the Samurai bonds would be sold at the end of March. But the city had included an expected interest rate saving of $100 million in the budget for the fiscal year 1994, which begins on July 1, and wanted to get the savings secured quickly so it could be shown to the rating agencies, she said.
For New York City residents, the issue is especially attractive because it is triple tax-exempt. That means a 6.30 percent tax-exempt yield will equal a taxable yield of about 9.8 percent for a person in the top Federal tax bracket, which is now 31 percent. At the 39.6 percent top bracket proposed by President Clinton, the taxable equivalent yield is about 13.8 percent.
 
S.& P. Ratings

The Standard & Poor's Corporation said yesterday that in the first quarter it had downgraded the credit rating of many more bonds than it had upgraded.
S.&P. downgraded the credit ratings on 130 corporate issues totaling $219.1 billion, compared with upgrading 81 issues worth $30.5 billion. On tax-exempt municipal issues, ratings were cut on 52 issues totaling $3.1 billion while ratings were raised on 42 issues totaling $1,4 billion.

HEADLINE: Further Sign Of Slowing In Recovery

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
Consumers spent more and saved less last month, the Commerce Department reported today, but income growth weakened in a further sign of a slowing economic recovery.
The department also said sales of new homes rose only moderately last month, even though mortgage rates were at a 20-year low. February sales rose 4.6 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 595,000, after having plunged by a revised 12.7 percent, to a rate of 569,000, in January. 
 The reports indicate the economy has lost some of the momentum that carried it to a relatively strong 4.7 percent annual growth rate in the fourth quarter last year.
 
 
Spending and Income Figures
 Personal spending was up by six-tenths of 1 percent, to $4.26 trillion, last month after a three-tenths of 1 percent January gain. Incomes from wages, salaries and all other sources edged up only by two-tenths of 1 percent, to $5.23 trillion in February, following a five-tenths of 1 percent rise in January.
It was the sixth straight month of more consumer spending, which fuels two-thirds of national economic activity. But the savings rate dipped to its lowest in more than two years as consumers drained their bank accounts to keep going.
"The consumption data indicate that growth during the first quarter of 1993 will not be as robust as the 4.7 percent reported for the fourth quarter of 1992," said Marilyn Schaja, an economist at the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation in New York.
While the growth in new-home sales was a significant improvement from January, sales last month were 5.3 percent lower than February a year earlier, when new homes sold at a rate of 628,000.
 
 
Lumber Costs Cited
 Michael Carliner, an economist with the National Association of Home Builders, said bad weather was clearly a factor slowing sales last month. But there were other negative factors, he said.
"We've had continuing weak growth in employment and in incomes," Mr. Carliner said. "We may also be about to see increases in new-home prices because of rising lumber costs."
The report on personal income covered not only wages and salaries but also income from sources such as dividends, rents, interest and businesses.
Wages and salaries alone, excluding all other income sources, fell in February by $3.5 billion to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3 trillion -- the first decline in wages and salaries since September.
 
 
January Bonuses
 Manufacturing payrolls increased but there was a big falloff in incomes for employees in service industries, in part because the securities industries paid larger-than-normal bonuses in January for income-tax reasons.
Personal savings fell in February to an annual rate of $187 billion from $202.9 billion in January.
The savings rate, which shows savings as a percentage of disposable income and is widely watched by economists, dropped to 4.1 percent in February from 4.4 percent in January. That meant Americans were saving only 4.1 cents out of each dollar they earned after taxes last month -- the weakest savings since they put away 4 cents for each dollar of income last October.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
A Lack of Direction Leaves The Dollar Narrowly Mixed

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar ended narrowly mixed yesterday in listless trading. There was little international political news or economic data to give the market direction.
Gold prices fell 30 cents on the Commodity Exchange in New York, where bullion for current delivery settled at $332.10 an ounce. A late quote from the Republic National Bank put spot gold at $332.20 an ounce, off 15 cents from Friday. 
 A Commerce Department report showed Americans' income rose a scant two-tenths of a percent in February, while consumption was up a more robust six-tenths of a percent. But analysts attributed the spending rise largely to bad weather last month that forced consumers to pay more for heat and for services like snow shoveling.
 
 
Sluggish Growth
 Analysts said the data confirmed a recent trend of sluggish American economic growth. New home sales, which rose to a 595,000 annual rate in February, were in line with economists' expectations and failed to move the dollar.
"The subpar economic data were enough to keep people from betting on the dollar," said Randolph Donney, senior research director at Pegasus Econometric.
Dealers said they were awaiting a meeting of the Bundesbank on Thursday to see if Germany would lower interest rates again, narrowing its rate advantage over the dollar. A cooling of tensions over the political situation in Russia also depressed demand for the dollar, which often gains in times of international crisis.
Currency trading did react to European political news yesterday. The lira hit new all-time lows against the German mark as an Italian Government corruption inquiry widened. A landslide victory for French conservatives in Sunday's runoff election renewed speculation that the franc could be devalued, but the currency held up well in thin trading.
The dollar closed at 1.6268 marks in New York, down from 1.6330 marks on Friday. Earlier in London, the dollar settled at 1.6318 marks, little changed from 1.6319 marks on Friday.
 
 
Tokyo Trading
 In Tokyo, the dollar ended at 116.88 Japanese yen, up from Friday's 116.76 yen. In London, it rose to 116.85 yen from 116.45 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 116.85 yen, up from 116.50 on Friday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.4905, from $1.4915 Friday. It held steady in New York at $1.4905, above Friday's close of $1.4880.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Baseball Puts Teeth in Minority Job Plans

BYLINE: By CLAIRE SMITH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla., March 29

 BODY:
Major league baseball owners, long impervious to criticism of their minority hiring record, signaled an about-face today, promising new initiatives that will be enforced by the threat of sanctions.
The plan, announced today by Bud Selig, owner of the Milwaukee Brewers and baseball's acting commissioner, comes at a time when the sport and its ruling executive council stand just one week away from the start of a season that has been targeted for possible boycotts by the Rev. Jesse Jackson. 
 In a statement, Jackson criticized the plan for lacking specificity and left open the possibility of protest actions.
 
The Schott Shot
 The owners' program comes less than two months after baseball was caught up in its latest embarrassment on the minority front, with the suspension of Marge Schott, owner of the Cincinnati Reds, on grounds she made racially and ethnically insensitive remarks. Charges of institutional insensitivity resulted, not only from high-profile civil rights leaders like Jackson, but from members of Congress and the players' unions of three professional sports.
The owners' initiative not surprisingly makes the standard calls for the recruitment of minority-group members as owners, employees and paying fans. The new ground broken was found in calls for clubs to actively and aggressively recruit minority vendors, to educate all employees in the area of equal opportunity programs and to make accessible hiring information heretofore deemed confidential in order to assure a monitoring process will work.
 
Minority Businesses Sought
 The owners put great emphasis on the economic bridges to minority communities. Selig said a key point was the directive that clubs identify and seek the services of minority-owned businesses. Among those now being sought are providers of goods, banking and investment services, and physicians, attorneys and broadcast rights holders. Clubs are also being told to assure that non-minority firms they do business with demonstrate that they are equal opportuni
"That's the hardest thing to do, but it could have the most impact," said Jerry Reinsdorf, owner of the Chicago White Sox and co-chairman of the owners' equal opportunity committee, which drew up the program, "because there's a multiplier effect. When we hire an employee, we put somebody to work. But now we're essentially going to be helping to create jobs outside of our organization."
Included in the plan's definition of "minorities" are African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, American Indians, Asian-Americans and women.
The owners, while refusing to tie their actions to any attempt to negotiate a peace with Jackson and his followers, nonetheless detailed a line of action that, for the first time, emanated not from from a baseball commissioner but the clubs themselves.
 
Jackson's Response
 "The report sets forth a series of good principles and good intentions to be implemented individually and voluntarily, but contains no overall or team-by-team plan to correct the situation," Jackson said in a statement. "It sets forth no specific goals; has no time frame to accomplish the general goals (their goals are immeasurable); there is no directive or incentive involved to implement an affirmative action plan."
Jackson said in a telephone interview that baseball's plan was unacceptable and will lead his newly formed Rainbow Commission for Fairness in Athletics to engage in a campaign of direct action.
"We're going to have a meeting of our leadership in Baltimore on Wednesday, then we are going to give a formal response," Jackson said. Direct action, Jackson said, could emerge "in the form of picketing, or the form of targeting institutional season-ticket holders, or with the E.E.O.C. or Civil Rights Commission which now must consider doing hearings on baseball."
"The Reverend was probably looking for more specifics," admitted Jerry Reinsdorf.
"I'm only interested in getting to a goal and I know that each club has got to do it its own way. We thought very hard about requiring each club to submit a specific plan. We thought about an industry-wide plan, but we were counseled to go in this direction as opposed to more specifics."
Reinsdorf and Selig both insisted that stringent guidelines will not be needed because of the owners' new-found commitments, as well as pledges for self-policing.
"My committee is going to be monitoring this and if we find that clubs are not complying, we're going to go back to the executive council or to the commissioner, when there's a commissioner, and ask for fines," Reinsdorf said.
 
No Set Guidelines
 Under baseball's major league agreement, organizations can be fined up to $250,000 for violation of baseball edicts.
There are no set guidelines as to how much business each club is expected to throw toward minority vendors, an omission Reinsdorf said Alexander & Associates, the Washington-based consulting firm, endorsed.
"They constantly told us that quotas and specific numbers are too difficult because we're dealing with 28 independent and small businesses and when you have such small units, it's hard to establish a quota to any one of them," Reinsdorf said. "So what we're looking for is in the aggregate, to have their numbers just continue to increase."
Clifford Alexander, head of the consulting firm, termed the concept of quotas and set-aside programs unneeded diversions. "That whole discussion would allow people who don't want to see any progress to say 'why are you setting aside money for them?' " Alexander said. "There's no reason to set aside money. There are plenty of minority-owned firms that can provide the services a ball club requires."
Another aspect of the plan deals with minority ownership.
The commissioner's office and the league offices are instructed to encourage minority-group members to seek controlling interests of clubs. Clubs with multiple owners are instructed to seek to attract minorities as investors.
 
Selig's Promise
 Baseball, not only hectored by civil rights leaders but its most recent commissioners, has made some percentage gains. It now has a front-office minority representation of 17 percent compared with 2 percent in 1987. And it will enter this season with six minority managers.
Selig, whose statement today also detailed baseball's contributions to charities, youth baseball, Negro League players and the like, said, "We can do better. And we will."
"I realize we can't do it overnight," said Reinsdorf. "But I want to report a year from now meaningful progress."

HEADLINE: Making Trade Pact Work for the Environment

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Save Nafta. But Don't Roll Over" (editorial, March 17) urges United States officials to get tougher in working out the details of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Certainly, much remains to be done, but a strategy that threatens both Mexico and Canada is not the way to do it. 
 On the environment, it would make more sense to push all three countries to recognize a convergence of interests in solving joint problems. Motives that brought them to the bargaining table for freer trade in goods, services and capital across national boundaries should be used to reduce the unintended trade in environmental degradation. This means working together to set priorities, finding the means to enforce laws and international agreements on the books, and creating incentives and institutions that benefit the environment.
Among many environmental issues related to the trade agreement, the highest priority should go to the United States-Mexico border region. The Clinton Administration, rather than growling at our trading partners, needs to convince everyone it will help clean up the border. As a start, the Administration should review the activities of Federal agencies in the border region, establish an Environmental Protection Agency region office and work with Congress to provide secure Federal funds for our portion of the United States-Mexico border plan.
This plan, long neglected by our Government, gives the new Administration an opportunity -- along with Mexico and the border states -- to prove that freer trade's benefits can be used to improve the environment for citizens in both countries.
We also need a North American commission on the environment, to serve as a forum for cooperation on environmental and public health issues, and to help the countries follow through on the environmental provisions of the trade agreement. The commission would go beyond the agreement to tackle difficult issues in enforcing environmental laws and regulating methods of production.
Also, the commission should have authority to receive and investigate citizen complaints, to publicize its findings, to develop and recommend correctives to the parties involved, and to recommend enforcement actions to a national government if a corrective measure is not adopted in a reasonable period of time.
Finally, as a condition of implementing the trade agreement, all three countries -- especially the United States -- should call on the private sector to do more. For example, United States-based companies operating in Mexico can serve as a model by providing public access to information on the environment, public health and safety. Businesses can follow the lead of the El Paso Foreign Trade Association by sponsoring training programs for industry personnel involved in transporting, handling and storing hazardous materials.
Finally, we should take full advantage of new initiatives from the business community, such as the Gulf of Mexico Business Council for Sustainable Development. The decisions of these executives will determine the fate of the trade agreement's promise to "promote sustainable development" and "strengthen the development and enforcement of environmental laws and regulations."
Getting tougher in the negotiations may make sense for some trade matters, but if we want to solve environmental problems the United States strategy needs to help everyone get smarter.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Britain Softening Emphasis on Ousting Iraqi

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 29

 BODY:
The United States and Britain have begun to move away from their insistence that the trade embargo against Iraq cannot be lifted while President Saddam Hussein remains in power.
Both President George Bush and Prime Minister John Major had said on several occasions that the sanctions must remain until President Hussein has been toppled, though the Security Council resolutions imposing the embargo contain no such requirement. 
 Their insistence that Iraq remove its dictatorial leader has become increasingly unpopular with other Arab countries because it clearly exceeds the Council's decisions and because many Arab countries are quietly making accommodations with Iraq.
Neither the United States nor Britain mentioned this condition today when the Security Council reviewed the embargo and decided it should remain in place because Iraq has not complied with the terms of the cease-fire in the Persian Gulf war. Instead they submitted long lists of ways in which Iraq refuses to comply with those terms.
 
Window for Administration
 Western diplomats had predicted that today's periodic review, the first since President Clinton took office, would provide an occasion for the new Administration to end the vendetta that Mr. Bush seemed to wage against Mr. Hussein and to adopt a more legalistic policy toward Iraq's compliance.
Appearing Sunday on the NBC News program "Meet the Press," Secretary of State Warren Christopher also refused to repeat the Bush Administration's warning that President Hussein must go before sanctions can be lifted.
Instead he said the Clinton Administration was "de-personalizing" its quarrel with Baghdad while insisting that Iraq comply with the cease-fire.
"To the extent we are de-personalizing it, it is only because we want those resolutions to be obeyed not only by Saddam Hussein, but by whoever comes after him," he said.
 
Letting Opponents Do the Job
 But Mr. Christopher also argued that full compliance would in fact undermine President Hussein's Government and lead to its overthrow because they require him to stop oppressing the Kurds in the north and the Shiites in the south. Both groups want to topple him from power.
Pointing out that Resolution 688 requires Baghdad to end its military suppression of the Kurds and the Shiites, Mr. Christopher said: "It's quite inconceivable to me to believe that he can do that and still stay in power, so we are pushing ahead. Our policy is to try to ensure that the United Nations resolutions are lived up to."
After today's review of the sanctions at the United Nations, the United States representative, Madeleine K. Albright, refused to discuss the policy change, saying, "We are not talking about that."
Britain's representative, Sir David Hannay, said, "The instructions I received for conducting the sanctions review did not relate to Saddam Hussein's staying in office."
 
Parading the Violations
 Instead the United States and Britain described what they called violations of the conditions that the Security Council imposed on Iraq at the end of the gulf war.
They noted Iraq's failure to take part in the boundary commission demarcating the border with Kuwait, the suppression of Kurds and Shiites and Iraq's refusal to cooperate with the United Nations personnel charged with eliminating Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction and monitoring its military industries.
Miss Albright accused President Hussein of trying "to charm the international community," a reference to various more temperate statements by Baghdad and the decision to send Nizar Hamdoun, a respected and accomplished diplomat, to represent Iraq at the United Nations.
But she said: "Iraq's facade of apparent readiness to meet its obligations has not been translated into concrete responses. And no such charm has been enjoyed by the people of Iraq, who suffer the policies of their Government."

HEADLINE: Ukraine and Arms Accords: Kiev Reluctant to Say 'I Do'

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine, March 29

 BODY:
The political unrest in Russia has stalled efforts to substantially reduce nuclear arsenals in the United States and the former Soviet Union.
In Ukraine, new fears of Russian nationalism have encouraged an increasingly vocal group of legislators who advocate keeping some nuclear weapons. President Leonid Kravchuk had promised last year that Ukraine would ratify not only the 1991 Soviet-American agreement reducing nuclear warheads, but also the non-proliferation treaty of 1970, which would oblige it to give up all nuclear weapons.
 
Treaties Need One Another
 The breakup of the Soviet Union left nuclear weapons in four republics: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan. All but Ukraine have ratified the July 1991 treaty, which called for one-third cuts in the nuclear warheads on Soviet and American ballistic missiles, and Ukrainian legislators, who are debating the treaty, are hesitant about giving up the weapons they inherited from the Soviet Union. 
 Without final ratification by all four successor states of the 1991 accord, known as Start I, and the 1970 pact, the treaty to halt the spread of nuclear arms, there is no way Moscow and Washington will ratify a follow-up treaty signed in January by President Boris N. Yeltsin and President George Bush.
That treaty, known as Start II, would eliminate heavy, land-based, multiple-warhead missiles and leave the United States and Russia with about 3,500 warheads each, down from a current total of 21,000. The treaty would eliminate any reasonable hope for a successful attack by either side.
Start II is built on Start I and is meaningless without it, but ratification of the second treaty can wait for a year or more, senior Western diplomats say. Much more pressing is the first treaty, which the Parliament of Ukraine is now debating. When the Soviet Union broke up, Ukraine laid claim to all Soviet property on its territory, including nuclear weapons.
Mr. Kravchuk and his Government have not altered their commitment to ratify both Start I and the non-proliferation treaty.
But some influential legislators now say that while they favor ratifying Start I, subject to certain conditions, Ukraine should wait before signing the 1970 accord and becoming a non-nuclear nation. They suggest keeping some nuclear weapons to deter any possible move by Russia to force Kiev back under Moscow's wing.
"The situation in Russia complicates the process of ratifying Start," said Dmytro Pavlychko, the chairman of the Parliament's foreign relations committee. "A few days ago, the idea of a fast transition of Ukraine to a non-nuclear state had more support that it does now."
The Parliament will ratify Start I, he said. "But I don't think we'll join the non-proliferation treaty very soon," he added. "I think we'll move to be non-nuclear, but at a slower pace. In three or four years, things will calm down in Russia."
 
After You, Says Moscow
 Separation of Start I and the non-proliferation treaty would probably derail both Start agreements because the Supreme Soviet of Russia has said it will not implement Start I until Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan also become non-nuclear states. Belarus has signed the non-proliferation treaty and Kazakhstan has promised to do so, a promise that no one seems to doubt.
Before the breakup of the Soviet Union, Moscow could have complied with Start I by destroying the silos of 130 six-warhead SS-19 intercontinental missiles in Ukraine, while leaving other nuclear weapons in place there.
Should Ukraine interpret the treaty this way, it would be left with at least 460 warheads on 46 more modern intercontinental SS-24 missiles, and 30 bombers with an estimated 416 warheads on bombs and cruise missiles.
But maintaining such an arsenal would run counter to President Kravchuk's commitment to President Bush to eliminate Ukraine's strategic weapons within seven years of ratifying Start I. Washington considers that commitment legally binding.
 
The Weight of Friendship
 Western diplomats say the weapons in Ukraine remain under the control of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the tottering association of 11 former Soviet republics.
But one diplomat said: "There's a lot of technical know-how in Ukraine, and they may begin to delude themselves into thinking they can take over, manage and use these weapons. And some in Ukraine's leadership seem to think Ukraine is only important to the United States because of the weapons."
Washington is turning up the pressure on Kiev, which resents it. On March 25 President Clinton met with Foreign Minister Anatoly Zlenko and told him Start I "is a precondition to a long-term successful relationship" with Ukraine. Despite "some opposition at home in Ukraine because of uncertainty in Russia," Mr. Clinton said, "we have to have them sign on, and I encouraged them to go ahead and do it."
But the Deputy Foreign Minister, Boris I. Tarasyuk, warned Washington not to pressure Ukraine.
"It would be counterproductive to put pressure on us and our Government while the Parliament is trying to sort it out," he said in an interview. "It would be a great mistake and could increase the numbers of those who advocate -- not a nuclear Ukraine -- but not acceding to the non-proliferation treaty in order to leave some room for maneuver."
 
'It Will Only Upset Russia'
 Mr. Pavlychko, the chairman of the foreign relations committee, said Ukraine should not admit to any thought of maintaining a nuclear arsenal because "it will only upset Russia." Still, Ukraine can be an important counterbalance for all of Eastern Europe against any Russian expansionism, he said.
"We must remain clever in this period -- to remain a strong state without threatening anyone," he said. "We must ratify Start I, and then we shall have to see."
Some of his colleagues are even more explicit; a few, like Gen. Volodymyr F. Tolubko, a deputy and a commander in the strategic forces, advocate active construction of a nuclear deterrent.
Other voices are also hardening.
Bogdan M. Horyn, Mr. Pavlychko's deputy chairman and deputy chairman of the military affairs committee, has said that Ukraine "has the right to decide to be a nuclear or a non-nuclear state," and that commitments to become a non-nuclear state "were voiced as intentions, not obligations."
 
'Intention' vs. 'Commitment'
 "Time brings some changes," Mr. Horyn continued. "During this period of instability in Russia, it's unwise and dangerous to get rid of our nuclear weapons. There's a big difference between 'commitment' and 'intention.' "
When told of such comments, Mr. Tarasyuk, the Deputy Foreign Minister, sighed. "The position of the Government has not changed," he said, explaining his doubt that Mr. Pavlychko or the others represented a majority view. Most legislators have not concentrated on the issue yet, he said. "It's too early to start to count votes," he added. "The crystallization of attitudes will occur when they're about to make a decision."
Western diplomats are less confident than Mr. Tarasyuk, saying the idea to delay agreement on the non-proliferation treaty was gathering support. Even President Kravchuk has been ambivalent, one diplomat said, promoting the treaties to "foreign presidents and foreign journalists, but not at home."
The diplomat continued: "If Mr. Kravchuk would say to Parliament, 'We're losing favor with the West, and we have no choice -- it's the West or Russia. These weapons offer no real security, so ratify the treaties,' it could make all the difference. But he hasn't. Maybe he will."
 
What Ukraine Wants
 Ukraine has already annoyed its neighbors by attaching conditions to Start I.
The Government, often responding to legislators, says it wants compensation for the nuclear material in any warheads that would be destroyed, including those attached to tactical weapons that have already been transferred to Russia for destruction by June 1992.
Ukraine also wants compensation for the cost of destroying its nuclear weapons, which Foreign Minister Zlenko estimated at $2.8 billion. So far, the United States has promised only $175 million.
And it wants unspecified guarantees from other nuclear powers against attack, and is securing promises to that effect, Mr. Tarasyuk said.
Talks on all these questions continue.
Western officials regard these issues as difficult but resolvable, but they add to existing irritations. "Ukraine is always moving the goal posts," one diplomat said.
 
See Themselves as Good Guys
 Ukrainian officials, for their part, say they resent all the attention being paid by Mr. Clinton to finding money to aid Russia, which they see as unstable and unreliable, while friendly, stable Ukraine gets comparatively little.
"They feel the disparity," a senior Western diplomat said, "and Start is part of the problem. It definitely is a cloud over the relationship with Washington. But Washington has been wrong not to diversify the relationship sooner and push ahead with more economic and cultural aid."

HEADLINE: CLINTON BACKS OFF FROM POLICY SHIFT ON FEDERAL LANDS

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30

 BODY:
Bowing to warnings from Western senators that they might oppose his economic program, President Clinton has backed away from proposing a major change in the way Federal land is managed, Administration officials said today.
Coming a month after the White House suggested drastic changes in policies that have encouraged development in the West for more than a century, the turnabout was a significant defeat for environmentalists. 
 President Clinton's plan included raising the fee for grazing livestock on 280 million acres of public range and establishing royalties on gold, silver and other metals now mined from Federal land at no charge.
 
Immediate Resistance
 The Administration had also proposed a ban on logging of national forests at below-market rates. But officials in the Administration and in Congress said they were not sure how the turnaround on mining and grazing would affect logging.
The grazing fees and mining royalties met immediate resistance from Western lawmakers, who told President Clinton at a recent meeting that the changes would mean economic devastation to ranchers and farmers.
The action was seen as a setback for Leon E. Panetta, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, who had fought to keep the provisions in Mr. Clinton's budget framework, and for Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who had hailed the package as ushering in "a brand new era in land management."
 
'Not a Retreat'
 Nonetheless, Kevin J. Sweeney, a spokesman for Mr. Babbitt, said: "It is not a retreat. It's more bowing to the impact from the Senate on how these things would happen."
After two weeks of negotiations, White House officials said today that the disputed provisions would be deleted from Mr. Clinton's proposal for a budget framework, on which Congress is currently working. The support of Western Democrats is essential for passage of Mr. Clinton's economic program in the Senate.
Contending that the change was not substantive, Administration officials vowed to press forward with the new fees through separate legislation and administrative actions rather than including them in the overall budget package.
 
Other Avenues Possible
 "This is a process argument, not necessarily a policy argument," said George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director. "If we can find a better way to achieve the President's goals, then all to the better."
But environmental groups and lawmakers who had endorsed the Administration's plans said they were furious about the decision.
"This is a fundamental mistake by the Administration," said Representative George Miller, the California Democrat who heads the Natural Resources Committee. "The decision to defer these reforms from the budget sends the message that business as usual has lived to fight another day."
Michael Francis, director of the national forest program at The Wilderness Society, said: "I don't think I've ever seen a white flag get put up so fast. The Clinton White House came out charging but, once close enough to see the whites of the enemy's eyes, turned tail."
 
'Made Their Views Known'
 Asked if Mr. Clinton was caving in to political threats from the Western senators, Mr. Stephanopoulos said, "They clearly made their views known to the President."
Today's action is the latest example of an emerging pattern in which Mr. Clinton proposes bold policy changes but then appears to adjust his course in the face of strong opposition. In the last week, he raised the possibility of restricting the deployment of gay soldiers after pledging to end discrimination against homosexuals in the military.
On another issue, Mr. Clinton first proposed restricting donations to national parties and by political action committees but later offered a compromise after negotiations with House Democrats who depend on those contributions for their campaigns every two years.
Despite the reversal today, Democratic lawmakers said they still believed Congress would pass legislation to set the new fees on using public lands, though they might not be enacted as fast, and they might not be as high as the Administration had proposed.
In proposing the restrictions on the use of publicly owned resources, White House officials had said they knew Mr. Clinton risked losing Democratic support in the Rocky Mountain states in 1996. But they had said they had also expected to gain support on the West Coast, where environmental protection is particularly important among voters.
In the end, however, today's decision demonstrated the political strength of Democrats in Colorado, Montana, New Mexico and Nevada, whose support for the budget plan is considered critical in the Senate, where less populous states wield more power than they do in the House.
In interviews today, Senators from the Western states called the Administration's decision a victory that resulted from their negotiations with the White House.
 
No Threats, Just Hints
 Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, Democrat of Colorado, said that although he did not personally tell the President that he would oppose the budget package, he made his concerns clear to White House officials.
Asked whether Western senators could support the President's budget if it included the mining and grazing provisions, Mr. Campbell said: "There is no question that some of the Western senators would not have been able to do that. None of us were threatening to take a hike. But I think the President saw the impossibility of many Western Democrats not being able to support it knowing we'd be beaten over the head.
"How would you go back to a public-land state facing an election in four years and say that you voted to basically end mining and ranching and the using of public lands?"
Another Democrat who played a major role in the negotiations, Senator Max S. Baucus of Montana, preferred not to describe the White House decision as the result of pressure tactics.
 
Emphasizing Teamwork
 "We didn't criticize the President publicly," Mr. Baucus said, "and he realized we made a good case.
"This is just teamwork basically; we're together on the same team. Reform is needed in all these areas. It just has to be done in an even-handed and balanced way."
Some environmental groups said they were surprised that Mr. Clinton would bow to the Western senators on the eve of his trip Friday to Portland, Ore., for an important meeting on forest policy. The Administration organized the meeting as a way of settling the dispute about logging in areas where northern spotted owls live, one of the nation's most intractable and publicized environmental battles.
"Before the summit has even begun, Clinton has surrendered the public interest," said Peter Bahouth, who oversees the forest protection efforts by Greenpeace, an environmental group. "Clearly he's cutting deals behind closed doors, and that means that not only will our public forests continue to be destroyed, but taxpayers will continue to pay for it."
But the senators who opposed Mr. Clinton's plan said they did so because smaller ranchers would be driven off their land, rural communities would be threatened and a recent rise in mining claims would be snuffed. They noted that they were already troubled by the Administration's proposed energy tax, which would adversely affect states in the West, an area that produces energy and where residents drive long distances.

Gorski, called Mr. NeMoyer, whom Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan recommended yesterday for United States Attorney for the 17 counties of western New York, a "consummate attorney and intimate political adviser and a significant player in virtually every public policy issue this government has faced over the past six years."
In December, Mr. NeMoyer succeeded in reaching a settlement in what citizens of Buffalo came to know as the "domed stadium case." It was a 20-year-long dispute with a developer who was supposed to build a stadium and sued the county after its Legislature voted not to appropriate sufficient funds. The county ultimately agreed to pay $10 million, significantly lower than the damages originally sought by the developer.
Mr. NeMoyer received his bachelor's degree from the State University of New York at Binghamton in 1974, his law degree from the State University at Buffalo in 1977, and a master's in economics from the same school in 1984. He is married and a father of four.

HEADLINE: Court Supports Editor on Rights to Dead Sea Text

BYLINE: By JOEL GREENBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, March 30

 BODY:
In a verdict that could have significant implications for future research on the Dead Sea Scrolls, a Jerusalem court ruled today that an Israeli professor had a copyright on his reconstruction of one of the most important of the ancient Jewish manuscripts.
The District Court awarded Dr. Elisha Qimron of Ben Gurion University in Beersheba $44,000 in damages for infringement of copyright by the publisher of a book that included, without permission or credit, his deciphering of one of the 2,000-year-old scrolls. Dr. Qimron had sought $200,000. 
 Lawyers for both sides said the ruling established for the first time that a copyright could be claimed for a reconstruction of an ancient text.
 
Victory for Authorized Editors
 The case was the first court test in a swirling controversy over publication of the Dead Sea Scrolls that has swept the scholarly world since tight limits on access to the documents were lifted more than a year ago. The verdict appeared to bolster the status of a team of authorized scroll editors, of which Dr. Qimron is a member.
About 800 scrolls, considered one of the great archeological finds of the century, were discovered more than 40 years ago in caves near the Dead Sea. Written between the second century B.C. and A.D. 70, they contain the oldest known copies of the Old Testament and are believed to provide valuable insights into the history of Judaism and the origins of Christianity.
Dr. Qimron had sued the publisher and editors of "A Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls," a collection of more than 1,700 photographs of scroll fragments published in 1991 by the Biblical Archeology Society.
 
Reconstruction of Scroll
 The defendants were Hershel Shanks, president of the society and editor of The Biblical Archeology Review, Dr. Robert H. Eisenman of California State University at Long Beach and Dr. James M. Robinson of the Claremont Graduate School in California. Mr. Shanks has waged a campaign to permit free access to the scrolls, and had published the fascimile edition to bring previously unpublished documents to light. An appendix to his forward to the edition included a 121-line reconstruction from a scroll known as MMT, considered important because it lists differences over religious laws that divided the sect responsible for the scrolls from mainstream Judaism.
Dr. Qimron said the reconstruction was a leaked version of his work done with John Strugnell, a Harvard scholar and former chief of the scroll editing team. The reconstruction, with a translation and commentary, is to be published at the end of the year.
Judge Dalia Dorner ruled that Mr. Shanks had knowingly violated Dr. Qimron's copyright by reprinting the bootleg version of MMT, and had also caused "economic damage and mental anguish" to Dr. Qimron by depriving him of first publication rights.
Mrs. Dorner rejected arguments by Mr. Shanks that Dr. Qimron could not claim a copyright for reconstructing an ancient text he did not write. Deciphering and arranging scores of scroll fragments while filling in extensive gaps in the text was a creative enterprise, she said.
 
Warning on Inhibiting Scholars
 After learning of the verdict today, Mr. Shanks warned that it could inhibit scholars from republishing reconstructed texts for further commentary and interpretation. "It's clearly an impediment to scholarship," he said.
Dr. Norman Golb, professor of Jewish history and civilization at the University of Chicago, said, "This represents a grave danger for the future of manuscript research."
But Dr. Qimron and other scroll experts disagreed, saying that today's ruling had upheld existing scholarly conventions while sending a strong signal to would-be plagiarists.
"This will serve as a precedent for the future," said Dr. Emanuel Tov, who heads the team of scroll editors. "It justifies the work of our team, and I hope that other people planning to make improper use of our group's material will now think twice."
Mr. Shanks said he would probably appeal the verdict to Israel's Supreme Court. A countersuit he has filed in Federal District Court in Philadelphia is still to be heard.

HEADLINE: House Rejects Big Cuts In Committee Spending

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30

 BODY:
Rejecting Republican demands for a deep reduction in staff, the Democratic-controlled House voted today to cut spending on its committees this year by only 5 percent below the 1992 level.
Virtually all the savings, which require no further approval, will come from the abolition of four small "select" committees, panels that hold hearings and otherwise review policy but do no legislating. 
 The 224-to-196 vote followed a largely partisan debate over what kind of change the voters sought in November. Republicans, who had proposed a 25 percent cut in committee financing, contended that the people had wanted to clip the wings of an unresponsive Congress.
But Democrats argued that only a strong Congress could investigate and cut the Government waste that voters demand to be slashed.
In all, the measure approved today cuts spending on committees by $2.75 million from the $55 million of last year. Of those savings, $2.7 million will come from the dismantling of the four select committees, which dealt with hunger, children, the elderly and illegal drugs.
Several powerful standing committees, including Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce, and Armed Services, will receive slight increases. Twenty-one other committees face cuts, but they total only $57,746.
 
More Cuts Possible
 The sum in overall savings is roughly equivalent to a tenth of a percent of the cost of a Stealth bomber. The House, whose vote today was on an authorization bill, will get a chance to cut more during the appropriations process in the coming months.
After the House bank scandal and controversies over Congressional perquisites, spending on the legislative process has become the Republican battleground of choice. The debate today was a good example.
Led by their freshmen, the Republicans contended that the cuts approved amounted to little more than a shell game.
And they noted that the Democratic leaders had agreed to abolish the four select committees only after it became clear that there were not enough votes to save them.
"This is a slap in the face of the American taxpayer," said Representative Jay C. Kim, a Republican freshman from California. "Congress must take the lead, not play games with numbers."
 
Response by Dellums
 But Representative Ronald V. Dellums, the California Democrat who heads the Armed Services Committee, countered by saying Congress needed strong committees to keep watch on the executive branch's bureaucracy and insure its efficiency. "For a few measly thousand dollars," he said, "we can bring you savings of billions of dollars."
All 169 Republicans voting opposed the measure, while 223 Democrats were joined by one independent in voting for it.
Twenty-seven Democrats broke with their leadership, joining in a coalition of conservatives and freshmen who sought deeper cuts and liberals who supported the select committees.
"We clearly have the responsibility to tighten our own belts," said Representative Anna G. Eshoo, a freshman Democrat from economically strapped California, who voted with the Republicans.
"For some it may seem symbolic, but in fact it is reality because of what my constituents are going through."
 
A Freshman Surge
 The vote came against a backdrop of maneuvering by Republican and Democratic freshmen on behalf of various plans to overhaul House procedures and privileges.
The 47 Republican freshmen issued their own program of improvement and streamlining, which includes such proposals as abolishing the Appropriations Committee by combining the authorization and appropriations processes.
The Republicans also advocate requiring roll-call votes on all appropriations and revenue bills and imposing term limits for House members. Few of their proposals, if any, have a chance of being adopted.
The 63 Democratic freshmen are struggling to come up with their own package.
But since their ranks are divided over to what extent they should challenge the seniority system and traditional perquisites, they are not expected to reach a consensus on any sweeping changes.

HEADLINE: Congress Agrees On Compromise For Deficit Plan

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30

 BODY:
House and Senate negotiators agreed today on a five-year plan for cutting the deficit by just under $500 billion, a measure that would lay the foundation for enactment of President Clinton's economic program.
The agreement is to be announced Wednesday and will be followed quickly by House and Senate votes. 
 Few details were available immediately after the compromise was reached. The two houses' plans were similar to begin with since both were based on Mr. Clinton's proposals: tax increases on the rich, military cuts and other savings, along with increased spending on certain domestic programs, including roads and research.
Majority Democrats hoped to pass the legislation in the House as early as Wednesday, and the Senate the next day. It would be the earliest a deficit-reduction plan was approved since the budget law was enacted in 1974.
 
Holding Military Costs
 In reaching a compromise, the Senate agreed to lower its total tax increase by roughly $22 billion to about $273 billion over five years. The House, meantime, backed away from the limits it sought on cost-of-living increases for Federal workers and retirees.
Like the House-passed version, the compromise package would also hold spending on the military and most domestic programs over the next five years to no more than the $548 billion the Government will spend this year. Excluded from this freeze would be benefit programs like Social Security and Medicare.
The outline of the package was included in a $1.5 trillion budget for fiscal 1994, which starts on Oct. 1. The measure, which does not require the President's signature, sets goals for tax and spending bills lawmakers will consider later this year.
The agreement came as Democrats erased an embarrassing setback the Senate had dealt to Mr. Clinton's jobs bill, another important piece of the his recovery economic program. The $16.3 billion measure would provide money for mass transit, summer job and other employment-heavy programs.
In a 52-to-48 vote, the Senate reversed itself and killed a Republican amendment trimming $104 million from the bill. Lawmakers had given the Republican provision preliminary approval the night before.
The tally showed that the chamber's majority Democrats will probably be able to keep enough of their 57 members together to muscle the jobs measure through the Senate largely intact.

HEADLINE: Dow Advances by 2.17 in Moderate Trading

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
Investors continued yesterday to abandon their cyclical favorites of recent months for the consumer growth stocks that have fared so poorly this year.
Yesterday's turn toward companies that can resist a weak economy came after a disappointing report on consumer confidence. 
 Food, beverage, tobacco and especially drug stocks have fallen to levels that have tempted some money managers who have not touched them in years.
"Even we have succumbed and recently put some money into Warner-Lambert," as well as Upjohn, said Tony Hitschler, president of Brandywine Asset Management. His search for good values has caused him to shun drug stocks for a decade. But now, he said, "Some of these stocks in the noncyclical area are suffering perhaps too much."
Opposing tugs on various groups of stocks left the major market averages up only narrowly. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 2.17 points, to 3,457.27, on moderate volume of 231.2 million shares. Sharp gains in Microsoft and several medical issues gave the Nasdaq market much more of a ride. The Nasdaq Composite index gained 5.49, to 686.25.
With money managers indulging in trading techniques peculiar to the close of their quarterly reporting periods, some analysts were cautious about saying whether the flow of money from cyclicals to consumer growth stocks would continue.
Thomas Gallagher, head of trading at Oppenheimer & Company, is still doubtful about the drug stocks. "This group has gone from being the ugliest group in the world to being the group everybody likes," he said. "There's no rhyme here."
The most prominent reason for yesterday's run-up in drug stocks, however, was some statements by Administration officials that their health-care plans might not include price controls. Abbott Laboratories rose 1 1/2, to 26; Merck 1 1/4, to 35 1/2; Eli Lilly 1 7/8, to 48 3/4; Medtronic 3 5/8, to 75, and U.S. Surgical 3 7/8, to 56 1/2.
Among other consumer growth stocks, Coca-Cola added 1 1/8, to 43, and Philip Morris 1 3/4, to 64.
Retailers were among the worst performers, and steel and aluminum stocks were treated as if made of very base metals indeed.
The Conference Board reported yesterday that consumer confidence fell sharply this month, and the Johnson Redbook survey of retailers indicated that sales have recently declined. Wal-Mart fell 2 3/8, to 30 7/8; Dayton Hudson 1 3/8, to 80, and Lowe's 1 5/8, to 33 1/4.
Among the metals, Nucor, USX, Inland Steel, Reynolds Metal and Alcoa each dropped at least a point.
Among yesterday's victims of downbeat news, Fisher-Price, a toy maker, fell 3 1/8, to 20 3/8, after forecasting a quarterly loss.
I.B.M. fell 1 5/8, to 50 1/8, on speculation by some analysts that the company might cut its dividend in coming months. The Nasdaq computer stocks surged, however led a 4-point gain in Microsoft, to 91, on the release of a new version of its DOS software for personal computers. Intel added 1 1/4, to 115 1/2, and Sun Microsystems 1 3/8, to 29 5/8. Nasdaq medical stocks also climbed, with US Healthcare up 3, to 44 3/4; Amgen up 2, to 37, and St. Jude Medical up 1 1/2, to 32 1/4.

HEADLINE: Budget Politics Exposed in Fight for Supercollider

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27

 BODY:
While posing for television cameras as tightfisted accountants, lawmakers are fighting behind the scenes to protect one expensive program or another as Congress votes on President Clinton's plans for cutting the Federal deficit.
Like land mines half hidden in the sand, these programs could block the progress of Mr. Clinton's economic plan. Removing them means grappling with complex combinations of local and political interests. 
 Nowhere are the intricacies of budget politics more evident than in the all-out effort by the otherwise frugal Texas and Louisiana delegations to save the superconducting supercollider, the gigantic proton smasher that is being built under the plains of Waxahachie, Tex., and outfitted with huge magnets from Hammond, La. It is worth more than 7,000 jobs in its construction and operation.
But it will also cost $8.4 billion over six or seven years, a figure that White House budget-cutters are sure to find tempting when the country is hard pressed to pay for more prosaic needs, like the interest on the national debt.
 
Economics Versus Politics
 Mr. Clinton and the Congress must negotiate through an obstacle course of hundreds of individual spending items, as diverse as subsidies for cotton growers in Arizona or money for construction of Seawolf submarines in Connecticut. Economists can make a powerful argument to cut any of them, but the political logic often goes in another direction.
In the case of the supercollider, Mr. Clinton is thought to have doubts on its economics, but he is well aware that its future is closely tied not only to jobs in the battleground state of Texas, but also to the Democratic Party's hopes to maintain control of the Senate. So far, he is standing by a campaign pledge to support the project, a promise that helped him win Louisiana and stay competitive in Texas in the Presidential election.
For all the political maneuvering expected in the coming months over the supercollider, the arguments so far virtually never refer to politics. With its potential to form new alloys and stronger metals, proponents concentrate on the supercollider's vital role in keeping the United States competitive in industry and dominant in science.
 
Secret of Energy and Matter
 "This is fundamental, basic science that can give us the answer to what energy and matter are made of," said Senator J. Bennett Johnston, Democrat of Louisiana.
But Senator Dale Bumpers of Arkansas, a Democrat who is a strong advocate of cuts to lower the Federal deficit, views the proton-smasher as an unaffordable example of high-technology pork. "I'm not saying there isn't a lot of elegant science that can be gleaned from this, but that's what it is: elegant," he said. "We can't afford elegance now."
The arguments against the supercollider were bolstered last month by a General Accounting Office report estimating a $630 million cost overrun in its $1.25 billion construction budget alone.
But in the end, said Representative Sherwood Boehlert of upstate New York, "the superconducting supercollider is raw hardball politics."
After the first inning, the project's proponents are ahead, as Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who was a Texas Senator until two months ago, prevailed over the budget director, Leon E. Panetta, and persuaded President Clinton to include the project in his budget proposal. And allied with Mr. Bentsen are some of the most powerful members of Congress, which is why the supercollider is likely to survive, though perhaps in a somewhat scaled-back form.
 
Not Taken for Granted
 But this year no one is taking anything for granted, as public pressure for shrinking the deficit is changing the political calculus on the Hill, said Representative Sam Coppersmith, an Arizona freshman Democrat on the Science, Space and Technology Committee. "In the old days, the dynamic was, He got his project, I got mine," said Mr. Coppersmith, who is torn between costs and merits of the project. "Now the psychology is, My project got cut, now cut his."
In the Senate, at least three members -- Senators Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut and Dennis DeConcini, Democrat of Arizona -- are rethinking their past support. "Before you raise taxes, you cut spending," Mr. D'Amato said, explaining his switch.
Against those new pressures to cut, the supercollider proponents have a powerful lineup including these lawmakers:
*Senator Johnston, the chairman of the Energy Committee and a subcommittee chairman on the Appropriations Committee, who has heavy sway over his colleagues by holding the keys to mining on public lands, offshore drilling and other energy projects.
*Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, who as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, holds the purse strings for some incumbents facing tough fights in 1994.
*Representative Tom Bevill of Alabama who is chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee that handles the supercollider. Even if the House votes kill the project, as it did last year, he is in a position to work to revive it in a Senate-House conference committee.
But Mr. Johnston, Mr. Gramm and Mr. Bevill face a fight. Last year, the Senate voted 62 to 32 to save the proton-smasher, which is designed to investigate the most profound secrets of the origin of the universe. But at least a handful of lawmakers say they are ready to change their votes, and most of the Senate freshman are thought to be skeptical.
"I'm not confident," Mr. Gramm said. "It's a hard sell every year. If the President made an all-out effort it would help."
 
More Scrutiny
 Mr. Johnston voiced more confidence, but he added, "I'm acutely aware that all projects are subject to increased scrutiny."
Under the Bush Administration's budget estimate for 1993, expenditures for the supercollider would come to $859 million. The new Administration is expected to ask for $640 million in its budget next month.
Opponents say their best hope goes something like this: under public pressure, the House rejects the project by a greater margin than last year's 231-to-181 vote; then, the margin to approve the project in the Senate is slashed by at least a dozen votes, and finally, as the supercollider goes to a Senate-House spending conference, probably sometime in the fall, Mr. Clinton lets Mr. Bevill and other Democratic lawmakers know that he no longer supports the program.
The large freshman class must supply the nay votes to increase the House margin, and many of them have caught the budget-cutting fever.
 
All Up to Clinton
 That leaves matters in the hands of Mr. Clinton. Mr. Panetta, who voted against the project as a Representative last year, put the supercollider on his cut list this year. But when Gov. Ann Richards of Texas was at the White House watching the Super Bowl with Mr. Clinton, she convinced him that if he slashed the project, he would undercut whatever hope Senator Bob Krueger -- the Democrat she appointed to replace Mr. Bentsen -- has of winning the the special election on May 1, an election that could weaken the Democrats' already uncertain control of the Senate.
"I don't know where the President's true feelings lie," said an Administration official involved in budget matters. "It was never a firm decision." Still, Vice President Al Gore, a strong supporter of the supercollider in the Senate, is working to reinforce Mr. Bentsen's argument that Mr. Clinton should stand by his campaign promise whether or not Mr. Krueger wins.
Mr. Bumpers, who has close ties to the President, said he hoped that Mr. Clinton would come around and drop his support for the supercollider. "He knows he is not going to get anything like all the cuts he requested in Medicare, farm subsidies or pay freezes on federal employees," the Arkansas Democrat said. "So then he'll have to look someplace else for the big bucks."

New York City Yields at 18-Year Low

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
New York City sold $758 million worth of bonds yesterday, with yields at the lowest level since the eve of the city's fiscal crisis 18 years ago.
The bonds will be used to refinance about $664 million of old, higher-interest-rate bonds. The city is taking advantage of the sharp decline in interest rates since the Presidential election, which has brought long-term rates to their lowest levels since the 1970's. The new bond issue is expected to help the city save about $100 million in interest costs in the fiscal years 1993 to 2000. 
 The bond issues include several kinds of so-called derivative products to lower the costs for the city.
 
35-Day Adjustable Rate
 One, which was created by Lehman Brothers, involves $73 million of bonds due in 2013 and 2014. The bonds offer one group of investors an interest rate that is adjusted every 35 days. A second group of investors would get a much higher rate of interest. But if short-term interest rates rise, then the return to the second group of investors is cut to pay a higher rate to the first group.
Other regular long-term bonds that were sold yesterday went at a yield of 6.35 percent, while the derivatives went at a lower yield -- or cost to the city -- of 6.25 percent. In a statement the city said this deal saved it approximately $1.4 million.
In addition, derivatives can reduce the total amount of conventional bonds in the offering. By offering fewer conventional bonds, New York City hoped to make the offering more attractive.
 
Total Offering Reduced
 But as the bonds were priced yesterday, the demand for these derivative products was much less than expected and the total offering was cut from a possible $200 million or more to about $135 million, according to Dennis Boyle, a managing director of the municipal bond syndicate at Merrill Lynch & Company, the lead underwriter for the city issue.
Mr. Boyle said retail demand was fairly strong for the city's conventional issues up to 1999 and for the maturities from 2004 out to 2016, which the yield was 6 percent or over. The demand for the maturities of 2000 to 2003 was weaker because they were in the intermediate range but the yield was under 6 percent. He said that he expected that the portion of the bond issue that will be left in the hands of the underwriters will total about $235 million.
The yields on the tax-exempt issues range from 3.25 percent on the bonds due in August of 1994 to 5.20 percent on 1998 maturities; 5.90 percent in 2003 and 6.35 percent on 2009 through 2011 and 2014 through 2016. The 6.35 percent yield is the lowest since the spring of 1975.
The taxable equivalent yields are much higher, especially for triple tax exempt New York City residents. The taxable equivalent yield on the long-term bonds with a tax-exempt yield of 6.35 percent is close to 13 percent for a New York City and state taxpayer in the top Federal tax bracket of 39.6 percent, including a 10 percent surtax, proposed by President Clinton.
 
Flood of New Issues
 The New York City bonds are part of a flood of new issues this week that could total $8 billion, according to Bloomberg Business News. That flood has been weighing on prices, which have fallen recently. Yesterday, traders said prices of actively traded municipal bonds were unchanged in light trading.
The rush of new issues because of the fall in interest rates is reflected in the preliminary figures for the first quarter of the year from the Securities Data Corporation. These show there was a record $61.64 billion of new issues in the first three months of the year, a 23 percent increase over the first quarter of 1992, according to preliminary data. The total issuance last year of $232.4 billion was a record for the tax-exempt municipal market.
The rush to take advantage of lower interest rates is clear in the preliminary totals. More than 67 percent of the total new issues refinanced older debt with higher interest rates.
The pace of the refinancing this year, if it continued, would lead to another record year. This is in sharp contrast to the forecasts at the end of last year for a decline in new issues and refinancings this year. But those forecasts were made on the assumption that interest rates would remain relatively stable.
 
Treasury Market
 Prices of Treasury notes rose slightly yesterday, but the price of the 30-year bond fell. Treasury notes seemed to get some support from local governments, which buy these securities to put into escrow funds to pay off higher-rate debt.
The price of the 30-year bond rose early in the day but then fell 8/32 as the yield rose to 6.91 percent, up from 6.89 percent Monday. Traders said there was renewed focus on inflation, as the price of gold rose sharply. Yet, the decline in the Conference Board's index of consumer confidence was another indicator that economic growth will be slower, which would ease inflationary worries.
Because of the uncertainty about the outlook, prices ought to remain in a tight range until Friday, when the Department of Labor will release the March employment report.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Off Sharply

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
The prospect of higher taxes and deeper spending cuts under President Clinton's economic plan seems to have dampened consumers' spirits -- and spending -- in March.
The index of consumer confidence released yesterday by the Conference Board, a business research group, fell a surprisingly sharp six points in March, to 62.6, following an eight-point decline in February. 
 In all, two-thirds of the post-election surge in the confidence measure had evaporated, as fewer consumers said in March that they expected their incomes to improve in the next six months and more foresaw a decline.
 
'A Real Softening'
 "I don't think anyone expected him to raise taxes only on the top 1 percent of income earners," Michael Gould, chairman of Bloomingdale's, said in a recent interview, referring to the reaction to President Clinton's plan for cutting the budget deficit in a Feb. 17 speech to Congress. "Nonetheless, there's been a real softening after his speech."
Economists say consumers seem to think the President's plan to cut the deficit is apt to slow economic growth. That might have been borne out by the component of the confidence survey that measures consumer expectations for six months hence. That index fell almost 8 points in March, and has lost about 27 points since December.
Consumers were gloomier in March in spite of signs that jobs might be getting a little more plentiful. Another Conference Board survey released yesterday -- one that covers help-wanted advertising in 51 major newspapers -- showed that advertising for job openings jumped in February, especially in the South and Midwest.
Retailers said that March sales pretty much mirrored the slump in spirits, with ferocious winter storms adding to consumers' woes. According to the latest report from Johnson Redbook, which surveys more than 25 retailers every week, sales in the first four weeks of March were nearly a percentage point lower than in February. And analysts expect uniformly downbeat reports from the nation's largest retail chains next week.
 
'Additional Things'
 But consumers had already turned more cautious before the bad weather hit. In January and February, the Commerce Department reported earlier this week, consumer spending grew at roughly half the robust rate of last fall -- a 2.8 percent annual rate versus 5.1 percent.
"My C.E.O.'s and I all have this sense that there are additional things on customers' minds," said George R. MrKonic, the executive vice president for specialty retailing at Kmart who overseas seven of the company's national specialty chains, including Waldenbooks and Builders Square. Even stores that weren't in the storms' paths complained of mediocre results, he said."That's one piece of evidence that something else was going on in March."
The Conference Board's consumer confidence measure does tend to zig and zag more than another widely followed consumer poll. But the University of Michigan survey for the first half of March, released to clients last week, also showed an erosion in expectations since December -- although the Michigan decline looks a lot less alarming than the Conference Board's 15-point drop over the last three months.
"Consumers clearly recognize the improving economy, and they're still quite positive about current conditions," Richard Curtin, director of the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers, said. "But they are also re-evaluating how quickly things are going to get better."
Although expectations for a rebound in April and the rest of the year remain, the current state of consumer finances seems to point to the modest 3 percent gains in consumer spending that the Blue Chip consensus of economic forecasters has been predicting.
 
A Sensitive Issue
 One sore point clearly is taxes. "Taxes are a very sensitive issue," Fabian Linden, director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center, said. "Because Bush had the Treasury withhold less from people's' paychecks, people realize that they are going to have to pay more on April 15."
Further, the trend of inflation and long-term interest rates -- which, when declining, enables homeowners to refinance mortgages and reduce their monthly bills -- is no longer downward. And the savings level is near an all-time low, making it less likely that consumers can squeeze savings further to finance big increases in buying.
Most important, wages and salaries have been growing sluggishly, partly because the unemployment rate has been just inching down and partly because lots of companies, worried about holding down costs, are still reluctant to hand out raises.
 The March consumer confidence reading was the lowest level since July, although significantly higher than a year ago, when the index totaled 56.5, and from the recession readings of 50 or lower.
The index, calculated on a base of 100, is derived from a survey sent to 5,000 households nationwide, which covers questions ranging from home-buying plans to local job conditions.
The index is regarded as an important indicator of household financial and employment security, which plays a direct role in consumer willingness to borrow and spend. Consumer spending, in turn, is responsible for about two-thirds of the nation's overall economic activity.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Farm Product Prices Up
 WASHINGTON, March 30 (AP) -- The prices farmers get for raw products rose seven-tenths of 1 percent from February to March, but stood 2.8 percent lower than a year earlier, the Agriculture Department said today.
Price gains in the month for cattle, corn, eggs and hogs more than offset price declines for apples, lettuce, milk and sweet corn. When compared with last March, prices for corn, oranges, tomatoes and wheat dropped more than enough to offset increases for cattle, celery, eggs and hogs.
Crop prices collectively dropped 1.7 percent from February and 13 percent from the average a year earlier. Vegetable prices declined 9 percent from February and 22 percent from a year earlier. The all-fruit price index in March was down 10 percent from February and 45 percent from a year earlier.
Feed grains and hay rose 2.8 percent from February but dropped 12 percent from a year earlier. The March corn price, at $2.08 a bushel, was up 8 cents from February but still the lowest March price in five years.
Meat animals moved up 2.1 percent from February and averaged 7.9 percent above March 1992.
Poultry and egg prices rose 7.4 percent during the month and 17 percent from last year.

HEADLINE: India Cancels Dam Loan From World Bank

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30

 BODY:
The Indian Government today canceled much of a $450 million World Bank loan for a vast irrigation and hydroelectric project, because it cannot meet the bank's environmental and resettlement standards.
Bimal Jalan, India's representative on the bank's board, told his colleagues today that his country would not seek the remaining $170 million that had been authorized for the project, but not yet allocated, for the $3 billion project on the Narmada River, in the drought-prone northwest part of the country. 
 The decision is a major victory for international environmental groups who have fought the huge irrigation and hydroelectric project and the bank's involvement in it. For many environmentalists, the dam was a symbol of misguided support of heavy-handed development projects that sometimes do more harm than good.
But Indian officials emphasize that they intend to complete the project on their own, adhering to the bank's environmental and resettlement requirements. World Bank officials said privately that India preferred to complete the project without interference from multinational lending institutions. The Indian Government has viewed the criticism by environmentalists as an affront to its sovereignty, and an example of Westerners telling a developing nation how to run its affairs.
The enormous project includes the 535-foot-high Sardar Sarovar dam and more than 3,000 others, 47,000 miles of canals and a plan to provide 1,450 megawatts of power -- enough energy to provide electricity to 1.4 million American homes for a year -- irrigation for 4.4 million acres of land and drinking water to 40 million people. The project is sponsored by three Indian states: Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.
The World Bank chose to finance a portion of the Narmada River Valley project in 1985, without the benefit of a full environmental impact study. Concerns raised by environmental groups forced the bank to undertake its first independent review of a bank-financed development project.
The review, done in 1991 by Bradford Morse, an American who was the former head of the United Nations Development Program and Thomas Berger, a Canadian Supreme Court justice, cited a number of environmental and resettlement problems and called for the bank to "step back from the project and consider it afresh."
Despite the report, the bank board kept funding for the project alive in October, over the objections of American and Japanese representatives. At the same time, the board gave India until March 31 to meet a series of standards, called "benchmarks," covering environmental concerns and how to resettle the more than 140,000 villagers who would be forced off their land by the rising waters.
Unable to meet the standards, the Indian Government decided today to forgo World Bank funding rather than try to plead for more time to comply. "They knew as well as anyone else that getting an agreement for relief of the benchmarks would have been a very contentious and politically charged task," a World Bank official said.
The remaining part of the World Bank loan represents a small fraction of the total cost of the project, and work is far along on major portions. Still, whether the Indian Government can complete the project without World Bank financing is an open question.

HEADLINE: Cairo Journal;
Fury of Islam Dims Expatriate Sparkle on the Nile

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, March 30

 BODY:
Despite its congestion and pollution, heaps of garbage and bureaucratic ineptitude, Cairo offers many foreigners what their home countries do not: entrance into the upper echelons of society, legions of servants and the glow that the elite derive from privilege.
But the cocoon spun around most expatriates in Egypt is crumbling. And the self-assuredness of the Europeans and the Americans, who socialize at hotels and clubs beyond the means of most Egyptians, has given way to fear. 
 "Life was very easy when I first came," said Patricia M. Goltermann, who is from Riverside, Calif., and has lived in Cairo for five years. "There was no place you did not feel safe and comfortable. Now things have changed."
 
A Deadly Warning
 The Islamic Group, which has carried out violent attacks against foreign tourists, said recently that it would strike at foreign businesses and foreign workers. The group told expatriates three weeks ago to leave Egypt "to preserve their lives." But so far there has been no visible evacuation undertaken by foreigners, although tourism has been way down.
Today, the Islamic Group issued what it said was a final call for all expatriates to leave Egypt, "because the time for warnings has ended."
The statement coincided with an explosion inside the burial chamber of one of the three pyramids at Giza, Egypt's most-visited tourist site. There was no apparent damage to the 4,500-year-old Chephren pyramid, but two Egyptian workers were wounded.
Officials said later that the explosion was accidental. But it underscored the jitters in this country, where tourism has been severely damaged. .
The threats by the Islamic Group, given force by the violence against foreign tourists that has left three dead and about two dozen wounded, have seen most of the 35,000 Americans and Europeans alter their daily routine.
Many foreign residents no longer go to the city center, where three bombs have exploded in the last month, and most dress more conservatively. A few foreign women have even begun to wear an Islamic veil in public, and others wear glasses to protect themselves from the vials of acid tossed at foreign women by Islamic militants.
 
Westerners 'Are Bracing'
 Family trips out of Cairo, to places like the pharaonic sites in Upper Egypt, are out of bounds. Some foreign workers are not renewing contracts, and companies are making contingency plans to evacuate foreign employees.
"Everyone who comes into our building now is searched," said the manager of one of the largest European companies in Egypt. He added that all cars parked in the garage were searched, too. "We are bracing for attacks."
In a city with little violent crime, and a low-paid servant class, many of the burdens of urban life, from phone bills to child care, are alleviated for expatriates by maids, errand boys, drivers, cooks and nannies.
The political and cultural systems that created the wealth and power of the industrialized nations were accepted in recent years as something worthy of, if not imitation, then at least deference. And some upper-class Egyptians, who admire the manners and customs of the West as fervently as the Islamic militants spurn it, speak French or English to their children.
But the mood of the country, burdened by overpopulation and crushing poverty, has changed in the last year with the rise of Islamic militancy. Increasing numbers of Egyptian women now wear veils, pubs and bars are being closed, and the influence of the West is blamed in militant tracts for everything from economic deprivation to AIDS.
 
Luxury Amid Squalor
 The frustration is increasingly vented on the foreign residents, many of whom live in the luxury suburb of Maadi, with its large houses and lawns, or Zamalek, the exclusive Nile island.
Ibrahim Ali Khalil, a 24-year-old truck driver who earns $50 a month, sat in the cab of his battered pickup on a dusty street in the Imbaba slum.
"Money means nothing to these foreigners," he said, looking toward an elderly man selling chickens in wooden cages. "They are ruining our country by dressing provocatively and implanting their ideas in the minds of Egyptians."
When asked about the attacks against foreigners, he paused.
"Whoever does wrong," he said quietly, "gets what they deserve."
The discontent is not lost on many expatriates, although few speak Arabic and many isolate themselves from all but the upper crust of Egyptian society.
"Egyptians are not as warm and friendly as before," Paul F. Allam, a Scottish physical-education teacher, said. "We know that these attacks come from a small group, but most locals, who are not extremists or fundamentalists, have changed, both in the way they dress and how they behave."
The schools and cultural institutions that are linked to the West, likethe Cairo-American College, which received a bomb threat three weeks ago, or American University in Cairo, have made concerted efforts to lower their profiles and have increased their security staff. The wrestlers at the Cairo-American College, for example, have been told to remove their varsity jackets in public.
 
Acid Hurled at Women
 There have been a few attacks against foreign residents, most commonly the tossing of acid on the legs of women wearing pants or short dresses.
"I warned my uncle and aunt, who are visiting here from the United States, not to go to Aswan," said 29-year-old Michael Slade of Minneapolis, who is a student at the American University in Cairo. "But they didn't listen to me. When they got there three bombs went off."
Jayne E. Cookson, a 60-year-old artist from Eugene, Ore., who has lived in Cairo since 1990, wears glasses in public to protect herself from acid-throwing militants. Although in love with Egypt, and often seen in the past sketching the crumbling Islamic monuments around the city, she rarely ventures out now.
"I see my friends less," she said, "and I have made the hours of my visits earlier. I do not go into town at night. I was thinking of staying indefinitely, but now I wonder how much longer I will be here."

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Are Impatient to Start Pentagon Cuts

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30

 BODY:
In Congress's first formal response to the Administration's proposed $263 billion military spending plan, lawmakers reacted coolly today to what the Pentagon concedes is a "holding budget."
Les Aspin, in his first appearance as Defense Secretary before the House Armed Services Committee he formerly headed, seemed almost apologetic at times in proposing a military budget for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. It would postpone decisions on canceling costly weapons programs until the Pentagon completes a comprehensive "bottom-up" review this summer. 
 Mr. Aspin's successor, Representative Ronald V. Dellums, Democrat of California, accused the Defense Secretary of clinging too closely to the budget he inherited from the former Defense Secretary, Dick Cheney. He said Congress needed to examine possible cuts for fiscal year 1994 -- suggestions have included attack aircraft, submarines and the expensive C-17 transport plane -- without waiting for the complete Defense Department review.
 
Why Wait Another Year?
 "This committee will need to act on next year's defense budget before the completion of the bottom-up review," Mr. Dellums said. "It should not blindly accept 'treading water' as the proper course for fiscal year 1994. There would be a significant cost to delaying for another year our inevitable adjustment to the post-cold war world."
The talk of the hearing today was of transition: from George Bush to Bill Clinton, cold war to post-cold-war, Mr. Cheney to Mr. Aspin, and from Mr. Aspin to Mr. Dellums.
As committee chairman, Mr. Aspin, a moderate Democrat from Wisconsin who supported early military action in the Persian Gulf war, wielded power through his mastery of military issues and by rewarding loyal committee members by financing pet projects in their districts.
Mr. Dellums, for years the most outspoken Congressional advocate of slashing the Pentagon's budget, now assumes the difficult task of leading a disparate group of liberal Democrats, conservative Republicans and some 20 new lawmakers on the panel, including 17 freshmen, to agree on a common committee spending plan.
 
A Time for Speeches
 Indeed, today's hearing featured more speeches from lawmakers than questions to Mr. Aspin and Gen. Colin L. Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Many lawmakers expressed concerns about parochial interests like base closings and National Guard forces, while some Republicans said Mr. Clinton's long-term budget cuts would hurt military readiness.
"I want to, in the very outset, express my concern for what many feel are cuts that are too deep in our military," said Representative Floyd Spence of South Carolina, the committee's ranking Republican.
Mr. Spence and other Republicans contended that Mr. Clinton's proposal to cut more than $120 billion through 1998 beyond what Mr. Bush had proposed dangerously exceeded the President's own campaign promise. Mr. Clinton had vowed in the campaign to cut $60 billion more than Mr. Bush through 1997. Mr. Aspin said the additional savings resulted mainly from a freeze on government workers' pay and revised assumptions about inflation, and that it did not mean deeper troop cuts or weapons cancellations.
Mr. Aspin repeatedly emphasized the Administration's aim to maintain current training levels for troops and shrink the total number of troops, rather than let military readiness slip.
 
Feeling the Uncertainty
 In a reflection of the effects of the uncertainty on the armed services, General Powell said that military officials were "a little concerned" about "early warning signs" in recruiting.
The Army, in particular, is having to accept more recruits without high school diplomas, although 94 percent of all recruits are still high school graduates, said Maj. George Wright, a spokesman for the Army Recruiting Command at Fort Knox, Ky.
Major Wright attributed the trend to declining advertising budgets, a misperception that the military was no longer signing up new recruits and fewer recruiters. Spokesmen for the Navy, Marine Corps and Navy said goals have been more difficult to meet, but that virtually all recruits are high school graduates.

HEADLINE: Study Sees Rising Distress For Landlords

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
The number of privately owned rental apartment buildings in New York City showing signs of financial distress has risen sharply in the last five years, an indication that a new wave of abandonment may be around the corner, a study has concluded.
The study, by the Community Service Society of New York and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, estimates that 140,000 rental units -- one out of six rental buildings in the city -- is either behind in taxes, or mortgage payments or both. 
 The study concludes that a serious new surge in abandonment could occur, though not of the proportion that ruined many neighborhoods in the 1960's and 70's. That wave, which at its peak had the city taking over as many as 10,000 buildings a year, turned the city government into a major landlord, owner of a huge and decrepit stock of buildings that are still a management headache and a financial drain.
 
Affecting Poor Areas
 The report, "Housing on the Block: Disinvestment and Abandonment Risk in New York City Neighborhoods," is to be released today. It found that most of the buildings in jeopardy are in poor neighborhoods, in many of the same areas that suffered widespread abandonment before. At the top of the list of neighborhoods at risk, for example, are Central Harlem in Manhattan, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Crown Heights and Bushwick in Brooklyn and the Mott Haven section of the Bronx.
But not all neighborhoods at risk are characterized as poor. Also at risk for a decline in housing stock, the report said, is the Chelsea-Clinton area on Manhattan's West Side, a neighborhood with many small, quaint buildings that had attracted wealthier tenants and many new stores and restaurants in the 1980's.
The increase in property-tax arrears follows a period in the mid-1980's when the city experienced a slowdown in the number of properties that were being abandoned and had to be taken over by the city. In the 1980's the region was buoyed by an extraordinary rise in real-estate values and home prices.
But in recent years the city's real-estate market has slumped, the recession has made it harder for many tenants to keep up with rents and landlords have faced higher operating costs. Many owners are reeling from increases in water and sewer fees. The increase is a result of the new metering system that the city is now reviewing.
The Community Service Society of New York is a 150-year-old private nonprofit organization that is concerned with issues like the housing, health, education and welfare of the city's neediest residents. The social-service agency has no connections with the real-estate industry.
The research by the Community Service Society found a 71 percent increase in tax arrears on rental properties from 1988 to mid-1992. Moreover, in 1992 more than 4,000 rental properties reached the courts in foreclosure proceedings compared to 100 in 1986.
 
Fewer Redeeming Properties
 A spokesman for the city's Department of Finance confirmed tax delinquencies had risen sharply in the last five years, but said he could not coment on the accuracy of the study's data or conclusions because he had not read the report.
The Department of Finance statistics show, for example, that in 1989, $152.7 million, or 2.45 percent of the property-tax roll, was in arrears. In 1992, $370.3 million, or 4.45 percent of the rolls, was delinquent.
Another significant indicator of the potential for widespread abandonment, the report said, was in the declining rate of ownership redemption, when landlords pay off taxes to halt a takeover by the city. In 1988, 9 out of 10 landlords with tax delinquencies settled their tax bills to avoid losing their properties. The study found that in 1992 only one out of four owners redeemed their properties.
David R. Jones, president of the Community Service Society, said: "The problem is that some these neighborhood are becoming intensely poor. Without the sort of income mix present even two decades ago, the core of these neighborhoods, working people, is lost. If this process is allowed to continue without intervention, the cost of rebuilding will be vastly more expensive in the end."
 
Rents Don't Cover Payments
 One significant difference from previous periods of serious default is that this time a contributing factor was the real-estate boom of the 1980's, the authors of the study said.
Victor Bach, director of the housing policy and research unit of the Community Service Society and who with Sherece West, researched and wrote the report, said many of the landlords had gone into the real-estate market when values were rising and refinancing loans were easier to obtain. They had expected the value of the property to keep climbing. Now some of those owners are not getting rents that meet their higher mortgage payments.
One positive finding, the study said, was a decrease, 27 percent, in reported incidents of arson from 1987 to 1991.
Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner for the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said the survey's findings were another reflection of the continued recession in the region.
"There is still a crunch in the general economy of New York," he said. "There has been a slight strengthening, but we have yet to see a significant move to job recovery. We are still bumping along. When tenants can't pay their rents, it impacts property owners."
Michael D. Lappin, president of the Community Preservation Corporation, a lending company founded by New York banks to make loans for redevelopment in poor neighborhoods, said the findings in the report were troubling but did not necessarily spell disaster for the city's rental housing stock.
"There are troubling indicators to suggest that the recession has put rental housing in danger," he said. "Foreclosures in apartment buildings continues to occur. But what is different from the situation in the 1970's is that these buildings still have value. There are buyers for these foreclosed buildings and there is still a demand for housing."
Among the recommendations in the study, was that the city establish a task force to develop a strategy to save buildings in jeopardy.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gold and Silver Prices Soar, But Rally May Be Fleeting

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold futures prices surged to their highest level of the year yesterday as commodity funds poured money into precious metals.
Analysts said there was no clear fundamental reason for the rally and cautioned that prices could quickly reverse course without broader support. 
 Gold for April delivery jumped $4.80 on the Commodity Exchange in New York to $337 a troy ounce, the highest settlement price for near-term deliveries since Dec. 17. May silver soared 14.7 cents, to $3.90 a troy ounce, the highest level since Nov. 5.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, April platinum leaped $5.10, to $363.70 a troy ounce.
 
Germany the Trigger
 The high-volume buying began in Europe overnight. The overseas buying was prompted by the German central bank's announcement that it will stick to its policy of lowering interest rates in small steps, in part to avoid driving up the value of the American dollar, said Peter Cardillo, research director with Westfalia Investments Inc. in New York.
A stronger dollar makes investments denominated in the American currency more attractive, which weakens investment demand for gold.
The surge continued in the United States as metal prices moved above longstanding resistance points, including $3.80 in the silver market, which brought in more buyers.
Fund managers, who tend to base trading decisions on the market's technical behavior rather than external factors, were big buyers, analysts said.
"They all went like dominoes in a row once the market got rolling," said Martin Reichenberg, manager of trading services for Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J.
But Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst with Paine Webber Inc., said the rally needed to be confirmed by further advances.
"If this move is for real, we should have more gains tomorrow, possibly big gains," he said. "If it sputters, and we go down tomorrow, that could indicate this is just a technical rally."
In other markets, energy prices ended the day mixed in advance of the weekly report on inventories from the American Petroleum Institute. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light sweet crude oil for May delivery slipped 1 cent, to $20.28 a barrel; April heating oil fell 0.89 cent, to 55.96 cents a gallon, and April unleaded gasoline fell 0.61 cent, to 59.01 cents a gallon. But May natural gas rose 0.15 cent, to $2.042 for 1,000 cubic feet.
