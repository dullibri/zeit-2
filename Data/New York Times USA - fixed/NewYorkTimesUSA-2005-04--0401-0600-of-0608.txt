HEADLINE: F.D.R.'s Bill of Rights: What Happened?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Tears came to my eyes as I read ''A Radical in the White House'' (column, April 18), Bob Herbert's commemoration of Franklin D. Roosevelt's death 60 years ago. The tears were shed not for the end of a glorious, heroic life but for the end of glorious, heroic ideas and hopes. 
 At 82, I remember with clarity the Roosevelt years, as well as the hopes for a good life that lingered after F.D.R.'s death. 
 The war ended, we married, raised families, pursued careers -- and believed that our lives would be filled with honest purpose and that the world would be a better place. 
 We believed that F.D.R.'s ''second Bill of Rights'' spelled out a prophecy for our lives, our golden future.
 That wonderful age of innocence and idealism! How did it all disappear? 
 Is there one towering personality who can bring us together again to save the decency and pride of America? Someone who can cry out, ''There is nothing to fear''?

HEADLINE: F.D.R.'s Bill of Rights: What Happened?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Bob Herbert, contrasting this administration with the New Deal era, asks a poignant question: ''How in the world did we allow ourselves to get from there to here?'' As someone born in 1933, two weeks before Franklin D. Roosevelt was sworn in, the answer seems obvious. 
 The more we gained, the more we lost. As our resources grew, so did our greed.
 Greed is our No.1 enemy. It has blinded today's politicians and destroyed the basic values of individual human rights espoused by F.D.R.
 That's how we got from there to here.

HEADLINE: Intel's Profit Up Sharply As Chip Sales Stay Strong

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 19 

 BODY:
Intel Corporation, the biggest maker of semiconductors, reported Tuesday that profits rose about 25 percent in the first quarter on high demand for chips for notebook computers and mobile devices. The strong showing beat Wall Street's forecasts and quelled some investor concern that the technology sector was experiencing another slowdown.
 Intel's upbeat report came less than a week after I.B.M. disappointed investors with quarterly earnings that fell short of analysts' expectations and the company's own projections. I.B.M.'s poor performance dragged down the market and seemed to signal weak demand in corporate technology spending. 
 Intel executives assured investors on Tuesday that the company was seeing no such slowdown in demand, and expressed confidence in global economic conditions. 
 ''We see a pretty seasonal, normal environment,'' said Andy Bryant, Intel's chief financial officer, in a conference call with investors. ''As of today, worldwide demand seems pretty solid.'' 
 Intel's earnings report, which along with I.B.M. is considered a bellwether of the technology sector, came after the close of regular trading. Shares of Intel rose 42 cents, to close at $22.63, then rose nearly 6 percent in after-hours trading.
 ''Clearly, the macro environment is uncertain,'' said Tim Luke, an analyst with Lehman Brothers. ''But it does seem that demand in general has been remained solid and that Intel's execution has improved.'' 
 Intel executives attributed the company's strong results to increased sales of higher-priced chips used in notebook computers, wireless networks and cellular handsets. Mr. Bryant said that the company was also clearly benefiting from improved manufacturing processes. 
 The company, based in Santa Clara, Calif., reported net income of $2.15 billion, or 34 cents a share, compared with $1.73 billion, or 26 cents a share, in the first quarter last year. Analysts had forecast earnings of 31 cents a share on sales of $9.31 billion, according to Thomson Financial. 
 Revenue rose 17 percent over last year, to $9.4 billion, from $8.1 billion. The first quarter includes an extra week, though company executives said that they were unable to estimate its impact on the quarter.
 Gross profit margin was 59.3 percent, beating the company's forecast of roughly 57 percent and up from 55 percent in the fourth quarter.
 ''The boost to gross margins is definitely a net positive,'' said Adam Parker, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. 
 Last month, Mr. Bryant raised guidance for the quarter, telling investors that Intel would have sales of $9.2 billion to $9.4 billion, compared with earlier projections for sales between $8.8 billion and $9.4 billion, because of improved manufacturing and lower than expected start-up costs.
 Looking ahead, Intel said that it expected revenue in the second quarter to be in a range of $8.6 billion to $9.2 billion, in line with the average analyst forecast of $8.9 billion.
 Providing proof of the Intel's confidence in technology spending, Mr. Bryant said that the company was increasing its manufacturing capacity and accelerating capital spending. Intel said that it planned $5.4 billion to $5.8 billion in capital spending in 2005, up from its earlier projection of $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion. 
 Intel's report also came only days after Advanced Micro Devices, Intel's leading competitor, posted a loss for the first quarter from poor sales in its flash memory chip business. A.M.D.'s microprocessor business fared well, however, posing a 31 percent increase over the same period a year earlier, showing strong demand within the company's core business segment. Much of A.M.D.'s problems in flash memory are from competitive pressures, including price cuts by Intel on its flash memory chips. 
 A.M.D. and Intel have been racing to deliver their first chips based on dual-core technology, which places two processing engines on a single core. Intel said on Monday that personal computer makers, like Dell, have started shipping dual-care systems. A.M.D. is expected to begin shipping its first dual-core chips -- the Opteron chip for server computers -- on Thursday. 
 Mr. Parker said that Intel's increase in capital spending was aimed at staying ahead of A.M.D.

In Asia, General Motors' profits plummeted in the first quarter, but the first hints of a rebound are starting to become visible in China, its most important Asian market. [C8.]

Court Limits Basis for Stock Suits
The Supreme Court ruled in a closely watched fraud case that an accusation that a company's misrepresentations caused an inflated share price was insufficient as a basis for a lawsuit. Justice Stephen G. Breyer, left, writing for the court, said that the purpose of permitting private suits for securities fraud was ''not to provide investors with broad insurance against market losses, but to protect them against those economic losses that misrepresentations actually cause.'' [C3.]

New Food Pyramid Has 12 Forms
The Agriculture Department introduced a food pyramid that comes in 12 versions, depending on activity level and caloric need. [A23.]

Stocks Gain on Earnings News

Coca-Cola Earnings Fall 6 Percent
In its first-quarter earnings announcement, Coke reported sales growth in Asia, Africa and Latin America that far outweighed growth in the United States and Europe. These positive results allowed Coke's chief executive, E. Neville Isdell, to project a note of optimism amid otherwise lackluster results. Coke's overall earnings fell 6 percent, to $1.5 billion, slightly exceeding forecasts. Revenue rose 4 percent, to $5.3 billion. [C20.]

Pfizer reported sharply lower first-quarter earnings, while Johnson & Johnson, reported a doubt-digit earnings increase. [C2.]

HEADLINE: Signs of a Rebound, Even as G.M.'s Asian Profits Fall

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, April 19 

 BODY:
General Motors' profits in Asia plummeted in the first quarter, but the first hints of a rebound are starting to become visible in China, the automaker's most important Asian market, company executives and analysts said Tuesday.
 Automakers post profits based on their sales to independent dealers, not the dealers' sales to the public. G.M. cut its shipments to dealers in China by half in January and February, mostly blaming inventories of unsold cars that swelled as the government tried to slow the economy to a more sustainable pace.
 But the number of vehicles that G.M. ships to dealers recovered in March, rising 12 percent from a year earlier, according to company figures released late Tuesday. Retail sales by dealers have also been strong lately, climbing 11 percent in March. 
 G.M. also introduced on Tuesday a redesigned subcompact car, the Chevrolet Aveo, the first of a series of new models that industry specialists predict could reverse the slide earlier this year.
 While sales recovered toward the end of the quarter, the distribution of sales has shifted toward smaller, less expensive cars with thinner profit margins, said Troy A. Clarke, a group vice president of G.M. and president of its Asian operations.
 ''There's a mix issue; we didn't sell as many Buicks'' in the first quarter, he said. He added, however: ''This is not an unexpected shift. Our operations are profitable.''
 The Chinese market is becoming more competitive for G.M., which has 10 percent of the market, the second-largest share after Volkswagen.
 Toyota, Honda, Nissan and Hyundai are expanding quickly here. The Ford Motor Company, which was slow to enter the Chinese market in the 1990's, is now racing to catch up as well.
 Ford announced on Tuesday in Nanjing, China, that it, along with the Mazda Motor Corporation, which it controls, and the Changan Automotive Group, its Chinese joint-venture partner, would build a large factory there with the capacity to assemble 350,000 engines a year.
 Auto executives have gathered here from around the world for news events before the opening of the Shanghai Auto Show to the public this weekend.
 As part of its earnings announcement in the United States on Tuesday, G.M. said that its Asian operations posted a profit of $60 million in the first quarter of this year, down from $275 million a year earlier. G.M. attributed the decline mainly to lower earnings in China and Japan.
 G.M.'s performance here is important as the company struggles to reverse losses in its North American vehicle operations and tries to persuade credit rating agencies not to downgrade its debt to junk status.
 G.M. sold more vehicles in China last year than in any other country except the United States. But the company's total revenues here probably lagged those of its third- and fourth-largest vehicle markets, Canada and Britain, because half of G.M.'s sales here were of small, very simple vehicles that sell for $3,200 to $7,000 apiece and have engines not much more powerful than many motorcycle engines. G.M. does not release revenues by country.
 Wholesale shipments of these minivehicles to dealers by the company's joint venture with Wuling Motors in southern China climbed 44 percent in the first quarter of this year compared with a year earlier, said Stephen Small, chief financial officer of the joint venture. But the company's main joint venture here, Shanghai G.M., recorded a 34.4 percent drop in dealer shipments and a 12.6 percent drop in retail sales despite the recovery in March, according to the company's figures. 
 The precipitous drop in January and February occurred partly because G.M. was changing models, but mainly because dealers' inventories of unsold cars had ballooned to 50 days' sales, Mr. Clarke said. Sales in China slowed by 3.7 percent for the entire industry, with Hyundai in particular gaining sales while Volkswagen was forced to cut shipments to dealers of some models by 70 percent.
 ''It doesn't mean Volkswagen is doing a bad job, it's just how many Volkswagens in a row are people going to buy?'' Robert A. Lutz, the vice chairman of G.M., said here.
 Volkswagen executives had been scheduled to discuss their plans for stemming the rapid loss of their former dominance of the Chinese market, which they achieved by rapid expansion here in the 1980's when other automakers faced many restrictions or were less interested in China. But late Tuesday Volkswagen canceled a Thursday news conference by the head of its Asia-Pacific operations, Bernd Leissner.
 Nobody expects the Chinese market to repeat soon its 80 percent growth in 2003, which was followed by a 16 percent increase last year. But Chris Gubbey, the executive vice president of Shanghai G.M., the company's joint venture with Shanghai Automotive Industry, said that G.M. expected the market to continue growing by 10 percent or so a year this year and for the next few years. 
 Yale Zhang, the emerging markets forecast director in the Shanghai office of CSM Worldwide, a global automotive consulting company, said that G.M. seemed well positioned in the Chinese market compared with other manufacturers because it is close to offering a series of new models.
 ''Those several new products, I believe, will boost their sales,'' he said.
 One common criticism of G.M.'s operations in China is that the company may have allowed too many of its competing divisions to enter the market, creating fratricidal competition with high advertising costs similar to the struggle in the United States among the Chevrolet, Pontiac-GMC, Saturn, Buick, Cadillac and Hummer divisions.
 G.M. is selling Chevrolets, Buicks and Cadillacs here, as well as Opels from Germany, Saabs from Sweden and tiny Wulings.
 Mr. Clarke said that if some divisions did not succeed in China, they would withdraw. ''If nobody wants to buy a Saab,'' Mr. Clarke said, ''we're not going to force them.''

HEADLINE: Securities Fraud Standards Upheld by Supreme Court

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 19 

 BODY:
The Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday in a closely watched fraud case that an accusation that a company's misrepresentations caused an inflated share price was insufficient as a basis for a lawsuit.
 Investors bringing such a suit must claim at the outset, the court ruled, that the artificially high stock price eventually caused their losses. Under the ruling, failure to include such accusations in the original complaint will result in dismissal of the lawsuit. 
 The decision, while a blow to plaintiffs' lawyers, was neither surprising nor, evidently, particularly difficult for the justices. In a unanimous opinion of only 11 pages, the Supreme Court aligned itself with a majority of the federal appeals courts, including the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York. Earlier this year, that court adopted the same approach in throwing out a lawsuit by investors who claimed that unduly positive reports by Merrill Lynch had been responsible for their losses in the stocks of Internet start-up companies. 
 Justice Stephen G. Breyer, writing for the Supreme Court on Tuesday, said that the purpose of permitting private lawsuits for securities fraud was ''not to provide investors with broad insurance against market losses, but to protect them against those economic losses that misrepresentations actually cause.'' 
 The decision overturned a 2003 ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, that had permitted a class-action lawsuit to proceed against Dura Pharmaceuticals for losses that the plaintiffs said were the result of misstatements about the prospects for government approval of a new spray device for the treatment of asthma. 
 The Ninth Circuit's position was that plaintiffs need only represent that on the date of their stock purchase, the share price was higher than it would have been but for misrepresentations about a company's performance or prospects. The Ninth Circuit was the only appeals court to have adopted such a pro-plaintiff interpretation.
 Under the prevailing rule, which the Supreme Court endorsed, investors who claim that they paid too much for a stock because of fraudulent misrepresentation cannot recover damages unless they can show that the subsequent drop in price was tied directly to the original misrepresentation, through the issuance of a corrective disclosure, for example.
 Justice Breyer said that in the absence of proof, it was not logical to assume that an eventual drop in share price was the result of the misrepresentation.
 He said the lower price could just as well reflect ''changed economic circumstances, changed investor expectations, new industry-specific or firm-specific facts, conditions or other events.''
 In his opinion, Dura Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Broudo, No. 03-932, Justice Breyer also noted that the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which Congress passed to curb class-action securities-fraud suits, required plaintiffs to show that the defendant's misrepresentations ''caused the loss for which the plaintiff seeks to recover.''
 The Ninth Circuit had held in the case that ''loss causation is satisfied where the plaintiff shows that the misrepresentation touches upon the reasons for the investment's decline in value.'' 
 But Justice Breyer observed: ''To 'touch upon' a loss is not to cause a loss, and it is the latter that the law requires.'' 
 The case now goes back to the Federal District Court in California that had originally thrown it out for failing to meet the legal test of ''loss causation.''
 Dura was a pharmaceutical company based in San Diego in the late 1990's when the events that led to the lawsuit took place. It later merged with the Elan Corporation. 
 According to the plaintiffs' accusations -- which, because no trial has taken place, remain unproven -- Dura falsely claimed that its asthma product would soon receive approval from the Food and Drug Administration. 
 When Dura announced eight months later, in November 1998, that approval would not be forthcoming, its share price, which had already dropped sharply from a high of $53 during the period when the plaintiffs were buying it, fell to $9.75 from $12.75. 
 The Securities and Exchange Commission supported Dura's Supreme Court appeal, telling the Supreme Court that the Ninth Circuit's approach ''cannot be reconciled'' with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.
 Dura's lawyer, William F. Sullivan of the law firm Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker, said the Supreme Court's decision would provide defendants in similar lawsuits ''an important tool in avoiding expensive and often unmeritorious cases.''
 Patrick Coughlin, a lawyer with Lerach Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman & Robbins who argued the case for the plaintiffs, predicted that when the case returned to the District Court, his clients would be able to meet the Supreme Court's test and keep the case alive.

HEADLINE: DEFECTION DELAYS U.N. NOMINEE VOTE

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL; Scott Shane contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 19 

 BODY:
A surprise last-minute defection by an Ohio Republican forced the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to postpone a vote that had been scheduled for Tuesday on the nomination of John R. Bolton as ambassador to the United Nations.
 The chairman of the panel, Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, reluctantly agreed to put off any vote until next month to allow a review of what Democrats portrayed as troubling new accusations that cast doubt on Mr. Bolton's temperament and credibility.
 Until the defection, by Senator George V. Voinovich of Ohio, the panel had appeared prepared to send the nomination to the Senate floor on a strict party-line vote. But Mr. Voinovich stunned other senators by announcing that more time was needed to explore accusations against Mr. Bolton. 
 ''My conscience got me,'' he said after the stormy two-hour session. He said he had gone to the meeting planning to vote for Mr. Bolton, but changed his mind after hearing the case against the nominee made by Senators Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware and Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, both Democrats.
 ''I wanted more information about this individual, and I didn't feel comfortable voting for him,'' Mr. Voinovich said.
 The Democrats called the delay a significant setback to Mr. Bolton's prospects, providing opponents with time to seek corroboration for the accusations made since he appeared before the committee a week ago. 
 Among those highlighted by Mr. Biden was a statement from Melody Townsel of Dallas, a former contract worker for the Agency for International Development who wrote in an ''open letter'' to the committee that Mr. Bolton, as a private lawyer, routinely visited her hotel room ''to pound on the door and shout threats'' over two weeks in 1994 in Moscow because she had complained about inefficiency by Mr. Bolton's client, the prime contractor in a foreign aid program. 
 Ms. Townsel actively opposed President Bush's re-election. Mr. Biden said that her accusations remained unsubstantiated but that there was some independent corroboration.
 Mr. Bolton has not addressed the accusations since they became known late last week. His aides have said that he will not respond to reporters' inquiries during the confirmation process and that any statement will be in response to questions from the committee.
 A spokesman for the White House, Scott McClellan, said that Democrats were raising ''unfounded allegations'' and that administration would address them.
 ''We are more than happy to answer any questions that members of the committee have,'' Bloomberg News quoted Mr. McClellan as saying. ''John Bolton is exactly the person we need at the United Nations, and we look forward to his confirmation.'' 
 Among the 10 Republicans on the panel, two in addition to Mr. Voinovich expressed concerns on Tuesday about the nomination. One senator, Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, said that he was ready to vote to send the nomination to the full Senate, but that he would not guarantee that he would vote in favor of the nomination on the floor.
 ''I think the charges are serious enough that they demand, or cry out, for further examination,'' Mr. Hagel said at the committee meeting. 
 The second Republican, Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, did not make his views known at the hearing, but told reporters later that he was glad that the vote had been postponed.
 ''I don't know if I've ever seen, in a setting like this, a senator changing his mind as a result of what other senators said,'' Mr. Chafee said. ''The process worked. It's kind of refreshing.''
 Until Mr. Voinovich spoke up near the end of the session, he had not figured in speculation about wavering among Republicans. Mr. Voinovich had not attended either of the committee hearings last week on the Bolton nomination, citing the press of other Senate business. The only doubts expressed in public by Republicans on the panel had come from Mr. Chafee and Mr. Hagel. 
 Mr. Lugar had pushed throughout the session for a vote, saying President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice deserved a swift decision on the nomination.
 Asked to comment on the decision, a spokesman for the State Department, Adam Ereli, said: ''Our only comment is that we believe that Mr. Bolton's nomination is a good one. He'll be a strong candidate, and we hope for him to be in New York so he can begin the important work he has there.''
 At one point, Mr. Lugar asked that the roll be called for a vote. 
 But Mr. Voinovich spoke up to say, ''I have heard enough today that it gives me some concern about Mr. Bolton.'' 
 After some hasty discussion, Republicans and Democrats agreed unanimously to put off any decision until the first week of May, when the Senate returns from a weeklong recess.
 The parties agreed to ask the committee staff to investigate the accusations against Mr. Bolton and seek further information from the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency about reports that he sought to intimidate intelligence analysts. The committee held out the possibility that Mr. Bolton, who appeared before the panel last Monday in a daylong session, could be called again.
 To date, just one former official, Carl W. Ford Jr., a former assistant secretary of state, has testified in public against him. 
 The testimony of other officials, including Christian W. Westermann, the top biological weapons expert in the State Department, and Fulton T. Armstrong, a former intelligence officer for Latin America, has been placed on the public record.

HEADLINE: Former Times Publisher Wins Newspaper Award

BYLINE: By The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 19 

 BODY:
Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, chairman emeritus of The New York Times Company, was awarded the Katharine Graham Lifetime Achievement Award on Tuesday by the Newspaper Association of America at its annual meeting here.
 The award is named for the late publisher of The Washington Post, to whom it was awarded posthumously in 2002. 
 In presenting the award, Gregg K. Jones, chairman of the association, said Mr. Sulzberger deserved recognition for two main reasons: publishing the Pentagon Papers in 1971 and reinvesting in The Times during the financial crises of the 1960's and 1970's.
 Mr. Sulzberger, 79, who was publisher of The Times from 1963 to 1992, read the more than 7,000 pages of the Pentagon Papers, a classified history of the Vietnam War, before deciding to publish them. Mr. Jones said that after Mr. Sulzberger read the papers, he was asked what he thought. ''Oh, I would think about 20 years to life,'' he responded. 
 Until that point, Mr. Jones said, most traditional newspapers had been reluctant to challenge the government directly, and it was a watershed moment in journalism history.
 As Mr. Sulzberger accepted the award, he recalled his old friend Mrs. Graham. He told the audience of the March day in 1967 when he met her in Paris to seal the deal to join forces in publishing The International Herald Tribune. They could not agree on whether to call it a publication of The Times and The Post or The Post and The Times. As their talks dragged out, someone suggested a coin toss.
 ''Kay called, and I won,'' Mr. Sulzberger said. ''Too bad more journalistic differences aren't settled in this sensible way.''

HEADLINE: NEGATIVE DEBT OUTLOOK FOR BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY

BYLINE: Reuters

 BODY:
Fitch Ratings revised its debt outlook for Berkshire Hathaway, the holding company run by Warren E. Buffett, to negative from stable, citing the 74-year-old Mr. Buffett's age and the impact of regulatory inquiries. The revision covers the AAA ratings for Berkshire and its auto insurance unit, the Geico Corporation, and raises the likelihood of a downgrade within two years, according to Keith Buckley, a Fitch group managing director in insurance. A downgrade might raise the company's borrowing costs. Fitch wrote that while Buffett is ''reportedly in good health and has expressed no intention of retiring,'' it would not be easy for Berkshire to replace his talent or sustain his strategies after his departure. The rating agency also cited inquiries by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer. A call to Berkshire was not immediately returned.

HEADLINE: F.D.R.'s Bill of Rights: What Happened?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''A Radical in the White House,'' about Franklin D. Roosevelt:
 Unlike F.D.R., George W. Bush -- a conservative in the White House -- espouses a bill of opportunities, not rights: the opportunity for a useful and remunerative job; the opportunity to earn enough for adequate food, clothing and recreation; and the opportunity for every farmer to grow and sell products at a return that provides a decent living.
 The bill of opportunities also includes the opportunity for a decent home and adequate medical care; the opportunity for adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident and unemployment; and the opportunity for a good education.
 Most important, it includes the right of every person, according to his or her abilities, to convert these opportunities into reality.

HEADLINE: F.D.R.'s Bill of Rights: What Happened?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 F.D.R.'s litany of rights is nonsense.
 The problem with calling for a universal right to food, or housing, or employment, or health care, is that such a right for person A is meaningless unless person B simultaneously incurs an obligation. 
 Person A may argue that he has a right to food or to a job (a right presumably based on his need), but it does not follow that person B therefore has an obligation to feed or employ him. B may wish to help A (by means of private charity, for example), but B's moral intuition does not transform into A's legal right.
 The change in direction that began under President Ronald Reagan, the change that Bob Herbert so deplores, restored a measure of sanity after the breakdown of individual liberties brought about by Franklin D. Roosevelt's demagogy.

HEADLINE: Rice Reminds The Russians Of Obligation To Democracy

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: MOSCOW, April 19 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, reiterating American concerns about authoritarian trends in the Kremlin under President Vladimir V. Putin, said Tuesday that Russia's coming leadership of the Group of 8 industrial nations next year gave it ''certain responsibilities'' to guarantee economic and political freedoms.
 Some critics of the Bush administration said Washington should threaten to remove Russia from the group if Moscow did not improve its record on human rights and democracy. Ms. Rice has repeatedly dismissed that approach as counterproductive, a position she reiterated. 
 ''I don't see any reason, and the president doesn't see any reason, that we would want to see Russia isolated,'' Ms. Rice said. 
 But, she said, ''we have to continue to impress upon the Russians that certain responsibilities come with membership in the G-8.'' Ms. Rice, a scholar of Russian history, was in Moscow briefly on her first visit as secretary of state to pave the way for President Bush's trip next month. 
 Speaking on her plane here, she said recent trends in Russia's struggle to become a full-fledged democracy were not positive, citing increasing central control of state governments and broadcast media. But, she added, ''it would be a mistake to start to think of this as somehow reverting back to Soviet times.'' 
 She said Russia was under pressure to open its economy in order to join the World Trade Organization and to keep an open political system as a member of the Group of 8. 
 Ms. Rice's comments were the latest in an increased tempo of criticism of Russia, reflecting what some officials say is mounting concern by President Bush and his close aides about Mr. Putin.
 But American attempts to raise these concerns have met with an icy response from Russian leaders. For example, Mr. Bush's talk in February in Bratislava, Slovakia, about Russian democracy was said by some American officials to have prompted a Russian lecture in return about Moscow's policies and even about supposed American problems with democracy at home.
 As examples of Russian ''setbacks,'' Ms. Rice cited Mr. Putin's decision last year to have state governors chosen in Moscow rather than elected by local legislators, and what she described as a ''virtual absence'' of independent broadcast media.
 She made no reference to Russia's arrest and prosecution of independent business executives for financial irregularities, actions that administration analysts have said are intended to stifle dissent. She also strongly suggested, without saying so directly, that Russia needed to get rid of ''inconsistencies'' in its treatment of foreign oil companies.
 That comment appeared to echo rising complaints by American companies over canceled contracts for exploration and production, and over curbs under Mr. Putin on foreign majority ownership in oil exploration. 
 Ms. Rice also said some progress had been made on negotiating the dismantling of loose nuclear weapons and fuel in Russia. Talks on the subject stalled after demands by American companies that they be exempted from liability in Russia in the event of accidents or damage.
 In the area of dissent and free expression, some Western diplomats say they not only fear that the Russian crackdown could hamper the next scheduled presidential election, in 2008, but also that Mr. Putin might take the drastic step of changing the Constitution to allow him to run for another term. 
 Ms. Rice said she did not expect a problem. ''I think everybody expects that since the Russian Constitution prohibits a third term for that president, that the president will respect that,'' she said. ''He has said it several times.'' 
 She added that Russia did appear to be allowing opposition figures to lay plans to run for the office.

HEADLINE: Altria Profit Rises On Higher Prices

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The Altria Group posted an 18 percent increase in quarterly profit yesterday, as cigarette prices increased and it gained market share, aided by an improving economy that helped it fight off cheaper competition. 
 Strength in the United States tobacco market, including market share gains by its Marlboro brand, helped offset weakness at the Philip Morris International unit, where tax increases on cigarettes in Germany weighed on sales. 
 Altria has said it is preparing to split up its business to gain fuller market value for its operations, but must first clear tobacco litigation hurdles in the United States. Yesterday, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia refused to reconsider a ruling that barred the government from seeking $280 billion in past profits from cigarette makers as part of its civil racketeering case against the industry. 
 Altria, which is also the majority owner of Kraft Foods, reported first-quarter profit of $2.60 billion, or $1.25 a share, compared with $2.19 billion, or $1.07 a share, a year earlier. Earnings from continuing operations were $1.24 a share, a penny better than the average analyst estimate posted by Reuters Estimates.
 Revenue rose 8.7 percent, to $23.62 billion, with the effect of the weaker dollar adding $741 million. Excluding excise taxes, revenue was $16.46 billion. On that basis, analysts on average forecast $15.79 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.
 The company raised prices on some brands by $1 a carton, either through direct price increases or lower promotional allowances, depending on brand.

HEADLINE: Japan Still Bans U.S. Beef, Chafing American Officials

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 20 

 BODY:
Where's the American beef? That's a question more and more American officials and many Japanese consumers are asking here. 
 Six months after American negotiators thought they had a deal to resume beef exports to Japan, historically the largest foreign market for American ranchers, this $1.2-billion-a-year market remains closed, as a result of a single case of mad cow disease detected in Washington State in December 2003.
 But Japan's barriers to American beef are now drawing heavy fire in Congress, conjuring up a 1980's-style battle over American export access to Japan. Partly because of earlier battles, Japan bought about one-third of American beef exports in 2003, the last year of imports. 
 Members of Congress ''don't want this issue to boil over into the larger relationship,'' J. Thomas Schaeffer, the new American ambassador here, warned Monday in his first news conference. Calling on Japanese to ''divorce the emotion from the science,'' he noted: ''After all, 300 million Americans are eating that beef every day, and there are no health concerns in the United States.''
 Next week, a delegation of American specialists is to arrive here from Washington to testify about measures taken in the last 15 months to prevent new cases of the fatal brain-wasting disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, as mad cow disease is formally known. But late summer looks like the earliest that Japan's food safety bureaucracy might reopen doors to American beef.
 In Japan, polls show that a majority are in no rush to open to American imports. ''I hope Japan will import American beef only when it is confirmed safe enough,'' Kayo Mochizuki, a housewife, said Wednesday.
 The centerpiece of the American effort is a federal agriculture program that has increased mad cow testing from 20,000 animals a year in 2003 to a forecast for 500,000 this year. No infected cows have been detected since the lone case, a 6-year-old Canadian-born cow, was found 16 months ago. In contrast, 17 infected cows have been detected in Japan since August 2001, the latest two weeks ago.
 But Japan tests all cows that are slaughtered. The United States plans to test about 14 percent of cows slaughtered this year, focusing on the oldest animals, which are most at risk. Last October, American officials say, Japan agreed to resume imports of beef from cows under 21 months, an age group not deemed to be at risk from the disease.
 ''It is spilling over from an agricultural issue to a trade issue, which is unfortunate,'' Howard H. Baker Jr., who stepped down as ambassador here in February, said in a news conference. Referring to the beef ban, he said, ''I tried very hard to bring that thing to closure, and three times, at least, maybe more, I thought we had.''
 Pressure on Japan started in February when 20 senators, largely from Republican-dominated Western states, threatened ''retaliatory actions against Japan'' in a letter to Japan's ambassador in Washington, Rizzo Kato. The letter noted that Japan's tire exports to the United States were roughly the same value as American 2003 beef exports to Japan. 
 Talking to Japanese reporters after meeting April 6 with 22 members of the House of Representatives, Ambassador Kato said: ''I felt their growing frustration firsthand. I also felt that anything could happen if the current situation persists.'' 
 In Congress, support is growing for resolutions warning Japan to reopen its market to American beef. If not, the Senate text says, ''the United States trade representative should immediately impose retaliatory economic measures against Japan.'' The House text warns that Japan is ''putting a long and profound bilateral trading history at risk.'' 
 Japan's ban on American beef imports dominated Mr. Schaeffer's confirmation hearing in Washington in early March. Senators approved Mr. Schaeffer, evidently seeing a reliable ally in this former state legislator from Texas, the nation's largest beef-producing state. 
 ''All these are red states, and that's why President Bush is so concerned,'' John E. Car Baugh Jr., a political consultant, said here Monday, running his finger down a list of Republican majority states.
 Fearing political damage, President Bush made a telephone call to Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan in early March. The two leaders, allies in Iraq, talked about American beef, aides later told reporters. Later in March, the secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, visited here and devoted more of her comments to American beef than to North Korean bombs. 
 Speaking privately, American diplomats here charged that Japan failed to live up to a deal reached last October to open up to American beef. According to the Americans, Japan promised to loosen its testing rule and allow imports of beef from untested cows under 21 months. A Japanese official working on the beef issue elaborated Monday in an interview: ''The Japanese government also thinks that early resumption of the beef trade is important. But it is directly related to the food safety issue, and, in Japan, people are very sensitive on the food safety issue.''
 But judging by crowds of Japanese diners last month at the Outback Steakhouse in Guam, there is a minority who want to eat American beef. Some diners say American beef is cheaper and tastier than Australian beef, often the alternative. .
 Indeed, nearly 1.2 million Japanese consumers signed a petition last month calling for the resumption of beef imports from the United States. In February, when the Yoshiro D & C Company, the nation's largest ''beef bowl'' chain, drew on its stocks of frozen American beef for a one-day offering of its gyudon shredded beef on rice, the restaurant chain sold 1.5 million meals in six hours.

A Rise in Japan's Exports
 TOKYO, Thursday, April 21 (Reuters) -- Japan's exports grew by more than expected in March, with shipments to China rebounding after their first drop in three years in February. But the rise failed to brighten the outlook for Japan's export-reliant economy. 
 Exports to China were up 5.8 percent from a year earlier, rebounding after a 2.3 percent drop in February but still well below the torrid pace of around 30 percent growth seen last year. Japan's global exports in March were up 6.2 percent from a year earlier, compared with a consensus market forecast for a 5 percent gain, and they rose 1.9 percent from February on a seasonally adjusted basis, the Ministry of Finance data showed.

 CORRECTION:
Because of a computer malfunction, an article in Business Day yesterday about negotiations to resume American beef exports to Japan misspelled three names. The ambassador to Japan, who commented, is J. Thomas Schieffer, not Schaeffer. Japan's ambassador in Washington, who has met with American lawmakers, is Ryozo Kato, not Rizzo. A political consultant who discussed the implications of the talks is John E. Carbaugh Jr., not Car Baugh.

HEADLINE: Simple Store to Clear Your Mind, and Your Wallet

BYLINE: By Alex Kuczynski

 BODY:
IT takes a certain kind of woman to appreciate a store like Stella McCartney. 
 First, this creature must be a devout student of fashion, someone who can tell the difference between silk gazar and silk muslin, a gusset and a grommet. Someone for whom a home subscription to Women's Wear Daily would be a suitable, much-appreciated Christmas present. 
 Second, she must possess an eclectic sensibility, one that combines an appreciation for the ruffles of Victorian romance with the deconstructed layers of late 1990's Japanese fashion and an admiration for rock-star flamboyance. 
 And finally -- if she is not a celebrity who gets her clothes free -- she must be willing to spend some money. 
 For the rarefied crowd that fits these guidelines, the Stella McCartney store in the meatpacking district must be a kind of paradise. The interior of this 4,000-square-foot converted warehouse is spare but playful, designed to show off clothing as a gallery shows off precious artwork, yet still appealing enough that someone might walk in off the street, in a neighborhood that has become filled with other high-fashion stores in recent years. The feel is modern but earthy: screens of ivory and pink metal rods act as room dividers, which, when ruffled by breezes, make soothing clacking sounds. 
 On my first visit, on a warm weekday afternoon, I felt free to paw through the racks of cotton voile dresses and flowing skirts with impunity. The two sales attendants were friendly but didn't hover; more important, they did not cast importuning sideways glances toward me every time I paused to look at something. There weren't many customers, and of the three young women who came in during the course of an hour, two were the kind of shoppers sophisticated enough to ask for a look book -- the fashionista term for catalog -- on their way out. 
 After a few difficult seasons in which Ms. McCartney was pilloried by critics, the spring-summer line has been a hit with the followers-of-fashion crowd. Where previous lines were garish and theatrical, this collection is lighter, floaty, less intellectual and more amusing, a summer sorbet of a season. 
 I plucked one especially pretty skirt from the rack and held it up to the light: a meringue confection in layers of linen, cotton and sheer lace. How lovely, I thought. How fetching. Then the price tag tumbled out: $3,165. Gulp. At that price I no longer felt comfortable touching; instead, I made pretend, polite motions toward the delicate wisps of fabric. 
 To be fair Ms. McCartney's prices are on the same scale with other high-end designers. In that stratospheric ether, she is even a bit more affordable than Chloe and Marc Jacobs. 
 Yet despite all of the store's overtures toward friendliness -- its open and inviting layout, the friendly staff -- it is forbidding for one simple reason: the prices are still very high considering the simplicity of the merchandise. I expect something more, perhaps more structure, perhaps an exotic material at that end of the spending spectrum, which Ms. McCartney's clothes do not provide. 
 Yes, the cotton espadrilles on wooden soles are amusing and attractive. But $510 is a lot to pay for wooden sandals, even in the incongruously inflationary world of footwear where, thanks to Carrie Bradshaw, women are all now expected to pay $500 for the most drab Manolo Blahnik mule.
 I hate to take Ms. McCartney to task; to do so is to join in a merry band of ceaselessly nasty observers. From the beginning critics pointed out that she unfairly enjoyed the fruits of her family's fame and wealth. (She is the daughter of Paul and Linda McCartney.) When she graduated from fashion school in London, Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss modeled in her graduation show. Surely, critics needled, someone who by virtue of her family connections is friends with Gwyneth Paltrow and Madonna and is independently wealthy will burn out fast. 
 Ms. McCartney, however, churned out collection after collection. At 25, she was recruited to succeed Karl Lagerfeld at Chloe. Her Chloe collections were uneven, but she eventually settled on some pieces that acquired a cult following, like airbrushed T-shirts and rhinestone-studded sunglasses. In 2001 she left Chloe and with backing from the Gucci Group started her own line. 
 Her latest collection, on display at the boutique, includes romantic billowing dresses meant to slip off the shoulders, knee-length bloomers, taffeta trenches, knotted bikinis. A limited-edition T-shirt she designed with the cartoonist R. Crumb is available for $150. (Mr. Crumb celebrated the publication of his book, ''The R. Crumb Handbook,'' at the store recently.) 
 On my second visit, again on a weekday, I asked to see the sheer white cotton dress a friend bought. She raved about its simplicity and elegance. Sold out. 
 Ms. McCartney, who spent time as an apprentice on Savile Row, is known for her suits, and the few on display are beautifully made, elaborately tailored and priced within the realm of reason for high-quality work: about $1,100 for jackets, $500 to $800 for the pants. I have admired Ms. McCartney's suits in the past: a homage to her mother, who wore bespoke three-piece men's suits in the 1970's, there is a quality of formality and stiffness to them that is softened by her use of eclectic fabrics -- like twilled silk -- and her occasional fondness for lining the jackets in vibrant colors. 
 I plucked a gold sneaker out of a large Lucite box. These are casual shoes, touchingly orthopedic as rendered by Ms. McCartney and manufactured by Adidas. One could picture a retiree in Boca Raton wearing them for shuffleboard if it weren't for the fact that they are sheathed in a gold plastic and mesh and so look more fit for a rap star. 
 The sales clerk asked if I planned to wear them while working out, in a tone suggesting that others who buy them do so of course. With their squishy, unsupported soles, they are not constructed as serious athletic shoes. And they cost $230, a lot to pay for gym shoes. 
 The clerk took my debit card and disappeared into the back of the store. I was alone in the vast room. And that is when I realized what is missing from Stella McCartney: There is no cash register. No desk at which a clerk writes a receipt, a bell dings and a final tally unfurls from a plastic machine. No black credit-card box at which a sales clerk can stare vacantly, jiggling her pencil and longing for the approval code to appear in green electronic light. Nothing as crass and quotidian as a sales counter. But that absence, in its way, signals what is wrong with Stella McCartney. Yes, the store is welcoming, and the clothes are pretty. But the absence of a cash register is the white elephant in the room, a coy way of informing anyone who wants to buy something of high-end shopping's most important dictum: if you have to ask, you probably can't afford it. 

Stella McCartney
429 West 14th Street; (212)255-1556.

ATMOSPHERE -- Earthy, quirky and designed to be welcoming. Clothes are stored on Lucite shelves, inviting shoppers to touch.
SERVICE -- The staff is friendly and knowledgeable.
KEY LOOKS -- Blowsy St.-Tropez dresses, cropped jackets.
PRICES -- Expensive, but in line with other high-end designers. A simple cotton voile dress from the spring-summer line is $780. A small batik print doctor's bag is $545.

HEADLINE: Inflation Fears Pummel Stocks; New Lows for '05

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER and LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Fears of rising inflation sent stocks to new lows for the year yesterday after the government reported a sharp increase in consumer prices that all but guaranteed that the Federal Reserve would continue to push interest rates higher even as the economy may be slowing.
 Last week investors were worried about the effect of slower economic growth on corporate earnings. The addition of inflation fears to the mix could put nerves on Wall Street even more on edge.
 A 0.6 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index last month was the largest in five months, the government reported. The 0.4 percent jump in the core rate, which excludes food and energy, was twice the forecast from analysts and the biggest monthly increase in nearly four years. 
 While some economists predicted that inflation should moderate in coming months, higher energy costs have pushed consumer prices steadily higher so that they have been running at an annual rate of 3 percent or more for several months.
 In the New York metropolitan region, inflation was considerably stronger than at the national level, rising 1.7 percent in March in the largest month-over-month increase in 23 years. [Page B4.] 
 Stocks fell further in the afternoon after the Federal Reserve reported its summary of economic activity around the country. The major theme of the report was that cost pressures have been rising and that businesses had been able to pass them on in higher prices.
 With inflation moving to the top of the range that Fed policy makers consider acceptable, analysts said, they may have little choice but to push rates steadily higher even if such actions threaten to slow economic activity further. 
 ''The disappointing inflation news suggests that the Fed will now have to see something more dramatic in economic weakness before they consider pausing'' in raising rates, said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at ITG/Hoenig, a brokerage firm in Rye Brook, N.Y. 
 Slow growth and rising prices were the hallmark of the 1970's and were called stagflation. While no one is saying the economy faces such an illness now, even a hint of stagflation makes the Fed's job more difficult.
 ''This will make it tough on them if they want to get more aggressive in raising interest rates because they could be accused of endangering the economic recovery,'' Mr. Barbera said. 
 Yesterday's stock decline quickly ended a pause after shares plunged three consecutive days last week, from Wednesday through Friday, in their worst week since August.
 With a 1.1 percent decline yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average has now given up all of the 9 percent rally it experienced from the day after the presidential election through March 4, when the Dow hit its 2005 high just 59 points shy of 11,000. After falling 115.05 points yesterday, to 10,012.36, it is now threatening to break below 10,000, and is down 7.2 percent for the year.
 The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 15.28 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,137.50, putting it only 7 points above its Election Day level. It is now down 6.1 percent for the year.
 The Nasdaq composite index dropped 18.60 points, or 1 percent, to 1,913.76, about 5 points from the 2005 low it hit Friday. That was the lowest level since mid-October, before the post-election rally. The Nasdaq is down 12 percent in 2005.
 The afternoon sell-off was powerful enough to overwhelm the performance of stocks that reported surprisingly good earnings for the first quarter, including Intel and Caterpillar. Many investors were hoping that better-than-expected earnings from several bellwether companies would help the stock market rebound. 
 Intel, which reported after the market closed Tuesday that its profits jumped 25 percent, was up as much as 3.4 percent in early trading, but closed up just 3 cents, or 0.1 percent, at $22.66. Caterpillar, whose earnings swelled by 38 percent for the first quarter, was up as much as 6.1 percent, but finished up $3.09, or 3.6 percent, at $88.04.
 After the market closed, eBay reported another strong quarterly earnings gain of 28 percent.
 For millions of investors, the new inflation figures make sorting out the economy, stocks and interest rates even more difficult.
 ''I think it is very confusing,'' said Henry Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell & Reed in Overland Park, Kan. It appears that ''the stock market believes that inflation is going to lead the Federal Reserve to overshoot,'' he added, by raising its short-term benchmark rate so aggressively that economic growth would suffer too much. 
 Federal Reserve policy makers are expected to increase the short-term rate they control to 3 percent at their May 4 meeting in what would be the eighth consecutive quarter- point increase in less than a year.
 The bond market's reaction to the inflation news may also be confusing for investors, because inflation fears usually drive bond prices lower and yields higher. After falling early, prices of the Treasury's 10-year note rebounded to rise 6/32, to 98 16/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 4.19 percent, from 4.21 percent Tuesday.
 ''People are worried about stocks and the soft patch in the economy and you are having a flight to quality,'' said Scott Gewirtz, co-head of government bond trading at Deutsche Bank. 
 Indications of a slight weakening in the economy -- auto sales off, retail sales slowing, wages still losing ground to inflation, job growth below par -- have many forecasters marking down their expectations for economic growth to an annual rate of 3 percent to 3.5 percent in the second quarter from 3.8 percent in the fourth quarter.
 ''If anything is pinching family budgets right now, it is their experience every day at the gas station,'' said Jared Bernstein, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. ''That constrains their budgets more than interest rates. If they are spending more at the pump, they have to be spending less elsewhere.''
 Yesterday, the price of crude oil for June delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 46 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $54.03 a barrel, not far below its record high. While oil prices are not included in the core inflation rate, they appear to be a contributing factor in the rise in other prices. 
 ''The underlying trend is up, and that is largely because of the oil pass-through,'' said Nigel Gault, chief domestic economist at Global Insight.
 Still, last month's 0.4 percent jump in the core rate may not be as threatening as it appeared at first glance because of seasonal aberrations. One major contributor was a sharp jump in hotel room rates, perhaps because the Easter week holiday fell in March; similarly a big jump in spring apparel prices may also have been affected by the timing of the holiday. Neither spike is likely to be repeated in April.
 But the broader inflation rate shows no signs of diminishing. Half of the rise in the overall index was from rising gasoline prices, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. They averaged $2.09 a gallon, up from $1.91 in February, according to Energy Department surveys, and in the first half of April the average rose again, to $2.24 a gallon, foreshadowing still another sharp increase in the Consumer Price Index.
 For the 12 months ended in March, the overall inflation rate for consumers was 3.1 percent compared with 2.5 percent last September and 1.7 percent in March 2004.

HEADLINE: Ecuador's Leader Flees and Vice President Replaces Him

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO; Carla D'Nan Bass in Quito and Monica Trujillo in Bogota contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, April 20 

 BODY:
President Lucio Gutierrez of Ecuador fled his presidential palace on Wednesday after the Congress, meeting in special session, voted to remove him. The Congress then swore in Vice President Alfredo Palacio, a 66-year-old cardiologist, to replace Mr. Gutierrez, 48, a former army colonel who had faced mounting street protests against what critics called an illegal overhaul of the Supreme Court.
 Mr. Gutierrez, who took office in January 2003, became the third president since 1997 to be ousted from power in the small but oil-rich Andean country, which has close economic ties to the United States. In 1997, Abdala Bucaram was declared mentally unfit to govern and fled into exile. In 2000, President Jamil Mahuad was ousted in a coup supported by Mr. Gutierrez, then an army colonel. 
 Ecuadorean protesters accused all three of corruption, mismanagement and a strong-arm governing style.
 ''Today, the dictatorship, the immorality, the arrogance and the fear have ended,'' Dr. Palacio said in a speech broadcast on Colombia's Caracol radio network. ''From today, we will restore a republic with a government of the people.''
 Dr. Palacio did not say whether he would call new elections. It was also not clear if the majority of Congress and the Ecuadorean public would support him as he tries to steer the country out of paralysis. Ecuador does not have a Supreme Court -- the Congress disbanded it on Sunday -- and its myriad political parties are bitterly divided. 
 ''Logic would have it that Palacio would stay the year and a half that remains, organize elections and construct the judicial system,'' said Adrian Bonilla, a political analyst in Quito, the capital.
 Mr. Gutierrez fled the presidential palace in a military helicopter, infuriating protesters who assumed he would flee the country, as have other former leaders. Demonstrators then closed down Quito's international airport to prevent his escape, while the attorney general's office announced that a warrant had been issued for his arrest for having ordered troops to use violence to put down anti-government demonstrations.
 But Wednesday evening, Brazil issued a statement saying that Mr. Gutierrez was in that country's embassy in Quito and that the Foreign Ministry was making the necessary arrangements to grant him asylum.
 Mr. Gutierrez, who had run for president as a populist friend of the poor, lost much of his public support almost as soon as he took office. Ecuadoreans were increasingly dissatisfied with his austere economic policies, which had produced a 6 percent growth rate in 2004 but also hardships for ordinary citizens.
 But it was Mr. Gutierrez's role in twice dismissing the Supreme Court, most recently last Friday, that helped create a firestorm he could not survive. An interim court installed by Mr. Gutierrez's allies had cleared former President Bucaram of corruption charges, permitting his return to Quito earlier this month.
 Protests picked up momentum on April 13, with demonstrators accusing Mr. Gutierrez of a power grab. In Quito, where the protests began, a small FM radio station, La Luna, marshaled people for daily anti-government rallies. "I feel like we lit a fuse and that there was so much repressed anger that it just kept burning," said Ramiro Pozo, the news director at La Luna.
 On Wednesday, anti-government lawmakers voted to end Mr. Gutierrez's term based on a vague article in the Constitution that permits a president's removal for ''abandonment of the post.'' The congressmen said that by disbanding the Supreme Court and calling for a state of emergency on Friday the president had violated the Constitution.
 The president had insisted to reporters that he would not resign, but on Wednesday his political situation became untenable after the military withdrew its support. At a news conference, Gen. Victor Hugo Rosero, head of the armed forces, said the military could not ''remain indifferent before the pronouncements of the Ecuadorean people.'' Then the head of the national police force, Gen. Jorge Poveda, also resigned, saying, ''I cannot continue to be a witness to the confrontation with the Ecuadorean people.'' 
 The police chief was referring to protests that turned violent Tuesday night as tens of thousands of protesters clashed with security forces, who used tear gas and high-pressure water hoses to disperse them. International radio reports said that two people had been killed, including a foreign news photographer.
 Opposition members of Congress had been trying to oust Mr. Gutierrez since late last year, accusing him of corruption and nepotism. In November, they failed to muster enough votes to impeach him. Mr. Gutierrez had bested his opponents with the support of the Roldosista party, led by Mr. Bucaram, who had been in exile avoiding corruption charges since his ouster.
 In return for Roldosista support, government opponents said, Mr. Gutierrez's allies in Congress disbanded the Supreme Court and named a new one that, in March, cleared Mr. Bucaram. Mr. Bucaram was also being sought Wednesday night.

HEADLINE: Iraq Chief Says a Mass Killing, Under Dispute, Did Take Place

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and ROBERT F. WORTH; Layla Istifan, Abdul Razzaq al-Saeidy and Khalid al-Ansary contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, April 20 

 BODY:
The new Iraqi president, Jalal Talabani, said Wednesday that more than 50 bodies had been discovered in the Tigris River and suggested that they were victims of a mass kidnapping south of Baghdad that other Iraqi officials had insisted was a hoax just three days before. 
 Mr. Talabani, who made the assertion after a meeting with Shiite leaders about dividing up top jobs in the new government, offered no details about the crime, including when or precisely where the bodies were found. 
 It was the latest bizarre development in a succession of claims about whether any kidnappings had occurred. The president's report supported a version of events favored by Shiite politicians who are about to take office in the new government and ran contrary to denials by the departing prime minister, Ayad Allawi. 
 While Mr. Talabani said hostages had been killed and their bodies thrown into the Tigris, he offered no documentation that could help independently verify his statement, like a list of victims, photographs of the bodies or the names of witnesses. 
 But he said the government knew the names of victims and had such photographs, and several news agencies reported that the local police and other authorities in Suwaira -- just downriver from Madaen, where the mass abduction was originally reported to have occurred -- said they had recently recovered some 50 bodies from the river. 
 An American military spokesman in Baghdad said he had no information about the report.
 The announcement was made on a day in which violence in Iraq continued to mount. Twenty Iraqi troops were taken from their trucks near the western city of Haditha, dragged to a soccer stadium and lined up against the wall and shot, according to an official in the Interior Ministry. 
 Nineteen of the soldiers died and one was taken to a hospital, the official said. American military officials said they had no information about these killings.
 Dr. Allawi escaped a car-bomb assassination attempt that killed two policemen and wounded one, according to the Interior Ministry. 
 Regardless of whether Mr. Talabani's report is later verified, the surge of renewed insurgent attacks -- which also included eight deaths and three other suicide car bombings on Wednesday in Baghdad -- underscored the challenges facing the new government that is expected to take power in the coming days. 
 Violence has left dozens dead in Baghdad alone in the last week, calling into question suggestions that the tide in the war is clearly turning.
 Mr. Talabani's comments are likely to have a significant political impact. If true, they will inflame Shiites who are already furious at attacks carried out by Sunni Arab insurgents. If they prove wrong, they are sure to enrage Sunni Arabs who feel shut out of the new government and do not trust the new leaders.
 Political leaders continued negotiations late into the night over appointments to the cabinet, and several top political aides said a principal sticking point was demands made by Dr. Allawi's party for four cabinet-level jobs, including deputy prime minister. 
 Shiite leaders had hoped to announce a new cabinet on Thursday, a religious holiday, but that appeared unlikely late Wednesday because of continuing Shiite disagreement with Dr. Allawi, the two aides said.
 Last weekend the kidnapping dispute threw the nation into turmoil as Shiite leaders asserted that Sunni terrorists had staged a large-scale abduction of Shiite men, women and children in the town of Madaen. 
 But on Sunday, after surrounding and searching the town, Iraqi troops found no bodies or hostages and suggested that the accusations had been fabricated. Dr. Allawi confirmed that no hostages had been found and said lurid accusations about violence there appeared to be false.
 Yet some Shiite leaders remained angry that their assertions of a mass kidnapping were discredited. 
 Shiite leaders, who hold a majority of parliamentary seats, are negotiating with other factions, including Kurdish officials led by Mr. Talabani, over how many cabinet posts each side will get.
 Political leaders of the dominant Shiite alliance talked well into the night with Dr. Allawi's party, which according to political aides continued to seek the jobs of deputy prime minister, either interior minister or defense minister, at least one economy-focused minister, like oil or finance, and one service minister. But Shiites believe that is too much, the aides said. 
 A meeting between Dr. Allawi's party and Shiite leaders continued late Wednesday at the home of Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, a major Shiite leader, said Ali al-Dabagh, a senior aide in the Shiite alliance. Mr. Dabagh said Sunni officials -- who are to get a comparatively small number of top government jobs -- had complicated the negotiations by putting forward conflicting lists of Sunnis as candidates for the positions allocated to them.
 ''They don't have one side we can deal with,'' Mr. Dabagh complained. He added, ''We see the demands of Dr. Allawi as too high.''
 In an interview on Wednesday evening, an aide to Mr. Talabani elaborated on the president's comments about the kidnapping, saying the government had names and pictures of the victims and names of the killers. ''There were hostages who were killed and thrown into the Tigris, and we found 50 dead bodies,'' the aide said. He said details would be released soon. 
 In the continuing violence in Baghdad, two Iraqis, one of them a child, died after insurgents tried to attack an American military convoy in the restive western Baghdad neighborhood of Amiriya with a car bomb, according to Iraqi officials.
 Two car bombs exploded in the Dora neighborhood of Baghdad, one aimed at a police car rushing to the scene of the other car bombing, according to an Interior Ministry official. Together, the bombs destroyed 15 police vehicles and wounded three people, he said. 
 Before the attempt on Dr. Allawi's life, a Health Ministry official said a total of 6 Iraqis were killed and 20 wounded by terrorist activities in Baghdad on Wednesday. Three civilians were also killed in the northern city of Mosul, he said.

HEADLINE: The Democrats Of Spring, In Full Throat

BYLINE: By JOYCE PURNICK

 BODY:
AH, spring in New York. The forsythia are in bloom. The daffodils are up. The Democrats are making it interesting again. They cannot, bless them, help themselves.
 The week began with Bob Kerrey, president of the New School University and a former United States senator, raising -- and then quickly dropping -- the prospect of running for mayor of New York. What fun. Two days' worth. 
 Then the Democrats participated in a forum on Tuesday that sounded two clear themes. 
 First, the four candidates unabashedly presented themselves as, well, Democrats. They portrayed the city as a sad place, run by a passive Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who is too accommodating to fellow Republicans and presides over a city plagued by high unemployment, inferior schools, bad housing, a troubled subway system and poor fiscal management. 
 Is that how most voters see the city (today, that is, not 15 years ago)?
 Second, during the forum sponsored by Crain's New York Business, there was a bit of a change in chemistry. The focus seemed to shift perceptibly from Fernando Ferrer, who despite his current troubles had long been considered the candidate to beat, to Anthony D. Weiner.
 Congressman Weiner, who represents Brooklyn and Queens, is little known citywide and sits low in the early polls, statistically even with Council Speaker Gifford Miller and behind the Manhattan borough president, C. Virginia Fields, and Mr. Ferrer. Mr. Weiner is, in fact, widely believed to be running to establish his name for the future. 
 Could be. Whatever Mr. Weiner's plans for this year or four years from now, the ambitious congressman left no doubt Tuesday morning that he would be heard.
 Early on during the breakfast event at the Grand Hyatt -- before anyone raised the subject -- he delivered the sound bites of the day when he said that Mr. Ferrer's proposal to impose a tax on stock trades temporarily was ''kind of like someone running for governor of Wisconsin proposing a dairy tax.'' 
 Then, during the forum's closing moments, he nearly jumped out of his seat, his face scrunched in a scowl, as Mr. Ferrer answered a question about his tax proposal from Greg David, Crain's editor. Contending that it would be impossible or illegal to tax stocks traded on the Nasdaq or on other electronic exchanges, Mr. David suggested that the plan would draw business away from the New York Stock Exchange. ''Isn't your proposal a threat to this crucial New York institution?'' he asked.
 ''No,'' Mr. Ferrer answered. He maintained that people still preferred trading at the Stock Exchange, noted that the some of its proceeds would go toward improvements for the stock exchanges, and said the city needed Wall Street's help to comply with a court order for more school spending -- which he estimated would cost the city treasury $1 billion a year.
 His campaign later acknowledged that he had been inaccurate. The state is under a court order, now on appeal, to increase education aid to the city. It is indeed likely that the state will demand that the city chip in, though this may be the first time that a candidate who could one day be mayor has volunteered to set an opening bargaining position with the state at $1 billion.
 Congressman Weiner, clearly trying to position himself as the candidate of the boroughs, said later that he had been frustrated that the forum was ending because he wanted to note that Wall Street is not just for the wealthy but employs many in the middle class.
 NOT that there are many substantive differences among the four. They basically agree on most issues --opposition to the mayor's plan for a stadium on Manhattan's Far West Side, criticism of the schools, disdain for Wal-Mart, which, facing intense opposition, dropped plans earlier this year to open its first store in the city, in Queens. 
 The four Democrats also agree on this: being a Democrat still matters to most New Yorkers. The city has not elected a Democratic mayor in 12 years, despite overwhelming Democratic registration. 
 Mr. Weiner drew a laugh when -- asked if the city would be better off today if the Democrats Mark Green, David N. Dinkins and Ruth W. Messinger had been in charge over the last 12 years -- he said, ''There has never been a job that a Democrat couldn't do better than a Republican.'' 
 But those Democrats lost to the Republicans Rudolph W. Giuliani and Mr. Bloomberg. The reasons were many, but they did lose, suggesting at the least that winning the Democratic primary, which draws the faithful, is no longer a job guarantee.

HEADLINE: Innovation moves from the laboratory to the bike trail and the kitchen.

BYLINE: By Virginia Postrel. 
Virginia Postrel (www.dynamist.com) is the author of ''The Substance of Style: How the Rise of Aesthetic Value Is Remaking Commerce, Culture and Consciousness.''

 BODY:
WHEN most people think about where new or improved products come from, they imagine two kinds of innovators: either engineers and marketers in big companies trying to ''find a need and fill it'' or garage entrepreneurs hoping to strike it rich by inventing the next big thing.
 But a lot of significant innovations do not come from people trying to figure out what customers may want. They come from the users themselves, who know exactly what they want but cannot get it in existing products. 
 ''A growing body of empirical work shows that users are the first to develop many, and perhaps most, new industrial and consumer products,'' Eric von Hippel, head of the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Group at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote in ''Democratizing Innovation,'' recently published by MIT Press. (The book can be downloaded at Professor von Hippel's Web site, http://web.mit.edu/evhippel/www/ .)
 Innovation by users is not new, but it is growing. Thanks to low-cost computer-based design products, innovators do not have to work in a professional organization to have access to high-quality tools. Even home sewing machines have all sorts of computerized abilities. And once a new design is in digital form, the Internet allows users to share their ideas easily.
 Because users are often quite different from each other, their innovation, by definition, accommodates variety. A survey of users of Apache Web server software found that different sites had different security needs: one size definitely did not fit all. Nineteen percent of the users surveyed had written new code to tailor the software to their specific purposes.
 ''Users are designing exactly what they want for themselves; they have only a market of one to serve,'' Professor von Hippel said in an interview. ''Manufacturers are trying to fit their existing investments and existing solution types to the largest market possible.''
 Open-source software like Apache or Linux is an obvious example of users developing and sharing innovations, but it is not the only one. Many of the book's examples come from extreme sports like kite surfing and snowboarding, where enthusiasts often invent their own equipment. Mountain biking, Professor von Hippel noted, grew to about half a million participants before manufacturers started to make bicycles suited for wild rides on rough terrain.
 Mountain bikers ride on different terrains and in different weather conditions, and they do different sorts of tricks. They also come from varied professional backgrounds, from orthopedic surgery to aerospace engineering, giving them different skills to draw on.
 Not surprisingly, bikers have come up with a wide range of innovations. One biker developed his own armor and protective clothing. Another invented a way to carry his bike on steep mountains and dangle it over cliffs. Yet another added metal studs to his tires for biking on ice.
 In order for companies to generate new ideas, Professor von Hippel urges them to pay more attention to ''lead users'' like these biking enthusiasts: people who stretch the limits of a technology and create their own innovative prototypes.
 In a study at 3M, he and several colleagues found that product ideas from lead users generated eight times the sales of ideas generated internally -- $146 million versus $18 million a year -- in part because lead users were more likely to come up with ideas for entire new product lines rather than minor improvements.
 The definition of ''lead users'' can become a bit circular, identifying anyone who innovates as a ''lead user.'' But in some fields, it is not hard to spot the people whose need to lower costs or enhance performance is particularly great.
 ''The Disney animators or Pixar animators are ahead on video editing tools from the ordinary consumer,'' Professor von Hippel said. ''Yet we know the stuff that these guys develop now ends up migrating downstream to the general people over time.''
 To get people exactly what they want, user innovation suggests an alternative to mass customization, the manufacturing process that seeks to tailor products to specific users while maintaining the economies of large-scale production. Mass customization generally entails mixing and matching pre-specified components, which significantly limits its flexibility.
 When you order a Dell computer, for instance, ''you can slot in any disk drive you want, but it's still a disk drive,'' Professor von Hippel said. Truly flexible manufacturing technologies, he suggested, would work more like photocopiers, which do not limit what sort of images they can reproduce.
 The model is custom semiconductor design and manufacturing. 
 ''For digital components, you can design anything you want, whether it's artificial life or a dishwasher controller, and just like you print characters on a piece of paper, you can print your design,'' he said. Users can design and test whatever they need and turn the design over to the chip maker's flexible manufacturing technology.
 Custom chips are possible because chip makers, beginning with LSI in the early 1980's, developed ''tool kits'' that let customers design their own solutions without mastering the manufacturer's technical knowledge. That is a model other industries could follow, Professor von Hippel suggested.
 In the book, for instance, he discusses the problems of creating recipes for restaurant chains. Traditionally, the restaurant chefs use regular kitchen ingredients to develop new recipes. For mass production, those recipes have to be translated into factory ingredients and processes, which do not have the same tastes and textures. To reproduce a new dish, then, food processors have to work from a chef's sample but reinvent the recipe. Getting the right formula often requires many iterations.
 To help chefs create the final recipes themselves, Ernie Gum, director of food product development for the Nestle FoodServices division of Nestle USA, developed what Professor von Hippel called a ''tool kit'' of preprocessed food ingredients identical to those actually used in the factory -- for example, a chili puree processed on industrial equipment. In field testing, Professor von Hippel found, the tool kit cut the time to develop new foods from 26 weeks to only 3. 
 Tool kits speed innovation by letting users and manufacturers apply their own specific knowledge. With a tool kit, the customer can turn a poorly articulated wish into a well-specified plan. ''I can say,'' Professor von Hippel said, '''I'll design my wish and then you make it.'''

HEADLINE: Real Estate Sales Drive Up Consumer Prices in Region

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
The Consumer Price Index in the New York City area rose 1.7 percent last month, the largest month-over-month increase in 23 years, the federal Department of Labor said yesterday.
 The increase, which was far higher than the rise of inflation nationally, was driven largely by the sharply rising real estate sales and rental markets as well as higher prices for clothing, travel and mass transit. Food and beverage prices in the region, which have risen several times faster this year than the national average, crept up four-tenths of 1 percent last month, led by increases in the price of bananas, fresh fish, poultry and spices. 
 Energy prices, which have risen 12.4 percent in the New York area over the last year, continued to climb, although a rise last month in residential fuel prices was offset somewhat by a 1.7 percent decline in electricity charges.
 The index, which is not seasonally adjusted, measures spending in New York City and northern New Jersey. 
 Housing costs continued their painful pinch. In New York, rents of primary residences rose 5 percent from March 2004 to March 2005, compared with a 3 percent increase nationally, spurred by demand as well as increases for rent-stabilized apartments. 
 ''People are continuing to move to the city,'' said Michael L. Dolfman, regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which oversees the index, a measure of consumer spending for a variety of goods and services. ''There is a limited supply of apartments, so this a story of supply and demand again.'' Over all, housing costs, which include purchase prices, rose 6.5 percent in March over the same month last year, and are up 3.2 percent in the year to date. 
 ''It's no real surprise that housing along with energy prices contributed to the increase in the Consumer Price Index,'' said Jonathan J. Miller, president of Miller Samuel Inc., a real estate appraisal and consulting firm in New York. ''Long-term rates have remained low, which has continued to fuel the demand for housing. ''With mixed economic reports over the past month, long-term rates have fallen nearly back to levels seen in January,'' Mr. Miller added, ''which suggests we may see continued growth of this magnitude over the next few quarters.'' 
 An odd quirk in the way the Consumer Price Index is calculated also contributed to the inflation figures for New York. In figuring the cost of shelter, the index includes how much people spend on out-of-town lodging, which for New York area residents jumped by 27. 7 percent from February to March of this year. 
 Since March of last year, lodging prices nationwide have increased 8 percent, according to the Travel Industry Association of America. And while the Consumer Price Index has risen 3.1 percent since last March, travel prices have risen slightly faster, 5.6 percent, according to the association's figures.
 ''Lodging prices are going up and have been since the beginning of the year,'' said Andrea Stokes, the director of marketing and international research for the association, ''especially in major markets. New Yorkers, if they are traveling out of town, are probably going to other major markets, and that is where hotel prices are going up faster.''

HEADLINE: Trade Group Decides Manhattan Is Still Toyland for Fall Fair

BYLINE: By KAREEM FAHIM

 BODY:
The board of a toy industry trade group has voted unanimously to keep the annual October toy fair in New York City, rejecting a proposal to save money by moving it to Dallas.
 The decision by the group, the Toy Industry Association, removes one of several challenges facing toy manufacturers that do business in the city.
 ''It wasn't a heated meeting, there was just a lot of facts presented,'' said Arnie Rubin, the chairman of the association, whose board voted on Tuesday in Los Angeles. ''But people are passionate about Manhattan, and the toy industry has over a 100-year heritage there.'' 
 The toymakers were concerned about the vote because of uncertainty surrounding the future of the International Toy Center, two buildings in the Flatiron district that serve as headquarters for many of the manufacturers and as the site of the October toy fair. 
 In January, a developer, the Chetrit Group, bought the buildings, 200 Fifth Avenue and 1107 Broadway, where hundreds of toy companies have offices or showrooms. The new owners are widely expected to convert them into high-end condominiums, but a spokeswoman for Chetrit said only that the developer was still evaluating its plans. 
 Mr. Rubin said Chetrit's assurances that the October fair could be held in the two buildings helped persuade the board to keep the show in New York. The toy association, which represents more than 400 companies, had been considering moving the show to Dallas to save money on rent and to secure more flexible lease arrangements.
 In May, the toy association's board will vote on whether to keep a yearly February toy fair at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. That fair brings some 35,000 retailers of varying sizes to Manhattan, according to Mr. Rubin, who said that Atlanta and Orlando were also being considered as hosts for the event.
 Toy company owners welcomed the news yesterday. 
 ''We're ecstatic about it,'' said James Pressman, the president of Pressman Toy Corporation, which has rented space in the International Toy Center for more than 50 years. ''This is our home. On a personal level, and for the industry, I think it's great.'' 
 The October show is the smaller of two shows. Pressman said that fair gives buyers from the larger toy retailers like Wal-Mart and KB Toys the opportunity, by appointment, to visit manufacturers in their showrooms.
 Mr. Rubin said the decision on the bigger February show, which city officials have estimated brings as much as $55 million to New York City, hinges on conditions at the Javits Convention Center. 
 ''It's truly a tossup,'' he said. ''It's not big enough to accommodate the growth we plan.'' 
 Janel Patterson, a spokeswoman for the New York City Economic Development Corporation, said that her organization and New York City were committed to supporting the toy industry and to keeping the February show in New York. ''We are working with the toy industry and the Javits Convention Center to make that happen,'' she said.
 Mr. Rubin said, ''There's no argument that New York is a world-class city, but Javits is not a world-class facility by any means.''

HEADLINE: F.D.R.'s Bill of Rights

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Bob Herbert's description of Franklin D. Roosevelt's proposals for a ''second Bill of Rights'' (column, April 18) brings to mind Eleanor Roosevelt's role in the elaboration of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, approved by the United Nations in 1948.
 Today, by contrast, the United States stands virtually alone in rejecting the validity of economic, social and cultural rights. That posture was evident last week at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. The United States was again the sole dissenter in separate votes of 52 to 1 on resolutions on the right to food and the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Manhattan: Council Backs Pesticide Notice

BYLINE: By Anthony DePalma (NYT); Compiled by Anthony Ramirez

 BODY:
New York has acted to apply an optional state law that requires lawn-care companies to give neighboring property owners 48 hours' notice before applying pesticides. The City Council voted unanimously yesterday to join seven counties in the state, including Nassau, Suffolk, Rockland and Westchester, that already follow the pesticide law. The Council also voted to direct city agencies to reduce the use of harmful pesticides on municipal property, and substitute, whenever possible, nontoxic pest-control methods. The Council also passed a package of five bills intended to reduce harmful emissions and increase fuel economy in the city's car, truck and bus fleet. Anthony DePalma (NYT)

HEADLINE: Rice Tells Putin U.S. Is No Threat in Region

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: VILNIUS, Lithuania, April 20 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice offered reassurances on Wednesday to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and to listeners of a popular Moscow radio station that the United States would not supplant Russia's influence in its neighborhood despite growing American friendship with other countries in the region.
 But in a long day of talks and interviews in Russia, before flying here to Lithuania for a NATO meeting, Ms. Rice continued to suggest that Russia needed to do more to foster economic and political freedoms.
 Her comments were among the strongest of any American officials about Russia's energy industry, apparently reflecting sharpening concern not only about Russian business practices but also about high oil prices. 
 Ms. Rice said she had told Mr. Putin that the seizure of the oil conglomerate Yukos and the prosecution of its executives ''shook people's confidence'' in Russia's transition to democracy and a free economy, and that investors needed reassurance ''that there is indeed rule of law'' for businesses and investments. Many Russians expect a guilty verdict on tax evasion and fraud charges and perhaps a long prison sentence for Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the former chairman of Yukos. 
 Complaints have been rising from American oil companies that they have been barred from taking part fully in oil and natural gas ventures in Russia. Ms. Rice, echoing those complaints, noted that at a time of rising oil prices worldwide, Russia, which rivals Persian Gulf countries in output, could help itself and the world economy by increasing energy supplies.
 ''It's a sector that could be performing, I think, better,'' she told reporters on her plane to Vilnius, adding that Russia should put forward ''rules that people can understand'' that were ''applied consistently over time'' in a way that did not handicap foreign investors.
 The comment appeared to be a reference to Russian decisions to cancel foreign roles in energy exploration and to impose new rules allowing foreign oil companies to take only minority positions in partnerships with Russian investors.
 Ms. Rice had a full agenda of other issues, and she said she had made progress on some of them. Among these were the stalled talks on a joint effort to dismantle Russian nuclear weapons so they do not fall into the hands of terrorists. The talks have snagged over American demands that Russia immunize Americans from liability for damages if an accident or disaster grows out of the effort. Ms. Rice said she had come to Moscow with new ideas to move the talks along.
 She said she had also discussed Russia's role in the Middle East peace efforts, talks with Iran to get it to dismantle any nuclear weapons projects, Russia's efforts to open its economy to qualify for the World Trade Organization, and counterterrorism programs. 
 These issues and others are expected to be on the agenda for President Bush's visit to Moscow in May to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II.
 Ms. Rice held meetings at the Kremlin and the Foreign Ministry, but she also made a direct appeal to Russians in an interview on Ekho Moskvy, an independent radio station that frequently broadcasts criticism of the government and that says it reaches two million people across Russia. 
 In a half-hour interview, she answered questions about the expanding American military presence on Russia's periphery and about the role American support for democracy might have played in the ousting of governments in Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan.
 Alexei Venediktov, editor in chief and the host, asked her pointedly if the United States was trying to export democracy the way the Soviet Union sought to export socialist revolution. ''There's an important difference here,'' she said. ''You do not actually have to export democracy.'' 
 She said democracy rose from within a state, though the United States had supported private organizations and institutions in some countries to move the process along. ''We see this as not a zero-sum game but one in which everyone has much to gain,'' she said.
 Ms. Rice bantered occasionally with Mr. Venediktov in Russian, which she has studied, but she apologized for speaking largely in English, saying she felt too intimidated by Russian grammar to feel comfortable speaking Russian for the whole interview. 
 Here in Lithuania, Ms. Rice kept up her theme that democracy was spreading throughout the old Russian sphere of influence, and fired a shot at what she said was one country in the old Soviet Union that remained authoritarian: ''Belarus is really the last true dictatorship in central Europe, and it is time for change to come,'' she said.
 On the plane, Ms. Rice said she had tried to send the message to Mr. Putin not to fear democracy. ''I wanted to send a very strong message that the United States does not see developments in the former Soviet states, now independent states, as in any way anti-Russian or meant to diminish Russian influence,'' she said.
 She said the same thing at a meeting with the foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, who countered that he wanted the United States to be a strong democratic country playing a significant role in the world. 
 But Ms. Rice said she did not feel the Russian side was defensive when the issues were brought up. ''They are willing to talk about them,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Sharpton Backs No Candidate In the Primary

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
The Rev. Al Sharpton will not endorse a candidate for the Democratic mayoral nomination, sitting out the primary for first time in 20 years because the candidates have thus far failed to present a clear message or a winning strategy, he said yesterday.
 Mr. Sharpton held open the possibility that if the situation changed, he might make an endorsement in August, just before the primary. 
 An associate said that he had been prepared to make an early endorsement of Fernando Ferrer but that that had changed after Mr. Ferrer told a police union that he did not think the fatal police shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, was a crime.
 ''I was personally troubled by Mr. Ferrer's statement,'' Mr. Sharpton said in an interview in his Midtown office, accompanied by Marjorie Harris, a senior adviser. ''Part of our career has been to deal with the criminalization of police brutality, and one statement implied that he did not agree with the criminalization and that is something that's very serious to me.''
 Mr. Sharpton supplied pivotal support to Mr. Ferrer in 2001 after lengthy deliberations, and the Ferrer campaign was hoping for his support this time around as it sought to build a black and Hispanic coalition to win the Democratic nomination, but the Diallo matter led to an outcry against Mr. Ferrer among black leaders. 
 In helping him make the decision, Mr. Sharpton said, Ms. Harris consulted with members of Mr. Sharpton's political organization throughout the city and found that there was some support for C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president and the only black candidate in the race. But, they said, it was not enough to justify an endorsement.
 ''I think to endorse without being convinced of the absolute positions that people are running on combined with a winning strategy would be to cheapen and trivialize what we've tried to build in this city,'' Mr. Sharpton said.
 Precisely how many votes a Sharpton endorsement can bring may be murky, but it is clear that his blessing can bring energy and momentum to a campaign. In addition, Mr. Sharpton's support and his ability to mobilize political operatives carries weight among certain segments of the black electorate. 
 Democratic strategists say that especially in an election that is expected to be close, candidates like Mr. Ferrer or Ms. Fields will need to draw a strong turnout among black and Hispanic voters as well as attracting some white votes.
 But Mr. Sharpton said that although he thought that any of the four major Democrats in the race could beat Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, none of them had offered a clear message on the issues he considered most important. 
 Those include high unemployment among black men, public education, police brutality and racial profiling.
 ''We're not just another political group that feels that we've got to be at the dance because the dance is on,'' Mr. Sharpton said. ''No, we don't have to be at the dance unless the dance is something along the lines that we feel is more than compelling.''
 Mr. Sharpton also dismissed the notion that he and Harlem leaders like Representative Charles B. Rangel were surreptitiously working to help Mr. Bloomberg to clear the way for a 2009 candidacy of Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr.
 Saying that if he wanted to help Mayor Bloomberg he would simply endorse him, he added that he and Mr. Rangel had never agreed on a candidate except for Mr. Ferrer in 2001. Should Mr. Bloomberg win re-election, it would be his last term because of term limits.
 ''So why would we have this four-year clandestine plan? It's ridiculous,'' he said.
 Mr. Sharpton and Ms. Harris said that it was conceivable that Mr. Ferrer or Ms. Fields could strengthen their campaigns enough by summer's end to win Mr. Sharpton's endorsement. In 2001, Mr. Sharpton did not come out for Mr. Ferrer until August. And before that, Mr. Sharpton and Mr. Ferrer clashed, as Mr. Sharpton demanded that Mr. Ferrer support a slate of black candidates in return for the endorsement, and Mr. Ferrer refused.
 This time around, Mr. Sharpton and Ms. Harris suggested that Mr. Ferrer would need to take a different approach in addressing the Diallo statements. So far, Mr. Ferrer has said that he chose his words carelessly but has stopped short of apologizing for them.
 Mr. Sharpton said that Mr. Ferrer needed to ''consider the fact that a lot of people have called for'' an apology.
 Ms. Harris said that part of their calculus included the reactions from their supporters, some of whom expressed palpable anger when Mr. Ferrer appeared at a National Action Network forum two weeks ago.
 She said that had the Ferrer camp tried ''some type of outreach, then perhaps people would have embraced his statements later in a different way.''
 As for Ms. Fields, Mr. Sharpton said he thought she was doing a good job and should gain momentum. ''But,'' he said, ''we'll see.''

HEADLINE: Down Market Casts a Pall On Social Security Plan

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 20 

 BODY:
Markets go up and markets go down. But the slide over the last month on Wall Street is hardly good timing for President Bush, who now finds himself with another issue to explain as he struggles to win over public opinion -- and the votes he needs in Congress -- for his proposal to add investment accounts to Social Security.
 After running up gains early in the year, the Dow Jones industrial average has fallen more than 9 percent in the last six weeks, including a drop of 115 points, or 1.1 percent, on Wednesday. 
 The decline could prove temporary. But it occurs just as the White House is preparing to begin discussing the politically painful benefits cuts that would be part of any legislation to put the retirement system on sound footing, and the decline could make it that much harder for Mr. Bush to convince workers that the sweetener he has offered them, a chance to divert part of their payroll taxes to stocks and bonds, is a winning proposition. 
 ''The times are not on his side,'' said Irwin M. Stelzer, a conservative commentator and the director of economic studies at the Hudson Institute, a research organization. ''You are seeing a Republican Congress saying to itself, 'He doesn't have to run again.' And the market is working against him.'' 
 In financial terms, the decline is not extraordinary. By most measures, stock prices remain in the broad range where they have been in since the beginning of last year. White House officials say at every opportunity that long-term historical rates of return in the market suggest that workers will do better by putting some money in stocks and bonds than by banking on the current Social Security system.
 The economic backdrop, though, is looking more troubled than it did a few months ago, and the markets are reflecting concern about high oil prices, a pickup in inflation and growing budget and trade deficits. 
 In political terms, a weak market and jittery investors create an unwelcome juxtaposition for the White House as Mr. Bush makes his case that Wall Street can be counted on to help offset the benefits cuts required to ensure the long-term solvency of Social Security.
 ''We hope the president is going to make more of an effort to sell the virtues of personal accounts,'' said Michael D. Tanner, director of health and welfare studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian research group that has long promoted adding individual accounts to Social Security. ''To the extent that the general economic backdrop makes people feel more uncertain generally, it makes them more nervous, and that is background noise that drowns out some of the message.''
 In an interview on Monday with CNBC, Mr. Bush was asked whether the downdraft on Wall Street made this the wrong time to advocate putting Social Security money in the market.
 ''No, listen, now's the right time to talk about permanently fixing Social Security, because every year we wait it costs $600 billion more for the next generation,'' Mr. Bush replied.
 His reference was to estimates of the annual increase in the Social Security deficit under a calculation that economists opposed to his approach say is misleading because it tries to describe the financial health of the system over an open-ended period rather than over the 75 years typically used to gauge its health.
 Mr. Bush went on to say that because more people were investing through 401(k) plans and individual retirement accounts, the country had ''a different culture now'' for investing than it did a generation ago and that allowing the investing option would be ''a better deal for younger workers.''
 Mr. Bush has ridden out all kinds of market turmoil, including the plunge in prices after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the repercussions from corporate scandals, and his allies say this dip will hardly deter him. 
 Two of the most outspoken advocates of remaking Social Security to include a substantial investment component, Senator John E. Sununu of New Hampshire and Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, both Republicans, chose Wednesday to reintroduce their bill that calls for bigger accounts than Mr. Bush supports.
 On a substantive level, the market volatility is highly likely to increase attention on the requirement in Mr. Bush's approach for workers to use all or part of the money in their accounts to buy an annuity, a contract giving them a guaranteed stream of income for life, when they retire. 
 How much they receive would be affected by how the market is doing when they retire. Those lucky enough to retire when Wall Street is booming would fare better than people who retired when the market was down. 
 The White House plan would seek to reduce the problem by encouraging workers to shift from stocks into bonds as they approach retirement, although even the safest government bonds are not immune to substantial price fluctuations. 
 On a political level, this current dip could prove troublesome to the White House, people in both parties said, because Mr. Bush seems to be running out of time to pick up the support he needs to meet his goal of having Social Security legislation passed this year.
 Congressional leaders are counting on Mr. Bush to absorb some of the heat for them by more explicitly putting on the table some of the steps that they say would be necessary to assure Social Security's solvency, meaning benefits cuts and, perhaps, tax increases.
 Even before Mr. Bush steps into that treacherous terrain, polls suggest that although he has made headway in convincing Americans that there is a problem with Social Security that needs to be addressed, his call for investment accounts is losing favor.
 If there is hope for the White House here, it is that small investors have proven remarkably immune to market gyrations, tending to hold tight and take long-term views.
 In a paper Cato published two years ago, the pollster John Zogby said that there was ''no correlation between support for individual accounts and stock market performance'' and that the appeal of the accounts was primarily based on Americans' desire to control their retirement finances.
 ''As far as public opinion goes, it does not have much effect,'' Mr. Tanner said. ''It's in many ways like abortion. People have set opinions, and outside events don't seem to swing opinion a great deal. Congress, on the other hand, is so skittish that anything makes them nervous.''

HEADLINE: Economic Growth in China Is Stronger Than Expected

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Chris Buckley in Beijing contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, April 20 

 BODY:
A soaring trade surplus and strong investment in new apartment buildings and office towers helped lift the Chinese economy to 9.5 percent growth in the first quarter, considerably stronger than expected and above the government's target of 8 percent, China's statistics agency announced on Wednesday.
 The economy's heavy reliance on soaring exports and a feverish property market, in which luxury apartments change hands at steeply rising prices despite high vacancy rates, prompted concern among investors and economists alike.
 Chinese stocks fell Wednesday on fears that Chinese authorities might feel compelled to raise interest rates to cool speculation in real estate. The Shanghai composite index dropped 1.31 percent and the Shenzhen composite index tumbled 1.83 percent. 
 Zheng Jingping, the spokesman of the National Bureau of Statistics, said that growth in investment in buildings and other fixed assets, at 22.8 percent in the first quarter compared with a year ago, was too high. ''If the pace can be kept at about 20 percent, that will benefit the stable and healthy development of the Chinese economy,'' he said.
 Investment growth was especially strong in urban real estate projects, at 26.7 percent in the first quarter. The People's Bank of China last month raised the down payment required in many cities for mortgages to 30 percent of the property's value, from 20 percent.
 Wealth has become highly concentrated here, and growth in domestic demand has slowed somewhat for many goods as middle-class families economize. Sales dipped in the first quarter for all but the cheapest and the most expensive cars, for example.
 But the luxury auto market remains strong. ''Over all, the economy is still powering ahead,'' said Ian Robertson, the chairman and chief executive of Rolls-Royce, during a visit to the company's gleaming dealership here.
 Rolls-Royce will hold the Asian introduction of its long-wheelbase Phantom here on Thursday. The car will retail in China at close to $800,000 because of steep Chinese taxes that double the price tag of luxury cars. China has become the company's fourth-largest market, narrowly trailing Japan, but still well behind the United States and Britain, Mr. Robertson said.
 Part of the demand comes from entrepreneurs who have grown wealthy in the property market. Several construction cranes stood across the street from the Rolls- Royce dealership, and Mr. Robertson pointed to them, calling them the ''national symbols of China.''
 A spurt in exports, which jumped 35 percent and led to a near-record surplus of $16.6 billion for the quarter, also stepped up pressure on China to allow its currency, known as the yuan or renminbi, to appreciate against the United States dollar and other currencies.
 A stronger yuan would make Chinese exports more expensive and less competitive in foreign markets, and would make it easier for foreign companies to increase sales here. Chinese imports have stagnated except for raw materials, especially oil from the Middle East and Africa. The Bush administration in particular, and European and Japanese officials to a lesser extent, have been calling for China to let the yuan rise, most recently when finance ministers in the Group of 7 nations met in Washington last weekend.
 James J. Padilla, the president and chief operating officer of the Ford Motor Company, issued a thinly veiled warning here late Wednesday that American manufacturers would not tolerate high trade deficits in the United States indefinitely. 
 ''How long will the U.S. be an open market where imports just come in? It won't be forever,'' he said at a dinner with reporters in Shanghai that was part of preparations for the public opening of the Shanghai Auto Show this weekend.
 Ford and especially General Motors have been losing market share steadily for many years, mainly to Japanese automakers, though Mr. Padilla warned that Chinese automakers would eventually start trying to enter the American market. ''That will develop over time, but it's not tomorrow,'' he said. 
 Several investment banks, notably J.P. Morgan, have been predicting that a change in Chinese currency policy could come soon, either in the coming weeks or on July 1, given Chinese officialdom's penchant for making important economic decisions at the middle or end of the year. But the sometimes violent street protests against Japan may have delayed any move by creating an atmosphere of political uncertainty that may discourage the government from taking any potentially risky economic moves.
 Several senior Chinese officials expressed strong reservations last month about any change in the value of the currency.
 One benefit of allowing currency appreciation is that it would make it cheaper for Chinese companies to buy oil and other commodities that are priced in dollars. The consumer price index here was 2.8 percent higher in the first quarter than a year ago, well below the level of 4 percent to 5 percent that the government has said would be a problem. But producer prices, which tend to be less regulated, have been rising twice as fast.
 ''Although we think the C.P.I. rise in the first quarter was quite mild, we can't be complacent and we need to seriously increase monitoring,'' Mr. Zheng said.
 At the Canton Trade Fair last Friday in Guangzhou, China, many managers were complaining about the high cost of oil, which is driving up the cost of plastic, polyester and other materials. Wang Zhi Gang, a manager of the Yantai Tiancheng Textiles Import and Export Corporation in Yantai, China, said, 
 ''We have to ask our customers to pay more,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Blame China?

 BODY:
Members of Congress, egged on by American manufacturers, are threatening to slap punitive tariffs on Chinese goods unless China increases the exchange rate of its currency, the yuan, thus raising the price of Chinese imports here. Some Senate Democrats are even threatening to block President Bush's choice for the United States trade representative, Rob Portman, unless the administration also espouses get-tough tactics. This is protectionism raising its ugly head, and an all-around dreadful strategy. That's only in part because Mr. Portman, one of the president's better nominations, deserves confirmation. Worse, it's based on a misunderstanding of both China's financial situation and the cause of American economic woes.
 At the heart of this debate is China's policy of linking the value of the yuan to the value of the dollar. That was called sound policy when the dollar was strong. But now that it is weak, Congressional critics call it manipulation because it makes already inexpensive Chinese goods even cheaper the world over. As proof that the yuan is undervalued, the tariff seekers point to the United States' ballooning trade deficit with China, which accounted for about one-fourth of the United States' gargantuan global trade imbalance of $617 billion in 2004. 
 The trade deficit and the loss of American manufacturing jobs are very serious problems. It would be nice to think that they would self-correct if China would only change its ways. Nice, but wrong. Most of the trade gap with China is caused by Americans' insatiable appetite for Chinese imports, for which there are few domestic substitutes. And even if the yuan's exchange rate is too low -- a point on which economists differ -- it is a minor contributor to the trade deficit. If China let the yuan appreciate by 20 percent, and most other Asian currencies followed suit, the deficit would probably decline by only about one-fifth over the next year or two. That's not nearly enough to bring the American trade imbalance into a range that is generally considered sustainable.
 Tariff-mongering politicians don't necessarily want to believe this. ''Many of us feel they're playing this country for a fool,'' Senator Charles Schumer of New York fumed at a recent hearing. Treasury Secretary John Snow, to his credit, explained at that hearing how a premature yuan revaluation might do more harm than good. 
 Pegging a currency to the dollar is perfectly legitimate for a country like China with a fragile banking system and rudimentary capital markets. China's problem is that its underdeveloped finance sector exists hand in hand with a surging economy, which puts pressure on the yuan to appreciate. That state of affairs has attracted huge amounts of speculative capital into China, in anticipation that its government will soon allow the yuan to rise. Such speculative capital is destabilizing -- feeding, for example, a worrisome Chinese real estate bubble.
 This helps explain why China's leaders are so nervous about letting the yuan appreciate. They need a more flexible currency, sooner rather than later, both for the sake of trade relations and to gain more control over their own economy. But if China makes a small currency adjustment, the speculators will be rewarded and will pour in more money in expectation of future upward moves, further destabilizing the economy. And if China makes a large adjustment, it will incur sharp losses in its huge dollar holdings because an upward move in the yuan means a downward move in the dollar. That would only weaken its financial sector.
 It's not in China's interest, or in the interest of global economic stability, for China to move the yuan before its officials have coalesced around a strategy for doing so. And American lawmakers should be thinking twice about what the impact at home could be if the yuan is revalued. America's lack of savings -- by the government and individuals -- is the biggest contributor to global imbalances, making it necessary to ''import'' billions of dollars of foreign capital daily to cover our budget and trade deficits. 
 China is America's second-most-important lender, after Japan, and it will become even more important if other Asian nations curb their lending, as they have recently indicated they may. As long as China links the yuan to the dollar, it needs to buy large quantities of United States securities to prop up the dollar, a process that has helped keep American interest rates down and economic growth up. 
 If China loosened its currency's peg to the dollar, or removed it altogether, it wouldn't need to buy up dollar-based assets at its current torrid pace. The result could be a rise, even a sharp rise, in United States interest rates and, as a corollary, a falloff in economic growth. Neoprotectionist members of Congress should be careful about what they ask for.

HEADLINE: Democrats Try New Tack Over Trade With China

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 20 

 BODY:
After nearly two years of fruitless financial diplomacy toward China over exchange rates, the Bush administration faces a growing rebellion from Congress.
 Senate Democrats are threatening to block President Bush's nominee for United States trade representative, Representative Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, who comes up for a confirmation hearing on Thursday.
 Senator Evan Bayh, Democrat of Indiana, has said he will place a hold on Mr. Portman's nomination, meaning that the Senate would need 60 votes to end debate, until the administration supports a bill that would make it easier to penalize China for subsidizing its exports. 
 That moves come less than two weeks after a majority of Senate Republicans broke ranks with the Bush administration and expressed support for a bill that would impose tariffs of up to 27.5 percent on all Chinese imports if China fails to let its currency float more freely.
 In a vote that startled administration officials, the Senate voted 67 to 33 against a motion to kill the measure, which was sponsored by Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Senator Lindsey O. Graham, Republican of South Carolina.
 After failing to quash the bill, Senate Republican leaders promised to bring the bill up for a second vote by the end of July. 
 "That vote tapped into anxiety over trade practices that was deeper than the currency issue,'' Mr. Graham said on Wednesday. "For the first time, the reality of trade abuses trumped the arguments for free trade.''
 Mr. Schumer said: ''Congress is at the boiling point, and I think the vote on our amendment showed it.'' 
 China's trade surplus with the United States soared to $162 billion in 2004, propelling the overall trade deficit for the United States to a record $617 billion. 
 Though China's export boom stems largely from its low costs and enormous pool of cheap labor, administration officials and their critics agree that surge has been aggravated by China's policy of pegging its currency, the yuan, at a fixed exchange rate to the dollar.
 Analysts say the yuan is undervalued by at least 25 percent, which makes Chinese exports cheaper when priced in dollars.
 Under a policy of financial diplomacy, Treasury Secretary John W. Snow has tried to coax and convince Chinese leaders for nearly two years that it was in their own interest to let their exchange rate float and respond to global financial markets.
 Increasing the pressure last weekend, Mr. Snow declared at a meeting with finance ministers from the Group of 7 industrialized nations that now was the time for China to change its policy. 
 But Chinese officials pointedly declined an invitation to the attend the G-7 meetings. They accumulated more than $200 billion in dollar-denominated securities last year to keep their exchange rate stable. 
 ''Much as I wish it were the contrary, they are still on this tack of resisting any move of their exchange rate,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, head of the Institute for International Economics, a research group in Washington. 
 Mr. Snow and other top officials continue to rebuff calls to threaten China with tariffs or other trade barriers, contending that such efforts would simply harden Chinese resistance and could hurt American companies by damaging global trade.
 ''Turning to economic isolationism is not the answer,'' said Tony Fratto, a spokesman for Mr. Snow. ''Our policy of aggressive engagement with China and financial diplomacy is making progress.''
 But the pressure is building, and even supporters of the administration's soft approach to China are worried.
 ''We really need to negotiate, not legislate,'' said Representative E. Clay Shaw III, Republican of Florida and chairman of the House subcommittee on trade. ''We can hold it off to a certain extent over here, because we don't have the same procedures as the Senate. But we have found over the years that if you are patient enough you can find a way to attach your amendment to a bill.''
 Mr. Schumer and Mr. Graham, who is upset about the loss of textile and other manufacturing jobs in South Carolina, have attracted influential Republican co-sponsors, including Senators Mike DeWine of Ohio and Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina.
 An even greater number of Republicans in both the House and Senate have co-sponsored a milder bill that would make it easier for the United States to impose penalties in response to Chinese export subsidies. 
 Mr. Bayh, a co-sponsor of both bills, announced last week that he would try to block a Senate floor vote on Mr. Portman's nomination as United States trade representative.

HEADLINE: U.N. Nominee's Confirmation Is Seen in Growing Danger

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL and SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; Scott Shane contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 20 

 BODY:
After an unexpected erosion of Republican support for John R. Bolton, senators and their aides from both parties said Wednesday that his nomination as ambassador to the United Nations now appeared to be in some peril.
 Senator Lincoln Chafee, the Rhode Island Republican who had earlier said he was inclined to support Mr. Bolton, said Wednesday that he wanted to consult with his colleagues in the wake of the stormy meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday at which Democrats forced the postponement of a vote until next month. Among the committee's 10 Republicans, Mr. Chafee and 2 others have now voiced significant doubts about whether Mr. Bolton has the temperament and credibility to win confirmation. 
 Asked Wednesday if he was now less inclined to support the nomination, Mr. Chafee said, ''That would be accurate.''
 Senator George V. Voinovich, Republican of Ohio, sided Tuesday with the Democrats, forcing the panel's chairman, Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, to put off a vote. 
 Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, another Republican on the panel, also made clear during Tuesday's deliberations that he was troubled enough by some of the accusations against Mr. Bolton to possibly not vote for him on the Senate floor.
 The White House continued Wednesday to dismiss the charges as unfounded. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, traveling in Lithuania, endorsed him anew as ''the right person to be the United States ambassador to the United Nations at what is a really quite critical time.''
 But Democrats made clear their belief that Mr. Bolton had been dealt a serious and perhaps fatal blow.
 ''My hope would be that the administration, after yesterday, would say that he's damaged goods,'' Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut said. ''You'd think at some point, they'd wait a few days or whatever and decide this nomination isn't worth it to have a one-vote victory.'' Mr. Dodd said there must be other ''highly qualified, conservative Republicans to get appointed to this position that don't bring the luggage that Mr. Bolton will to this job.''
 Mr. Chafee said that Mr. Bolton's prospects were ''hard to predict'' but said he expected that ''the administration is really going to put some pressure on Senator Voinovich. Then it comes to the rest of us that have had some reservations.'' 
 The nomination appears to hang on what emerges on several points.
 One is whether the Senate panel substantiates accusations from a former contract worker on an Agency for International Development project that Mr. Bolton, as a private lawyer hired by her employer, tried to intimidate her in 1994. A co-worker has corroborated some of the charges made by the former contract worker, Melody Townsel, while the president of the company has challenged some of her claims. 
 A second point involves documents sought by the committee from the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency, to clarify conflicting accounts about Mr. Bolton's role in several matters, including his attempts while working as an under secretary of state to seek the transfer of several employees, and his requests for identifying information about American officials who were mentioned in or participated in conversations intercepted by the National Security Agency. He addressed some of these issues in his public testimony last week, but Democrats have said there is evidence some of his answers were less than candid.
 Finally, Mr. Bolton's prospects may hinge on calculations made by the nominee himself, or by the White House, and particularly Vice President Dick Cheney, who is regarded as his main patron. For now, President Bush and his team appear to see the battle as a test of wills, but new information, or the potential for another bruising hearing, may turn his cause into an unacceptable political liability. Mr. Chafee told CNN that the committee's Republicans might consider whether to recommend that the nomination be withdrawn.
 ''I think Republicans, we ought to get together and talk about this,'' Mr. Chafee said.
 In interviews on Wednesday, some Senate aides said they would not be surprised if the nomination was ultimately withdrawn. But many Republican senators continued to voice their support for Mr. Bolton.
 ''These allegations have come in; there is a feeling they have to be investigated,'' Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said, characterizing the views of most Republican senators. ''But it doesn't mean they bail out on him. I know of no Republican senator who says, 'I'm therefore voting against him.'''
 Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader, declared himself a ''strong supporter,'' acknowledging only that the delay made final approval ''more challenging from a scheduling standpoint.''
 But other Republicans, including Mr. Lugar, have voiced little enthusiasm for Mr. Bolton, making clear that they were willing to accept him mainly out of loyalty to Mr. Bush and the belief that nominees should be given the benefit of the doubt.
 The new account that corroborated Ms. Townsel's complaints against Mr. Bolton was offered by Uno Ramat, who worked with her on an Agency for International Development project in Kyrgyzstan in 1994. Mr. Ramat said Mr. Bolton, who was then a lawyer representing Ms. Townsel's and Mr. Ramat's employer, International Business and Technical Consultants Inc., flew to Moscow to counter Ms. Townsel's complaints that the company was slow in providing cash to pay suppliers.
 ''He was very intimidating and nasty,'' Mr. Ramat said in a telephone interview from Toronto. ''He terrorized the office, he really did.'' 
 Mr. Ramat also said he recalled a series of phone calls from Ms. Townsel, who was in Moscow, complaining of Mr. Bolton's behavior. He said she complained at the time, as she has in recent days, that Mr. Bolton followed her around the hotel, pounded on her door and threatened her. 
 But in a letter to the Foreign Relations Committee, the president of International Business and Technical Consultants, Jayant S. Kalotra, disputed Ms. Townsel's allegations. Mr. Kalotra said in the letter that his company found Mr. Bolton to be ''very intelligent, hard working, loyal and highly ethical.''

HEADLINE: My Life, My Subaru Outback XT

BYLINE: As told to Dana White.

 BODY:

WHO -- Miles Parker, 37, a computer scientist in Snyderville, Utah
WHAT -- 2005 Subaru Outback XT
 As the child of hippies, I spent my formative years crisscrossing the U.S. in a converted school bus while my mother and stepfather shopped for a spiritual home. They eventually settled on Buddhism, which I now practice as well. Given my nomadic childhood, it's not surprising that I've spent the better part of my adult life searching for stability. In some ways I'm still searching, but at least I've found it in my car.
 The Outback is my second Subaru. My first was a 2004 Impreza WRX, the souped-up version, but it was too small and looked too much like an economy car. I needed something bigger and, honestly, more adult. I wanted a little luxury -- heated seats, a moon roof -- and more room to haul my two dogs.
 One day I took the Impreza in for service in Salt Lake City and spotted an Outback on the showroom floor. I liked what I saw. The new interior is much nicer than in the past; the 2005 resembles an Audi, only more affordable and more sensible. It has a 2.5-liter turbo engine, so it's fast; all-wheel-drive, so it's safe; and a huge moon roof that lets lots of sunshine in. If you can't have a convertible, it's the closest thing.
 Contrary to popular perception, not all Buddhists are into self-denial. It's a question of desire. Shambhala Buddhists such as myself have no problem appreciating the finer things, as long as we don't get too attached to them. Of course, I'm quite attached to my Outback. I didn't say I was good at this stuff. 
 Subarus are a common sight around here. I live in a subdivision outside Park City, and I joke that the neighborhood regulations stipulate you must have at least one Subaru in the driveway. I lived in Washington, D.C., for several years, and saw plenty of people driving big S.U.V.'s that they absolutely did not need. You come out here to the mountains, where people know what they're doing, and they're driving Subarus and Volvo Cross Countries and Audi Allroads. We want a car that's not going to roll over and doesn't drink a lot of gas. 
 I've always been fascinated by cars, even if my earliest memories do take place in that school bus. When I was about 4, my mother and stepfather bought it from a school in Pittsburgh. They installed beds, a kitchen and a bathroom and painted it green and white. We called it the Turtle, though riding in it was like being in a boat on the open water. 
 We had many adventures. One time, when customs agents inspected our bus at the Canadian border, my parents asked me to sit on the bed to disguise the fact that there was pot stashed underneath. I'm not sure what happened to the bus; I think we left it at a commune somewhere. 
 Later, my parents got into Buddhism in Pennsylvania and followed their guru to Boulder, Colo. We lived in an A frame at 9,000 feet and later in a subdivision in Nederland. My stepfather was really into Audis -- for hippies, they had pretty epicurean tastes -- and my mom drove a succession of them until her divorce. We moved to Utah to be near her family and bought a boxy Subaru Loyale wagon. It was reliable but square.
 I graduated from the University of Utah and got a job as a computer consultant in Washington, D.C.. I married a woman I'd met in Utah. We had an Acura and a Saab. After 9/11 we moved back to Utah. It was my idea -- I wanted to be close to my family and to skiing. My wife and I were together for 10 years, but we finally admitted that while we love each other very much, we have some fundamental incompatibilities, and earlier this year we decided to move on. She kept the Saab. 
 The Outback was my gift to myself after the divorce. There were no negotiations. I got it in red, a color Julie would have never liked -- she thinks red attracts the highway patrol. I also got a beige and white interior, which she would have considered completely impractical, especially in mud season. 
 Yet now that I've got a nice car and my own house and a good career, I wonder, especially with the Buddhist thing, have I settled down too much? Am I diverting too much energy into believing that all this is real? I'll have plenty of time to think about it this summer: I'm spending a month as a seminary student at the Shambhala Mountain Center, a Buddhist retreat in Colorado. Once I get there I'll park my Outback and forget about it. But I know it will be waiting.

FACT SHEET
All About the Subaru Outback

THE LINEUP -- There are three Outbacks based on the Legacy wagon: the four-cylinder 2.5i, the turbo-charged 2.5 XT and the six-cylinder 3.0 R.

BASE PRICE -- $24,870, $28,670 and $32,870, respectively. (The smaller Outback Sport, which is based on the Impreza, has a base price of $19,570.)
WHAT IT MEANS -- Subaru is the Japanese name for the Pleiades star cluster.

NUMBER OF OUTBACKS SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES in 2004 -- 62,594 (70 percent of all Legacy wagons sold).

NUMBER OF SUBARU DEALERS IN THE UNITED STATES -- About 600.

COMPETITION -- Audi Allroad, BMW X3, Ford Freestyle and Volvo Cross-Country.

THE COMPANY -- After World War II, Nakajima Aircraft evolved into a scooter manufacturer; in 1953 it renamed itself Fuji Heavy Industries. The next year it unveiled its first car, the tiny P-1 sedan, which was renamed the Subaru 1500 in 1955. The company began selling Subarus in the United States in 1968. In 1996 it became the first automaker to make all-wheel drive standard in all its vehicles. That year, it introduced the Outback, arguably the first S.U.V.-wagon crossover. It became a favorite of the yuppie granola set (one of every seven cars sold in Vermont is a Subaru). For 2005, Subaru changed the platform for the Outback, making it qualify as a light truck with less stringent fuel-economy standards than cars.

COOL TECHNICAL FEATURE -- Subaru's Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive uses a horizontally opposed engine that sits low in the chassis, creating a low center of gravity for extra stability.

WHAT'S NEXT -- The 2006 Outback will be available with a navigation system.

FOR SALE -- The following Subaru Outbacks were available this week on eBaymotors.com: In Sacramento, Calif., a tan 2004 with 5,207 miles at a current bid of $10,100; in Farrell, Pa., a green 2001 with 80,454 miles at a current bid of $7,900; in Moorestown, N.J., a blue 1999 with 68,250 miles at a buy-it-now price of $8,700.

HEADLINE: From Every Angle, A Rising Revolution

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
''HOW this load of centuries wants to knock me down,'' wrote the Puerto Rican-born poet Julia de Burgos. Seeing her candid, youthful-looking face in a 1940's photograph of Latino writers in New York, you would not think that history -- her own -- would lead to her death on the streets of Manhattan a few years later, in her late 30's. 
 A small framed photograph of her, a studio head shot, sits on a table in the lobby of the Julia de Burgos Cultural Center at Lexington Avenue and 106th Street in East Harlem -- Spanish Harlem, El Barrio -- where she lived. And hers is just one portrait in a neighborhood full of them: pop stars on posters in Mexican and Puerto Rican music shops; political heroes on murals; blank-faced saints, known by the symbols they carry, in churches and botanicas. 
 There's yet another kind of portrait over on Fifth Avenue at the Museum of the City of New York: a historical snapshot of El Barrio itself, as seen through pictures taken at a revolutionary moment in the 1960's. And, next door, El Museo del Barrio is following up its recent survey of Latin American portraiture with a photo-documentary likeness of a single time and place, Mexico in the early 20th century. 
 ''Mexico: The Revolution and Beyond, Photographs by Casasola 1900-1940'' is in every way extraordinary. It has the span of a Greek epic, and the nested themes and subplots of a picaresque novel. The protagonists, alternately visionary and delusional, often dangerous, are Olympian in scale. Its bit parts are vividly drawn. Its chorus -- a curtain of faces, a sea of heads, a blur of bodies -- says much by saying almost nothing, by simply being there through everything, something surging into action, mostly observing and absorbing. 
 As complex stories often are, this one is the product of many hands, the first belonging to Agustin Victor Casasola. Born in Mexico City in 1874, he began his career as a typographer, then turned to reporting, and around 1900 began to take pictures. Photography was coming into its own as a news medium. It was big, and he decided to make it his business. 
 Enlisting the help of his gifted younger brother, Miguel, and other professionals, he set up a photo agency that, over four decades, generated hundreds of thousands of pictures. Agustin Casasola put his own name on most of them, whether he had taken them or not. We don't know his reason for doing so. Was it professional egotism, or a practical effort to consolidate a brand name? We do know that he understood the value of photography as a form of history, which led him to preserve nearly every image handled by the firm. 
 Some 500,000 prints and negatives survive as the Casasola Archive in the National Institute of Anthropology and History in Mexico. The 92 recently reprinted pictures in the show here, organized by the photographer Pablo Ortiz Monasterio, are culled from it.
 History, in its turn, gave Casasola a grand subject: an era of hair-raising political and social upheaval that had photographers dashing from presidential festivities, to firing squads, to guerrilla camps, to night courts and jazz cafes. Mexican culture, already an explosive hybrid, was in acute transition. A capitalist economy was making the rich impossibly rich, the poor starvingly poor. A nation that had joined the larger world was simultaneously looking back to what it fantasized it once had been. 
 The exhibition touches on all of this. Among the earliest pictures is a 1910 photograph of Gen. Porfirio Diaz, president of the country for more than 30 years. He introduced technology, encouraged international trade and enforced a civic peace. He also stripped peasants of land and basically made them slaves to foreign investors. 
 By 1910, popular anger was volcanic. Charismatic figures like Emiliano Zapata and Francisco Villa, known as Pancho Villa, amassed provincial armies so huge and vengeful that the government could not resist them. Diaz fled to France in 1911; Casasola photographed his ship pulling out. A new president, Francisco I. Madero, took power but was a washout. He was killed, someone else took over, and a pattern was set: revolution was literally that, a revolving wheel of disruption that carried some forward, crushed others. 
 Sometimes you can see its machinery spinning between rather than within pictures. In a photograph from around 1910, little girls in starched white aprons sit obediently in a classroom; Diaz was still in power. Five years later, a young woman -- she might have been one of the girls, now older -- stares with sidelong mistrust at the camera. She is dressed in soldier's pants, combat boots and a farmer's hat. De Burgos would have liked her. ''I delight in the desire to be Don Juan, or a bandit, or an anarchist worker, or a great soldier,'' she wrote in the 1930's or 40's.
 But every now and then, the latent cruelty of idealism looks straight at you. In 1915, the 30-something Zapata, with his marvelous moustache and ember eyes, sat for a Casasola portrait. He was that baffling thing, a right-thinking executioner, scrupulous and pitiless. Four years later, the same face is grotesquely bloated, the eyes sealed shut, as a group of young men prop up the fallen hero for a post-mortem photo-op. Are they his supporters? His assassins? Or are they the chorus, neither good guys nor bad guys, always there, like the Fates.
 Casasola and his crew were certainly very there, all the time, shooting whatever, wherever, with the opportunistic randomness that defines photojournalism. Sometimes the subject was epochal, often it was ordinary. And, in fact, images of ordinary life, passing in parade across the gallery walls, make up most of the show.
 The players? Shoe factory workers and street clowns. Politicians and prostitutes. Vamps and martyrs. Shawl-shrouded women and soldiers in khaki. Murderers under arrest; dissected cadavers under the knife. Blind orchestras and amateur wrestlers. Men in dresses, men in sombreros. Rich landowners -- hacendados -- and children loaded down like pack mules. The images are alternately awful and absurd, and sometimes it's hard to say which. 
 Occasionally we bump into someone we know, like Tina Modotti and Diego Rivera, and Frida Kahlo in a portrait by Rivera. This picture is actually part of a second, smaller show called ''Points of View,'' of photographs recently acquired by El Museo, including six pieces by Felipe (Phil) Dante (1934-2004), a founder of the photography collective En Foco. (More En Foco pictures are on view at Longwood Art Gallery at Hostos Community College in the Bronx.)
 Mostly contemporary, ''Points of View'' is well worth spending time with, not only because so much of it is so good, but because it demonstrates the steadily expanding range of an institution that began as a Nuyorican museum more than 30 years ago, and now represents ''Latino'' in its myriad forms.
 It is the earlier museum, though, that we find in ''El Barrio: Puerto Rican New York'' at the Museum of the City of New York, an exhibition organized by Kathleen Benson, curator of community projects, in conjunction with the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College, that is a portrait within a portrait. 
 The larger likeness is a detailed but expansive sketch, assembled from archival images and documents, of the Puerto Rican presence in East Harlem from the turn of the 20th century. The group photo of Latino writers, with de Burgos smiling but unrelaxed in the front row, is here. 
 The second, interior portrait is made up of some three dozen photographs taken in and around East Harlem in the late 1960's and 1970's by Hiram S. Maristany, who was born in El Barrio and still lives there. A few pictures -- of a sidewalk altar; of children watching a street festival from a fire escape -- serve as scene setters. But the others, on-the-spot records of political activism, have a concentrated heat. They're the photographic version of a flaming heart. 
 In the summer of 1969, a group of Puerto Rican students, Mr. Maristany among them, formed the Young Lords Party, using the Black Panthers as a model. Revolutionary in ideology, but focused on community action, they organized a garbage campaign to clean the streets and occupied a hospital, demanding health care for the poor. Mr. Maristany, the Lords' official photographer, was there every step of the way. He was also at El Museo del Barrio when it was new -- he served as director from 1977 to 1979 -- and at El Taller Boricua, or the Puerto Rican Workshop, now in the Julia de Burgos Cultural Center. 
 De Burgos's spirit is built into the show. The wave-shaped blue panels designed for the installation by the architect Warren A. James were inspired by an image from her poems. And one can easily imagine her words -- extravagantly romantic, politically exhortatory -- in the East Harlem air in that heady time. 
 It didn't last long. The Young Lords, riven by internal conflicts, disbanded. And de Burgos herself was, of course, long gone. She died of alcoholism and exposure on an East Harlem sidewalk. Because she was found without identification, she was buried in a potter's field. Only later was her body sent to Puerto Rico. 
 But if she lost a battle with herself, she won the war with time and history. They did not knock her down; they lifted her up, out of old photographs and into the minds of young poets and thinkers looking for ways to say the complicated things they want to say, today. 
 I am embodied in now; about yesterday I know nothing. 
 In the alive, my life knows the I Am of the new.
 The words come from one of her poems, translated by the writer Jack Agueros, an East Harlem native. And the poem comes from one of her books. It is a turbulent self-portrait of a book, as exhilarating and puzzling in its intimate way as the Casasola and Maristany photographs of revolution. And it is titled, with a poet's exquisite irony, ''Song of the Simple Truth.''

''Mexico: The Revolution and Beyond, Photographs by Casasola 1900-1940'' remains at El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue at 104th Street, (212)831-7272, through July 31.

HEADLINE: Fall in Indicators' Index Suggests A Shift Toward Slower Growth

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A closely watched index devised to forecast future business activity fell in March, the Conference Board reported yesterday.
 The composite index of leading economic indicators fell 0.4 percent last month, to 115.1. The decline was slightly larger than that expected by analysts, who had forecast a 0.3 percent drop. 
 The March drop came after a rise of 0.1 percent in February, and a revised 0.3 percent decline in January.
 The March reading points to an economy that while experiencing some turbulence is making a fairly normal and expected transition to slower growth, economists said.
 ''This is no more than a slowdown in economic activity, but it's not an indicator that we're about to enter anything more serious than a slowdown,'' said Anthony Chan, senior economist for J.P. Morgan Fleming Asset Management in Columbus, Ohio.
 The economic slowing suggested by the index was countered by another report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. That report pointed to stronger-than-expected growth in the mid-Atlantic region's manufacturing sector during April, along with rising prices.
 Also, the Labor Department reported that the number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits plunged by 36,000 last week, the biggest drop in three years. 
 The drop, which government analysts cautioned was vastly overstated by special factors, pushed the number of applications down to a seasonally adjusted level of 296,000. It represents the third consecutive week of declining claims.
 Analysts said an early Easter skewed the weekly figures, and said the four-week moving average of claims was a better indicator. That figure declined by 8,500, to 330,250.
 Economists noted that an earlier rise in claims for jobless benefits was the largest factor pushing down the Conference Board's index. Taken together, the economic reports point to a transitional period for the economy, they said.
 ''I think that slower growth may actually overstate what we're headed for,'' said Mark Vitner, an economist for the Wachovia Corporation in Charlotte, N.C. ''I think more modest economic growth is what we're likely to see.''

HEADLINE: Ecuador's New Chief Picks Cabinet; Leftist in Economic Post

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO; Carla D'Nan Bass contributed reporting from Quito for this article.

DATELINE: QUITO, Ecuador, April 21 

 BODY:
A day after President Lucio Gutierrez was driven from power, his successor, Alfredo Palacio, named a new cabinet on Thursday, including a left-leaning economy minister likely to appeal to poor Ecuadoreans, while working to gain legitimacy with Washington and Ecuador's Latin American neighbors.
 Mr. Gutierrez, 48, who was voted out of office by Congress on Wednesday and fled the presidential palace in a helicopter, was granted asylum by Brazil, which on Thursday evening was making arrangements to fly him out of the Ecuadorean capital. The attorney general's office has issued a warrant for Mr. Gutierrez's arrest for the deaths of two people killed this week in anti-government demonstrations. 
 After days of violent street protests over what opponents called Mr. Gutierrez's illegal overhaul of the Supreme Court, the capital was relatively quiet on Thursday. Most Ecuadoreans, long accustomed to political tumult and short-lived governments, returned to work. Still, despite a freezing rain, small but loud groups of demonstrators, fuming at the politicians they say do little other than sack the country, called for Mr. Palacio, who had been Mr. Gutierrez's vice president, to resign.
 ''The reality is people are not happy,'' said Pedro Oscullo, 33, an artisan who protested outside the presidential palace. ''We wanted to get the president out but we wanted a new president with new ideas. This is just the same old political parties taking over.''
 In a country and region where sentiment against market-driven reforms is strong, Mr. Palacio tried to cast himself as a different leader.
 Speaking to reporters on Wednesday and Thursday, he and his economic minister, Rafael Correa, criticized his predecessor's fiscal austerity measures and ties to international lending institutions. Even before Mr. Palacio took over as president, he had called it immoral for a country to use 40 percent of its budget to service its debt, and his new government may reconsider the direction of trade talks now under way with the United States. Mr. Palacio and his ministers have criticized the government's fiscal responsibility law and have said they would like to use oil money earmarked for the public debt to pay for social spending. Mr. Palacio, who does not belong to a political party, also stressed his independence.
 ''I am no politician,'' said Mr. Palacio, 66, a cardiologist who practiced in the United States in the 1970's. ''I'm a simple doctor.''
 Mr. Palacio, though, faces a host of obstacles in a chronically unstable country that has a bitterly divided Congress, a citizenry fed up with corrupt and inept politicians and, for the moment, no functioning Supreme Court. The new government has yet to obtain international recognition, though political analysts expect it.
 ''He has a new Cabinet but it's unclear how much support he has,'' said Fernando Bustamante, a political analyst at San Francisco University in Quito. ''And there are doubts about his legitimacy, especially abroad.''
 Indeed, the United States has not recognized the new government, and the Organization of American States has declined to support Mr. Palacio's administration until it explains how the change in government meets constitutional standards.
 Traveling in Lithuania, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called for adherence to the rule of law and seemed to suggest that early elections could help defuse tensions. ''There needs now to be a constitutional process to get to elections,'' she told Fox News.
 In a vote that raised questions among some diplomats because it did not include the full 100-member Congress, lawmakers voted 60 to 2 on Wednesday to remove Mr. Gutierrez from power. Ecuadorean lawmakers based their vote on Wednesday on a clause in the Constitution permitting the removal of a president for ''abandonment'' of his post. They justified the measure by arguing that Mr. Gutierrez's efforts to control the Supreme Court violated the law and went beyond the president's constitutionally mandated powers.
 Mr. Palacio, a former health minister from coastal Guayaquil, Ecuador's economic engine, is virtually unknown in the country. Joining Mr. Gutierrez's 2002 campaign for president -- when Mr. Gutierrez cast himself as a leftist man of the people -- Mr. Palacio quickly broke with him once he won office.
 For many Ecuadoreans and politicians here, the big question is whether Mr. Palacio can unite a divided country behind his government while forming political pacts with Ecuador's myriad parties.
 Mr. Palacio's pledge to call a referendum in the next few months, the first step toward a reform of the Constitution, will win him some supporters. But the new president's steps have already ruffled some feathers, like the appointment of Mr. Correa as economic and finance minister. Mr. Correa, an economist, has criticized Ecuador's trade pacts, its deals with the International Monetary Fund and its decision to replace its legal tender with the dollar.

HEADLINE: Critics of Deal With Giants Want to Read the Fine Print

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS

 BODY:
While New Jersey officials are poised to approve a new stadium for the New York Giants, the deal that was struck last week with the team has some lawmakers asking whether the state is giving up too much. 
 The board of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority is expected to vote in favor of the agreement today, since Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey has lined up support for what he calls ''a big win for taxpayers.''
 The Giants are to build and finance a $750 million replacement for the 29-year-old state-owned stadium in the Meadowlands Sports Complex, pay $6.3 million in rent and taxes and take over maintenance costs of more than $3 million a year. 
 The state's obligations and potential losses are less clear, however. No one has determined exactly how much of the debt on the existing stadium must be paid off or whether the sports authority could have received more money for the 40 acres of prime property it is providing to the Giants for retail development.
 The deal has critics within the administration and the sports authority, but few are willing to be identified. The public complaints are coming from legislators who raise doubt about the deal's benefits. 
 ''I am afraid this ultimately will end up costing the taxpayers,'' Assemblyman Kevin O'Toole, a Republican on the budget committee, said in a statement on Wednesday.
 Lawmakers also say they have been given no information about the agreement, which Mr. Codey, a Democrat, signed on April 14. 
 ''This may be the best deal in the world,'' said Assemblyman Joseph R. Malone III, the ranking Republican on the budget committee, who with fellow Republican committee members called for a public hearing on the agreement. ''I just want it to see the light of day.'' 
 Independent sports economists say that they believe the plan is a far better deal for the taxpayers than most N.F.L. stadiums are. 
 Even if the deal ends up costing the state $10 million to $20 million a year, as some detractors say, said Mark S. Rosentraub, an economist at Cleveland State University, that price would be negligible when spread over millions of households.
 There are questions, though, about what the state is giving up over the 40-year term of the lease. It will take on $124 million in debt. 
 The chairman of the sports authority, Carl J. Goldberg, said the agency's lawyers believed that $72 million of that amount would have to be retired immediately when the existing stadium is demolished. He added that the authority already has the cash to pay that off. Whether the authority pays off more than that, refinances the remaining debt or both has not been determined. 
 The state now relies on revenue from the stadium to pay its debt service of $5 million to $6 million a year. Another source would have to be found if any debt is refinanced. It is not clear, either, how the state will finance the $30 million in infrastructure improvements that it plans to spend.
 At the same time, the state will lose about $18 million a year that it receives from Giants, Jets and MetroStars games, concerts and other events -- although it already stands to lose income if the Jets and MetroStars soccer team, which also uses the stadium, leave as planned. 
 The state's consultants say the project will produce $15.3 million in added tax revenue in its first year of operation, 2009, and $1.1 billion more than the existing stadium would yield over a 30-year period. 
 Mr. Codey and Mr. Goldberg say the alternative to a new stadium -- improving the old one under a lease provision the Giants have sought to enforce in court -- is a huge risk that could cost the state $300 million. 
 Still, Republicans are critical, and even some Democrats are wary of the agreement. Mr. Goldberg says he has reached out to legislators to talk about the deal. But some complain that the terms are still mysterious. 
 Assemblyman Paul DiGaetano of Bergen County, a Republican running for governor, said Wednesday that the Giants were getting ''prime real estate'' at almost no cost.
 ''The governor and the leadership of the sports authority are acting quickly before the people realize what's going on,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Riding Into the Future, but on What Kind of Wheels?

BYLINE: By Kirk Johnson

DATELINE: MOAB, Utah 

 BODY:
Carson City had silver. San Francisco boomed with gold. Here it was all about uranium. For more than three decades after World War II, as the nation built its arsenal of cold war weapons and nuclear energy plants, the richly radioactive deposits that snake through southeast Utah made tiny Moab the nation's Geiger counter capital.
 At its height, there were 40 to 50 publicly traded uranium companies listed in the Utah newspapers, and most of them were here. The town had its own stock exchange. Deals unfolded over lunch at places like the Golden Steak. Then the accident at the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania in 1979 stalled the nuclear industry, and the Soviet Union fell, and Moab's go-go uranium economy was gone. 
 Now uranium is stirring again in the West. Two mines reopened last year in Colorado -- and five more could reopen this year -- prompted by a surge in prices and demand around the world, and the anticipation that new nuclear power plants might be built in the United States. 
 But Moab will not be reaching for its old crown, people here say. Unlike many other towns in the uranium belt that faded into the desert as the mills and mines closed, Moab moved on economically and has thrived as a tourist destination for visitors to nearby Arches and Canyonlands National Parks. What grips Moab now is not the question of mines versus tourism, but exactly what kind of tourism to embrace.
 The geology beneath Moab's soil may be the same, but the town's identity is not. The economic revival in the 1980's was led by young people, particularly health-conscious mountain bikers who discovered the area's back roads and sandstone trails. Coffee bars, bike shops and back-country tour operators now dominate a Main Street that once catered to the humbler needs of prospectors. 
 Nostalgia for days past has also been tempered by the huge mountain of mine waste that has moldered on the edge of town for decades. A long investigation into the environmental consequences of the mining, and a battle to have the tailings removed by the government, gave Moab a deeper and in some ways darker sense of its history, people say.
 ''This cleanup says a lot about what we think,'' said the mayor, David L. Sakrison, who arrived here 1972 as a footloose hitchhiker bound for South America and decided to stay. Mr. Sakrison said he still remembered how the wind would whip across the pile, then unprotected and barely monitored, blow dust through the streets. ''You could taste the metal in your mouth,'' he said.
 For one thing, the battle over the pile forced leaders like Mr. Sakrison to think beyond their own backyard. 
 In seeking support for a cleanup, Moab and its allies argued that the government should move the tailings not for Moab's sake, but for the Colorado River's. The drinking water and irrigation supplies for millions of people in Arizona and California could be contaminated, supporters of the cleanup said, if a flood someday washed the tailings into the river, which runs past the town. 
 The argument, aided by a series of articles about the tailings pile in The San Diego Union-Tribune by a reporter who grew up in Moab, was decisive, environmentalists say. The Department of Energy said this month that it would move the Moab mine tailings pile to a safer spot of entombment about 30 miles away.
 The debate about Moab's future, meanwhile, goes on, though it is again a question of how the land should, or should not, be used.
 Some business owners say the town should pursue more business from all-terrain vehicle owners and other off-road drivers, who have been visiting in increasing numbers and seem to spend more than mountain bikers or hikers. Others worry that the mountain-bike crowd might be chased away if the town becomes too closely identified with the ''motorheads,'' as many people here call the gas-burning backcountry contingent, and that too many heavy-tread tires in the backcountry could devastate the landscape for everyone.
 After the annual Jeep Safari week last month, which drew about 5,000 four-wheel-drive vehicles to Moab, a town with only a 5,000 year-round residents, the acrimony on both sides was thick. 
 One Colorado resident sent an e-mail message to the Chamber of Commerce saying he loved Moab but was so offended by the Safari that he would never return. At least one four-wheeler wrote that he was fed up, too. He said he thought that off-road drivers were looked down upon and hassled by the police.
 A petition was put up around the same time, signed by many Moab business owners, in favor of closing many trails to off-road vehicles. The trails, the signers said, were becoming ''a spider web of roads through some of our wildest and most sensitive landscapes.''
 Jason Taylor did not sign.
 ''I make my living with motors, so I hope it's not an effort to close us out,'' said Mr. Taylor, the general manager of Moab Adventure Center, which does Hummer tours and Jeep rentals. ''I'll fight to the end.''
 Longtime residents say the impact on the land from uranium mining -- the mill finally closed in 1984 -- was unquestionably severe and substantial in spots around Moab. But the land back then, despite the pawing of the miners, was still fairly wild and mostly empty.
 ''There just weren't that many people,'' said Lloyd M. Pierson, a retired National Park Service ranger who came to Moab in the 1950's, when the writer Edward Abbey had also just arrived to work as a seasonal ranger, a job Mr. Abbey later wrote about in his books about the Southwest.
 ''Now people are literally all over the place,'' Mr. Pierson said. ''Some of the things they've done to the land are appalling.''
 People like Jeremy Parriott are among those looking for Moab's new point of balance. 
 Mr. Parriott and his friends bought 320 acres here last year to play on with their all-terrain vehicles and motorcycles, and then in a fit of anticommercial largess, invited the rest of the world to come out and ride as well, free, no questions asked. 
 ''I don't want the headache of trying to make it a profitable business,'' said Mr. Parriott, 32, whose shaved head and big grin make him look like the actor Patrick Stewart. 
 Mr. Parriott posted a box by the gate for donations, with a request that people haul out their own garbage and be nice. His neighbors have complained about the noise, but some Moab politicians have applauded, sharing his hopes that weaning at least a few motorized riders from the public lands might ease the level of conflict and reduce damage to the landscape.
 But uranium is not quite finished leaving its mark on Moab, either. The $400 million, 10-year government cleanup project will create hundreds of transportation and engineering jobs -- the kind of work that people thought was long gone here.
 ''How ironic it is; we're going back to the thing we started with,'' said Joette Langianese, who represents Moab's west side on the Grand County Council. ''There's going to be a boom from moving this pile, like there was from uranium in the first place.''

A mountain of uranium mine waste has moldered near the Colorado River for decades. Moab has long been fighting to get it removed by the government. Supporters of a cleanup say water and irrigation supplies could be contaminated if a flood washed the waste into the river. The Department of Energy said this month that it would move the waste to a safer spot of entombment about 30 miles away.

HEADLINE: Stocks Surge, But Investors Remain Cautious

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH and JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Mimi Rauschelbach, a retired businesswoman from Phoenix, says she is confident about the strength of the American economy. But that is not translating, as it often does, into confidence in the stock market.
 Like thousands of individual investors across the country, she has become more cautious than she was in years past about investing in stocks. And it may not make much difference that the stock market's main measures had their best day of the year yesterday. 
 Bolstered by signs of corporate profit growth, investors made up for a sharp downturn on Wednesday, when stocks fell to their lows for the year. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 206.24 points yesterday, or 2.1 percent, to close at 10,218.60. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 22.45 points, or 2 percent, to 1,159.95. For the two benchmarks, it was the biggest daily gain since October 2003. 
 The Nasdaq composite index surged 48.65 points, or 2.5 percent, to 1,962.41, its best one-day gain since last March. Google said after the market closed that its earnings beat forecasts by 40 percent, a report that could help propel stocks higher today. 
 Still, all three market measures remain down 4.3 percent or more for the year. Individual investors are weathering one of the more trying times in the market since the early months of 2003, just before stocks rallied to end the three-year market plunge after the equity bubble burst in 2000.
 One consequence is a sudden jump in market volatility, something that can frighten investors. In just the last seven trading days, the S.&P. 500 has had daily moves of 1 percent or more in either direction five times. In the 69 other trading days this year, there were only 6 days when the index moved 1 percent or more. 
 It appears, based on data on the flow of money in and out of mutual funds, that many investors have recently decided that they have had enough of stocks. In the first three weeks of April, there was a net outflow of $147 million from domestic stock mutual funds, according to AMG Data Services. That net outflow comes after inflows of $3.5 billion in January, $9.3 billion in February and $5.9 billion in March.
 For investors like Mrs. Rauschelbach there is not the blind faith in, nor the blind betting on, certain sectors that was rampant at the end of the 1990's. She is making her investment decisions more thoughtfully than she did before. 
 ''I try to buy more carefully,'' said Mrs. Rauschelbach, who is in her early 60's. Mrs. Rauschelbach and her husband live on the income from their retirement nest egg. ''They talk about a stock pickers' market; I think that is absolutely the case.'' 
 Several recent surveys suggest investors are less positive about economic growth and the stock market than they were at the start of the year. According to the UBS index of investor optimism, which was released in March, sentiment about the economy dipped to the same level it was in October, the lowest it had been since June 2003, on worries of permanently higher gas prices. About 77 percent of investors last month said gas prices would rise permanently, compared with 54 percent in May 2004. 
 Investors still have ''concern when you talk about the stock market,'' said Kenneth S. Janke, chairman of the National Association of Investors Corporation, an umbrella organization for investors and investment clubs. ''If they see any kind of bad news, whether its predictable or not, they take that as a sign to sell.''
 Tobias M. Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citigroup, said, ''We are certainly at heightened levels of anxiety.'' Based on recent visits to many big institutional investors, he said ''they are afraid to buy into this market; they don't know where the bottom is.''
 Even with yesterday's rally, the market has yet to recover from last week, the worst for the market since August. And adding to the worries of slower-than-expected economic growth that suddenly appeared last week, the government reported Wednesday that inflation jumped sharply in March and is running at a 3 percent annual rate at the consumer level.
 Federal Reserve policy makers, who meet next on May 3, are expected to keep raising their short-term interest rate benchmark, especially if inflation pressures persist. But if those rate increases come while the economy is slowing, the effect on economic growth and corporate earnings could be more than the stock market could take.
 Investors like Mrs. Rauschelbach find that their heads tell them to stick with stocks because the economy is doing well while their stomachs tell them that the days of peppy economic growth may be coming to a close because of near-record oil and gasoline prices and the prospect of high interest rates in the months ahead. And for her, there is so little to choose from.
 ''Technology stocks aren't a good place anymore,'' she said. Oil stocks, she added, have run up and ''are no longer a good place.''
 ''Pharmaceuticals were great growth stocks and now we really don't want them anymore.'' And, she lamented, ''real estate values are out of sight.''
 Alex Ring, a 20-year-old finance major at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, said that the recent market plunge has made him bearish on the market even though he has about $15,000 invested.
 ''There are opportunities in individual stocks, but in the market as a whole, I am more uncertain,'' he said.
 As a result, he said he planned to continue to take short positions in the Nasdaq exchange-traded fund he owns through an online broker for at least the next month, betting that its price will go down. By taking a short position -- borrowing to sell something now -- an investor can profit if that security or index falls and he or she buys it back later.
 But while not betting on the overall market, Mr. Ring is still willing to take a narrower bet on a stock sector he likes. In this case that is oil and gas companies, through index funds like iShares Goldman Sachs Natural Resources fund. Some investors still want to stay the course, however.
 ''Economic reports come and go and investor sentiment changes as quickly as the wind on an Oklahoma plain,'' said Jake Dollarhide, chief of the Longbow Asset Management Company in Tulsa, Okla.
 But Mr. Dollarhide understands why many investors are so worried. ''Whenever the market has a very bad day or an extended period of days we see triple-digit declines, it's human nature to get out. It's human nature to panic.''
 Joseph N. Craig, 58, of Ellicott City, Md., finds the recent decline less unnerving because he sees it as an opportunity. ''This might be a real good time to be looking for bargains rather than abandoning the market,'' he said. ''I tend to hope or think that when the headlines say doom and gloom, it is time to back up the truck and go shopping.''

HEADLINE: Global Underdog

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman (''A Whiff of Stagflation,'' column, April 18) points out a serious problem in the United States.
 The agenda of the radical conservatives is making us less competitive in the world. We pay substantially more than other developed countries for health care, but we have lower life expectancies and 45 million uninsured Americans. 
 Our military budget is the world's largest, roughly equal to that of the rest of the world combined. 
 We use 25 percent of the world's oil production, making us dependent on oil-producing countries. 
 Our annual budget deficit is $400 billion, which puts our economy at the mercy of foreign governments. We pay more than $300 billion in interest on the national debt every year. We have skyrocketing college tuition costs and underfinanced schools. 
 The net result is a weaker United States position in the global marketplace.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Manhattan: Public Sector Pays More

BYLINE: By Steven Greenhouse (NYT); Compiled by Anthony Ramirez

 BODY:
The Citizens Budget Commission, a business-backed research group, issued a report yesterday finding that public-sector workers in the New York area earned an average $28.26 an hour, 15 percent more than the $24.62 earned by private-sector workers. 
The commission said the finding, based on federal labor statistics, undermined an argument by public-sector workers that they deserved generous benefit packages to compensate for higher private-sector pay. But James Parrott, chief economist for the Fiscal Policy Institute, a liberal research group, said the public sector's edge resulted largely from the rapid erosion of labor standards in New York's private sector, caused in part by weaker unions and globalization.

HEADLINE: 'Madison'

BYLINE: By ANITA GATES

 BODY:

Opens today nationwide
Directed by William Bindley
Rated PG, 105 minutes
 It's not every day that a mechanic gets to be a movie hero. The last one may have been Joe Patroni (George Kennedy), who pulled a Boeing 707 out of the snow in ''Airport'' (1970). But Bruce Dern, as Harry Volpi, is a dashing figure, arriving to save the day in this sentimental film about hydroplane racing.
 ''Madison,'' in the tradition of ''Chicago,'' ''Fargo'' and ''New York, New York,'' is a movie named for a city -- in this case, Madison, Ind., population 13,000 or so, on the banks of the Ohio River. In 1971, Madison's economy, based on waterway shipping, is shot. All it has left is its tradition of hydroplane racing, and when it has the chance to play host to the Gold Cup race, there are four big questions: Can the town come up with the $50,000 prize money? Does Miss Madison, the community-owned boat whose crew is managed by Jim McCormick (Jim Caviezel), a heating and air-conditioning repairman, have any chance to win? What will Jim have to do? And how will it all affect his son, Mike (Jake Lloyd, aka Anakin Skywalker of ''Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'')?
 ''Madison'' wants to be both heartwarming and quirky but is sometimes just cutesy instead. A baby girl's first word is ''Agnew.'' An elderly white man and an elderly black man argue about which racing day over the decades was best (1962? No, it rained). William Bindley, the director, who wrote the screenplay with his brother Scott Bindley, takes the position that big-city people disdain small towns just for being small. The racing teams from Budweiser and Atlas Van Lines and the television news people are portrayed as openly condescending. 
 The peculiar thing, from an urban perspective, is that while the film, based on a true story, celebrates the peace, quiet and charm of small-town life, it also revels in the thrills of a super-noisy high-speed sport. Only moviegoers who care about nitrous-oxide injection systems or Madison itself are likely to appreciate it. 
 ''Madison'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes mild profanity and a couple of fatal explosions. ANITA GATES

TREGOE, BENJAMIN B. JR.

 BODY:
 TREGOE--Benjamin B. Jr. Co-founder and chairman emeritus of Kepner-Tregoe, Inc., died on April 20, 2005 of complications from nonHodgkins lymphoma. He was 77. In 1958, Dr. Tregoe and Dr. Charles H. Kepner left the RAND Corporation, where they worked as systems researchers, to found KepnerTregoe and Associates, Inc. Innovative pioneers, the two social scientists conducted original research with major corporations and discovered a core set of analytical problem-solving and decisionmaking processes that continue to be recognized as universally valid. Today, 400 of the 1,000 largest corporations worldwide use Kepner-Tregoe management methods. Their company, which later became Kepner-Tregoe, Inc., is headquartered in Princeton, NJ and conducts business in over 50 countries and 20 languages. Since its inception, Kepner-Tregoe has transferred its problem-solving, decision-making, and planning approaches to millions of managers. Dr. Tregoe and his colleague, John W. Zimmerman, also developed a process for strategic decision making that has helped many top management teams set and implement strategy. Dr. Tregoe provided the inspiration and leadership for Kepner-Tregoe over many years. He held a firm belief in the quality and depth of development for every associate as they delivered Kepner Tregoe's services to clients. He was conceptionally brilliant, a tough questioner, and a sensitive counselor. Dr. Tregoe and his company have been a significant force in organization development, pioneering both the train-thetrainer approach and process consulting, both of which have become common practice. He was elected to the Human Resource Development Hall of Fame. Dr. 
Tregoe was a leading lecturer and published extensively in journals throughout the world. His first book, The Rational Manager, which was co-authored with Dr. Kepner in 1965, is recognized as a landmark publication in the field of management methodology. He also co-authored The New Rational Manager: An Updated Edition for a New World (1997); Top Management Strategy: What It Is and How to Make It Work (1980); Vision in Action: Putting a Winning Strategy to Work (1989); The Culture of Success: Building a Sustained Competitive Advantage by Living Your Corporate Beliefs (1997); and Analytic Processes for School Leaders (2001). In 1993, Dr. Tregoe realized a long-held dream when he established the Tregoe Education Forum. This nonprofit organization provides students in middle and high schools with the critical-thinking skills needed to effectively solve problems, make decisions, and work together. Dr. Tregoe was born in San Francisco on December 23, 1927. He graduated from Redondo Union High School in Redondo Beach, California in 1945. After serving in the U.S. Marine Corps, he received his bachelor's degree from Whittier College and a Ph.D. in sociology from Harvard University. He also received an honorary LL.D. from Whittier College, where he served as a trustee and a board member. He was a member of the board of directors of The J.M. Smucker Company, the National Alliance of Business, The World Affairs Council of Philadelphia, and the Princeton Day School. He served as chairman of an advisory committee to the dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University. He is a past member of the Young Presidents' Organization, where he served as international education chairman and a member of the board, and a member of the Chief Executives' Organization. Dr. Tregoe is survived by his wife, Jeannette Tregoe; two daughters, Cynthia Richetti and Elizabeth Gonzalez; one son, Benjamin B. Tregoe III; and two grandchildren, Kaleigh and Gavin Richetti. For information contact the Mather-Hodge Funeral Home, Princeton, NJ (609924-0242). A memorial service will be held at the Nassau Presbyterian Church in Princeton, NJ at 11 a.m. on Monday, April 25th. Following the service, a luncheon reception will be held at the Nassau Club, 6 Mercer Street, Princeton. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Benjamin Bainbridge Tregoe Fellowship Fund, The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Harvard University, University Hall 3 North, Cambridge, MA 02138-3654 or to the Cancer Support Group and Programs of Care of the Nassau Presbyterian Church, 61 Nassau Street, Princeton, NJ 08540.

HEADLINE: China Looms As the World's Next Leading Auto Exporter

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, April 21 

 BODY:
Industrial heartlands from the Great Lakes region to Germany, look out -- here comes the Chinese auto industry.
 A senior DaimlerChrysler executive, Ruediger Grube, startled a roomful of journalists and his own aides at the Shanghai Auto Show on Thursday by disclosing that the company intended to export small cars from China to the United States. Daimler is already in talks with one of its Chinese joint-venture partners to build a factory for the exports, he said, and would like to work out the details and make a final decision on the project in the second half of the year.
 But any cars from such a venture would be only part of what now seems to be shaping up as a broad assault on global automotive markets by Chinese companies and the Chinese divisions of multinational companies.
 China's auto parts exports of everything from Delphi parking-brake components to Johnson Controls seat covers are already increasing to countries around the world. Sizable exports of fully assembled cars by Chinese-owned automakers like Hafei and Chery have already begun to developing nations in South America, Africa and the Middle East. 
 DaimlerChrysler's negotiations now make it increasingly likely that significant numbers of cars will be shipped from plants in this country to the United States and Europe as soon as 2008.
 Robert A. Lutz, the vice chairman of General Motors, said here that he expected at least one of China's homegrown automakers to be successfully exporting around the world in the next five years.
 ''We're rapidly approaching that point,'' Mr. Lutz said. ''I wouldn't venture to say which one it will be.''
 Until recently, high costs for auto parts, a scarcity of top-quality steel, a shortage of experienced engineers and a history of uneven quality had prevented China from using its inexpensive labor to gain any significant share of the world automotive market.
 But all these problems, including quality, are gradually being fixed, even as Chinese industrial workers, at $2 an hour or less including benefits, remain among the lowest paid in the world.
 ''In terms of quality, the cars from China and the cars from Korea are the same,'' said J.M. Noh, the president of Beijing Hyundai and an automotive-quality expert who spent 15 years in Hyundai's quality-control departments in South Korea before coming to the company's joint venture in China.
 The prospect of fully built cars from China appearing in showrooms in the United States and Europe risks renewed international confrontations over China's trade and currency policies.
 The Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler does not now sell a very small sedan of the sort the company proposes to import from China; its smallest offering in the United States is the slightly larger Dodge Neon. But the planning for such a car is likely to stir memories of how Japan and South Korea each started by dominating the American subcompact market and then steadily moved to larger vehicles.
 In Detroit, the United Automobile Workers responded to the DaimlerChrysler announcement with a blistering attack on China and on Washington's trade policy.
 ''The $1.50-to-$1.95-per-hour labor cost in the Chinese auto industry is not arrived at by any 'natural' operations of a free market,'' Ron Gettelfinger, the union president, said in a statement, ''but through artificial repression of wages by a brutal regime which outlaws independent trade unions and jails more labor activists than any country in the world.''
 ''China's repression of its own workers and its manipulation of its own currency,'' Mr. Gettelfinger added, ''are unfair trade practices which must no longer be tolerated by the U.S. government.''
 In China, Honda has just finished building a factory in Guangzhou, near the southeast coast, for exports to Europe starting in late May or early June. More speculatively, the Chery Automobile Company has announced plans to begin shipping some cars to the United States in 2007, although it faces formidable difficulties in developing an American dealer network.
 But auto executives say that the real challenge from China, at least for the next several years, will lie in the auto parts industry. The Commerce Ministry forecasts that Chinese automotive exports, mainly parts, will rise to a range of $70 billion to $100 billion by 2010 from $11.8 billion last year.
 ''I see more opportunities for the components base and major subassemblies for export,'' said James J. Padilla, president and chief operating officer of the Ford Motor Company.
 At the same time, China's need for imported auto parts is leveling off as car sales slow in its domestic market and automakers find that they can more easily buy locally. After running trade deficits in the auto sector for the last three years, China's automotive exports in the first two months of this year, at $2.01 billion, were almost double its imports, at $1.17 billion.
 Continental Teves, for example, is now able to make or buy nearly all the parts for brakes that it sells in China except for antilock braking system valve blocks, which still come from Germany. BorgWarner has begun making timing belt gears and sprockets in China for Volkswagen's huge operations here, instead of importing them from one of its factories in Italy.
 The Chinese government is pushing not just parts makers but auto assembly plants to export. Regulations bar multinationals from owning more than 50 percent of auto assembly joint ventures in China.
 But Beijing authorities made an exception two years ago and allowed Honda to own two-thirds of the assembly plant just completed in Guangzhou after it promised to export all the cars from that factory to Europe.
 Asked whether DaimlerChrysler was seeking a similar deal for the factory it is negotiating to build for the production of small cars for the American market, Mr. Grube said only that a number of details of the operation were still being worked out.
 To be sure, China's auto sector still faces several obstacles to exports -- most notably the uneven quality of many small parts and the lack of a dense infrastructure of reliable local suppliers of the many different screws, rods, bearings and other parts essential in assembling larger auto components.
 Timothy R. Donovan, executive vice president and general counsel at Tenneco Automotive, said that quality problems had been a significant cost in Tenneco's manufacturing of shock absorbers, struts and mufflers, which are sold almost exclusively in the Chinese market. 
 Tenneco has to employ extra workers to sort and check incoming parts because defect rates are 15 to 20 percent higher than in advanced industrial nations, Mr. Donovan said. But the workers inevitably do not catch all the defects, which are found later in the production process or even on arrival at the assembly plant, he said.
 The later a defect is found, the higher the cost of rebuilding or throwing out the entire part. To make matters worse, the same grades of steel often cost more in China than elsewhere because of high local demand, and many high-strength grades must be imported at even greater expense. 
 ''Their supply base, from a cost standpoint and a quality standpoint, is not up to world-class standards,'' Mr. Donovan said, while adding that quality is now improving.
 While Chinese parts now hold a large and rapidly growing share of the market for lower-quality replacement parts purchased by repair garages, automakers in industrial nations have so far been wary of relying on parts from China for installation in new cars.
 But this, too, is beginning to change, with Mr. Donovan saying that Tenneco is starting to receive requests from automakers to submit contract bids for production in China.
 Some Chinese manufacturers complain of receiving many invitations to bid from European, American and Japanese automakers that have little intention of buying, but want to use the bids to demand much lower prices from long-established domestic suppliers. 
 ''These groups come in from Ford or G.M.,'' said Todd Fortner, president of the Changshu Automotive Interiors Company, ''and we don't know if they're just surfing'' for low bids. ''Sometimes, I get tired of answering all these requests for quotes.''
 The big question in the longer term, Mr. Fortner added, is whether industrial nations will keep their markets open to imports and avoid protectionism.
 ''The Chinese economy is capable of doing $100 billion'' in annual auto parts exports, he said, ''but whether the U.S. economy or the European economy has the stomach for it remains to be seen.''

HEADLINE: MBNA ISSUES WARNING ON PROFIT FOR YEAR

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The MBNA Corporation, the nation's biggest independent credit card company, said yesterday that its profit would be significantly below its 10 percent growth target for 2005 because customers are paying off more debt. Shares of MBNA fell 17 percent. 
Payments were especially high on credit cards carrying MBNA's highest interest rates, the company said, adding that more borrowers were paying off cards in favor of less expensive sources of credit like home equity loans. Stock in MBNA, based in Wilmington, Del., fell $3.83 to $19.28 a share. MBNA said that first-quarter profit fell to $31.7 million, or 2 cents a share, from $519.7 million, or 40 cents, a year earlier. The company said that it would have earned $514.1 million without costs for a revamping.

HEADLINE: Stock Exchange's Members Expecting Windfalls From Merger

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
The New York Stock Exchange's decision to acquire Archipelago Holdings and become a public company promises to provide a windfall for the members, the holders of the 1,366 seats on the exchange. 
 But at a closed meeting late yesterday, some exchange members said they wanted a bigger stake in the new combined company.
 The exchange has set aside about $400 million to pay each member about $300,000 in cash for the trading rights to their seats. In addition, the existing members will also receive about 80,000 shares of stock in the newly combined company. That stake would be worth about $2.4 million for each member. 
 Just yesterday, the exchange said a seat was sold for $1.8 million, 11 percent more than the previous price for a seat. But that is still a discount to the $2.7 million value implied by the deal's terms.
 The recent rise in seat prices suggests that there is optimism about the exchange's future. Some Big Board members said yesterday that they were enthusiastic about the merger. 
 ''It's almost like getting into a house where you are not going to tear it down, but you are going to take it down to the rafters and build something in it,'' said William R. Power, a New York Stock Exchange member who serves on its advisory board of trading industry executives. 
 The swiftness of the deal's timetable, Mr. Power added, made him even more enthusiastic about how management was ''aggressively transforming the place.''
 But other members at yesterday's meeting said they should own more than the 70 percent of the new company that was outlined on Wednesday.
 ''We are starting with a lower base than I would have liked, but we are moving forward and I don't think we have a lot of time,'' said Thomas Caldwell, the chairman of Caldwell Asset Management who bought four Big Board seats last year. ''The N.Y.S.E. has been behind the game for a long time, and we must get into this century.''
 Over the last few years, the price of a New York Stock Exchange membership seat has fluctuated. Besides a weaker market, the Big Board has battled concerns about its corporate governance, charges of improper trading and uncertainty about the future of its floor model. 
 The price of a seat tumbled to $975,000 in January, down 63 percent from its peak in 1999 and the lowest in nearly a decade.
 ''The prospects of the New York Stock Exchange, they weren't looking positively,'' said Lawrence J. White, an economics professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University. ''Things were looking as if they were going downhill.''
 Now, that outlook seems to have changed. Yet, the Big Board seats, which give members access to the trading floor and an ownership stake in the exchange, will probably be eliminated. They are to be converted into shares of the new public company, the NYSE Group, freeing the new exchange to issue trading permits whose prices and terms will be at the discretion of the board.
 Shares of Archipelago, meanwhile, surged 60 percent yesterday. The stock, first offered to the public in August, closed up $11.20, at $29.96.

HEADLINE: War Is Muted as Issue in Britain, but Not for Its Muslims

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: BIRMINGHAM, England, April 19 

 BODY:
The war in Iraq brought Salma Yaqoob to public life, and with an election due next month, the politics of that same conflict could make or break her dream of staying there. 
 Once a leader of the pacifist Stop-the-War campaign, Ms. Yaqoob is now one of a handful of candidates fighting the mighty Labor electoral machine in the name of a tiny start-up movement called Respect -- feeding on the antiwar sentiment that consumed many Britons in the prelude to the conflict in 2003 and that lingers in the deep mistrust many voters avow toward Prime Minister Tony Blair.
 But as the May 5 election approaches with Mr. Blair clearly in the lead in opinion polls, the Iraq war has come to occupy ambiguous ground. The damage that the war has done to Mr. Blair's credibility has made trust in the prime minister an issue throughout Britain. But opposition to the war itself, which particularly animates Ms. Yaqoob and many of her fellow Muslims, is rarely mentioned by the main contenders for power on the campaign trail. 
 The opposition Conservatives, led by Michael Howard, supported the invasion and cannot therefore make political capital out of it. And the antiwar Liberal Democrats have done little on the hustings to exploit the issue. 
 ''In this election the war is everywhere and nowhere,'' said the columnist Jonathan Freedland in the antiwar newspaper The Guardian, comparing the British election with those last year in Spain and the United States. ''While Jose Maria Aznar and George Bush were pounded by their electoral challengers over the conflict, Tony Blair enjoys a free pass from his chief rival, Michael Howard. Iraq is not exactly the lead item in any of the main party manifestos.''
 Or, as Ms Yaqoob put it in an interview at her suburban home, ''it's the elephant in the room.''
 Her campaign here in the British Midlands has a special twist. Her constituency, called Birmingham Sparkbrook and Small Heath, has 27,000 Muslim voters, almost half the electorate, giving it one of the highest concentrations of Muslims of any of the 646 electoral districts in contention, according to electoral experts. But the district also has the sixth largest Labor majority in the country --16,246 votes. Writ small thus, the contest here will offer one test of Mr. Blair's ability to avoid political punishment among Britain's Muslim population for ordering British troops to Iraq as America's ally. 
 ''Wherever there is a strong Muslim population, Tony Blair is going to lose,'' said Mohammed Naseem, the chairman of Birmingham's Central Mosque. Dr. Naseem also supports the Respect movement, which is led from London by a maverick former Labor legislator, George Galloway, who visited twice with Mr. Hussein in prewar Iraq.
 Just as important, though, the fight here reflects a contest among Britain's more than 1.6 million Muslims -- less than 3 percent of the population -- between an older, first generation of immigrants that generally looked to the Labor Party and their younger, more assertive offspring, born and raised in Britain. 
 ''My father voted Labor forever, but the war in Iraq changed everyone's opinion,'' said Farrah Zaman, 37, a British-born Muslim homemaker who wore the niqab headdress covering everything except her eyes.
 ''Tony Blair sent the troops out to Iraq and he adamantly said he believes he did the right thing, but I can't stop thinking about how many innocent people were killed,'' she said. ''He always said he never did anything wrong, but they never found the weapons of mass destruction,'' whose existence -- the core of Mr. Blair's argument for ousting Mr. Hussein -- was never proved.
 Like other people interviewed for this article, Ms. Zaman preferred to dwell on the number of dead since the war -- which she and others here reckoned, without offering proof, to be 100,000. Mr. Blair, like President Bush, prefers to remind skeptics that the invasion brought an end to Mr. Hussein's atrocities, which, by their account, claimed many more lives than allied military action. 
 In the hardscrabble Sparkbrook area of Birmingham, the Muslim influence is evident in the halal foodstores and Islamic bookshops, the flowing black robes and dark headdresses of the women. Over the decades, waves of immigrations brought people here, predominantly from Kashmir and Afghanistan and most recently from Somalia. Many are women.
 ''For the first time you have got young British-born females wearing the hijab,'' said Parwez Hussain, 32, manager of an educational Web site, referring to the Islamic head scarf covering women's hair and neck and reflecting Islamic piety. ''Half the voters are female,'' he said. ''You don't know what they are going to do. Historically women didn't get involved. Now they make up half the people at political rallies.''
 That may not, though, add up to anything like a rout for Mr. Blair in this critical region. ''Whoever wins the Midlands will win Britain,'' said Robert Waller, a co-author of the Almanac of British Politics reference work. But to win, Mr. Blair's adversaries would need a huge and improbable-seeming swing in their favor.
 The opposition, moreover, is splintered in various ways. ''There's no monolithic bloc'' among Muslim voters, said Ms. Yaqoob, 33, a psychotherapist who is seeking to increase the number of Muslims in the British Parliament beyond its current level of two. She is not alone in that ambition. 
 The Liberal Democrats -- the junior opposition party, which opposed the deployment of British troops in Iraq -- have fielded their own Muslim candidate in her district, Talib Hussain, a defector from the Labor Party. Some believe that with deeper roots and broader organization, the Liberal Democrats will capture the vote of disaffected Muslims.
 ''It's a difficult call,'' said Ibrahim Versani, a medical doctor, who said he voted for Labor in 2001 but will not do so in 2005 because Mr. Blair's government brushed aside widespread opposition to the war in Iraq. 
 ''There's a lot of sympathy with Respect on the antiwar issue,'' he said, ''but I suspect they are not so strong on the other issues -- jobs and the economy.'' 
 There is some bitterness, too, that the Muslim vote is so fissured. Mr. Hussain, the Liberal Democratic candidate, accused Respect of ''helping Labor get back in'' by dividing Muslim loyalties.
 The potential beneficiary is Roger Godsiff, the Labor candidate first elected 12 years ago, who has maintained Labor's dominance here.
 Mr. Godsiff, who is not Muslim, seemed to be calculating that, whatever the hopes of insurgents like Ms. Yaqoob, Muslims' traditional tie to Labor would prevail. ''The way the system works is that that you talk to the community, you talk in groups, large groups, small groups, particularly to the men and they take the message back to the extended family,'' he said.
 There are, of course, much broader distinctions within British Islam as a whole. On Tuesday, Islamic militants burst into a news conference in London held by representatives of the Muslim Council of Britain, the country's largest mainstream Muslim organization, and handed out leaflets saying, ''Voting for any political party will guarantee your seat in hellfire forever,''
 Later the same day, people from the same militant group clashed violently with followers of Mr. Galloway, the Respect leader in east London, saying it was un-Islamic to vote and that anyone who did so became an infidel.
 Some Muslim leaders said that pointed to a further generational divide. Ali Miraj, a Conservative candidate in Watford, north of London, told reporters that younger Muslims were impatient with the mainstream leadership. ''They want some sort of Islamic state, some sort of Utopian ideal,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Urges Congress To Rein In Federal Benefits

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 21 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, urged lawmakers on Thursday to scale back promised benefits for both Social Security and Medicare ''sooner rather than later.''
 Expressing particular alarm about health costs and Medicare, Mr. Greenspan warned that the federal budget was on an ''unsustainable path'' that would lead to a vicious circle of higher deficits, higher interest rates and even higher borrowing. 
 ''Unless that trend is reversed, at some point these deficits could cause the economy to stagnate or worse,'' the Fed chairman told the Senate Budget Committee.
 But Mr. Greenspan bristled visibly when a Democratic lawmaker accused him of making the problem worse by supporting President Bush's tax cuts in 2001.
 The federal budget enjoyed a brief period of surpluses that ended in 2001, then fell into consistently deeper deficits that the White House expects to hit $427 billion in 2005.
 Mr. Greenspan also told lawmakers that he expected China to unpeg its currency from the dollar ''sooner rather than later'' because Beijing's policy is threatening to harm China's own economy. In doing so, he joined a chorus of American officials who are pressing China to lift the value of its currency because of the artificial advantage it provides to its exports. 
 But Mr. Greenspan focused most of his comments on the long-run problems that loom as the nation's baby boomers begin to claim Social Security retirement and Medicare benefits.
 He described Medicare, where costs have consistently grown much faster than the economy, as a much bigger and more unpredictable problem than Social Security.
 And though he did not endorse particular cuts, he spoke favorably about two ideas that have been floated by President Bush: pushing back the normal retirement age and changing the formula for setting future retirement benefits.
 ''If existing promises need to be changed, those changes should be made sooner rather than later,'' he said. 
 Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, criticized the Fed chairman as ''taking the lid off the punch bowl'' by strongly supporting tax cuts in 2001.
 Mr. Greenspan admitted that he and most other forecasters had been wrong to expect budget surpluses, which disappeared the next year.
 But he said it was unfair to accuse him of complicity in the deficits, because he had also pleaded unsuccessfully for ''triggers,'' or mechanisms that would require policy changes if expected tax revenues failed to materialize.
 Mr. Greenspan also reiterated his plea for a renewal of ''pay-go'' restrictions that would require Congress to offset the cost of both new spending programs and new tax cuts with savings in other areas.
 President Bush and most Republican lawmakers have adamantly rejected any such restrictions on tax cuts.
 Despite testifying during a week in which stock markets were whipsawed by conflicting signals on inflation and corporate earnings, Mr. Greenspan said little about the economy except that it appeared ''to be expanding at a reasonably good pace.''
 Asked if the economy appeared headed toward ''stagflation,'' a mix of rising inflation and stagnant growth, the Fed chairman said, ''It certainly doesn't seem that way.''

HEADLINE: TriBeCa's Film Emporium, Big Enough to Get Lost In

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
The TriBeCa Film Festival, which opened on Tuesday, has a message for New York. Lest we forget, movies are show business as well as art. In the words of ''Celluloid Heroes,'' a wonderful old Kinks song celebrating the screen's magical hold on our imaginations, ''Everybody's in movies.'' And that means everyone from the snootiest cinephile to the squarest suburban family. 
 That grass roots attitude may not be easy for everyone to accept in New York City, where institutions like the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the Museum of Modern Art promote the notion that art films rule. The sudden appearance of the TriBeCa Film Festival in Manhattan in 2002, arriving on waves of hype, has been a classic case of a staid old neighborhood jolted by an influx of new money and brash new energy. 
 Naysayers still view the festival as the equivalent of a sprawling modern McMansion too large for its allotted space, an alien weed running wild in a meticulously cultivated garden. 
 The flashy newcomers, the old guard grumbles, give raucous celebrity parties in their own exclusive, gated enclave; because almost all of the screenings take place south of Canal Street, with many at the 11-screen Regal Cinemas Battery Park Stadium complex, Midtown moviegoers unaccustomed to venturing south of Houston Street must go out of their way to attend. Besides, they whisper, isn't the TriBeCa Film Festival really a business opportunity masquerading as civic boosterism? And doesn't its avowed goal of helping revive the economy of Lower Manhattan after 9/11 smack a little of entrepreneurial piggybacking on a catastrophe? 
 But as it mounts its fourth annual onslaught on Lower Manhattan (through May 1), the TriBeCa Film Festival is flexing more artistic muscle than ever before. Casual moviegoers may notice only the icing on the cake: the festival's figurehead and prime mover, Robert De Niro, popping up everywhere to promote it, and the heavy-duty glamour of its opening film, ''The Interpreter.'' 
 But below the slick, star-crusted glaze is a rich, serious cake. The festival's size alone is intimidating: 250 films, including 158 features from 45 countries; divided into 11 categories that include 4 competitions. 
 The lineup for the two most important contests, for best narrative feature (17 entries) and best documentary feature (another 17), may have a long way to go to challenge the supremacy of the Cannes International Film Festival, which begins next month and siphons off the creme de la creme of world cinema. But give the TriBeCa Film Festival some time. In a few years, it could give that old French circus by the Mediterranean a run for its money. That would be good for movies, good for New York and maybe even good for Cannes. 
 A leading contender for best narrative feature this year at TriBeCa, ''The Beat My Heart Skipped,'' is the French director Jacques Audiard's thrilling remake of James Toback's 1978 cult classic ''Fingers.'' The movie features a star-making performance by Romain Duris as a young Parisian thug and shady real estate operator who aspires to be a concert pianist. Mr. Duris has the sinewy charisma of the young Jean-Paul Belmondo or Alain Delon. As it follows his tug-of-war between two ways of life, one brutal, the other refined, the movie stirs up a delicious mixture of Alfred Hitchcock-style suspense, hard-boiled action and exquisite musical reflection. 
 A worthy contender for best documentary feature, Jeff Zimbalist's inspiring film ''Favela Rising,'' examines the murderous lifestyle of teenage drug dealers in the slums of Rio de Janeiro and finds hope in the flowering of the Afro-reggae movement, which redirects the energies of gangsters into dance, theater and percussion-driven reggae bands. 
 The less important feature competitions -- one narrative, one documentary -- are devoted to the promotion of local films and filmmakers dealing with New York subjects; there is plenty of raw talent to be evaluated. 
 The competitions are augmented by four catchall categories, each with its own character. Spotlight offers what it calls ''groundbreaking films by new stars and master directors.'' Special Screenings presents ''high-profile films showing in their New York premieres.'' Wide Angle focuses on ''North American premieres of outstanding films by up-and-coming directors'' and Showcase concentrates on ''outstanding features and documentaries from around the world.'' These categories sometimes overlap.
 The Spotlight films, led by ''2046,'' the hotly anticipated futuristic romance by the Hong Kong filmmaker and critical darling Wong Kar-Wai, are especially tantalizing. Other promising Spotlight titles include ''Asylum,'' a dark, psychological thriller with a distinguished cast (Natasha Richardson and Sir Ian McKellen) and screenwriting credit (Patrick Marber of ''Closer''); and ''The Last Mitterrand,'' the French director Robert Guediguian's portrait of the late French president, portrayed with towering authority by Michel Bouquet.
 Special Screenings is presenting ''9 Songs,'' Michael Winterbottom's erotically charged mixture of explicit sex and rock 'n' roll; and Gregg Araki's ''Mysterious Skin,'' a drama about Kansas teenagers dealing with their molestation by a Little League coach. For intellectual puzzle-solvers, there is Peter Greenaway's 3-part, 6-hour-plus epic, ''The Tulse Luper Suitcases.'' 
 The final three categories include Midnight (''cutting-edge features and documentaries for nocturnal cinephiles''); Restored and Recovered (''restored classics, reconstructions, and new looks at familiar and unsung classics''), whose co-curator is Martin Scorsese; and the children-oriented TriBeCa Family Festival, which includes an all-day street fair on April 30.
 Faced with such abundance, what is one poor critic to do? Following various recommendations, I sampled films from several categories, attended advance screenings, watched DVD's and videocassettes, and focused on the narrative feature competition, whose winning film last year was the excellent Chinese film ''The Green Hat,'' which never found an American distributor. 
 One formidable entry in this year's narrative feature sweepstakes, Ilya Khrzhanovsky's surreal nightmare, ''4,'' is a phantasmagoric vision of a ruined Russia scarred by heavy industry and poverty. The movie presents a world of hideous deformity, of cloned piglets, wild dogs and a village of cackling toothless crones making dolls out of bread they chew with a ravenous zest. Food has never looked more repellent in a film. The stark surreal images evoke a mixture of terror and absurdity that comes as close to the experience of an actual nightmare as anything I've seen on the screen. 
 ''I Am a Sex Addict,'' Caveh Zahedi's autobiographical monologue about his own addiction to prostitutes, also flirts with the bizarre, but with a wry sense of humor, as Mr. Zahedi remembers his carnal adventures in stylized re-enactments. Mr. Zahedi, an unattractive creature who resembles a human bug, counters his own creepy narcissism with a deadpan sense of humor that wins you over. This confessional film illustrates the Freudian notion that the brain is really the principal sex organ. 
 In Duncan Tucker's ''Transamerica,'' the ''Desperate Housewives'' star Felicity Huffman plays a pre-operative, male-to-female transsexual posing as an evangelical Christian, who travels from New York to Phoenix with her son without informing him of her identity. Ms. Huffman's portrait of an emerging transgender still insecure in her body is a sensitive, convincing portrait of someone in the throes of change who has yet to settle comfortably into a new self. 
 Worthy films with Middle Eastern settings include ''Ushpizin,'' an Israeli marital drama set in the ultra-Orthodox community; ''Gilaneh,'' a bleak Iranian drama set in Tehran and spanning 15 years and two wars; and the sweet Turkish film ''Boats Out of Watermelon Rinds,'' about two movie-struck boys in a Turkish village in the 1960's. Alicia Scherson's sophisticated film ''Play'' creates a social tapestry of Santiago, Chile, through a collision of oddball characters. 
 Among the documentaries, the harrowing ''Devil's Miner'' examines the perilous life of a 14-year-old boy who risks his health working for slave wages in a Bolivian silver mine. In the touching ''From Two Men and a War,'' Robert Drew, the cinema-verite pioneer, recalls his experiences as a World War II fighter pilot and his meetings with the legendary war correspondent Ernie Pyle. 
 One of the loveliest movies in the Showcase series, ''Touch the Sound,'' is a portrait of the deaf Scottish percussionist Evelyn Glennie, an extremely articulate world-class musician and teacher, whose analysis of the relationship of sound to vibrations felt in the body overturns conventional notions of human hearing. 
 Mentioning these few films while leaving out so many others unexamined gives me pause. To browse the festival program is to find oneself longing to get lost in movies for a month or two. The sheer quantity of artistically ambitious work offered by the TriBeCa program is something that no other New York film festival or institutional series can begin to match. The masterpieces may be few and far between, snatched up by others. But the abundance of satisfying alternatives to Hollywood studio product from everywhere is encouraging. In the case of the TriBeCa Film Festival, more is more.

HEADLINE: Sizzle, Yes, But Beef, Too

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
New York Times columnists are not allowed to endorse U.S. presidential candidates. Only the editorial page does that. But in checking the columnist rule book, I couldn't find any ban on endorsing a candidate for prime minister of Britain. So I'm officially rooting for Tony Blair. 
 I've never met Mr. Blair. But reading the British press, it strikes me that he's not much loved by Fleet Street. He's not much loved by the left wing of his own Labor Party either, and he certainly doesn't have any supporters on the Conservative benches. Yet he seems to be heading for re-election to a third term on May 5. 
 Indeed, I believe that history will rank Mr. Blair as one of the most important British prime ministers ever -- both for what he has accomplished at home and for what he has dared to do abroad. There is much the U.S. Democratic Party could learn from Mr. Blair.
 First, you don't have to be a conservative to be a conviction politician. For years Mr. Blair was derided by the press as ''Tony Blur'' -- a man of no fixed principles, all sizzle and no beef, who dressed up the Labor Party as ''New Labor,'' like putting lipstick on a pig, but never really made the hard choices or changes. The reality is quite different.
 In deciding to throw in Britain's lot with President Bush on the Iraq war, Mr. Blair not only defied the overwhelming antiwar sentiment of his own party, but public opinion in Britain generally. ''Blair risked complete self-immolation on a principle,'' noted Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a pro-Democratic U.S. think tank. 
 Remember, in the darkest hours of the Iraq drama, when things were looking disastrous (and there have been many such hours), Mr. Bush could always count on the embrace of his own party and the U.S. conservative media machine and think tanks.
 Tony Blair, by contrast, dined alone. He had no real support group to fall back on. I'm not even sure his wife supported him on the Iraq war. (I know the feeling!) Nevertheless, Mr. Blair took a principled position to depose Saddam and keep Britain tightly aligned with America. He did so, among other reasons, because he believed that the advance of freedom and the defeat of fascism -- whether Islamo-fascism or Nazi fascism -- were quintessential and indispensable ''liberal'' foreign policy goals.
 The other very real thing Mr. Blair has done is to get the Labor Party in Britain to firmly embrace the free market and globalization -- sometimes kicking and screaming. He has reconfigured Labor politics around a set of policies designed to get the most out of globalization and privatization for British workers, while cushioning the harshest side effects, rather than trying to hold onto bankrupt Socialist ideas or wallowing in the knee-jerk antiglobalism of the reactionary left.
 The strong British economy that Mr. Blair and his deft finance minister, Gordon Brown, have engineered has led to spending on health and education -- as well as on transportation and law and order -- that has increased ''much faster than under the Conservatives,'' The Financial Times noted on Wednesday. ''The result has been numerous new and refurbished schools, dozens of new hospitals, tens of thousands of extra staff and much new equipment.'' 
 And these improvements, which still have a way to go, have all been accomplished so far with few tax increases. The vibrant British economy and welfare-to-work programs have, in turn, resulted in the lowest unemployment in Britain in 30 years. This has led to higher tax receipts and helped the government pay down its national debt. This, in turn, has saved money on both interest and welfare benefits -- money that has been plowed back into services, The Financial Times explained.
 In sum, Tony Blair has redefined British liberalism. He has made liberalism about embracing, managing and cushioning globalization, about embracing and expanding freedom -- through muscular diplomacy where possible and force where necessary -- and about embracing fiscal discipline.
 Along the way, he has deftly eviscerated the Conservatives, leaving them with only their most fringe policies -- another reason American Democrats could learn a lot from him. Their own ambivalence toward globalization and the new New Deal our country needs to make more Americans educated and employable in a world without walls, and their own ambivalence toward muscular diplomacy, cost Democrats just enough votes in the American center to allow a mistake-prone Bush team to squeak by in 2004. So if Mr. Blair does win in the U.K., I sure hope that Democrats in the U.S. are taking notes.

HEADLINE: Private Accounts, Public Accountability

BYLINE: By Martin Mayer. 
Martin Mayer, the author of ''The Fed,'' is a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution.

 BODY:
SO few specifics of President Bush's Social Security proposal have been made public that it is difficult to say which will make trouble. But one person who should be seriously concerned about the details is Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve.
 According to many reports, the Bush plan would require retirees who have chosen ''personal accounts'' to use most or all of the money in those accounts to purchase annuities to supplement the payments that will remain after the government recalculates their Social Security benefits. How large an annuity that retirees can buy -- and thus what standard of living they may expect -- will be determined largely by interest rates set by the Federal Reserve. That's a lot of power to concentrate in one conference room on Constitution Avenue. 
 A simple annuity provides its purchaser with a certain amount of money every month for the rest of his or her life. The Bush annuities would have to be more complicated and expensive, because their payouts would have to rise with both the cost of living and the poverty threshold.
 Apart from the inflation question, however, there is an even more complex issue: the percentage of a retiree's personal account that would go toward buying the annuity. That percentage could fluctuate substantially over the year, so someone who retires in April could wind up with significantly higher or lower income from someone with the same portfolio who did not retire until October. 
 This difference would, in part, be a matter of routine fluctuations in the value of the stocks and bonds in the personal account -- it is not unusual for the market to rise or fall 10 percent over six months. The value of any personal account will depend on the prices in the market on the day the annuity is purchased. If someone retires when the market is up, the personal account will be larger and the cost of the annuity will take a lesser share of it; if he retires when the market is down, the annuity will absorb a larger part of his account.
 Even more significant, because each annuity locks in today's interest rate for what would be an average of 15 or more years, any differences in interest rates between April and October would considerably influence the price of the annuity that must be purchased. The higher the interest rate, the cheaper the price of an annuity that yields a certain income; the lower the interest rate, the more expensive the same annuity will have to be.
 The Federal Open Market Committee meets eight times a year to set short-term interest rates. As the baby boomers age, several hundred thousand more Americans will retire between these meetings, just about all of them required under the president's plan to purchase annuities to supplement their reduced Social Security payments. (If there were no legal requirement to purchase annuities, many economists, analysts and just plain wastrels would maximize their return by spending their personal accounts as soon as they have access to the money -- knowing that when it ran out, they would receive money from a government embarrassed by the sight of so many old folks shuffling into soup kitchens. The minimum annuity contemplated in the Bush program is one that pays enough to bring the retiree's reduced Social Security income to the poverty line.)
 Voting on interest rates in a world of private accounts, then, the Federal Reserve governors and bank presidents will know -- and if they forget, the AARP will remind them -- that they are voting to alter the future income of many Americans close to retirement. As Mr. Greenspan must recognize, this is a burden the Fed does not need.
 Most people concerned about the security of their pensions in a world of personal accounts worry that the money would be invested in an Enron. As advertised, diversification would take care of most of that problem. But you can't diversify time. If President Bush's proposal had been in effect for the last 30 years, an American retiring in the spring of 2000 -- having earned an average income and built an average personal account in index funds -- would retain a personal account at least a third larger than the personal account of his younger brother, who had the same income and the same investments but retired in the spring of 2003.
 And this difference would have resulted not from anybody's working harder or investing more intelligently or more fortunately. It would stem simply from the accident of having been born a couple of years later.
 Over the years, central banks have learned to cope with irrational and arbitrary government policies. This one may be a step too far. Alan Greenspan should weigh in on the debate.

HEADLINE: U.N. Monitor of Afghan Rights Accuses U.S. on Detentions

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, April 22 

 BODY:
A United Nations human rights monitor has accused American military forces and contractors in Afghanistan of acting above the law ''by engaging in arbitrary arrests and detentions and committing abusive practices, including torture.'' In a report released Thursday, the Afghan police and security forces were also criticized for similar actions. 
 Cherif Bassiouni, an Egyptian who was appointed as an independent human rights monitor for Afghanistan by Secretary General Kofi Annan in April 2004, called for American troops to set an example for Afghan forces by showing accountability for actions toward prisoners. In particular, he raised concern about the cases of eight prisoners who died while in American custody in Afghanistan, and said the cases should be immediately investigated. 
 Only two American soldiers, Pfc. Willie V. Brand and Sgt. James P. Boland, are known to have faced military tribunals in the deaths of Afghan prisoners, in a case in which two Afghans were abused until they died in December 2002 at Bagram Air Base. Neither case has been publicly decided. A contract interrogator for the C.I.A., David A. Passaro, is to go to trial in May in the beating of an Afghan prisoner in June 2003. 
 Mr. Bassiouni's report covered all aspects of human rights violations in Afghanistan, detailing concerns about inequities against women, abduction and trafficking of children, illegal seizure of property, lack of due process and social and economic abuses against minorities, displaced people, the poor and the disabled. There has been some progress, he said, specifically in the democratic process and reconstruction. 
 But he found ''pressing human issues'' stemming from the actions of factional warlords, Afghan police and security forces, and American-led alliance forces and private security contractors. He said he had communicated his concerns to American and Afghan government officials.
 During two visits to Afghanistan over the last year, he said, he received reports of ''serious violations by coalition forces'' from Afghans who said they had been victimized and from human rights and nongovernmental organizations. About 18,000 foreign troops are in Afghanistan, including 17,000 Americans, though only American troops run military detention centers there.
 The reported violations included arrest and detentions of nationals and foreigners without legal authority or judicial review, and a list of abusive acts on detainees from forced nudity, hooding and sensory deprivation, to ''sexual abuse, beatings, torture and use of force resulting in death.'' 
 Detention conditions were reported as below human rights standards set by the Geneva Conventions and the United Nations, he said, although he was not allowed access to the facilities. He called for human rights organizations and the United Nations to be allowed access to detention facilities run by the United States.

HEADLINE: In New Laws, Big Step in Journey to Cleaner City Fleet

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA; Kareem Fahim contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
With its congested streets, elusive parking and hard-core residents who are proud that they never get behind the wheel, New York has never been as sympathetic to automotive culture as car-crazy cities like Los Angeles or Detroit. 
 But even a city whose most resonant connection to the automobile may be the boxy Checker cab sometimes gets the urge to pop the hood and savor exotic new technology. 
 In the last decade and a half, New York has assembled what environmentalists say is one of the largest collections of alternative-fuel vehicles in the country, cars and trucks that run on ethanol, methanol, natural gas and other sources, sometimes in weird combinations. 
 New York is now embarking on an even more far-reaching effort that will radically change the looks, sounds and tailpipe emissions of a large portion of the vehicles in the city's fleet of cars, vans and light trucks. Environmentalists hope the new effort will be more effective than the last one at cleaning the air and finding viable alternatives to old gas guzzlers that top officials have stubbornly held onto. 
 ''New York City has certainly provided a living laboratory of what works and what doesn't work in terms of alternative fuels,'' said Richard Kassel, a senior lawyer and director of the Clean Vehicles Project at the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York. ''It was a program that started with good intentions, but outlived its usefulness.''
 A local law passed in 1991 mandated that 80 percent of the new cars and light trucks that the city buys each year be able to run on alternative fuels. Officials say the city has met that threshold every year, producing a collection of 3,300 alternative-fuel vehicles, most of them turning out to have been better ideas on paper than on the streets of New York. 
 The alternative-fuel vehicles, about 40 percent of the 7,800 light-duty vehicles in the city's fleet, are scattered across the city and may not be easy to distinguish, except by their shortcomings. They include:
 $(6$)1,160 cars built to use both regular gasoline and compressed natural gas, which is far cleaner and has the advantage of being produced in North America, thereby lessening the city's dependence on foreign oil. However, with only 11 private or municipal filling stations in the city dispensing natural gas, the bifuel vehicles have been running almost exclusively on gasoline.
 $(6$)612 Ford Tauruses that run solely on ethanol. Their tanks can be filled only at the six Department of Sanitation depots equipped with special ethanol pumps. Drivers assigned to use these cars must know where those depots are, and never stray too far from them, which limits the vehicles' usefulness. And environmentalists say ethanol cars are not noticeably cleaner than those that run on gasoline.
 $(6$)175 dedicated compressed natural gas vehicles. Most are altered gasoline-powered cars. The gas tanks were removed by after-market shops and natural gas tanks were placed in their trunks, filling the space and making the cars somewhat unstable. The cars have not functioned anywhere near as well as expected. 
 The alternative-fuel fleet also includes 123 vehicles that were supposed to run on methanol but never did because the city never purchased the fuel, and 347 all-electric carts that can reach a top speed of 35 miles per hour but cannot be used on city streets. The most recent additions, 882 new hybrid electric-gasoline powered cars, are the lone bright spot in the city's effort so far. They can get up to 45 miles per gallon in the city on unleaded gasoline and have very low emissions. 
 Since 1991 the city has also kept buying old-technology cars, and the City Hall parking lot is often filled with big black Ford Crown Victorias and Mercury Grand Marquis, which average about 18 miles per gallon in the city. But that is expected to change under the new law passed this week that requires the city to buy only the cleanest and most fuel-efficient cars available. 
 ''The era of the big boxy Crown Vics will come to an end and be replaced by a wide range of clean and fuel-efficient hybrids in every size and shape,'' Mr. Kassel said. 
 Except for the new hybrids -- mostly the Toyota Prius, but a few new models are expected to arrive soon -- the city has been disappointed with the performance of the alternative vehicles. But officials do not consider the effort a failure. 
 ''That was a landmark bill that really paved the way for alternative-fuel bills around the country,'' said City Councilman James F. Gennaro, chairman of the Environmental Protection Committee and a sponsor of the clean-car technology bills approved by the Council this week. In 1991 he was a Council analyst who helped draft the alternative-fuel vehicle law. 
 ''Back then, technology was kind of a surrogate for emissions,'' Mr. Gennaro said. He conceded that the alternative-fuel technology was primitive, and that some of the efforts had fizzled. 
 The new law, which Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has said he will sign, continues the 80 percent goal for one more year, but the fast-growing new generation of hybrid cars will be included in the mix of alternative-fuel vehicles, even though they run on unleaded gasoline. 
 In 2006, the alternative-fuel requirement will be eliminated completely. Instead, the city will have to ensure that 95 percent of the cars, light trucks and small vans it purchases each year follow California's tough emissions standards and be very fuel efficient. The city will have to increase the overall fuel efficiency of its fleet by 20 percent within a decade, and the savings in gasoline are expected to offset any additional cost for the new vehicles over conventional cars. 
 ''We have to make sure we do something about the atmosphere and the air that we breathe,'' Mr. Bloomberg said of the new laws. ''You're not going to -- overnight -- change the world, but if we change the city's uses, and the city has a lot of vehicles, we can go a long way toward impacting the quality of the air.'' 
 Under the new laws, as cars in the current fleet age, their replacements must be as clean and as fuel efficient as possible. ''That includes all of the cars used by commissioners and public officials,'' said Mr. Gennaro, who, like other council members except for the speaker, is not assigned a city-owned car. 
 The only cars exempt from the new rules would be those used for emergency response and for the mayor. The Council speaker, Gifford Miller, who was a principal sponsor of the new car bill, is assigned a large Chevrolet Suburban. But he has directed the Council to purchase only cars that meet the new standards when it replaces any vehicles, including his. 
 Martha K. Hirst, commissioner of the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, the agency that buys the city's cars, said the new law excluded up to 5 percent of annual car purchases to give the city a little bargaining room. She said she was concerned that there might not be enough models available to meet the city's needs and budget requirements. 
 But as hybrids become more plentiful, it may be easier to get officials out of their big cars. Ms. Hirst is eagerly awaiting her new Honda Accord hybrid, one of the first in the city, which will replace her 2001 Buick LeSabre. And other officials, too, seem willing to make the switch. 
 ''I'd trade my Explorer in a minute for a Toyota Highlander Hybrid,'' said Marty Markowitz, the Brooklyn borough president, ''if the city approved it.''

HEADLINE: Oil's Lesser Role In U.S. Economy Limits Damage From High Prices

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
Not long ago, the notion that crude oil prices would ever reach $50 a barrel, much less surpass that, was a distant prospect. Some economists darkly predicted that sky-high oil prices would send the American economy into a recession, drive companies out of business and bring back both inflation and angry fuel lines. 
 Investors seem to have turned to this idea lately, reflecting a general uncertainty over the course of the economy. On Wednesday, they pushed stocks to their lowest point since October, in part because of worries that higher energy costs would crimp corporate earnings and stoke inflation.
 But even as prices cling above $50 a barrel, those fears have proved to be exaggerated. So far, the economy has weathered the price increase with remarkable ease and there is reason to believe that high fuel costs do not have quite the impact they once did. 
 The reason is that oil has been knocked off center stage in the American economy. The decline in manufacturing and the rise in service-oriented jobs means oil is not as indispensable for economic growth. Manufacturers and electricity-generating plants, once among the biggest users of oil, now depend primarily on natural gas, coal and, to a lesser extent, nuclear power.
 While the United States does consume more oil today, most of it is for transportation. And even as gasoline prices hover at record levels, the cost, adjusted for inflation, is still well below the peak reached in the early 1980's. Even more important, fuel takes up a smaller share of Americans' income. 
 This is not to say that the higher gasoline prices are not starting to pinch -- or that they will not send the economy for a loop if they go up sharply from these levels. With retail prices expected to reach a nationwide average of $2.35 a gallon this summer as travelers crowd the highways for vacations, the high costs could become more of a burden.
 Higher fuel prices have started to hurt slightly by curbing spending elsewhere. Retail sales rose only 0.3 percent, to $339 billion, in March, slower than February's 0.5 percent gain and less than analysts expected. In another tell-tale sign, consumer confidence declined for a second month in March. 
 The biggest concern was a fear of rising inflation, which resurfaced this week after the government reported that the Consumer Price Index rose 0.6 percent in March, the largest increase in five months. The core rate, which excludes food and energy, had its biggest monthly increase in nearly four years.
 But today's economy is more efficient than the one of three decades ago. In the early 1980's, households spent an average 8 percent of their income on energy bills, mainly gasoline and home heating oil. It took 102 minutes of labor for the average worker to pay for gasoline for a 100-mile trip back then, and energy costs accounted for 14 percent of the American economy.
 Today, thanks to energy-saving measures set off by the oil shocks of the 1970's and 1980's, most of these numbers have been cut in half, according to David Wyss, the chief economist at Standard & Poor's. Households now spend about 5 percent of their income on their energy bills. It takes 42 minutes of work to pay for a 100-mile trip, and energy costs account for 7 percent of the American economy.
 It also takes 55 percent less oil and gas to produce the same amount of gross domestic product today, compared with 1973 even as Americans' income, on average, has doubled.
 ''Americans seem to be able to bull their way through everything,'' Mr. Wyss said.
 In the fourth quarter of last year, when oil spiked above $55 a barrel for the first time, the economy still expanded 3.8 percent and personal spending rose 4.2 percent. ''No matter how high oil prices go, Americans will always find something to spend their money on,'' Mr. Wyss said.
 Still, every penny's increase in petroleum prices adds $3 billion a year in costs for consumers, which translates into a larger trade deficit, higher costs for some goods and lower real income, according to the American Petroleum Institute. For gasoline alone, every penny increase means more than $1.4 billion in higher costs.
 ''That is money that will not be spent on other goods and services,'' said John Felmy, the institute's chief economist.
 Oil prices, which averaged about $20 a barrel throughout the 1990's, started to rise significantly at the beginning of 2003. They reached a high of $58.20 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange on April 4 and traded at $55.39 on Friday. 
 Some economists argue that since the increase has happened over a longer period of time -- unlike previous oil shocks, when prices spiked in a matter of weeks -- the economy has been able to absorb it without spinning into a recession. 
 ''The increase has proceeded at a relatively gradual pace,'' said James D. Hamilton, a professor of economics at the University of California, San Diego, ''a pace at which the economy has had time to adapt; a pace that hasn't panicked consumers or firms; a pace different from earlier periods when increases came much more suddenly.''
 High energy costs have also had a lesser effect because they have not led to a widespread inflationary spiral that caused the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates sharply, according to Kenneth Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard, who was the chief economist at the International Monetary Fund from 2001 to 2003.
 ''Oil spikes and interest rate spikes used to come hand in hand and that led to recessions,'' Mr. Rogoff said. ''These days, long-term inflation expectations are much better anchored than they used to be 10 or 15 years ago. When people see a spike in oil prices, they don't immediately infer that we'll see double-digit inflation.''
 So how high must prices go before consumers feel the effects and the economy starts hurting?
 ''I don't know that there is a cliff to walk off from,'' Mr. Wyss of Standard & Poor's said. ''It's more like a slippery slope. It would probably take a doubling of oil prices to get us to the same situation as 1981.''
 (In any case, taking inflation into account, prices would have to reach $80 a barrel to match the record of March 1981. Using a similar measure, gasoline would have to rise to $3.12 a gallon to match its 1981 peak.)
 Many economists say there is typically a lag before the full effects of an oil shock are felt. Stephen Brown, the director of energy economics for the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, estimates that higher energy costs could cut growth from 2004 through 2006 as much as 1.6 percentage points below where it otherwise might have been. 
 ''We're not that far down the road yet,'' Mr. Brown said. ''Some of the impact on the economy is yet to come.''
 So far, Mr. Brown said, businesses have been reluctant to pass higher fuel costs on to consumers. 
 While oil has been flushed out of most industries, no real substitute has been found in transportation. Each day, American drivers burn 11 percent of the world's crude oil in the form of gasoline.
 The highly visible cost of filling up a gas tank could become a political headache for the Bush administration. Unlike the Clinton administration, which released emergency stocks to quell a spike in prices in 2000, the current administration says it would be a mistake to release strategic reserves to bring prices down.
 According to a USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll released April 4, respondents ranked high gas prices below terrorism and health care costs as priorities for the president and Congress. The same poll suggested that about 50 percent of Americans have cut back significantly on the amount of driving they do; more than a third of the respondents said they had reduced their spending significantly because of the higher prices.
 Lesli An Orio, 38, a Web site manager for a bank in Charlotte, N.C., is one of those who has reacted strongly to the price increases. 
 Returning from her honeymoon last April to ever-rising gasoline prices, Mrs. Orio decided to leave her brand-new silver Subaru Outback at home and ride the bus to work. She moved her two young boys to a public school closer to home in January so they would not have to ride 38 miles to their private school in the family's supersize Ford 150 pickup truck. 
 A year later, Mrs. Orio has grown used to her new routine, which saves her about $368 a month in gasoline costs and another $125 in parking fees. (In addition, she said, her 35- to 45-minute commute now permits her to get ahead on her reading; she recently finished James Michener's thousand-plus-page epic ''Hawaii.'')
 ''I will never take my car again,'' Mrs. Orio said in a telephone interview. ''Public transportation in Charlotte is archaic, but I've gotten to enjoy my time on the bus. And the money I save goes to a college fund for the children. I would not have done this if it had not been for high gas prices.''

HEADLINE: Ax in Hand, a Hendrix Sings of Jimi's Legacy

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
Jimi Hendrix's younger brother, Leon Hendrix, says he took up the guitar several years ago after a purple flame shot out of the sky and possessed him in bed, revealing a vision of his brother floating above him.
 ''I could see Jimi up there, beckoning,'' he recalled. ''He was saying, 'Come on, baby brother. It's time. You're ready.' Since then, I feel like he's sanctioned me to carry on his musical legacy.''
 And after a lifetime of living the blues -- including foster homes, drug addiction and other hardships -- Mr. Hendrix, 56, says he finally has a reason to sing them: he was recently cut out of his brother's $80 million estate. 
 His father, Al Hendrix, died in 2002 and left the estate largely to his daughter, Janie Hendrix. In September 2004, Mr. Hendrix lost his legal appeal for a portion of it in Seattle, the family's hometown.
 To avenge the defeat, he says, he took up the guitar, after wasting decades on drugs, alcohol and woman-chasing. He says he summoned his brother's spirit and is now booking club gigs, teaming with the drummer Buddy Miles, who played in Jimi Hendrix's Band of Gypsies. 
 He is also taping the performances for possible use in a television movie he is shopping to producers, and he has completed his second self-produced CD, ''Keeper of the Flame.'' 
 ''Here's how it all started,'' he explained during a recent interview in New York. ''I was laying in bed, and a purple flame came out of the sky and set the whole room buzzing. My whole body started shaking, and I had an old guitar in the corner that some lady traded me for some dope. The flame knocked all the dust off the strings and I just reached over and grabbed it, and ever since I've been playing like a madman possessed.''
 Mr. Hendrix wore stylish glasses and a black cowboy hat over his long, flowing, graying hair. He said that the prospect of being compared to his brother was so daunting that ''it took me 50 years to get the strength to pick up a guitar.''
 ''Sometimes I say, 'Have I lost my mind? How could I dare pick up a guitar after Jimi?''' he said. ''Plus, I always considered it sacrilege.''
 But with the help of steady guitar lessons, he said, he is writing songs by channeling his dead brother's spirit into his lyrics and guitar solos.
 ''Sometimes if I'm playing, I'll ask Jimi to help me,'' he said. ''I'll say, 'What do I do now?' And he tells me, 'Reach for it.'''
 Mr. Hendrix has six children and five grandchildren, but he still looks very much the virile rock star, and in some ways bears an uncanny resemblance to his brother. The sight of his hands cradling and strumming a guitar, his slender fingers adorned with rings, is eerily familiar. Like his brother, he plays the blues on a Fender Stratocaster plugged into stacks of Marshall amplifiers, and during a solo he can grimace and gesticulate like Jimi. (Unlike Jimi, however, he does not play left-handed.)
 But the similarities stop once the music starts. Mr. Hendrix admits that he has none of his brother's technical wizardry, although he adds that he is constantly improving.
 ''When I'm onstage, I see all these people looking at me expecting another Jimi, but I won't play none of his tunes,'' he said. ''Sometimes if I'm having a bad gig, I'll play 'Red House' or 'All Along the Watchtower' to perk the crowd up, but that's it.''
 ''They offered me 20 grand a night to play Vegas, but they want 'Purple Haze' and 'Foxy Lady,''' he said. ''I just can't play that stuff.''
 Jimi Hendrix died in 1970 in London at 27. His estate was awarded to Al Hendrix, who created a will allotting 24 percent to his other son, Leon. Al Hendrix rewrote the will in 1997 to exclude Leon, who received nothing but a souvenir gold record.
 Stating that Janie Hendrix had taken advantage of their ailing father to disinherit him and his family, Mr. Hendrix sued, but in September a Kings County Superior Court judge rejected his claim, noting that his father had cut Mr. Hendrix out of the will largely because of his recurring drug problems and unemployment, and his continual demands for money and threats to sue for it.
 Janie Hendrix, 43, Jimi and Leon's stepsister, whom their father adopted, has formed a multimillion-dollar company called Experience Hendrix. She has called Mr. Hendrix unstable.
 Mr. Hendrix says he was essentially Jimi's only true family. Their mother died when they were both children, and Al Hendrix often left Jimi to care for Leon, who was almost five years younger.
 ''He was my big brother, my best friend, my surrogate dad,'' he said. ''He was in charge of me: fed me, took me to school, taught me sports.'' Mr. Hendrix recalled watching his brother graduate from a one-string ukulele to an old acoustic guitar to a $40 Sears electric guitar. While Jimi never taught Leon guitar, he said, he would fall asleep each night listening to Jimi's incessant practicing and go along to band rehearsals and gigs and, later, on tour.
 And Mr. Hendrix misses few opportunities to capitalize on this brotherly connection. Many of his song titles and lyrics are direct references. He put on ''Keeper of the Flame'' last week in the Greenwich Village apartment of a friend, Mike Quashie, and sang along with the first track, ''Jimi and Me,'' a blues shuffle with a heavy-metal edge.
 ''Gonna tell you a little story, 'bout two brothers born,'' he sang in a rough rumble. ''One would bless the earth with song. The other, be forewarned.''
 ''My mama said, 'Your turn will come,''' he sang. '''Let your brother go before, he'll open up all them doors.'''
 Leaning back on a couch in the apartment, Mr. Hendrix shook his head to the music, and just before the guitar solo kicked in, he sang along with his ad-lib on the recording -- ''Come on, Jimi. Help me, Jimi'' -- and played air guitar, wincing along with his sturdy but simple blues licks.
 ''Oh Jimi, can you hear me?'' he sang. ''I can always hear your name. I can feel your spirit in my song tonight.''
 ''My band and I did odd jobs to get the money together to record this,'' he said later. ''I'm just scraping by. All I got is a guitar and six strings.''
 He was drinking red wine and smoking Merit cigarettes. After smoking one halfway down, he would put the unused butt back in the pack for later. A collector had brought some guitars over and handed several Stratocasters to Mr. Hendrix to try. Mr. Hendrix plucked one and said, ''I hate when people hand me guitars that are out of tune, because I'm tone-deaf.''
 The collector offered to buy a certain blue Stratocaster from Mr. Hendrix, who responded: ''The blue one? It's in the pawn shop right now.'' People began laughing, and Mr. Hendrix said, ''Hey, Jimi did it too.''

PERSON: Dr. Norman D. Newell

HEADLINE: Norman Newell, 96, Scientist Who Studied Dying Species

BYLINE: By JEREMY PEARCE

 BODY:
Dr. Norman D. Newell, an influential paleontologist who challenged opponents of evolutionary theory and helped shape theories explaining the mass extinctions of species, died on Monday at his home in Leonia, N.J., his family said. He was 96. 
 In a wide-ranging career that included scholarship, fieldwork and popular writing, he taught at Columbia and spent four decades as a curator of invertebrates at the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan. 
 Dr. Newell pursued his interests in the evolution of living and fossil bivalve mollusks, the formation and ecology of coral reefs and the geological history of the Peruvian Andes. His work on mass extinctions began in the 1950's, when he began to look at the disappearance of certain clams and other mollusks from the fossil record in Texas.
 He compared clams to other marine invertebrates in the Upper Paleozoic and Early Mesozoic periods -- about 245 million years ago -- and eventually concluded that the extinctions were a result of changes in sea levels and a fatal retreat of warm and shallow seas. Although other scientists had been aware of the marine extinctions, Dr. Newell was an early and dedicated investigator of their causes and the conditions surrounding them.
 Dr. Niles Eldredge, a curator in the division of paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan, and Dr. Stephen Jay Gould, the essayist and Harvard paleontologist who died in 2002, were students of Dr. Newell's at Columbia. In the 1970's, they developed the theory of punctuated equilibrium in evolution, which is the notion that transitions in species take place periodically, during intense periods of activity and not necessarily as part of a steady and gradual process.
 Dr. Eldredge said yesterday that Dr. Newell became ''a voice crying in the wilderness'' in explaining the evolutionary importance of mass extinctions ''at a time when no one else in the field was talking about them.''
 ''Now, increasingly in evolutionary thinking,'' he added, ''we recognize that extinction triggers what happens with the history of life, and is part and parcel with the evolution of life.'' In 1947, Dr. Newell led an expedition to the Peruvian Andes, near a region that he had previously helped to map, to collect marine fossils from elevations above 10,000 feet.
 In 1952, he led a group of scientists from the Museum of Natural History to study South Pacific atolls that were formed by coral reefs. The group landed on the atoll of Raroia, where Dr. Newell examined the ecology and sedimentation of reef systems.
 In later studies of coral reefs in the Bahamas in the 1960's, Dr. Newell brought ''the study of fossils into the realm of ecology and managed to reconstruct what they were like in living communities,'' Dr. John Imbrie, emeritus professor of paleo-oceanography at Brown University, said yesterday.
 Later in his career, Dr. Newell contributed to the public debate pitting theories of creationism against evolution. His 1982 book ''Creation and Evolution: Myth or Reality?'' was intended for a popular audience and became ''a ringing defense of Darwinian evolution that makes it very clear that nobody in science disagrees that man has evolved,'' Dr. Eldredge said.
 Dr. Newell continued to study extinction and proposed that the earth in the late 20th century was experiencing ''one of the greatest of all mass extinctions.'' He attributed the losses of hundreds of species to ecological disturbances caused by humans. Indeed, a 1987 paper written by Dr. Newell and a museum colleague, Dr. Leslie Marcus, found a nearly direct correlation between an increase in world population and increasing amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
 The paper was published in Palaios, a journal of the Society of Economic Paleontologists and Mineralogists, and found that emissions of carbon dioxide were ''almost wholly dependent on human activities with only very minor contributions from natural causes.''
 Norman Dennis Newell was born in Chicago. He received his bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Kansas and a doctorate in geology from Yale.
 He taught at the University of Wisconsin before 1945, when he joined the Museum of Natural History, where he remained for the rest of his career. He was named a curator emeritus in 1977.
 Dr. Newell was president of the Society for the Study of Evolution in 1949. He was elected president of the Paleontological Society in 1960 and 1961. In 1978 he was awarded the American Museum of Natural History's Gold Medal for Achievement in Science.
 He is survived by his wife, the former Gillian Wormall.

HEADLINE: The New Nursing Home, Emphasis on Home

BYLINE: By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON

DATELINE: TUPELO, Miss. 

 BODY:
At the Cedars Health Center, a traditional 140-bed nursing home here, meals are delivered on trays, hospital style. Hallways floored with linoleum extend in every direction. The smell is sterile and sour. 
 Cynthia Dunn, 82, lived there until she moved into a Green House, two streets away. Ms. Dunn's new home, a carpeted ranch-style house that she shares with nine others, has a communal dining table and an open kitchen. Emergency call lights are disguised by decorative stencils. The two staff members who care for the residents answer beepers, not bells, to reduce the institutional cacophony. On a recent visit, the smell at the door was of corn bread baking.
 Ms. Dunn, who has her own bedroom and bath at the Green House, pulled herself up in her wheelchair without invitation and expressed her opinion on where she lived. ''This is the most wonderful place I've been to yet,'' she said. ''The people, the food, everything.'' 
 The Green House Project, comprising 10 new suburban houses here, is an experiment in reinventing the nursing home. Its creators hope it will herald a new age for old age, although its advantages to residents are yet unproved in health care studies.
 Green Houses are part of a broadening movement to humanize care for elderly people with smaller, more domestic settings and a closer sense of community among residents and staff members. And they are an effort to address the fears of being institutionalized, among them anxieties about the loss of independence and the potential for abuse.
 ''I had been searching for some answers as to why it is that people say a short little prayer before they go into a nursing home,'' said Stephen L. McAlilly, president and chief executive of Mississippi Methodist Senior Services Inc., a nonprofit organization that runs the Green House program in Tupelo as well as the Cedars center, which it is meant to replace. ''People think they go to nursing homes to die.''
 Nursing care professionals, specialists on aging and advocates for the elderly call such experiments a culture change in the industry. People 85 and older are the fastest-growing segment of the population and will continue to be so over the next 30 years, the Census Bureau predicts. 
 As the nation ages, nursing homes are aging, too. Some 16,080 nursing homes house 1.6 million people, and many of the homes are outdated, built in the 1960's, when Medicaid was introduced. Proponents for change say that ''deinstitutionalized'' models like the Green Houses might help the industry compete with popular alternatives like assisted living, which offers a limited amount of nursing, and home health care. But critics say potentially higher costs of operation could keep them from being widely available and impede their ability to win support from state and federal government.
 The industry's occupancy rate has fallen to 85 percent, from nearly 100 percent 15 years ago, said Joseph Angelelli, an assistant professor of health policy and administration at Pennsylvania State University. ''The existing population in nursing homes lived through the Depression,'' Mr. Angelelli said. ''Their whole mind-set as consumers is much less demanding. The next generation is used to getting what they want.''
 The Green House Project has financial commitments for 20 more programs in 15 states, including an apartment-based version on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. At the Tupelo homes, Medicaid pays $126 per patient per day. Although no government figure is available, the American Health Care Association, a trade group representing 10,600 long-term care centers, estimates that nationally the daily rate is approximately $160, an average that includes Medicaid, Medicare and private payment. That would be about $58,000 annually.
 The nation's largest operators of commercial nursing homes are recognizing that kinder, gentler models could have a crucial sales advantage with the next big wave of potential customers: baby boomers. 
 Beverly Enterprises has 351 institutional-style homes and is renovating 39 of them, breaking large units of 100 beds into ''neighborhoods'' of 24, with a smaller, retrained staff dedicated to each group. 
 But environmental changes cannot be equated automatically with improvement in the quality of life. ''The degree of success is not uniform,'' said Leslie Grant, director of the Center for Aging Services Management at the University of Minnesota, who is evaluating the progress in 10 renovated Beverly homes. 
 Beverly has had legal problems. In 2002, it pleaded no contest to felony charges of abusing residents in California and agreed to pay $2.6 million. In 2000, it settled federal charges of defrauding Medicare with a $175 million payment. But those problems have not inspired its new efforts, said Patrice Acosta, senior vice president for quality of life services. ''The public is ready for an alternative,'' Ms. Acosta said of the changes in nursing-home culture.
 In Tupelo, the first four Green Houses, completed two years ago, were built with $3.4 million in private donations. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in Princeton, N.J., a health care philanthropy, financed the program and the training of staff members. In each house, two nurses' aides, also trained in household management, are on duty at all times. A nurse is on site, responsible for the four houses, which are on the same street in a retirement area. The organizers would eventually like to see Green Houses incorporated into the development of residential neighborhoods and not segregated in retirement communities. 
 More than a humane experiment, the Green Houses claim to be economically viable. The office staff is smaller, so costs are no greater than at Cedars, said Alan Brown, the chief operating officer for Mississippi Methodist Senior Services. 
 To help them feel that the Green House is their home, residents are encouraged to help with cooking or housekeeping.
 The project's conceivers, Dr. William H. Thomas and his wife, Jude Meyers Thomas, both 45, are children of the 1960's. They live in upstate New York on a working farm powered by solar and wind energy and draft horses. Before developing the Green House concept, Dr. Thomas, a Harvard-trained gerontologist, created the Eden Alternative to help large nursing homes address what he considered the core of despair for residents and staff members: loneliness, helplessness and boredom.
 Solutions included the provision of companion animals and plants to tend; the democratization of decision-making among staff members, with residents' representation; and the removal of standard clinical features like nurses' stations. Dr. Thomas, who has called himself a nursing home ''abolitionist,'' now maintains that the future is in a completely new model.
 Jude Rabig, the national director of the Green House Project, said that among the 40 patients living in the Green Houses in Tupelo, 25 percent had gained weight, an indication of general good health. Ms. Rabig also said the staff turnover was less than 10 percent a year, ''in an industry that has a national average of 80 or 90 percent.''
 Deinstitutionalizing a traditional nursing home can cost more than building a new center. Beverly Enterprises said it could average $500,000 to $1 million to add a living room and retrain the staff.
 Beverly, working with Action Pact, a training program in Milwaukee created by a social worker, is also looking into replacing tray-based meal delivery with dining rooms, an innovation that the Jewish Home and Hospital Lifecare System completed a year ago in 21 nursing units at its center in the Bronx, at a cost of $1million.
 Kenneth Sherman, senior vice president and administrator for the Bronx home, said that 70 percent of his residents gained weight after the introduction of dining rooms with cafeteria-style service, and that fewer residents were depressed.
 The Jewish Home and Hospital is planning an urban Green House project in a building on West 105th Street, where residents would live together in large apartments. 
 The obstacles to ''eldertopia,'' as Dr. Thomas characterizes his goal, include the expenses of rebuilding, the difficulties of clearing regulatory hurdles, the cost of liability insurance and the reluctance of administrators to disband their bureaucracies. And no one knows with any certainty what, if anything, works.
 ''Is it the physical environment?'' asked Dr. Robyn Stone, executive director of the Institute for the Future of Aging Services, a research arm of a long-term care trade organization in Washington. ''Is it the people doing the work? All of this needs to be tested.'' 
 Rosalie A. Kane, a professor in the school of public health at the University of Minnesota, who is comparing the quality of life for residents and staff members in the Green House pilot with those in the Cedars center, said the Green House appeared ''superior.'' She has looked at a wide variety of measures, including infection rates, prevalence of bedsores and the frequency of family visits.
 But the undisputed cheer that a homelike setting seems to provide still leaves the fact that old age is old age, and the question of whether, for residents who suffer varying degrees of disability and dementia, anything more than dignity can be restored to life. Residents of the Green Houses were not marooned in hallways in wheelchairs, as they were at Cedars, as if on an amusement ride that had lost power. But they were not the happy family, finding rich reward at the end of life, that the Green House Project hopes to create. 
 There were instead small moments of humanity. At lunch at one of the residences, Martin House, Gwendolen Hall, 93 and nearly blind, folded a paper napkin for Kathleen Berthay, 79, who is blind. And next door at Franks House, Viva Whitenton, 93, sat over coffee as if she were in her own kitchen and let her memories play. 
 Ms. Whitenton talked about her childhood in rural Alabama and her father, a fiddler, who taught her and her four younger brothers to play. He owned the first radio there, she said, and her mother put it in the window by the porch on Saturday nights so neighbors from near and far could set up chairs on the lawn and listen to the Grand Ole Opry broadcast. 
 The present seemed something she maintained a graceful distance from.
 ''Oh, I don't pay attention to where I'm at,'' Ms. Whitenton said later, sitting on her bed, looking forward. ''I have a good day if I'm here.''

HEADLINE: Slower Rise In Expenses May Dampen Rent Increases

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
Costs for landlords of rent-stabilized apartments increased at a slower rate than during the previous two years, according to a study released yesterday by the New York City Rent Guidelines Board, suggesting that overall rents may rise less as well.
 The board uses the information -- along with other studies including one on landlords' net incomes -- to govern rent increases on rent-stabilized apartments.
 Tenant groups expressed cautious optimism yesterday that given the study on landlords' costs, the board would not authorize increases on two-year leases exceeding last year's 6.5 percent, and much less than the 7.5 percent in 2003, which was the biggest since 1989.
 The new study, called the Price Index of Operating Costs, was released on a day when dozens of tenants rallied outside the meeting and accused the board of ratifying, over the last few years, the steepest rent increases since the 1980's. And this being an election year, no one has been more responsible for those increases, according to tenant groups, than the man who appoints the board: Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. 
 The board annually adjusts rents for the city's supply of nearly one million rent-stabilized apartments. And year after year, during public hearings before the board takes a preliminary vote in May, and a final vote in June, landlords say they are not making enough money and tenants say they are paying too much.
 The nine-member board has never authorized a rent decrease or frozen rents. Typically, the board has raised rents a few percentage points in line with inflation and, to a lesser extent, with the price index, which surveys owners' costs of everything from utilities to insurance. But in 2003 the price index rose 16.9 percent, the highest since 1980, due to spiraling costs for fuel, insurance and property taxes. Those factors prompted the board to approve a 7.5 percent increase for two-year leases and 4.5 percent for one-year leases.
 Last year, the price index increased by 6.9 percent. But landlords' net operating income also slipped by 0.1 percent in 2002, the first decrease since 1990. The result was an increase of up to 3.5 percent on one-year leases, and 6.5 percent on two-year leases.
 This year, the board reported that prices had increased by 5.8 percent, with fuel costs surging 20 percent, and insurance by 8.9 percent. 
 Those findings were below what Michael McKee, associate director of Tenants and Neighbors, a statewide advocacy group, had expected, and as such ''gives us a strong argument for a rent freeze,'' especially in light of recent rent increases that tenants say were excessive.
 But Jack Freund, executive vice president of the Rent Stabilization Association, a landlords' group, said that the study understated the increase in property taxes and failed to factor in the costs of the city's new lead-paint law.
 ''It's absurdly low,'' he said.
 Before the meeting, held at the Department of City Planning in Lower Manhattan yesterday, more than 50 people demonstrated outside, chanting slogans and hoisting signs that read ''Mayor Bloomberg, Don't Raise Our Rents.''
 It was the latest demonstration intended to elevate the issue of housing in the mayor's race.
 Sometimes, Mr. Bloomberg is the object of derision; at other times, he is the object of admiration. 
 Earlier this week, some of the people at yesterday's meeting applauded Mr. Bloomberg for helping create a trust fund for low-cost housing with $130 million in surplus funds from the Battery Park City Authority.
 But on May 1 tenant activists plan to demonstrate in front of Mr. Bloomberg's town house on the Upper East Side ''to prevent another round of unjustified rent increases,'' Mr. McKee said. ''Mike Bloomberg ignores tenants at his peril.''

HEADLINE: The Ship That's Sinking the Navy

 BODY:
Given the huge sums the Bush administration has lavished on the military, it is astonishing to learn that the Navy may not be able to buy all the new ships it needs. The Navy has no one to blame but itself, and its appetite for overequipped ships. 
 The most glaring example of that is the DD(X) destroyer program. The DD(X) is a marvel of advanced technology. But its most costly features are not relevant to the battles the Navy is likely to fight, and its outsized price tag of well over $3 billion per ship leaves dangerously little for the aircraft carriers, submarines and fast coastal-combat vessels that will be needed in the years ahead. 
 In the post-9/11 world, the Navy must prepare for combat against terrorists who melt in and out of rivers and harbors and ram explosives-packed boats into sitting warships. This will require more light and cheap craft, suitable for fast pursuit and patrol missions, and fewer megaships, designed for traditional warfare. Earlier designs of the DD(X) might have served these needs, had the Navy not insisted on layers of technology that needlessly added to the ship's weight and cost. 
 On average, the Navy can anticipate no more than about $10 billion a year for all of its shipbuilding needs. Much of that needs to go to renewing vital parts of the current fleet as they age. But that money simply won't be there if the Navy persists in spending $3 billion to $4 billion a year, as now planned, on the DD(X). Navy officials are aware of the problem but have not solved it. The only realistic answer is to jettison the DD(X) for a redesigned, more cost-effective large combat ship.
 Unfortunately, America's military contracting system is biased against such a sensible outcome. Like the other services, the Navy does not know how to say no to impressive technology, whether it's needed and affordable or not. In addition, consolidation in the defense industry has left only two main contractors capable of producing the Navy's ships -- Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics -- and they apportion the business between them.
 This absence of real competition significantly inflates costs, as does Congress's insistence on parceling out the work to as many of the six remaining major naval shipyards as possible. Lawmakers who represent these shipyards and their many subcontractors around the country constitute powerful Congressional constituencies for building prestigious but expensive ships that actually diminish national security by starving more vital programs. 
 Nobody likes to see the shipbuilding jobs generated by the DD(X) put at risk. But weakening the Navy's future fighting strength is too high a price to pay for insulating a few thousand workers from the harsh realities of economic life.

HEADLINE: Health Care in the Marketplace

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 As citizens of one of the wealthiest nations on earth, Americans should be dumbfounded by the economic inefficiency of what passes for a health care ''system'' in our country.
 As members of the human race, we should be appalled by what our approach to health care represents. 
 By abandoning medical coverage to the same market forces that have brought us insider trading, leveraged buyouts and junk bonds, we have encouraged people's health, well-being and even lives to be bought and sold like commodities.
 Human dignity demands that some things be protected from the jungle laws of free-market competition. Until we have equitable and universal health care coverage, our society will be unable to call itself humane or democratic.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman summarizes some of the idiocies intrinsic to the American health care system. One aspect that should be noted is that the lack of universal health insurance makes it difficult, if not impossible, for older job-seekers to find employment. 
 Companies don't want to hire anyone of a certain age because they fear the possibility of becoming embroiled in a costly, time-consuming lawsuit involving a disputed insurance claim.
 Thus, large numbers of capable but unemployed workers needlessly soak up public assistance money, are unable to contribute much to the economy as consumers, and suffer the trauma of feeling marginalized.

HEADLINE: Bicoastal Blues For G.M. and Ford

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 22 

 BODY:
Setting aside its home base in the Upper Midwest, Detroit has a blue state problem -- and it is about to get worse. 
 Washington and Oregon plan to become the 9th and 10th states to adopt California's tough car emissions rules, forming an increasingly potent market for more fuel-efficient vehicles on the West Coast and in the Northeast.
 The states that already follow California's stringent tailpipe emissions rules also happened to fall in the blue column of the 2004 presidential election: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont. 
 The electoral power of those states may fall well short of a majority but their buying power is still formidable, which puts considerable pressure on automakers to develop more fuel-efficient vehicles. Together, the 10 coastal states account for 29 percent of the nation's auto market, according to R.L. Polk, which tracks car registration data. 
 Further pressure comes from Canada, which recently forced automakers to agree to substantial cuts in emissions of global warming gases; California has a similar plan that automakers are challenging in court. 
 General Motors and the Ford Motor Company are themselves based in a blue state, but in the blue bastions on the coasts the last two domestically owned automakers face their biggest challenges, with customers turning to competitors like Toyota faster than in the rest of the country. Together, Ford and G.M. controlled 49.1 percent of domestic sales last year, but according to Polk, their market share in the 10 states was 40.6 percent. 
 ''The regional states tied to this emission policy represent hotbeds of import dominance,'' said Lonnie Miller, an analyst at Polk. Coupled with rising gas prices, the emission control plan, which is a relatively new development in most of the states, ''doesn't make life easier'' for G.M. and Ford, he said.
 The two companies, whose stocks have been battered this year for a variety of reasons, have bet their businesses largely on sales of big sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. Faced with slowing sales of medium and large S.U.V.'s, they are moving in divergent directions, partly because of strategy and partly because of their particular product cycles. 
 G.M. is diverting engineering resources from passenger cars to rush a new generation of its largest S.U.V.'s into production, betting that new models will stimulate the market for big sport utility vehicles. By contrast, at Ford -- whose overall fleet is actually less fuel efficient than G.M.'s -- executives say that they must diversify beyond big S.U.V.'s and that they will bring a crop of midsize sedans to the market later this year. 
 ''The reality is that both companies are heavily invested in large S.U.V.'s and both companies have more risk than they have opportunity with their current sales mix,'' said John Casesa, an auto analyst at Merrill Lynch. ''There is a secular trend towards lower emissions and higher fuel economy, which can only be met with lots of technology investment and probably smaller vehicles. There's only so much you can do with a Suburban.''
 This week, Washington's state legislature passed a bill adopting California's car rules; the governor, Christine Gregoire, a Democrat, is expected to sign it next month. And in an interview this week, Gov. Ted Kulongoski of Oregon, also a Democrat, said he was planning to use his authority to adopt California's regulations; he said he believed that he did not need legislative approval to do so. 
 ''We're going to move forward with it,'' Mr. Kulongoski said. ''It's going to be this year, I would expect.''
 Daniel Becker, director of the Sierra Club's global warming program, said that for environmentalists, who have few allies at the federal level in Washington these days, ''the states are where the action is to curb global warming.'' 
 ''With Oregon and Washington and Canada all signing up for clean cars, we're now approaching the tipping point,'' Mr. Becker said. His hope is that the industry will make broader changes to its North American product development operations as more states adopt California rules.
 Because California's regulations predate the federal Clean Air Act, the state has the authority to set air quality rules, and other states have the option of picking California's more stringent rules over federal policies. 
 The most potent part of California's regulations is its plan to require a roughly 30 percent reduction in automotive emissions of greenhouse gases by the 2016 model year, a step that would require an even greater percentage improvement in fuel economy. Automakers contend the measure is pre-empted by federal fuel economy law.
 At the same time, there is a vigorous debate in Detroit over how gas prices are playing on the minds of consumers. 
 ''Everybody thinks high gas prices hurt sport utility sales,'' said Robert A. Lutz, the vice chairman of G.M., in an interview last month. ''In fact they don't.''
 Mr. Lutz said most buyers of big S.U.V.'s were highly affluent. For ''the median income of, say, a Suburban or a GMC Denali buyer, probably the best demographics of any vehicle we have, or a Cadillac Escalade, you're looking at people with a household income of $150,000 to $200,000,'' he said. ''Do they care whether their gasoline bill goes from $20 a week to $40 a week? The answer is no.''
 By contrast, Ford cited ''the prospect of higher and sustained gasoline prices'' as the crucial factor in the 38 percent drop in earnings the company reported this week. Ford executives in recent weeks have said rising gas prices are leading to a faster-than-expected exodus from medium and large-size sport utility vehicles as gas mileage has emerged as a top issue for consumers.
 ''The world is headed this way; it just surprised us a little bit that it shifted so quickly because of the spike in oil,'' said William Clay Ford, Jr., the chairman and chief executive of Ford, in a meeting with reporters Wednesday.
 Mr. Ford, who has been outspoken in Detroit on issues like global warming, pushed his company to become the world's third automaker to sell a hybrid vehicle, a version of the company's Ford Escape S.U.V. introduced last year. G.M. has said it will not introduce a comparable vehicle until 2008, about a decade after Toyota and Honda brought the first hybrids to market. 
 Mr. Casesa, who compiles detailed studies of the industry's product development plans, said Ford had also been more aggressive in shifting to smaller, more fuel-efficient S.U.V.'s known as crossover vehicles. 
 ''They're not planning to dump the big S.U.V.'s, but they seem to be planning for pretty serious attrition in that market,'' he said, adding, ''G.M. has not been as big a believer in crossovers.''
 Marc Beckers, a spokesman for G.M., disputed that point. ''We're quite well positioned in general, from a fuel-economy perspective,'' he said, adding that his company has several crossovers available, including the Cadillac SRX and the Saturn VUE. Many more are in development, he said.
 Mr. Ford, in his remarks Wednesday, said his company had to push harder to diversify beyond its large S.U.V.'s, and said a new wave of midsize sedans coming later in the year would help. 
 ''We decided, and rightly so in retrospect, that we had to change our cost structure so that we didn't lose money on the smaller stuff,'' he said. ''We knew that the halcyon days would end at some point and we couldn't have everything riding on just a few products.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Agrees to Take Over Four Pension Plans at United

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH; Micheline Maynard contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
The federal government said yesterday that it had reached an agreement to take over all four of United Airlines' employee pension plans, with a shortfall of $9.8 billion, making it the biggest pension failure since the government began insuring pension benefits in 1974.
 The agreement, if approved by a federal bankruptcy judge, would remove an obstacle to the UAL Corporation's emergence from bankruptcy protection, which it entered in December 2002; UAL owns United.
 The airline has been trying to raise at least $2 billion in financing and has said it has preliminary interest from financial institutions. But none have been willing to commit themselves without a resolution of its pension issue. 
 United issued a statement yesterday saying the agreement ''resolves one of the major issues standing between United and its successful exit from bankruptcy.''
 The pilots' union had already agreed that United could terminate its pension plan. But the move angered flight attendants, who had hoped to preserve their plan. 
 The agreement would put new pressure on other big airlines, which also have traditional pension plans and face big deficits in them. United executives estimate the airline would need to spend only about $200 million a year on substitute plans like a 401(k) program. 
 That would give it a significant cost advantage over rivals like Northwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Continental Airlines and American Airlines, which is owned by the AMR Corporation and could lead them to try to match United's action. 
 The termination of United's pension plans, though long expected, will also worsen the finances of the government's Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which has been coping with a number of large pension failures since 2002. Some economists and analysts have warned that the agency is looking increasingly like a candidate for a taxpayer bailout.
 Bradley D. Belt, the agency's executive director, said yesterday that the failure of United's plans ''highlights the need for the comprehensive pension reform'' that the Bush administration proposed this year.
 ''Until Congress fixes the rules that allow pension plans to become so underfunded, the insurance program and plan participants are at risk of suffering large financial losses,'' Mr. Belt said in a statement.
 Neither the government nor the airline offered specific details of their agreement, which eliminates the need for United to persuade the bankruptcy judge that it must scuttle its pension plans. A federal official said that crucial terms of the agreement, like the timing of the pension terminations, still had to be worked out. But if the agreement goes ahead as planned, the government will take over the four pension plans and will assume the obligation of paying United's retirees. 
 For some retirees, that will mean reductions in payments, because the government's insurance has limits.
 The government estimated yesterday that the pension agency will cover about $6.6 billion of United's shortfall. The remainder, about $3.2 billion, will be borne by United's retirees, in the form of benefit reductions. Different retirees will be affected in different ways, depending on their age and other factors. In general, the pilots are expected to lose the most, because they have been promised rich pensions that exceed the government's insurance limits.
 The four pension plans cover about 121,500 employees and retirees. 
 It has been especially difficult for the government and United to agree on the date when the pension plans for the mechanics and pilots will move to the pension agency. United gave its pilots and mechanics pension increases less than five years ago, and the agency phases in its insurance coverage for increases over five years. United had been trying to keep both of those pension funds afloat to achieve the higher levels of insurance coverage.
 But the pension agency went to court, trying to speed the terminations and arguing that United was delaying the inevitable and increasing its costs.

HEADLINE: What does the selection of this pope portend for American Catholic youths, many indifferent?

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels

 BODY:
In the days after Pope John Paul II died, only his role in helping bring on the collapse of Communism earned more comment than his gift for reaching young people with the challenge of the Gospel.
 That testimony, along with the images of youthful backpackers swelling the crowds of mourners in St. Peter's Square, stirred memories of things witnessed firsthand in Denver 12 years ago at World Youth Day, and elsewhere. 
 But those recollections only made it all the more jarring to be simultaneously poring over a National Study of Youth and Religion, undertaken at the University of North Carolina, and its findings about American Catholic teenagers -- findings that raise obvious questions about the way leadership will be exercised in the papacy of Benedict XVI. 
 Those findings have recently been published in ''Soul Searching: The Religious and Spiritual Lives of American Teenagers'' (Oxford University Press, 2005), by Christian Smith and Melinda Lundquist Denton. With a mixture of good news and bad news that punctures many stereotypes about adolescent religious beliefs and behavior, this extensive study deserves attention for what it reveals across the full range of American religious groups. 
 But what leapt out during this papal transition was that the researchers had felt compelled to devote a separate chapter to their discovery that Catholic teenagers ''stand out among the U.S. Christian teenagers as consistently scoring lower on most measures of religiosity.'' 
 On various questions about beliefs, practices, experiences and commitments, the researchers found Catholic youths ''scoring 5 to 25 percentage points lower than their conservative, mainline and black Protestant peers.'' In-depth interviews showed many of these Catholic adolescents ''living far outside of official church norms.''
 Catholic teenagers were far less apt to affirm belief in a personal God, to report having ever undergone a very moving, powerful worship experience, or to say their faith was extremely important in shaping their daily lives or major life decisions. 
 There has been a lot of impressionistic talk, often verging on boosterism, about a new ''John Paul II generation'' of deeply committed, conservative young Catholics. So what should be said about this quite different-looking crop of John Paul II teenagers? How did this happen on the watch of the very pope who undeniably exhibited such magnetism among youth? 
 The obvious answer is that one individual, no matter how charismatic a communicator of his convictions, cannot do it alone. Even the millions touched by World Youth Days are only a small -- and often unrepresentative -- fraction of young Catholics, who as a whole can be reached only at the grass roots, through parish worship, religious education, youth ministry and, of course, their parents' example. 
 If this whole infrastructure of religious socialization is creaky, undermanned, short on skills and resources, fearful of ideas and innovation or unresponsive to important demographic, socioeconomic and cultural forces, then even the most dynamic pontiff can enliven only a minority of young Catholics. 
 Benedict XVI, by all accounts, lacks his predecessor's personal dynamism, but may very well pay more attention to the condition of that Catholic infrastructure. Unfortunately, when speculation began about the consequences of his election for American Catholics, the news media could only trot out the usual checklist of issues: contraception, abortion, homosexuality, sexual abuse crisis, ordination of women and so on. 
 The assumption always seems to be that adhering to a religious faith is primarily a matter of obeying rules and that in the case of Catholicism, these are made -- and might be remade -- by the man at the top. What gets lost is the idea that religious faith entails a more fundamental stance toward reality, one embedded in a community, expressed in its prayers and practices (not just its rules) and learned by exposure, both in person and in story, to exemplary individuals. 
 In this preoccupation with the rules, a lot of important questions went largely unasked. What kind of bishops and archbishops would Benedict XVI be likely to appoint? What might he do about the worldwide priest shortage? Would he find a regularized place in church life for the similarly worldwide upsurge of trained and dedicated lay people now carrying out pastoral work full time? What individual or group models of living the faith will he favor or disfavor? 
 Some Catholics may be waiting with bated breath for a papal ''yes'' or ''no'' on contraception, say, or whether to vote for a politician who supports Roe v. Wade. Most, poll data suggest, are not. What needs to be asked about the standard checklist of issues is how decisive a part they will play in the new pope's oversight of the Catholic infrastructure. 
 And in Benedict's case, still more decisive than these separate items is apt to be his underlying reading of the times. Many who claim to know have linked his choice of the name Benedict to a vision of the world -- or at least of its most economically advanced sectors, in Europe and America -- as entering a new Dark Age, when the best the church can do is maintain outposts of belief that, like the early medieval Benedictine monasteries, can preserve pure Christianity amid the ignorance and wreckage of barbarian rule. Much in Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger's writings supports this interpretation. 
 If that bleak vision is indeed his, will the resulting infrastructure nonetheless embrace this new generation of American Catholic youth, who are not simply untouched by official teachings about contraception or homosexuality but often appear unfamiliar with or indifferent to the basic Christian narrative of creation, incarnation and redemption? Or will a Benedict XVI church set its priorities so that most of these teenagers are consigned to the barbarian darkness while the church attends to the minority already saved?
 Some people have already written off Benedict XVI, while others are rushing almost to canonize him. Pending a clearer sense of his own vision of the world and of the priorities such a vision suggests, both reactions seem premature. 
 In a televised interview eight years ago, cited in John Allen's book ''Conclave'' (Doubleday, 2002), one high-ranking Catholic official gave a rather minimal view of what Catholics should automatically assume about a newly chosen pope. Asked whether ''the Holy Spirit plays a role in the election of the pope,'' the official replied, ''I would not say so in the sense that the Holy Spirit picks out the pope, because there are too many contrary instances of popes the Holy Spirit would obviously not have picked.''
 ''The Spirit's role should be understood in a much more elastic sense,'' the official added. ''Probably the only assurance he offers is that the thing cannot be totally ruined.'' 
 That official was Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI.

HEADLINE: Ericsson's Earnings Surge 73%, Aided by Strong European Sales

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: LONDON, April 22 

 BODY:
Profit at Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications equipment giant, soared 73 percent in the first quarter, the company said Friday, building on a recent run of healthy reports in the telecommunications industry.
 The company, the world's largest supplier of mobile phone networks, said that first-quarter net income increased to 4.64 billion kronor ($660 million). Sales were up 12 percent from a year before, to 31.5 billion kronor, as Ericsson introduced third-generation services in Western Europe, and demand for wide-band code-division multiple access, or WCDMA, increased in Eastern Europe and Turkey. 
 ''Our focus on profitable growth through intensified customer partnerships and operational excellence is successful and is giving us a distinct competitive advantage,'' said Carl-Henric Svanberg, the president and chief executive. The company's market share increased two to three percentage points from a year ago, he added.
 The stock rallied 3.85 percent, to 21.6 kronor on the Stockholm Stock Exchange.
 Ericsson has focused on cutting costs in recent quarters, particularly by eliminating jobs. These cuts helped to increase the gross profit margins to 48.5 percent in the first quarter from 44.7 percent a year ago, beating analysts expectations. 
 ''These guys are still the biggest player in the telecom equipment environment, anywhere, and economies of scale are playing into their hands,'' said Robert Sellar, head of technology on the equities desk of Aberdeen Asset Management.
 In recent years, investors and analysts predicted sales would drop steadily at established telecommunications equipment companies like Ericsson, as Chinese manufacturers took over the industry. 
 But, those analysts failed to take into account the amount of spending that these companies' customers needed to upgrade existing networks to support third-generation and other new technologies, Mr. Sellar said.
 Ericsson's news comes on the heels of unexpectedly strong reports from Nokia, the Germany business software company SAP and Motorola. 
 Despite the jump in first quarter sales, Ericsson forecast ''slight growth'' over all for 2005. The company sees ''encouraging signs of accelerated infrastructure investments in both China and the U.S.,'' Mr. Svanberg said.

HEADLINE: Bad Weather Forces Change in Bush's Earth Day Plans

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: KNOXVILLE, Tenn., April 22 

 BODY:
President Bush's plans to celebrate Earth Day in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park were undone by nature on Friday, as stormy weather in the area forced him to cancel and instead speak about the environment from inside a hangar here at the McGhee Tyson Airport.
 The White House had intended the president to speak at the park's Cades Cove, about 30 miles south of Knoxville. Rather than work with volunteers to help restore a park trail, though, Mr. Bush spoke for 10 minutes to a group of reporters, aides and military personnel with Air Force One as his backdrop. 
 ''In the park, had I been there, I would have reminded people today is Earth Day, a day in which we recommit ourselves to being good stewards of the land,'' he said. ''We didn't create this Earth, but we have an obligation to protect it.''
 The White House altered Mr. Bush's plans as he flew here from Washington, citing the danger posed by hail and thunderstorms to attendees of the outdoor events. 
 It had hoped to use the day to focus attention on what it called Mr. Bush's strong environmental record and to press Congress to pass his ''Clear Skies'' bill, which would give power plants more flexibility in meeting air-quality standards. Mr. Bush has enacted many provisions of the bill, which has been stalled in the Senate, through executive orders.
 Mr. Bush encouraged people to help the environment through volunteer programs, and said he was dedicated to aggressive environmental policies that did not impose unreasonable economic costs.
 ''Since 1970, the air is cleaner and the water is more pure and we're using our land better, and our economy has grown a lot,'' he said. ''My point is, it's possible to have economic growth and jobs and opportunity and, at the same time, be wise stewards of the land.''
 The White House had set the trip to highlight what it called progress in improving the region's air, which has been harmed by diesel and power plant emissions. 
 Critics say Mr. Bush has favored business interests too much and has overstated his policies' positive effects. ''We've seen very little real on the ground when it comes to improving the environment,'' said Julie Sibbing, a spokeswoman for the National Wildlife Federation. 
 Mr. Bush flew from here to his ranch in Crawford, Tex., where he is scheduled to spend the weekend and to meet on Monday with Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia.

HEADLINE: Outsourcing As a Sign of Strength

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN. 
William J. Holstein is editor in chief of Chief Executive magazine.

 BODY:
THE positive aspects of outsourcing technology work to India are often overlooked in the United States, says Shirish Netke, who was known for his work in developing the Java computing language while at Sun Microsystems. He is now chief strategy officer of American operations for Aztec Software, based in Bangalore, a company with $30 million a year in sales that provides software engineering services. Here are excerpts from a conversation:

Q. How can the outsourcing of skilled American jobs to India be healthy for the United States economy?

A. The simple answer is that it makes American corporations more profitable and in the process does benefit the country. Outsourcing is just one step in the natural evolution of the economic system. If there is a lower-cost producer of goods somewhere else, it is the responsibility of any corporation to follow that path and to provide as much value as they can to their customers and profit to their shareholders.

Q. Which companies does your firm work for?

A. We don't talk about who our customers are, but they include very large multinational companies, very large Fortune 500 companies, as well as aggressive start-up companies in the San Francisco Bay Area. It's pretty much around the country.

Q. The general view here is that if an American company loses its ability to innovate, that's bad. Do you disagree with that?

A. I wouldn't say I wouldn't agree. But there are two aspects of the ability to innovate. One is knowing the customer. I don't think that can be taken away from the Americans. But creating a process by which they can cater to customer requirements -- the systems, the engineering and the thinking -- that can be outsourced to somebody else. It's almost like saying that when you're building a house, the architecture is something you have to take care of yourself. But the plumbing is something you can have somebody else do. They can do it more efficiently than you can.

Q. If I were a customer turning over significant parts of my design work to you, I'd worry that one day I'd become irrelevant. I could be cut out.

A. The in-market knowledge of what the customer wants is hard to take out of the country. The way most of our customers think about it is that they have to get to a higher level of value addition. You go back to the Darwinian economic principles: anybody who adds value does not get ''obsoleted'' or taken out. That's one of the beauties of the American system. This whole concept of outsourcing is actually a symbol of American strength, not of weakness.

Q. What's an example of how outsourcing shows strength?

A. A friend of mine is the C.E.O. of JadooWorks in India. Tom Friedman of The Times actually wrote about it in a column. He visited them. Here is an animation company producing animated cartoons. The drawings are done by somebody in India, the voice-overs are done by actors from Hollywood and the music is provided by British musicians. It's a classic example of sourcing from the world's best, wherever they are.

Q. Even very high-value tasks can be outsourced. What's an American business owner to do?

A. A friend of mine and his family once had a dominant position in making plastic heels for ladies' shoes. Their company was called Ripley Industries. Over the past 40 or 50 years, the shoe manufacturing industry went to East Asia, to China and Taiwan and those countries. So the third generation of the family has gone into the software business. That's how they survived.

Q. Haven't companies in Silicon Valley been coping with these issues for many years?

A. Silicon Valley went through this thought process 10 or 15 years ago. I used to work at Sun, where the amount of time required to build a work station was about 15 minutes. We spent the rest of our time trying to make sure that we got absolutely the best subassemblies from different parts of the world. We just put it all together and sold it to the customer. We provided the certification of quality, the Good Housekeeping seal of approval. That is still in the hands of the person who is facing the customer.

Q. Will outsourcing fade at some point?

A. It's an irreversible trend. It's a one-way street in terms of global interdependency. I wouldn't say it's just the U.S. and India. It also touches China and Romania and other places. Every country has to be competitive. If you take advantage, it can make America and us very rich. If you don't take advantage, it can make us very poor.

Q. How do we prevent engineers and other skilled technology people from being rendered uncompetitive?

A. In the 21st century, the half-life of an engineer is four or five years. What I learned in my final year of engineering school, my daughter learned in the seventh or eighth grade. It's amazing. So it's very important not to look at engineers as a commodity. They are resources who have to exercise themselves regularly. They need to be challenged to constantly do bigger and better things.

Q. Does the United States have the proper educational infrastructure in place?

A. Higher education in the United States is the best in the world. The ability to harness what you do very well and channel it to your advantage is what will build success. American business is as competitive as it ever has been. Something like outsourcing will only make it stronger.

BYLINE: By David Dobbs. 
David Dobbs, who writes regularly on science, is the author of ''Reef Madness: Charles Darwin, Alexander Agassiz and the Meaning of Coral.''

 BODY:

When Dr. Alan Schiller's 87-year-old mother died in January, ''it took some convincing,'' Schiller says, to get his siblings to agree to an autopsy. ''They said: 'She had Alzheimer's. Let her rest.' But I told them: 'No, something seems funny to me. An autopsy is the only way to be sure.''' Schiller prevailed. A tanned, quick-minded, gregarious man in his 60's, he is naturally persuasive, and as chairman of pathology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, he carries a certain authority regarding autopsies. The word ''autopsy,'' he reminded his siblings, means to ''see for oneself,'' and they should see what happened to their mother. Schiller's mother died in Miami, so he called his friend Dr. Robert Poppiti Jr., chairman of pathology at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach. She was on the table the next morning.
 In a living patient, Alzheimer's is a diagnosis of exclusion, one that should ideally be reached only by eliminating all testable causes of fading memory and mind. Confirming it requires directly examining the brain. The definitive markers are the tiny protein plaques and fibrous tangles that appear under the microscope in stained sections. But a good pathologist can spot advanced Alzheimer's just by looking at the whole brain. The brain will be shorter, front to back, and more squarish than normal -- a reflection of Alzheimer's neuronal decimation, which shrinks the brain up to 15 percent. This would presumably have been the case with Mrs. Schiller. But the autopsist found her brain of normal shape and size. Dissecting it, he discovered a half-dozen cystlike lesions scattered throughout -- areas darker, softer and less elastic than the buff-colored parts surrounding them.
 ''He called me right away,'' Schiller told me. ''He said: 'Alan, your mother didn't have Alzheimer's. She had multi-infarct dementia.' You know what that is? It's a loss of mental capacity from a series of strokes. You can tell it because these cysts show up, little areas filled with fluid that comes in after a clot cuts off blood flow and the cells die. She had had multiple strokes. She didn't have Alzheimer's at all. She'd been slowly killed by strokes. 
 ''Now, this is useful information,'' Schiller continued. ''For one, it means I should worry less about getting Alzheimer's but maybe more about my cardiovascular health. It also means they could have been treating her for stroke. She might have had a very different life. But Alzheimer's has become a wastebasket diagnosis. You behave strangely and you're old, you have Alzheimer's. But other things, like this multi-infarct dementia, can produce the same symptoms. And no one ever checked for that.''
 This is the point that Schiller, a champion of the autopsy, means to make: even in today's high-tech medical world, the low-tech hospital autopsy -- not the crime-oriented forensic autopsy glorified in television, but the routine autopsy done on patients who die in hospitals -- provides a uniquely effective means of quality control and knowledge. It exposes mistakes and bad habits, evaluates diagnostic and treatment routines and detects new disease. It is, Schiller says, the most powerful tool in the history of medicine, responsible for most of our knowledge of anatomy and disease, and it remains vital. ''Neglecting the autopsy,'' he says, ''is anathema to the whole practice of medicine.'' 
 Yet the hospital autopsy is neglected. When Schiller went to medical school in the 1960's, hospitals in the United States autopsied almost half of all deaths, and the autopsy was familiar to medical students and practitioners alike. The United States now does post-mortems on fewer than 5 percent of hospital deaths, and the procedure is alien to almost every doctor trained in the last 30 years. Schiller has fought this. Soon after he took over Mount Sinai's pathology department 16 years ago, a time when many hospitals were closing their autopsy facilities, he built what he calls ''a beautiful new morgue,'' spending more than a million dollars. ''I wanted a grand opening, a public thing,'' he says, laughing. ''You know -- ribbons, speeches. The hospital said: 'Are you nuts? It's a morgue!''' The hospital has backed him otherwise. By pushing clinicians to ask for autopsies and by doing good autopsies that quickly give clinicians useful feedback, Schiller has lifted Mount Sinai's autopsy rates from the single digits to the midteens. But only a few hospitals, almost all of them teaching hospitals, like Mount Sinai, still do that many. Elsewhere the autopsy is dying. 
 Dr. George Lundberg, a pathologist who edited The Journal of the American Medical Association from 1982 until 1999 and now edits the online medical journal Medscape General Medicine, has, like Schiller, spent much of his career trying to revive the autopsy. The heart of his plaint is that nothing reveals error like the autopsy. As Lundberg noted in a 1998 article, numerous studies over the last century have found that in 25 to 40 percent of cases in which an autopsy is done, it reveals an undiagnosed cause of death. Because of those errors, in 7 to 12 percent of the cases, treatment that might have been lifesaving wasn't prescribed. (In the other cases, the disease might have advanced beyond treatment or there might have been multiple causes of death.) These figures roughly match those found in the first discrepancy studies, done in the early 1910's. ''No improvement!'' Lundberg notes. ''Low-tech autopsy trumps high-tech medicine . . . again and again.'' 
 Lundberg doesn't fantasize that the autopsy can make medicine mistake-free; medicine poses puzzles too various and complex to expect perfection, and indeed error rates run about the same no matter how many autopsies are done. But autopsies can keep doctors from repeating mistakes, and thus advance medicine. Doctors miss things. But without autopsies, they don't know when they've missed something fatal and so are likely to miss it again. They miss the chance to learn from their mistakes. Instead, they bury them. This, Lundberg says, ''is endlessly galling.''
 As Lundberg sees it, ''If you want to base your medicine on evidence, if you want to reduce error, if you simply want to know what you are doing, then you should start by evaluating the care given to your sickest patients -- the ones who die.''
The autopsy's intellectual founder was Giovanni Morgagni, a physician and professor at the University of Padua who wrote one of the most gruesome, humane and riveting early texts of modern medicine, ''The Seats and Causes of Disease Investigated by Anatomy.'' Published in 1761, when Morgagni was 79, the book describes nearly 700 autopsies he performed. His lucid, compassionate accounts demonstrated irrefutably that illness works in traceable, physical ways; medicine, therefore, should be an empirical endeavor aimed at particular physical processes rather than ''humors,'' spirits or other intangibles. 
 Morgagni's perspective was carried into the present era by William Osler, a Canadian who practiced and taught medicine in the United States in the late 1800's. Osler exerted more influence on 20th-century medicine than any other doctor, primarily by creating at Johns Hopkins Medical School the model for medical education still used today, with students seeing patients beginning their third year and training in internships and residencies after graduating. Osler placed the autopsy at the center of this education, performing more than a thousand post-mortems himself and insisting that staff members and students do them regularly. Tracking the necrotic footprints of their own missteps, he believed, would teach them lessons far more memorable than any text could. 
 Osler's argument was strengthened in the early 1910's by the work of Richard Clarke Cabot, who reviewed the records and autopsies of thousands of patients at Massachusetts General Hospital and found that the autopsies showed clinical diagnoses to be wrong about 40 percent of the time -- the finding replicated many times since. His reports helped solidify the autopsy's central role in medical education and practice. Autopsy rates began to rise. By World War II, they were nearing 50 percent, and autopsies had become standard in medical schools and many hospitals, where weekly mortality and morbidity conferences often focused on what autopsies had revealed about the diagnosis and treatment of patients' illnesses. 
 That midcentury peak helped drive remarkable medical progress. In 1945, for instance, the chance of survival for a patient with an aortic aneurysm was little better than it was a century earlier. But in the 50's and 60's, surgeons like Michael DeBakey, a pioneering cardiovascular surgeon, learned through trial and error -- the errors offering their lessons only through autopsy -- how to repair and replace first lower sections of the aorta in the abdomen and then, working up toward the heart, the biggest, most pressurized and most vital sections. By 1960, aortic repairs were routine. By 1970, the lessons learned helped make open-heart surgery common as well. 
 Autopsies similarly advanced other areas of medicine. They played central roles in diagnosing and spurring treatment for sudden infant death syndrome, Legionnaires' disease, toxic-shock syndrome, hantavirus, H.I.V., Ebola and other infectious diseases and helped make the association between lung cancer and smoking. These medical advances would have come about much more slowly without autopsies. In 1999, for instance, when four New York City residents died of what was diagnosed as St. Louis encephalitis, it was only because the city's unusually aggressive medical examiner's office insisted on autopsying them that they were discovered to be the first American victims of West Nile virus. (In most cities, the four would have been buried or cremated without autopsy.) The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention subsequently established a nationwide monitoring, control and treatment system credited with preventing scores or perhaps hundreds of deaths. 
 Though yet deadlier pathogens, like those that cause avian flu, mad cow disease and SARS, will almost certainly make their way to the United States, our low autopsy rates may well delay their detection. Prion diseases -- for instance, mad cow, which in humans is called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- cause a neurological death that doctors could mistake for multi-infarct dementia, encephalitis or even a fast-moving Alzheimer's. A patient who died of a prion disease might go unautopsied and be cremated or buried, leaving the prion disease and its source undetected. With some 200,000 Alzheimer's and stroke patients buried unautopsied each year, this may have already happened. 
After 20 years of making arguments for autopsy, Lundberg says that he feels like the football coach in the joke about the dim and unmotivated player. ''What's wrong with you, Jones?'' the coach says. ''Are you ignorant? Or just apathetic?'' To which Jones replies, ''I don't know, and I don't care.'' 
 When Lundberg talks autopsy to doctors' groups or health-care policy makers, his audiences generally agree that we should do more autopsies. ''But nobody takes the steps to make it happen,'' Lundberg laments. They shake their heads in dismay, then return to business as usual. The forces arrayed against the autopsy -- regulatory, economic and cultural -- seem to overcome any impulse to revive it. 
 It starts with pathologists. Most pathologists don't like autopsies. The procedure entails two to four smelly hours at the table and as many again analyzing samples, and the work comes atop other duties -- ones that feel more urgent -- like analyzing biopsies of living patients. Autopsies seldom advance careers or status, and most hospitals don't pay pathologists for doing them or provide updated equipment to ease the job or get the most out of the sampled tissues. 
 Hospitals say the problem is money. An autopsy can cost from $2,000 to $4,000, and insurance won't cover it. Most patient families blanch if asked to pay for it, and many can't afford to after paying medical and funeral bills. So the hospital gets the tab. For most of the postwar period up to 1970, hospitals generally paid it, essentially because they had to: the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations required hospitals to maintain autopsy rates of at least 20 percent (25 percent for teaching hospitals), which, then and now, is the rate most advocates say is the minimum for monitoring diagnostic and hospital error. The commission eliminated that requirement in 1970. Lundberg says that this happened because hospitals, which had already allowed the rate to drop to close to 20 percent since its 1950's high of about 50 percent, wanted to let it drop further and pressured the commission. The commission's current president, Dr. Dennis S. O'Leary, says it eliminated the standard because too many hospitals were doing poor autopsies -- and often only the cheapest, simplest ones -- just to make the quota. In any event, few hospitals have paid for autopsies since then. Money is too scarce, they say, the needs of living patients too great. 
 But this argument fails scrutiny. For starters, hospitals do get money for autopsies: Medicare includes an autopsy allowance in the lump sum it pays hospitals for each Medicare inpatient, and those patients account for three-quarters of all hospital deaths. This money could easily finance double-digit autopsy rates. But most hospitals spend it on other things. Lundberg and others have urged the Department of Health and Human Services to make Medicare payments contingent on hospitals' meeting a certain autopsy rate. But the agency shows no interest in doing so. 
 The hospitals' dodge on this issue reveals less about finance than about attitude. They have the money. They don't use it for autopsies because they don't value autopsies. The hospitals that do -- teaching hospitals like New York's Mount Sinai; Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, in Lebanon, N.H.; and Baylor University Medical Center, in Dallas -- manage to absorb the costs. Their lobbies may not be as nice. But they have a much better idea where their errors are. ''People sometimes ask me how good a hospital is,'' Lundberg says. ''With most hospitals, the answer is that no one knows -- because the hospital has no way to know how many and what kinds of mistakes they make.''
 Another oft-cited inhibitor is doctors' fears of being sued if an autopsy finds error. Research shows no link between autopsies and increased tendencies to sue. Patient families say this is because doctors increase trust by asking for an autopsy and encourage suspicion and acrimony when they don't request one. 
 Doctors seem to overestimate families' resistance to autopsies. In one survey of doctors and families of seriously ill patients, 89 percent of the physicians said they planned to request autopsies and two-thirds of the families said they would probably grant permission. ''But only 23 percent of them actually got autopsied,'' says Dr. Elizabeth Burton, a pathologist and autopsy advocate at Baylor who was one of the study's authors. ''Why? We went back and asked the families. Many were never asked. Among those who were, the biggest deciding factor was how strongly the doctor recommended it. If the doctor showed conviction and a good reason, the families almost always went for it.'' 
 Some families do object, of course, and variations on the refrain of Schiller's siblings, ''Let her rest,'' have answered many an autopsy request. But if the doctor persists and wins approval, the family often gains a welcome sense of resolution. An extreme example of how a post-mortem is expected to resolve troubling questions surfaced in the case of Terri Schiavo; an autopsy should reveal far more precisely the extent of her brain damage, resolving whether she was truly vegetative, with only her brain stem functioning, as most doctors believed, or even minimally conscious, aware and responsive, as her parents believed. (The Pinellas County medical examiner's office in Florida had not released the results of the Schiavo autopsy as this article was going to press.) More commonly, results clarify family health issues. People who go through a miscarriage or parents whose children have died seem to especially benefit. Tracing death to a particular cause seems to ease anguish about things done or not done. Yet few doctors regularly ask to perform the post-mortem.
 Perhaps the most troubling reason for the decline of the autopsy is the overconfidence that doctors -- and patients -- have in M.R.I.'s and other high-tech diagnostic technologies. Bill Pellan of the Pinellas County medical examiner's office says: ''We get this all the time. The doctor will get our report and call and say: 'But there can't be a lacerated aorta. We did a whole set of scans.' We have to remind him we held the heart in our hands.'' In fact, advanced diagnostic tools do miss critical problems and actually produce more false-negative diagnoses than older methods, probably because doctors accept results too readily. One study of diagnostic errors made from 1959 to 1989 (the period that brought us CAT scans, M.R.I.'s and many other high-tech diagnostics) found that while false-positive diagnoses remained about 10 percent during that time, false-negative diagnoses -- that is, when a condition is erroneously ruled out -- rose from 24 percent to 34 percent. Another study found that errors occur at the same rate regardless of whether sophisticated diagnostic tools are used. Yet doctors routinely dismiss possible diagnoses because high-tech tools show negative results. One of my own family doctors told me that he rarely asks for an autopsy because ''with M.R.I.'s and CAT scans and everything else, we usually know why they died.''
 This sense of omniscience, Lundberg says, is part of ''a vast cultural delusion.'' At his most incensed, Lundberg says he feels that his fellow doctors simply don't want to face their own fallibility. But Lundberg's indictment is even broader. The autopsy's decline reflects not just individual arrogance, but also the general state of health care: the increasing distance and unease between doctors and patients and their families, a pervasive fear of lawsuits, our denial of age and death and, especially, our credulous infatuation with technology. Our doctors' overconfidence, less bigheaded than blithe, is part of the medicine we've come to expect. 
Recently I stood in the autopsy room of a large teaching hospital waiting for a body to be brought up from the morgue. The young pathologist who would be overseeing the autopsy told me what little he knew of the morning's patient. The middle-aged man had come to an emergency room suffering seizures. A CAT scan of his head showed a lesion, possibly a tumor, in his left frontal lobe. He initially refused a biopsy, saying that he might seek a second opinion. The emergency-room doctor, worried about pressure in the patient's skull if the mass expanded, put him on anti-inflammatory steroids and sent him home. Sometime later the man came in again with stronger and more persistent seizures. Despite efforts to ease pressure in his skull, he progressed from seizures to a coma and died. Midmorning the day after that he was on a gurney on his way to the autopsy room. The man was not overweight and had no known history of serious illness. His main compromising factors were that he was an ex-drug user and a smoker. ''The drug use would suggest infection,'' the pathologist said. ''The smoking, obviously, cancer.''
 So what killed him?
 ''Most likely he herniated,'' the pathologist said. ''Things got too tight in his skull from whatever this growth was, and the pressure builds and finally it pushes the base of the brain down through the opening where the spinal cord enters the skull. That fits with the way he died. But even if that's right, we still don't know what the lesion is.'' At this point we heard the rumbling of wheels, and the autopsy assistant pushed a gurney covered with a canvas tent into the room. ''We'll know more soon,'' the pathologist said.
 He stepped out to get gowned up, and I went in to watch the assistant prepare things. By then the canvas tent was removed to reveal a body wrapped in sheets. The assistant worked efficiently but with a calm, understated respect. With no more force than necessary, he pulled the body from the gurney onto the autopsy table and unwrapped it. The patient appeared to be thinking: his eyes, slightly open, stared dreamily at the ceiling. 
 In addition to the pathologist, the assistant and a pathology resident, who would do the actual knife work, eight others attended, including a fourth-year medical student, two residents, three neuropathologists and a cardiac pathologist who had just dissected another patient's heart and lingered to see how the brain case played out. As people milled and talked, the assistant sank a scalpel into the flesh behind the man's ear and began cutting a high arc behind the rear crown of the skull. When he reached the other ear, he pulled the scalp's flesh away from the skull a bit, crimped a towel over the front edge of the opening he had made and, using it for grip, pulled the scalp forward over the man's head. When he was done, the man's skull lay completely exposed and his inside-out scalp covered his face down to his mouth. Now a neuropathologist, wielding the skull saw (like a cordless kitchen mixer with a rotary blade), carefully cut a big oval in the rear and top of the man's skull. He then used a hammer and chisel to tap around the seam. Finally he tapped the chisel in at the top of the cut and pried. With a sucking sound the skullcap pulled away. 
 The brain looked unexpectedly smooth. ''That's the swelling,'' the neuropathologist said. ''The convolutions usually show much more plainly.'' He gently pulled back the frontal lobe and slipped scissors behind the eyes to snip the optical nerves, then the carotid arteries and finally the spinal cord itself. Then he gently removed the brain and set it upside down on a table. 
 Even my untrained eyes could tell things weren't quite right: the left hemisphere was swollen. The growth in the left frontal lobe, less a lump than a slightly raised oval area about an inch long, was paler, yellower, firmer and more granular than the pinkish-tan tissue surrounding it. ''Could be a tumor,'' the neuropathologist said. ''Could be an infection. We'll know more in a few days.'' Similar lesions were eventually identified on both sides of the brain.
 With a pair of scissors, he pointed at a bulbous area around the brain stem. ''Here's the herniation. See how it protrudes? That's where it got pushed down through the opening where the spinal cord comes through. That's the medulla that pushed through, which, among other things, controls the heart and breathing. That's just not consistent with life.''
 He clipped a few samples from the lesion, and with that he was largely done. The assistant, meanwhile, worked on, and with the brain exam finished, the pathologist soon joined him. They extracted meaty lungs and a big liver. Pus oozed out when the trachea was cut. All this suggested systemic infection. ''At this point, I'd call it an even toss between infection and tumor,'' the pathologist said. ''If he tests positive for H.I.V., my money goes on infection.''
 This initial exam of the organs took some 15 minutes. When they finished, the group spent another hour dissecting the organs. The exercise was now more educational than diagnostic, but the pathologist showed no sign of routine-induced boredom; on the contrary, he clearly enjoyed showing the residents the hidden adrenal glands, the chest-wall vessels sometimes used for coronary bypasses and the vagus nerve's lacy, laddered course through the chest. 
 The full results would take several more days to come in. But they knew by the next day that the patient was H.I.V.-positive, and by the second day that the mass was not cancerous but an infection found mainly in immunocompromised patients like this one. 
 These findings had multilayered implications. That the man had H.I.V., for instance, would presumably mean something to any of his sexual partners. (Many states require the primary physician to contact sexual partners in such cases.) The rest of his family might find some relief in knowing that there was no tumor and that their own cancer risk was thus not raised. Beyond that, the case's main epidemiological significance was its addition to evidence that infections form an ever-growing but oft-overlooked cause of death -- another small correction in our assessment of what kills us. And that makes for better doctors. ''You don't learn these things all at once,'' the pathologist said. ''You learn a lot all at once in med school, sure. But after that, you become a better doctor by learning a little bit at a time. Incremental adjustments. That's what makes us better doctors. And this is the place you learn them better than anywhere else.'' 
 When a believer is in the full flush of describing autopsy's gifts, when you witness how quickly and effectively the procedure delivers them, it's easy to think that the autopsy will make a comeback. How could it not? At a time when medicine takes continuous fire regarding errors -- politicians and patient advocates outraged at studies showing that 100,000 Americans die each year from medical errors, tort lawyers chasing mistakes on which to hang huge judgments, malpractice rates jumping at triple-digit rates -- how can medicine ignore an instrument proven to detect error? 
 Yet it does. Other than hoping for a long shot, like Medicare or the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare setting autopsy-rate requirements, there is seemingly no quick return to routine autopsies. ''We just have to do this one hospital at a time,'' says Dr. Pat Lento, head of the autopsy service at Mount Sinai in New York. But most hospitals have no plans to revive the autopsy. And while physician organizations like the A.M.A. generally support the autopsy, most doctors don't avail themselves of it. The sad truth is that most of medicine seems to have relegated the post-mortem to a cabinet of archaic tools, as if the body's direct lessons no longer matter. In the end, the autopsy's troubles resemble those in a medical case in which the causes stand clear and a cure stands ready, but the patient doesn't take things seriously enough to pursue the fix. 
Toward the end of the autopsy I saw of the man who died from an ignored infection, someone asked the assistant if he could really put him back together for a funeral. It was almost 2 p.m. and the man was in pieces. His torso was a big red bowl formed by his back ribs, his skin hung splayed on either side and his scalp was stretched inside-out over his face. The assistant smiled and said, ''Oh, sure.'' The pathologist added: ''Absolutely! This guy could go to his wake tonight.'' 
 And so it was. Unlike most things, an autopsied body can be put back together far more easily than it can be taken apart. It took less than half an hour to replace the breastplate and sew up the man's torso; if he had a suit, it would fit as before and hide all. The skull cap all but snapped into place. The assistant rolled the man's scalp back over his head and started to suture it up. When he was done, our patient looked pretty good indeed. It was remarkable, actually, after all we had found about what ailed him, that he should still gaze at the ceiling, unchanged and none the wiser.

HEADLINE: Better Yet, Move It to Jerusalem

BYLINE: By PACO UNDERHILL. 
Paco Underhill, a geographer, is the author of ''Why We Buy.''

 BODY:
PLACE still has power over the human animal. The Yankees would not be the Yankees if they were anywhere else than the Bronx; nor would Goldman Sachs or J.P. Morgan Chase be the institutions they are, placed outside Manhattan. 
 New Yorkers understand their city in two ways -- as a whole and in its constituent parts. We are a city that is renewed with each new wave of immigrants, a city dedicated to global commerce and culture. But some things we aren't. We are not the City of Brotherly Love. Casey Stengel was never a diplomat. Pete Hamill and Tom Wolfe both lived here, with no apologies. New York symbolizes money and the culture of expression, but not any specific agenda or point of view. 
 While the Yankees wouldn't be the Yankees anywhere else, that's not the case for the United Nations. Wherever it is, it will be the center of the world of international diplomacy. If it left New York City, we might miss the cosmopolitanism imparted by the diplomats a little, but the organization has really never been integrated into the fabric of the city -- and its continued presence here has real drawbacks. Maybe it's time for the United Nations to leave Manhattan. 
 The United Nations was placed here after World War II, a symbol of America's domination of the world then, politically and militarily. Today the United Nations is a white elephant for the city. Because it is parked on top of some of the most expensive real estate on the continent, it deprives the city of the tax revenue that could come from an office building or other tax-paying development. Its flagship office building is not terribly noteworthy architecturally and needs a renovation and expansion that will probably burden the city even more. 
 At the same time, some of the world's poorest nations, forced to have a presence in one of the priciest places on earth, have to shoulder a huge financial burden of their own.
 The United Nations has always been an uneasy guest in our city. The parking tickets left unpaid and rental and lease agreements violated by United Nations delegates with diplomatic immunity have irritated New Yorkers for years. This egalitarian city does not take well to the presence of an elite that puts itself above our laws.
 So what city would be a good next home for the United Nations? How about Jerusalem? Such a move may revive an institution whose work may be more desperately needed today than at its inception half a century ago. 
 Jerusalem is a conundrum situated at a painful historical confluence. It is closer in the Western imagination to symbolizing all of humanity than any other place. An ancient, venerated city, Jerusalem sits at the bloody meeting ground of peoples at war. Jerusalem cries out for secular authority and global recognition, if only to preserve equal access for its worshippers and visitors of many faiths. Moving the United Nations there would decisively change the future of a city that has been shackled by its past.
 If the United Nations moved to Jerusalem, it could take over administrative control of the city. It could be responsible for public security and for maintaining public access to all historical sites. A new airport, administrative buildings, schools and housing would have to be built. Palestinian construction companies could build the new Secretariat. Israeli real estate entrepreneurs could sell gorgeous new and historic houses to foreign bureaucrats. 
 With the sale of the Turtle Bay property, the United Nations would start with a good nest egg, financed by the turnover of New York City real estate that has boomed in value and would be sold at the top of what may be a real estate bubble. Just think of what a few eight-figure ambassadorial residences in East Side co-ops would buy on Zion Hill. Such a move might finance months or years of United Nations' budgets and back assessments.
 For the world diplomatic corps, the problems of Sudan and the poverty of Gaza would no longer be at an abstract distance but immediate and real. A global institution at the geographical nexus of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, dedicated to world peace, would be more inspirational than all the high-rises in Manhattan. 
 It is, in a way, a pure New York solution. We as a city have always recognized that money and economic opportunity hold the promise of putting our political and religious differences into perspective.

LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN, THE BRONX IS BURNING
1977, Baseball, Politics, and the Battle
for the Soul of a City.
By Jonathan Mahler.
Illustrated. 356 pp. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $25.
 One summer afternoon in 1957 at Yankee Stadium, batting practice was under way, and Billy Martin felt horrible. Disconsolate and probably hung over, only recently traded from his beloved Yankees to the Kansas City Athletics, Martin had returned to New York for the first time since losing his pinstripes, and was about to take the field against his pals (and old drinking buddies) Mickey Mantle and Whitey Ford. The Roman Catholic archbishop of New York, Cardinal Francis Spellman, was in the stands, and asked for a word with Martin, the scrappy second baseman. As Jonathan Mahler tells the story in his entertaining and illuminating new book, ''Ladies and Gentlemen, the Bronx Is Burning,'' Spellman asked Martin how he liked Kansas City. ''Oh, just fine, Your Eminence,'' Martin answered. The more Martin thought about the prelate's kindly question, though, the gloomier he got. ''How do I like it in Kansas City?'' Martin mused once he was back on the field. ''I wanted to ask him, 'How would you like it in Kansas City?' '' New York was the thing; nothing else would do. Two decades later, in 1977, Martin was back in a Yankee uniform as the team's manager, standing in the spikes of Casey Stengel. ''Life is a very serious thing,'' Martin said, ''and baseball has been my life. What else has my life been? That's why, when I lose a ballgame, I can't eat. Sometimes I can hardly sleep. If you're in love with the game, you can't turn it on and off like a light. It's something that runs so deep it takes you over.''
 Martin might as well have been talking about New York itself. E. B. White called the city the ''capital of everything,'' and New Yorkers would not argue with him. The dramas particular to New York, a place of extremes, are more often of universal interest than, well, Kansas City's. It should not be surprising then that Mahler, a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine, believed a layered account of a single year in the life of the city, 1977, could sustain a book -- nor should it be surprising that he was right. In the long sweep of American history, of course, 1977 is not exactly 1865, 1941, 1968 or 2001. Yet from porn shops to gay bathhouses, from Yankee Stadium to City Hall, from the blackout to Son of Sam, from Rupert Murdoch's New York Post to the rise of SoHo and Studio 54, the city was living through what Mahler convincingly calls ''a transformative moment . . . a time of decay but of rehabilitation as well.'' 
 After a fire broke out in a school near Yankee Stadium during the 1977 World Series, Howard Cosell seemed to capture far more than a passing news story when he said on the air, ''There it is, ladies and gentlemen, the Bronx is burning'' -- at once encapsulating the era and giving Mahler his eventual title. The book is peopled with rich characters and strange, striking juxtapositions. In the Bronx, doing battle with one another and, occasionally, with opposing teams, there are Martin, George Steinbrenner and Reggie Jackson. In politics, Bella Abzug, Abe Beame, Ed Koch and Mario Cuomo go to war for the mayor's office, though one wonders why anyone would have wanted the job. Still at large, wielding a .44 Magnum, the serial killer Son of Sam writes a letter to Jimmy Breslin of The Daily News: ''Hello from the gutters of N.Y.C. which are filled with dog manure, vomit, stale wine, urine and blood.'' But you did not have to be a murderer who believed ''a father figure named Sam'' had told you to shoot people to detect signs of a fraying civic life in New York in 1977.
 Mahler marshals his evidence well. Crime had hit historic highs. Between 1973 and 1976 New York lost 340,000 jobs, and ''pornographic institutions'' grew from 9 in 1965 to 245 by 1977. When the power failed during a record heat wave in July, the blackout looting was epic and depressing; in the Bronx, a priest who went out to reassure his neighborhood came back to find his altar had been stolen. Christianity Today saw divine judgment in the power failure: ''The lack of electricity lit up the reality of people's minds and hearts. That's what people are like when separated from light and the light.''
 Murdoch's Post, meanwhile, the paper he bought from Dorothy Schiff, was shaking the city up with paparazzi and Page Six. Once a grand liberal institution, in March 1977 The Post ran 21 items on Farrah Fawcett-Majors. Its blaring headline for the blackout looting: ''24 Hours of Terror.'' The wise men of the establishment hated the sensationalism; they thought it bad for business. ''So your New York Post has now covered New York City's first big crisis since you took over,'' a chagrined Osborn Elliott, the former editor of Newsweek who was serving as deputy mayor for economic development, wrote Murdoch. ''Are you proud of what your headlines produced?''
 Still, for all the strife in the streets, a good time was had by many. ''Now is the summer of our discotheques,'' Anthony Haden-Guest wrote in New York magazine in June 1977. ''And every night is party night.'' Studio 54 took off; so did Plato's Retreat, the popular swingers' club. The first reported cases of the AIDS virus came in 1978, Mahler writes, which means 1977 ''was the last great year of unprotected, nonreproductive sex in the city.'' Worlds collided once when Abzug stopped off at the Continental Baths, which Mahler describes as a ''bathhouse/cabaret/disco.'' Shocked at what she saw, she called to scream at her campaign manager, crying: ''What the hell have you gotten me into? There are hundreds of guys up here wearing nothing but towels held together by Bella buttons!'' 
 BY using the Yankees as a central metaphor for the city's fortunes, Mahler is able to draw a nuanced portrait of this wild year. Baseball, like life, is at heart a prolonged test, a journey requiring skill, luck, patience and the capacity to lose dozens of games and still emerge as a winner. Like the city, the Yankees were roiled by internal woes but gave the world outsize personalities; like the city, they had dark moments yet endured, and, in six games in October against the Dodgers, prevailed, winning the World Series despite dugout jealousies, conflicts, crises and resentments. Martin -- Howard Cosell called him a ''beleaguered little pepperpot'' -- fought for respect as Jackson grew into one of baseball's first great independent superstars. Running on Scotch and self-doubt, Martin got the team to the Series in constant fear of his job (such was Steinbrenner's deft ownerly touch even then), but could not quiet his demons. 
 The future belonged not to Martin, who was a terrific manager but a terrified human being, fearful, his own worst enemy (though Steinbrenner ran a close second in that race). The New York being born in the heat of 1977 would instead be shaped, at least in the popular imagination, by men who did a better job of mastering their insecurities and channeling them into self-assertion. The ''emerging titans,'' as Mahler calls them, were Koch, who defeated Cuomo in the mayoral campaign, Jackson, Steinbrenner and Murdoch. ''They were flawed, farsighted, self-made men who intuitively understood the city's desire for drama and conflict because they shared it,'' Mahler writes. Down the years other figures would come to fit in this template of the transformative, men like Giuliani, Trump, Bloomberg. New York would see worse days than it did in 1977 -- indeed, on a brilliant blue September morning four years ago, the very worst of days -- but the city has always successfully made its way through what George Eliot once called the world's ''dim lights and tangled circumstance.'' In the wake of Reggie Jackson's legendary performance in Game 6 of the 1977 Series -- three home runs in three swings -- The New York Post asked, ''Who dares to call New York a lost cause?'' Who, indeed? Occasionally chaotic, yes; sometimes cruel; but never truly, finally, irretrievably lost.

HEADLINE: The Dodgers Have Opened By Leaping and Bounding

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY

 BODY:
Milton Bradley climbed the dugout steps Wednesday night and began jumping as he sensed another comeback victory unfolding for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Seven, eight, nine times, Bradley seemed to be bouncing on a trampoline. Up and down and up and down.
 When Bradley finally stopped, the Dodgers had burst ahead of the San Diego Padres and prevailed, 3-1, to extend their winning streak to eight games. A lot of the Dodgers have felt and played the way Bradley looked, with an emphasis on going up, not coming down.
 What made the streak especially exciting was that the Dodgers had come from behind in five of the victories. What made the streak especially rewarding was that they had done it with six players on the disabled list, including Eric Gagne, their intimidating closer, and Brad Penny, one of their best starting pitchers. 
 ''I think the start has meant more because of the manner in which we've done it,'' General Manager Paul DePodesta said. ''Some of those games could count for more than one win, from a psychological and confidence standpoint, for us.''
 Who are these Dodgers? Even after a three-game losing streak, the Dodgers have the snazziest record in the National League at 12-5 and are averaging nearly six runs a game. The Dodgers were depicted as dysfunctional after they did not re-sign Adrian Beltre, their 25-year-old superstar in the making. They also traded Shawn Green and did not re-sign Steve Finley and Alex Cora. 
 But DePodesta's plan was to make the Dodgers younger, to bring in players with postseason experience and to regain economic flexibility. His free-agent signings have worked out so far. Jeff Kent is hitting .348 and has been a stabilizer at second base. 
 Derek Lowe is 1-1 with a 1.27 earned run average. Right fielder J.D. Drew is hitting .378 in his last 12 games and will be an offensive force. 
 DePodesta, who took more hits than a tackling dummy at U.C.L.A. after trading the popular catcher Paul Lo Duca in a six-player deal with Florida last July, knows it is far too early to gloat. The Dodgers could still implode. The offense will not remain this powerful, and the starting rotation is good, not great. It features Lowe, Odalis Perez (3-0, 2.04 E.R.A. entering last night's game), Jeff Weaver (2-1, 6.00) and Penny, who is expected to return today.
 DePodesta would not gush about the speedy start. 
 ''A lot of people ask me if it feels nice to prove people wrong,'' he said. ''Quite frankly, not really. I just want to win games.''
 The combustible Bradley helps the Dodgers win and is entertaining, whether he is crushing a game-winning homer, putting his fingers to his lips to silence fans after making a catch or ridiculing himself after a lousy at-bat. Bradley, who was suspended last year for his tantrum after a plastic bottle was thrown from the stands, has five homers and 15 runs batted in, and is hitting .343. 
 About a week before the season opener, Bradley and Kent held a players-only meeting to discuss expectations. DePodesta was elated that the veterans had showed the leadership to remind their teammates that the games were about to become serious. Perhaps Bradley, like the Dodgers, is trying to alter his reputation. 
 ''Milton's brought a certain edge and a certain intensity with him,'' DePodesta said. ''He has expectations. That's definitely impacted our team.'' 
 Vin Scully, the team's broadcaster since 1950, pointed out during a recent telecast that many of the Brooklyn Dodgers had played together for several years before finally winning the 1955 World Series. 
 There was a mixture of delight and anticipation in Scully's silky voice as he noted that many of the 2005 Dodgers were teammates for the first time. So far, it feels right to these Dodgers. It feels like bouncing on a trampoline.

Can Clemens Keep This Up?
 Roger Clemens of the Houston Astros raced through his first 21 innings, giving up one run, striking out 26 and walking two. How much longer before the campaign for his return in 2006 begins? If the 42-year-old Clemens is still this remarkable and can still behave like a college senior by picking his own schedule with Houston, why not?
 Actually, Clemens was asked about this possibility last month, and he offered a typically rambling and typically Clemensesque response. Clemens, who has twice abandoned retirement plans, recounted how he would stay at an Astros game until the second inning, drive to see his son Koby's game and hustle back for the end of the Astros game. 
 ''Some of the parents who had just seen me in the dugout on TV couldn't believe it when they'd see me at Koby's game,'' Clemens said. ''Luckily, it only took 12 minutes to get there.'' 
 Cute story. But what about coming back in 2006? 
 ''Ten years ago, they didn't want me to continue,'' Clemens said, referring to how Dan Duquette, then the general manager of the Boston Red Sox, had said Clemens was in the twilight of his career. ''Now they won't let me stop. I think it's going to be even more difficult after this year to even entertain it.''
 It would be difficult, but not impossible. Tom Seaver, who pitched until he was almost 42 and tutored Clemens on gripping a slider while they were with Boston 19 years ago, said that leaving what you love doing is unbearable. 
 ''It becomes part of your soul,'' Seaver said. ''You don't want to stop pitching.''

Yankee in Boston
 When more than 20,000 runners lined up to run the Boston Marathon last Monday, at least one was daring enough to wear Yankee gear. It takes a brave soul to make that fashion choice, but Stephanie Cosola did. Her brother-in-law plays for the Yankees.
 Cosola's twin sister, Allyn, is married to John Flaherty, the Yankees' backup catcher. When Cosola told the Flahertys she was running in Boston, her fourth marathon in 50 weeks, they sent her a Yankees cap and shirt. 
 ''At first I was intimidated, but I'm a Yankee fan, so I wore it,'' Cosola said. ''I'm proud to be a Yankee.''
 In a passionate baseball city where T-shirts with derisive slogans about the Yankees are everywhere, Cosola was in the minority. Before the race, three men asked about her apparel. After she explained, they sheepishly revealed their identities.
 ''We're Yankee fans from Rochester,'' one said. ''We love John Flaherty.''
 A few hours later, Cosola stopped for water at Mile 16.
 ''You can have it,'' she said the man dispensing drinks had told her, ''even though you're a Yankee.''
 When Cosola flashed a glare that said, ''I've just run 16 miles, I'm from New York, do not mess with me,'' the man softened.
 ''But you look good,'' he said. ''You look really good as a Yankee.''
 The really good-looking Yankee, with hat and shirt intact, finished the race in just under four hours.

Mets Enjoy the Martinez Effect
 Pedro Martinez's outstanding pitching has given the Mets much more than results on the field. Because of him, the Mets have become relevant every fifth day, no matter what else is happening in baseball. He has that much presence. 
 But Martinez, who has always had a playful side, has also exhibited a sense of humor in his first season in New York. The Mets are discovering that Martinez, as approachable as a lion on the days he starts, can transform into a Jim Carrey wannabe when he is not pitching. 
 After Ramon Castro slapped the game-winning single to nudge the Mets past the Marlins, 4-3, on April 16, Martinez, holding a large garbage can above his head, greeted him in the clubhouse. 
 The gesture was Martinez's not-so-subtle way of teasing Castro about the size of his head. Next time, use this as a helmet, Martinez's actions seemed to say. But Castro did not need an explanation and howled at the lighthearted hazing.
 When was the last time a future Hall of Famer showed that much interest in a journeyman catcher? Martinez was making Castro feel like one of the guys and showing the Mets he could be one of the guys, too.

His Music Career Can Wait
 The knuckleballer Tim Wakefield signed an unusual contract that should enable him to finish his career with Boston, the team he has played for since 1995. Wakefield's one-year, $4 million extension with potential option years means he will pitch for the Red Sox as long as they want him and as long as he wants to be with them.
 Now that Wakefield is assured of being in Boston until at least 2006 and probably longer, he will have to wait to pursue his musical interests. Wakefield, an accomplished guitarist and singer, was asked recently if he would ever record an album, as his teammate Bronson Arroyo did. Wakefield said he could not envision doing something so involved until he had retired.
 For now, he can help with someone else's music. Wakefield performed backup vocals on ''7 Days,'' a song on ''Dream #29,'' the new album by the two-time Grammy nominee Cindy Bullens. 
 The lyrics are straight off Yawkey Way: ''I was 4 years old/Ted Williams played in town/My mother took my brother/She said I was too young/Well, he died today/I never saw him play/But I'm going see my baby in seven days.''

HEADLINE: One Day Makes the Week a Winner

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
A one-day rally on Thursday was enough to carry the three major stock market averages to net gains for the week, despite sharp declines on Wednesday that sent the indexes to new lows for the year.
 Fear of inflation helped set off Wednesday's stock selling. 
The immediate causes included a government report on consumer prices in March -- which rose more than expected -- and a Federal Reserve report suggesting that businesses around the country have been passing along rising costs to customers. 
 On Thursday, there was a powerful market rebound, as the three major indexes rose by more than 2 percent for the day. But on Friday, stocks fell again.
 Caterpillar, which rose more than 7.6 percent, was the best weekly performer in the Dow Jones industrial average. Other strong performers included Exxon Mobil, Intel, General Motors and United Technologies.
 For the week, the Dow gained 70.2 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 10,157.71. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 9.5 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 1,152.12. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 24.04 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,932.19. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note closed at 4.24 percent, unchanged from the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: A Board Turndown, and Then a Buyer With Board Ties

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
THE secretive process of getting a deal approved by a co-op board can be among the most mystifying and exasperating experiences in the life of a New Yorker. But when a board member wants an apartment that is in contract to someone else, the whole process can quickly veer into suspicion and misunderstanding. 
 That is what happened to Jeff Plaks, an Oklahoma man who was selling a one-bedroom co-op owned by his 94-year-old grandmother at 20 East 74th Street, at the corner of Madison Avenue.
 Mr. Plaks says he felt forced to sell to the close friend of a co-op board member after a deal that seemed a shoo-in was killed by the board. 
 But the board member, Ann H. Cook, who arranged for her friend, the lawyer Jack T. Litman, to buy the apartment, said she recused herself from board decisions on the apartment and didn't try to influence other board members. She said that she had been promised the right of first refusal to buy the apartment, and that Mr. Plaks reneged on that promise. 
 Mr. Plaks said that last year, his grandmother, Ruth Kamp, moved out of the apartment in preparation for a switch to an assisted-living home in Connecticut. Mrs. Kamp asked her grandson to help sell the unit, he said, and she told him to offer it first to her next-door neighbor, Ms. Cook, an art consultant and also a co-op board member.
 ''My grandmother said, 'If she wants it, give it to her at a slight discount,''' said Mr. Plaks, who grew up in Connecticut and now lives in Edmond, Okla., where he teaches Russian history at the University of Central Oklahoma. 
 Mr. Plaks said he spoke to brokers to determine what the market price would be and then took off about 10 percent to come up with a discounted price of $630,000 for Ms. Cook. 
 He said he spoke to Ms. Cook last May and she countered by saying that the apartment was worth only about $590,000, but that the price should be reduced further by 6 percent, to subtract the fee that would normally be paid to a real estate broker.
 ''She wanted it real cheap,'' Mr. Plaks said. ''I didn't even bother doing the math. I said $630,000 would be as low as it will go, take it or leave it, and she basically laughed and said: 'You're not going to get a buyer for the place. Please give me a call when you're ready to sell it to me.'''
 Mr. Plaks said he then asked Ms. Cook to recuse herself when it came time for the board to consider a buyer for the apartment. 
 ''I thought it would be the ethical thing to do,'' he said. ''She laughed and said: 'What kind of person do you think I am? Don't worry, you have nothing to fear.'''
 After Ms. Cook passed on his offer, Mr. Plaks hired a broker at Coldwell Banker Hunt Kennedy, who put the apartment on the market last June for $695,000. On Oct. 1, Mr. Plaks accepted a cash offer from a Connecticut couple for $670,000. Mr. Plaks said he was confident the buyers, an executive at a finance company and his wife, would be able to pass the board, because their financial statement included a seven-figure income and ample liquid assets. The couple planned to use the apartment primarily during the workweek. The building has a history of permitting such arrangements, so the brokers involved did not expect that to be an obstacle either.
 In fact, Mr. Plaks received other offers but said he chose this one because the brokers believed the couple would easily pass board scrutiny. But weeks went by, and the board did not schedule an interview with the buyer. Mr. Plaks was still awaiting word on the sale when he received what he considered an unusual telephone call in late November.
 ''Ann Cook gave me a call and said she wanted to know how much we had agreed upon,'' Mr. Plaks said. ''I told her and she just said, 'Well, if the deal falls through, would you sell it to me for the same price?' I said, 'I don't think it's going to fall through but if that were the case I'd sell it to you for what the market demands.' And she just laughed and said, 'I'll be calling you real soon.'''
 He said that within 48 hours he got a call from his broker saying that the board had rejected the buyers without ever having interviewed the couple. 
 Ms. Cook remembers the November phone call very differently. She said that Mr. Plaks had promised to give her the right to match any offers he received and that she had called to ask why he had not kept his promise. 
 ''That is utter garbage,'' Ms. Cook said of Mr. Plaks's version. ''I never said, 'I'll be calling you real soon.' On top of which, he had promised me that no matter what, he would give me the right of first refusal for any offer he had and he did not do so.'' Ms. Cook, who would discuss the events around the sale only briefly, said she did not participate in the board vote. ''I didn't vote,'' she said. ''I can't do that. I wouldn't do that.'' She said she also did not ask other board members to vote one way or the other. 
 ''There's just no way that this ever happened, that I could ever go to board members and say, 'Don't allow someone in,''' she said.
 Mr. Plaks said that Ms. Cook had asked him during their earlier talks for the right of first refusal, but that he told her he could not agree to do that. Mr. Plaks's broker, Lenore Silverstein of Coldwell Banker Hunt Kennedy, declined to be quoted for this story but she confirmed his account. 
 Gene Fein, a vice president at Stribling & Associates and the broker for the rejected buyer, said she had been shocked to learn he had been turned down. ''I was mortified,'' Ms. Fein said. ''The bottom line was that the exclusive broker took my buyer because she thought he was perfect; her manager and her fellow brokers thought he was perfect. I thought he was perfect, my manager thought he was perfect, the board package was lovely, he was not taking a mortgage. 
 ''He just got caught in some internal politics and it was horrifying to everybody.'' 
 Mr. Plaks said that after he found out the buyer had been turned down, he got another call from Ms. Cook, asking when his exclusive contract with his broker was to expire. ''She wanted to cut her out,'' Mr. Plaks said, observing that without a broker's commission in play, a buyer could argue for a reduced price. He told Ms. Cook that he was keeping the broker.
 On Nov. 26, Ms. Cook gave Mr. Plaks's broker a written offer for the apartment, matching the $670,000 price of the failed deal. But Mr. Plaks initially declined her offer and instead considered taking up the offer of one of the other prospective buyers who had made bids during the fall.
 But by now, Ms. Cook had a broker of her own and was pursuing the apartment more aggressively. Mr. Plaks said he began to worry that the board would reject his new buyer as well, and ultimately decided that it was in his grandmother's best interest to sell the apartment to Ms. Cook, rather than face another board turndown. 
 But there were to be no more discounts. ''My grandmother said no special deals for her; she's made our life very difficult,'' Mr. Plaks said. In late December, he said, Ms. Cook agreed to pay $680,000 in cash for the apartment. She said she planned to combine the unit with her apartment next door. 
 But there was yet another wrinkle. Mr. Plaks soon learned that Ms. Cook did not intend to buy the apartment after all. Instead he was told that Mr. Litman, who was identified to him as Ms. Cook's fiance, would be the buyer. Mr. Litman is best known as the lawyer for Robert E. Chambers Jr., the man who killed Jennifer Levin in 1986 in what came to be known as the preppy murder case. 
 Mr. Plaks said he worried that such a controversial figure would not get through the board. He said he was also told that the package Mr. Litman submitted to the board was sketchy and lacked some basic financial documentation. Then it turned out that, despite the earlier cash offer, Mr. Litman would be getting a mortgage. Finally, Mr. Litman was approved by the board in mid-March and the deal closed on March 21. Mr. Litman did not return repeated telephone calls.
 So what happened behind closed doors at the co-op board? ''I don't discuss board matters,'' said the board president, Theodore J. Freiser. ''They are confidential.'' He refused to say if Ms. Cook had voted or participated in any discussion of Mrs. Kamp's apartment sale. ''Your understanding of the situation is wrong,'' Mr. Freiser said. ''There is no conflict of interest.'' 
 Mr. Freiser refused to say how often the board had rejected potential buyers. Real estate brokers who track co-op sales identified 11 other apartments that had been sold in the building since August 2003. The listing brokers or the sellers of each of those apartments said in interviews that they had not had any buyers turned down by the board. 
 JoAnne Kennedy, the chief operating officer of Coldwell Banker Hunt Kennedy, said the experience at 20 East 74th Street shows why the co-op system is ripe for reform. ''This is an extreme misuse of co-op board power,'' Ms. Kennedy said. ''Co-ops say they're private clubs and they act like private clubs and they play by those rules and therefore fair housing isn't even a topic.''
 For his part, Mr. Plaks came away from the transaction feeling bitter and angry. ''You've got this co-op that can do whatever it wants without any transparency and without any accountability,'' he said. ''I tend to trust people and operate on a handshake and all those stupid things nobody would dare do in New York.''

Home with a Different View
 Jane Lauder is joining the migration of the well-heeled from their traditional breeding ground east of Central Park to the treeless precincts of Lower Manhattan. 
 She plans to occupy a newly purchased $12.63 million penthouse triplex with a terrace in a recently converted building in NoLIta. 
 Ms. Lauder, 31, the daughter of Ronald Lauder and the granddaughter of the cosmetics pioneer Estee Lauder, is vice president for marketing for the Estee Lauder brands American Beauty and Flirt! She is married to Kevin M. Warsh, 35, who works in the White House as a special assistant to the president for economic policy. Mr. Warsh has his primary residence in Washington, according to the White House press office.
 The couple were married in April 2002 at Mr. Lauder's estate in Palm Beach, Fla. Two years earlier, Ms. Lauder gave an interview to Harper's Bazaar, in which she showed off her apartment on Park Avenue on the Upper East Side.
 That article highlighted Ms. Lauder's collections of snow globes and modern art and described an apartment full of works by Ellsworth Kelly, Jasper Johns, Warhol, Matisse, Lichtenstein and de Kooning and furniture designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and Alvar Aalto.

HEADLINE: The N.F.L. Draft: A Study in Cockeyed Overconfidence

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
MORE than 40 years ago at a California hospital, a group of clinical psychologists were given some basic information about a 29-year-old man. They were asked to evaluate his personality and to say how confident they were in their diagnoses.
 The psychologists then received more details about the man, after which they could change their evaluation and their level of confidence. The cycle was repeated twice more, with additional information about the man made available each time. 
 The psychologists' judgments never improved much from their first impressions, but they came to believe more and more strongly in their diagnoses at each stage. The experiment, by Stuart Oskamp, became a classic study of overconfidence.
 This weekend at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York, before a national television audience and with millions of dollars at stake, the experiment will be repeated. Only this time it will be called the National Football League draft, the annual event at which teams choose college players.
 Like the psychologists -- or like homebuyers, corporate officers, stock-market investors and just about everyone else -- the N.F.L. executives will have to make big decisions based on incomplete information. And many of them will vastly overestimate their ability to forecast the future.
 After collecting data from the last 17 drafts, two economists -- Cade Massey at Duke and Richard H. Thaler at the University of Chicago -- have found a striking pattern. Again and again, teams value the top picks far too highly. They trade two or three picks from further down in the draft, or from the following year's draft, to move up only a few spots, believing that their eye for talent makes a slightly better draft position very valuable. Last year, for example, the Giants traded four picks for the draft's top pick, Eli Manning. 
 But history often proves these kinds of moves wrong. In the 1983 draft, considered the best ever for quarterbacks, Todd Blackledge, Tony Eason and Ken O'Brien were drafted before Dan Marino. Mr. Marino went on to rewrite the record book; the other three became journeymen. In 1999, which drew frequent comparisons to 1983, Akili Smith, who is now out of the league, was picked before Daunte Culpepper, today a star quarterback in Minnesota.
 ''Even the smartest guys in the world, the guys who spend hours with game film, can't predict this with much success,'' Mr. Massey said. ''There's no crime in that. The crime is thinking you can predict it.''
 When mulling trades, N.F.L. teams use a chart that lists the relative value of each pick. With his staff, Jimmy Johnson, the coach of the Dallas Cowboys in the early 1990's, invented the original version by analyzing past trades to figure out the draft's exchange rate. 
 The typical chart places a value of 3,000 on the first pick. That falls to less than 1,500 for the 10th -- making it worth less than half the first pick in a trade -- and to about 600 for the 32nd pick, the last in the first round. 
 To determine whether those values were accurate, Mr. Massey and Mr. Thaler looked at a number of measures, like games started, appearances in the N.F.L. all-star game and salaries.
 High picks indeed tended to be better than lower ones. But the gaps were much smaller than the N.F.L. charts suggested. The 32nd pick was worth more than half of the top pick on average, rather than just a fifth. 
 Even allowing for some inaccuracy in their measurements, the economists said, there was little doubt that trading up rarely paid off, especially because high picks must be paid so much more.
 So why do teams do it? People tend to be overconfident, like the psychologists in the California study or investors sure they can beat the market. They also suffer from what researchers call ''false consensus,'' believing the rest of the world is more like them than it really is. Ask a group of iPod owners what percentage of Americans own iPods, and they will usually overestimate. Similarly, N.F.L. executives tend to think all teams rank players similarly and that their team must trade up to the 10th pick to get the 10th best player. 
 The top picks that work out also tend to linger in executives' memories. 
 ''It's always easier to remember the touchdowns rather than the fumbles,'' said Gil Brandt, a Cowboys executive for almost 30 years.
 But if you recognize the uncertainty in the world, you can react to it in ways that improve your decisions. 
 Doctors can refrain from putting too much faith in their own diagnoses. Employers trying to fill a job can avoid thinking that there is only one good candidate -- the one they have spotted.
 More than anything, the research on the N.F.L. draft by Mr. Massey and Mr. Thaler suggests the value of humility when it comes to making judgments. The team that has done the most recent trading to get additional lower draft picks is the New England Patriots, winners of three of the last four Super Bowls. A decade ago, it was Mr. Johnson's Cowboys. Once the chart told him the going rate for high draft picks, he swapped a few of them for lots of low ones, creating the core of a team that also won three championships.
 ''It's like these shrimp boats,'' Mr. Johnson said by telephone from the Florida Keys last week. With their big nets, ''they'll get some trash, but they'll also get some real good fish.''

HEADLINE: How to Be Your Own Publisher

BYLINE: By Sarah Glazer. 
Sarah Glazer last wrote for the Book Review in December about electronic books.

 BODY:
When Amy Fisher finished writing her memoir about shooting her lover's wife, she told her agent not to send the manuscript to New York publishers. Instead, Fisher, who made headlines in 1992 as the 17-year-old ''Long Island Lolita,'' turned to iUniverse in Lincoln, Neb. The company charges authors several hundred dollars to convert a manuscript into a book and make it available for sale online. 
 Fisher's ''If I Knew Then,'' which came out in September, is probably the first sure-fire success to start out under the imprint of a so-called self-publishing company. (Other self-published books, notably ''The Celestine Prophecy'' and ''The Christmas Box,'' became best sellers, but their success was a surprise to the publishing industry.) 
 iUniverse is one of more than 100 ''author services'' companies in a fast-growing industry aimed primarily at writers who can't get the attention of traditional publishers. Earlier this month Amazon.com got into the act, announcing that it had acquired BookSurge, a printing company with a self-publishing division based in Charleston, S.C. BookSurge uses print-on-demand technology that makes it possible to guarantee a two-day turnaround to print a book, even if only one customer orders a copy. 
 For the first time, print-on-demand companies are successfully positioning themselves as respectable alternatives to mainstream publishing and erasing the stigma of the old-fashioned vanity press. Some even make a case that they give authors an advantage -- from total control over the design, editing and publicity to a bigger share of the profits. 
 It was the issue of control that appealed to Amy Fisher and her co-author, Robbie Woliver, editor in chief of the weekly Long Island Press, where Fisher has a column. They were confident that the book would sell well; indeed it appeared on the New York Times paperback best-seller list on Oct. 24, if only for a week. ''We figured we might make more money doing it this way,'' says Woliver, who called the royalties ''significantly higher'' than traditional publishers', though he would not reveal the percentage. (In a departure, iUniverse did not charge a fee for producing the book.) But he also notes that Fisher was ''determined not to be sensationalized'' by the media, which she says presented a distorted picture of her as a promiscuous teenager (perhaps following the lead of prosecutors in the shooting case, who maintained she had been a call girl). She wanted to control every aspect of the advertising and media interviews, Woliver says. ''We knew that wasn't going to happen with a traditional publisher.'' 
 Self-publishing companies like iUniverse have been growing rapidly in recent years, displacing old-style vanity presses and competing with the number of titles produced by traditional houses. AuthorHouse in Bloomington, Ind., which leads the pack with more than 23,000 titles, sold approximately one million volumes between 1997, when it started business, and 2002; in 2003 alone, it sold another million volumes, mostly through online retailers, according to the company. Amazon would have some catching up to do to get to those levels; on the other hand, since it has nearly 47 million customer accounts, the potential growth for its print-on-demand business is obviously enormous. 
 The difference between traditional vanity presses and modern print-on-demand publishing is essentially technology. Instead of expensive offset printing, which mainstream publishers use, print-on-demand relies on a glorified digital printer. The top three self-publishers -- AuthorHouse, iUniverse and Xlibris, based in Philadelphia -- all use the technology, and introduced a total of 11,906 new titles last year, according to R. R. Bowker's Books in Print database. By contrast, one of the few remaining old-style vanity presses, the 56-year-old Vantage Press in New York, produces between 300 and 600 titles a year.
 Meanwhile, for as little as $459, iUniverse will turn a manuscript into a paperback with a custom cover design, provide an International Standard Book Number -- publishing's equivalent of an ID number to place the book in a central bibliographic database -- and make it available at Amazon.com, barnesandnoble.com and other online retailers. (Vantage charges anywhere from $8,000 to $50,000 for a limited quantity of copies, some owned by the author and the rest warehoused by Vantage.) 
 ''Publishing has been an arcane specialist skill under the control of a guild of people that are unique and different from anyone else,'' the founder and chief executive of Xlibris, John Feldcamp, says. ''Those skills have been so complicated they haven't been accessible to normal human beings. What's happening is all the technologies of publishing are becoming increasingly cheap and accessible,'' as almost every aspect of production, including design and printing, has gone digital. 
 ''Companies like Random House and Simon & Schuster are in the process of investing in highly valuable properties. They want to find Deepak Chopra; they don't want to find a writer necessarily who has an audience of 10,000 people,'' Feldcamp says. Ultimately, he predicts, ''companies like us will support the lion's share of content out there,'' though probably not of best sellers, he concedes. The majority of books produced by self-publishers sell a few hundred copies at most. 
 Choosing to operate occasionally as a traditional publisher and offering better financial incentives, as iUniverse did recently for Fisher, ''isn't very hard'' for print-on-demand publishers, Feldcamp says, ''because they operate under a far more efficient set of economics than classic publishers.'' For example, after an initial offset printing of 30,000 copies, iUniverse has relied on print-on-demand to meet orders for Fisher's book as they come in. That means ''no excess inventory sitting in a warehouse, only to be remaindered,'' the company's chief executive, Susan Driscoll, says. 
 In today's world, where books are increasingly bought online, getting one's book into the central bibliographic database, known as BooksInPrint.com, is the cyberspace equivalent of getting published. The database is the primary source for major distributors like Ingram Book Group, whose listings in turn feed into the computerized offerings at Amazon, Barnes & Noble and Borders. 
 With all this democratic activity, self-published authors have essentially become the bloggers of the publishing world, with approximately the same anarchic range in quality that you find on the Web. Indeed, companies like AuthorHouse and iUniverse say they will accept pretty much anything for publication. ''That's the big problem with self-publishing and the stigma associated with it,'' Driscoll admits. 
 Most bookstores are reluctant to stock self-published books -- as their authors are disappointed to discover -- because they carry the vanity press taint, they aren't returnable and they aren't discounted as much as traditional books. In addition, major newspapers, including The New York Times, won't review vanity press books. 
 Driscoll is trying to overcome these obstacles with iUniverse's ''Star'' program, which will select two or three books a month that have passed an internal editorial review and sold more than 500 copies apiece. ''Star'' books will be returnable and competitively discounted, Driscoll says, and she plans to send galleys to magazines and newspapers in hopes of getting review attention. The company also presents those books to buyers at Barnes & Noble, which owns a minority stake in iUniverse, for display and stocking in its stores. 
 But only about 150 titles have been chosen for this treatment out of the company's approximately 20,000 titles. Steve Riggio, Barnes & Noble's chief executive, cautions, ''If a writer would like to get a book into bookstores, iUniverse is not the right route.'' Only about half a dozen iUniverse books will be stocked in his stores at any one time, he estimates. At the same time, he says, ''we would like publishers to have their eye on iUniverse'' as a ''farm team'' for promising new authors. 
 In that regard, self-publishers can point to a few success stories. Natasha Munson, a single mother in Atlanta, recently received a $250,000 advance and a two-book contract from Hyperion after she published her first book through iUniverse in 1999 at a cost of $99. (Prices have risen since.) In May and June Hyperion will bring out both books, inspirational guides for African-American women. Munson says stores were ''skeptical'' of self-publishing and it was difficult to persuade them to stock ''Life Lessons for My Black Girls'' in 1999 (now called ''Life Lessons for My Sisters''). Instead she made sales by sending promotional postcards to black sororities and sending e-mail messages to book clubs. 
 Eventually, Munson sold more than 20,000 copies of the book. That impressed a New York literary agent, David Dunton, who contacted her after reading a magazine article about her last spring. Dunton says he normally views self-publishing as the ''land of last resort.'' But he adds that publishers these days are looking for appealing personalities like Munson who can promote their own books on the talk show circuit. ''It's not all about the writing anymore,'' he said. ''You have to look good and sound good.'' 
 Unfortunately, aspiring writers eager to believe that a publisher has chosen them can also be led astray. Last year more than 130 writers petitioned the attorney general of Maryland and other government agencies to investigate PublishAmerica, a print-on-demand company in Frederick, Md., which describes itself as a ''traditional publishing company'' on its Web site.
 The authors say they were duped when they signed contracts with the company, because it is actually a vanity press. In press accounts and in promotions to its writers, the company has maintained that it is highly selective. But Dee Power, an Arizona writer in the forefront of the petition campaign, questions that claim. She says PublishAmerica accepted a bogus manuscript from her that repeated the same 10 pages eight times and changed the main characters' names halfway through. She and other writers say they were shocked by the sloppy editing of their manuscripts and falsely led to believe that stores would stock their books. (The government agencies have so far declined to investigate.)
 PublishAmerica does not charge a fee; it pays a ''symbolic, token $1 advance'' to most first-time authors, the company's president, Larry A. Clopper, told me. The irate authors contend that the way the company makes a profit is by demanding a list of 100 of the author's friends and family members, whom they bombard with order forms, and by persuading authors to buy books themselves. To that Clopper responds that most authors agree to provide the list, and that the largest source of the company's revenue comes from established booksellers. As for the company's selectivity, while he conceded that PublishAmerica accepts ''far more'' manuscripts than the traditional publishers, Clopper said, ''We reject them all the time because of poor quality.'' 
 Another complaint the authors had was with the PublishAmerica contract, which gives the company exclusive rights to publish a book for seven years (in contrast to iUniverse, for example, whose contract permits an author to shift his book to another publisher at any time). Clopper now says that PublishAmerica is offering an amendment to the standard contract that will permit authors to publish elsewhere -- though they have to request it. 
 Such disputes aside, self-publishing has attracted the interest of some major publishers as well as booksellers. ''What's interesting is the capability of having micro-niches that are so small that publishers would not be interested in publishing them in the traditional way,'' says Richard Sarnoff, the president of Random House Ventures, which owns a minority stake in Xlibris. ''Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Banding,'' a best seller at iUniverse.com, might be a good example of that, not to mention ''Be Brief. Be Bright. Be Gone: Career Essentials for Pharmaceutical Representatives,'' which has sold more than 10,000 copies -- all online, according to David Currier, one of its co-authors.
 Sometimes self-publishing offers a second chance. Laurie Notaro, a former columnist for The Arizona Republic, was turned down by more than 70 publishers when she sent out her first book, a collection of humor essays about life as a young single. So she turned to iUniverse. A literary agent saw an ad Notaro placed on Amazon.com, on the page for the ''Sweet Potato Queens'' series, which also appeals to a female audience. The agent took on Notaro and sold her collection to Villard, which had rejected the book on its initial rounds. Notaro's ''Idiot Girls' Action-Adventure Club'' reached No. 10 on the Times paperback best-seller list in 2002. 
 ''New York houses miss out on a lot of books that have worked,'' says Notaro's agent, Jenny Bent of the Trident Media Group, who also represents the ''Sweet Potato Queens.'' ''I've had a fair amount of success selling self-published books.''
 To some in the New York publishing world, self-published books still carry the stigma of the old vanity presses. But other editors say self-publishing can be a plus if an author has sold a healthy number of copies that way. Angelle Pilkington, an editor at Puffin, was impressed that one author, Charisse Richardson, had sold 10,000 copies of her first children's book, ''The Real Slam Dunk,'' through her own efforts. ''It was a very nice number and added some credibility when we got the manuscript,'' she says. Puffin's sister imprint Dial brought out the book, about two African-American children who get career advice from a basketball star, in February, and will publish a second children's book by Richardson in the fall. 
 Fireside and Touchstone, formerly paperback divisions of Simon & Schuster, have reissued a half-dozen self-published books successfully, according to Mark Gompertz, publisher of both houses. Most recently, Fireside brought out Matthew Kelly's inspirational book, ''The Rhythm of Life: Living Every Day With Passion and Purpose,'' which sold 100,000 copies as a self-published book. Under the Fireside imprint it became a New York Times best seller. 
 In a retail world increasingly dominated by national bookstore chains, it's hard to sell books by new authors without a track record, according to Gompertz. ''I often say to these people, 'You should try self-publishing first, get yourself known on Web sites and start building an audience and sales; when you have it, come back, because then we can make the case that we can get you out in a big way.' '' 
 Some established authors have turned to self-publishing because they're unable to interest their publishers in a new genre. Piers Anthony, who is known for fantasy and science fiction titles, has published more than 15 books with Xlibris, either to release serious historical fiction or to make out-of-print books available. Joyce Maynard, William F. Buckley Jr. and Marlin Fitzwater, the former White House press secretary, are among the authors who have turned to self-publishing to bring their books back into print. 
 One New York literary agent, Harvey Klinger, recently advised a best-selling author to publish her latest novel with iUniverse after it was rejected by several New York houses. According to Klinger, publishers complained that Kathryn Harvey's ''Private Entrance'' -- which he describes as ''sexy suspense'' -- fit into neither the ''chick lit'' category nor the older woman's audience (sometimes called ''hen lit''). 
 ''The self-publishing route has become a viable alternative for a lot of these authors who can't conveniently categorize what they're doing,'' Klinger says. With the trend toward publishers consolidating, the number of houses where authors can seek out bids is also diminishing, he notes. ''I think the growth of iUniverse and small-press publishing is a direct result.'' 
 Some industry observers suggest that established authors and novices who aspire to commercial success will remain a small fraction of the self-publishing industry. At six of its Philadelphia-area stores, Borders has been offering a take-home self-publishing kit for $19.99 as an experiment. For between $299 and $598, customers can have a manuscript converted into a book by Xlibris, be listed on Amazon.com and get shelf space in Borders. 
 Michael Spinozzi, executive vice president of the Borders Group, notes that the future of self-publishing may be in altogether less commercial forms. ''People are looking to come away with 20 copies of something very personal and very important to them: a cookbook with all the recipes they've collected through their lives; capturing a sporting season or a major occasion,'' he says. 
 Indeed, someday you may be able to walk into your grocery store and convert your Christmas photos into an instant coffee-table book written in your own deathless prose, Xlibris's Feldcamp predicts. Almost anybody will be able to say, ''I published my book last week.''

HEADLINE: Economic Jitters Hit Community Not Used to Lean Times

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

DATELINE: MARIETTA, Ga., April 22 

 BODY:
Inflation is tamer here than in the rest of the country, and gas is somewhat cheaper. The number of new people asking for unemployment is falling. Even so, for this affluent community just north of Atlanta, economic anxiety is creeping in.
 The shopping district around the town square, usually prime real estate, is dotted with rental signs. Paul Lubertazzi, the owner of Traveling Fare Catering, plans to redo his menu this weekend, raising prices to cover increased food and delivery costs. Hakan Senkal and his wife, Semra, have moved into the apartment above their restaurant and laid off the cook. Their weekday business has dwindled to just a few diners. 
 ''The people, they bring their own lunches with them,'' Mr. Senkal said. ''They don't want to spend money.''
 Reluctance to spend is one of the signs of trouble burbling beneath the smooth statistics churned out by the state's Department of Labor. Merchants like Mr. Lubertazzi, who have been struggling to absorb rising costs instead of passing them on to their customers, are beginning to reach their limits. Jobs are not scarce, but high-paying jobs are disappearing, said John Helton, the executive director of CobbWorks, a job placement and training center in Marietta, part of Cobb County.
 Last month, AT&T laid off 351 people who earned an average of $19 an hour. They had worked there an average of eight years, and many had no college degree, Mr. Helton said. They have little hope, he said, of finding a new job at the same level. He said he had heard stories about people who had been earning more than $100,000 taking jobs for $50,000 or $60,000. CobbWorks, a government contractor, is rated in part on how much of people's lost wages they are able to restore. The goal is 92 percent, but right now that figure is 84 percent, Mr. Helton said.
 ''We're in the process of renegotiating with the state, saying, 'Look, this is what's happening out there,''' he said.
 One client, Pat Washington, 39, was laid off after four months as a temporary worker selling wireless telephone plans. She said the company had told her that the job was likely to become permanent. 
 She said she had already cut back. ''I was just reading in the news yesterday that the gas prices are affecting the farmers, and that's going to eventually affect us with the groceries,'' she added.
 She is looking for work in retail sales, attending job fairs and sending out resumes. But gas prices have risen to an average of $2.11 a gallon in Georgia, up from $1.62 on Jan. 1, according to the Oil Price Information Service, which monitors gas prices for the American Automobile Association. 
 Although that is cheaper than the average price of $2.22 a gallon nationwide, job-hunting in Atlanta's sprawling metropolitan area has become more expensive. ''If I get called for interviews, I need to know if they're really going to hire before I go driving all the way there,'' Ms. Washington said. 
 Individual drivers are not the only ones suffering from higher fuel prices. Throughout Atlanta, schools have gone back to their boards for more money to cover the cost of fueling school buses. Fulton County schools needed an extra $600,000, and Gwinnett County an additional $300,000.
 Kerry Rees, director of fleet maintenance for the DeKalb County Schools, said his system had made two requests for a total of $800,000. The budget was originally $2.3 million. ''For our school system a one-penny change in fuel over a year has a $20,000 impact,'' Mr. Rees said. ''You're frustrated because you have no control over it.''
 For next year, he said, DeKalb schools have increased the fuel request to $2.8 million. ''Hopefully prices will come down,'' Mr. Rees said. ''If they stay where they are now that's not going to be enough money.'' 
 With a dearth of public transportation, Atlanta residents are particularly vulnerable to gas prices. But the city is also home to Hartsfield International Airport, the world's busiest passenger airport, where Delta Air Lines is both the anchor tenant and an emblem of the city's growth into an international hub. As Delta struggles to climb out of bankruptcy -- an effort that is front page news in Atlanta -- the price of fuel threatens to drag the airline back down.
 Here in Marietta, there was a sense of hunkering down -- of hope that things would turn around. The Senkals opened their restaurant, called Efes on the Square, four years ago. They used to live in an apartment above the restaurant but were doing well enough two years ago to buy a three-bedroom house with a swimming pool. Now, the house is shuttered and they are back in the apartment. Their take-home pay has dropped to zero.
 Mr. Senkal said his wife wanted to sell everything and move back to Turkey, their homeland. But he wants to wait, pinning his hopes of more customers on a $5 million restoration of a historic theater on the corner. 
 Next door to Efes, at Sarah Jean's Ice-Cream-N-Sweets, people strolled in for $2 cones. Among them was Jeff Dietz, with his daughter Rachel, 9, and son Zachary, 6. Asked about the economy, Mr. Dietz smiled and said, ''Well, I'm a Delta mechanic.''
 In January, he took a 10 percent pay cut. But his wife, an accountant, entered her busy season. ''She offset it enough that we haven't seen it yet,'' Mr. Dietz said. ''We'll probably start to see it this summer.''
 But Mr. Dietz took a philosophical view. ''Seems like if we hold out long enough, things will improve,'' he said. ''You do have to have ice cream.''

An article on Sunday about economic anxiety in Georgia misstated Delta Air Lines' financial situation. The company narrowly averted bankruptcy last fall; it did not go into bankruptcy.

HEADLINE: Washington's Egghead Quotient Keeps Growing

BYLINE: By ANNE E. KORNBLUT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IRVING KRISTOL snubbed New York when he left for Washington in 1988, pronouncing Manhattan no longer the ''nation's intellectual center'' as he packed off his ideological enterprise.
 The Atlantic Monthly does not have as lofty a motive for moving to Washington in the months ahead. David Bradley, the owner of the venerable magazine, said the recent decision to move and consolidate his publishing enterprises in Washington was driven by economics, not symbolism or a desire for cachet.
 But the news has given some readers, writers and thinkers -- not to mention Bostonians -- a familiar pang of anxiety, a reminder that even in the democratic Internet age, all cultural capitals are not created equal. 
 ''Spurred by the Atlantic's decision to leave Boston for Washington, D.C., it seems likely that other prominent institutions will follow suit,'' wrote Alex Beam, the Boston Globe columnist, in a recent parody predicting that Harvard and the Museum of Fine Arts would be next. 
 Boston's inferiority complex aside, the attention paid to The Atlantic's move -- and to news that the celebrity-publisher Judith Regan plans to set up shop in Los Angeles rather than in New York -- suggests that there is a stronger bond between cities and their intellectual elites than one might expect in an era of BlackBerry pagers and online magazines. 
 However far the geographic divides have been bridged, certain places are doing better than others. The interplay between personal contact and ideas still matters, at least somewhat.
 And while three East Coast cities have jockeyed for prominence, a perceptible southward tilt is continuing, as Boston has evolved from its liberal arts and political origins, and Washington has, in a sense, matured. Intellectuals still reside in Boston, New York and Washington (and hop the shuttle easily among the three), but in a highly charged political environment, there has been a move away from academic ideas toward ones generated in the real world, or at least real government. The think tankAnd if not that, then in think tanks. ''It's partly what grows up around a government over time,'' said Jacob Weisberg, the editor in chief of the online magazine Slate, which moved its headquarters from Seattle to New York this year after Microsoft sold it to the Washington Post Company. Slate also maintains a sizable Washington office.
 ''If you're doing a national magazine of any kind, particularly one that emphasizes politics or policy, you do miss a lot not being based in New York or D.C.,'' Mr. Weisberg said. 
 ''Slate was in Seattle for seven years and it worked well because with e-mail, the 'reply all' button is the new water cooler,'' he added. ''But you do lose something being away from the fulcrum of whatever you're writing about. I think that in an intangible way, it does take a toll.''
 Washington has become the beneficiary of a gradual intellectual migration. As industry-financed think tanks grow and finance a culture of policy analysts and serious thinkers with ideological differences, more intellectuals have been drawn to a city previously considered a backwater of shallow politicians and colorless government bureaucrats. 
 ''My father told me he went to Washington once or twice maybe when he was just out of the Army, to see the sights,'' said William Kristol, the son of Irving Kristol. It was only when John F. Kennedy became president in 1960 that the city ''for the first time began to mix the intellectual and political worlds,'' said the younger Mr. Kristol, who in 1995 founded the conservative Weekly Standard magazine here.
 Intellectual creativity and politics have grown ever more intertwined in the nation's capital in the half-century since the last president from Massachusetts was in office, the result of a boom in the election industry, ongoing partisan warfare and the sheer size of government, among other things. 
 So while there are public intellectuals today who write mainly about Washington but live in New York -- Fareed Zakaria, the foreign policy specialist, and Joe Klein, the political writer, are two well-known examples -- there is less insistence that creative types live only in New York. Fewer writers are repelled by the idea of living inside the Beltway. 
 Louis Menand, the New Yorker writer and Harvard literature professor, who has also worked in Washington, said that while the capital has ''this reputation of being wonky and boring,'' this can be appealing for practitioners of ideas. Washington journalists especially ''become suddenly interesting in a way they might not be in New York,'' where they are competing with artists, actors, restaurateurs, advertising executives and Wall Street moguls for prestige, he said.
 If any city is the loser in that equation, it is Boston. Academia, the core of Boston's identity, has lost its firm claim as the birthplace of ideas, a trend that liberals have lamented but been unable to reverse. In the contest to be the country's intellectual capital, Boston ''has been losing to New York over the years, the last 100 years or so, and I suppose that will just continue,'' said Nathan Glazer, the Harvard social scientist who made his name as a New York intellectual. 
 Founded in 1857, The Atlantic was given its name by Oliver Wendell Holmes, the writer, to represent a link between Europe and America, ''a carrier of cultural and intellectual goods'' between the continents, according to the author Ellery Sedgwick. That was at a time when Boston's role as the political and ideological engine of the Revolution and the center of Abolitionist sentiment before the Civil War remained vivid in the public imagination. 
 But by the time of Irving Kristol's move to Washington in 1988, the capital had begun to eclipse the Hub of the Universe. New York too, in his view, was on the wane. 
 ''If you want an animated discussion of 'large ideas' about God, human destiny, Western civilization, modern art, the future of democracy, etc., you are better served in Cambridge, Mass., or Chicago's Hyde Park than in New York,'' Mr. Kristol wrote in a farewell essay in The New Republic. ''Greenwich Village today is populated by itinerant consumers of such ideas, and New York's magazines are staffed by upwardly mobile men and women who purvey such ideas. But very few are grappling seriously with those ideas. As the city with the most consumers and the most purveyors, New York retains a semblance of an intellectual center. But the reality is not there.''
 Then again, he wasn't terribly impressed with the capital, either. ''And Washington?'' he added. ''It's certainly not here, either, and never has been.''
 But at least it is still trying.

HEADLINE: Finding a Market by Meeting Diabetics' Needs

BYLINE: By STEWART AIN

 BODY:
THE president of a marketer of a variety of products for diabetics said that he decided to develop them because his diabetic mother could never find the right medications.
 ''I owe it all to Mom,'' said Gary M. April, the president of Health Care Products, a division of the Hi-Tech Pharmacal Company in Amityville. ''She used to buy cough medicine that was loaded with sugar and all kinds of stuff because there was nothing on the shelf for diabetics.''
 Mr. April, 48, was hired by Hi-Tech in 1992 after 15 years in the consumer-products industry and in sales and marketing in the pharmaceutical industry. 
 ''I had been in high-level positions, and I had industry knowledge,'' he said. ''They said they had R&D, manufacturing and shipping and that we could take advantage of that infrastructure and with the right deals be successful. But we had almost no budget.''
 Shortly after he was hired, Mr. April said, he came across a sugar-free cough syrup that Hi-Tech had made a few years earlier but had never sold. 
 ''They didn't know how to market it, and they couldn't get it off the ground,'' he said. ''People years ago were not thinking of sugar-free the way we do today. We said this product makes obvious sense except that it had alcohol, sodium and dyes. So we told the chemist at Hi-Tech to take out everything but the active ingredients, that we needed a formula that would be totally suitable for diabetics.''
 To overcome the lack of money for marketing, Health Care Products came up with a product name, Diabetic Tussin, that was instantly recognizable by the target audience. 
 ''If you go to the store and see the word 'diabetic,' it communicates directly to diabetics that this product is for them,'' Mr. April said. 
 An estimated 6.3 percent of Americans have diabetes -- 13 million have been given a diagnosis of diabetes and another 5.2 million are unaware they have it, according to the American Diabetes Association. Diabetes is diagnosed in 1.3 million Americans each year, the association says, and that number is increasing because the population is aging and because of Americans' eating habits and sedentary lives. 
 Mr. April said that Diabetic Tussin sells more than a million bottles a year and that sales were growing 30 percent a year. It is also among Hi-Tech's top five products in sales; Hi-Tech makes about 150 items. 
 Adam B. Schuman, the director of marketing for Health Care Products, talked about Diabetic Tussin's virtues. ''It is sugar-free, alcohol-free and sodium-free,'' he said. ''And there is nothing wrong with nondiabetics taking it.'' 
 Mr. April said that the Health Care Products division contributes a minimum of one third of Hi-Tech's profits and accounts for 20 percent of the company's sales. 
 In the fiscal year that ends April 30, Hi-Tech, which trades on Nasdaq under the symbol HITK, is expected to record sales of $55 million to $60 million, Mr. April said. 
 In the 12 years since it introduced Diabetic Tussin, Health Care Products has become the ''industry leader in over-the-counter diabetic products,'' Mr. Schuman said.
 ''This is a tough niche to go after,'' he said, because of the relatively small percentage of diabetic Americans.. But that gives Health Care Products an advantage because it is not economically feasible for large companies to devote a lot of attention to such a small market.
 Other diabetic products the company makes include DiabetiSweet, a sugar substitute for baking and cooking; DiabetiDerm, a foot moisturizer to rehydrate severely dry skin, soothe irritated areas and help circulation; DiabetiTrim, a weight-management drink that is low in sugar, fat and calories; and Multi-betic tablets, which provide a combination of vitamins, minerals and supplements.
 Brian Bowen, a certified pedorthist in Minneapolis who makes and fits custom shoe inserts primarily for diabetics, said that he recommends DiabetiDerm to his patients. He said he discovered it three months ago after investigating foot-care products at the behest of a group of endocrinologists he works with in Kansas City.
 ''I found that DiabetiDerm contained L-Arginine, which has been shown to promote blood flow to the foot,'' Mr. Bowen said. ''I saw the clinical studies, and I decided that this is as good as it gets. We've had great feedback from our diabetic patients.''
 Dr. Bruce Henson, a member of Mr. Bowen's endocrinologists group, said that about 60 to 70 percent of his patients were diabetics and that he placed ''a high degree of emphasis on preventative care,'' citing a statistic that 75 percent of lower-extremity amputations are preventable. He said that although he does not endorse any products, he does recommend types of medicine, including Diabetic Tussin, because it is sugar-free, and DiabetiDerm, because it helps to increase circulation and sensation.
 Hi-Tech makes five varieties of Diabetic Tussin in Amityville, where it has five buildings and a warehouse with about 100,000 square feet. Health Care's other products are made by outside contractors. 
 Mr. April that said 75 percent of his company's success ''had to do with the name and sales and distribution.'' 
 ''We don't cure diabetes,'' he said. ''We just come up with solutions for a healthier life.''

 CORRECTION:
The L.I.@Work column last Sunday, about the Health Care Products division of the Hi-Tech Pharmacal Company, referred incorrectly to the financial performance of the division and the company. Bill Peters, the company's chief financial officer, said the sales of one product line, Diabetic Tussin, grew 5 percent to 10 percent in the first nine months of the 2005 fiscal year, not 30 percent a year. The division's sales are 10 percent to 15 percent of Hi-Tech's total sales, not 20 percent, and the division contributes 10 percent to 15 percent of Hi-Tech's profits, not a third. And the company has previously estimated that it will have sales of $64.8 million to $67.6 million this fiscal year, not $55 million to $60 million.

HEADLINE: Longing for an Island Without Any Malls

BYLINE: By JULIA C. MEAD

 BODY:
SINCE early this year, a coalition of small-business owners, civic groups and community advocates on the East End has campaigned against a proposed Barnes & Noble superstore in Bridgehampton. This month, the self-named Box-Busters are co-sponsoring two screenings of a documentary about another community's precedent-setting victory against one of the biggest box retailers of all, Wal-Mart.
 The local organizers said they hoped that the film, ''Talking to the Wall: The Story of an American Bargain,'' will inspire South Fork residents who oppose the opening of big-box stores in their area, and be a cautionary tale for consumers who welcome chain retailers.
 The documentary, which was made by a native Long Islander, Steve Alves, will be shown at 7 p.m. on April 28 at the Bay Street Theater in Sag Harbor. Mr. Alves will speak at the screening. 
 For years, national chains have been setting up shop in village centers along the South Fork. East Hampton storefronts once occupied by local businesses are now leased to Starbucks, Tiffany and Polo. Bridgehampton has a Kmart, a Victoria's Secret and its own Starbucks. Water Mill has a Blockbuster. 
 ''It's true we have lost some ground here, no question about it,'' said Kathryn Szoka, a founding Box-Busters member and co-owner of Canio's, a small bookshop in Sag Harbor. ''The idea is to not lose any more.''
 So the group asked Southampton Town to ban retail chains that use the same design and accounting practices in several stores, a so-called cookie-cutter approach. The town has not adopted such a ban, but since 2002, has had a 15,000-square-foot cap on new retail construction, adopted with Barnes & Noble in mind. Barnes & Noble executives are still talking to town officials, hoping to open in the area. 
 In the documentary, which he wrote, directed, produced, edited and narrated, Mr. Alves explores the debate over the economic, social and environmental effects of big-box stores by following events over five years in Greenfield, a western Massachusetts town where he now lives, and in Orange, a town about 20 miles away. But the film is also a personal chronicle of Mr. Alves's quest for a place to put down roots.
 The film opens with him describing his childhood in Amityville, and noting that seven movies have been made about the so-called Amityville Horror house, where Ronald DeFeo Jr. murdered six members of his family in 1974. The real horror, Mr. Alves asserts in the film, is not the house that subsequent owners claimed was haunted, but ''development run amok.''
 The core of the documentary is about the two Massachusetts towns. Greenfield, according to the 2000 census, has about 18,000 residents, while Orange has about 7,500. 
 In 1993, Greenfield residents who were opposed to construction of a Wal-Mart made the community the first in the nation to stop the retailer by forcing a binding referendum. Two years later, Orange welcomed Wal-Mart, believing it could revitalize the downtown. By 2000, though, the film shows, any hope of a comeback for downtown had been abandoned.
 Interviewed by telephone last week, Mr. Alves, 52, said the vote in Greenfield, which was hotly contested, continues to divide the community. 
 As Mr. Alves sees the issue, consumers who welcome a chain retailer's lower prices (one meaning of ''bargain'' in the film's title) are making a deal with the devil (the other meaning). Along with the ''every-day low prices'' and tax revenue that Wal-Mart proffers, the film says, come low-wage jobs, the disappearance of small businesses and an overall economic downturn as money that once circulated in a community is redirected to a faraway national headquarters.
 The film has been reviewed mostly in small newspapers in New England; one reviewer said that Mr. Alves took a stylistic cue from the deadpan humor that Michael Moore used in his documentaries ''Roger and Me,'' ''Bowling for Columbine'' and ''Fahrenheit 9/11.'' 
 Take, for example, the documentary's treatment of the Wal-Mart opening celebration in Orange. As crowds of would-be shoppers watch, a man in a blue vest, the company uniform, sings an earnestly schmaltzy ode to the retail giant -- ''You're looking swell, Wal-Mart/I can tell, Wal-Mart/You're still growing, you're still showing, you can sell for less.'' Cut to a preacher intoning a blessing on the new store and all who enter. The soundtrack plays ''Amazing Grace'' as the doors swing open and shoppers begin cruising the aisles.
 Any similarity to Mr. Moore's style is simply a function of how documentaries are edited, Mr. Alves said in the interview.
 ''You shoot a moment that is simply a mirror of our American culture but then in the editing room, when it's framed in a certain way, the painfulness of that moment somehow translates into humor,'' he said.
 Commenting on the opening of the store in Orange, he said that 50 years ago, such a crowd might have appeared for the dedication of a World War II monument. Instead, the United States has become a place where shopping is salvation, he said.
 Mr. Alves said he was planning to leave Long Island in the early 1970's, when construction began on the nearby Sunrise Mall. That mall now has 160 stores, including a Wal-Mart. Other malls, of the big-box and strip kinds, are nearby.
 ''It's shocking for me to see it now,'' said Mr. Alves, whose relatives still live in Amityville, Merrick and Bellmore. ''I feel an incredible attachment, a sense of belonging that seems encoded in me, but I try to see through the clutter.''
 Mr. Alves has strong feelings about the development of Long Island. In the film, he talks of ''the horror of uncontrolled development, like Long Island on steroids'' and the ''Kafka meets Looney Tunes'' atmosphere that he discovered in Los Angeles, where he directed a short, silent film about a man so overcome with despair at his surroundings that he throws himself off a train trestle.
 ''Talking to the Wall'' does not mention that Mr. Alves graduated from the University of Southern California's film school and worked in Hollywood as a film editor. The documentary was completed before he was elected, in 2003, to a one-year term as a Greenfield councilman.
 Although Greenfield has no Wal-Mart, there are at least 10 Wal-Marts within 35 miles, while all the other regional chain department stores have pulled out, Mr. Alves said in the interview.
 With their healthy tourism-fueled economy, the South Fork's Main Streets seem unlikely to turn into ghost towns even if Barnes & Noble opens its superstore in Bridgehampton, but Mr. Alves said in the interview that the effect on the region's 11 independent booksellers would be noticeable.
 ''Barnes & Noble is Wal-Mart with cappuccino,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Leaderless on Land Use

BYLINE: By VINCE POLIMENI. 
Vince Polimeni, a former president of the Association for a Better Long Island, is president of Polimeni International, a development firm.

DATELINE: Garden City 

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to development, Long Island is on a path to self-destruction. And the person leading the way is the Smithtown supervisor, Patrick Vecchio.
 Last month, Mr. Vecchio announced that he had urged Gov. George E. Pataki to block the sale of Kings Park Psychiatric Center to developers that plan to build housing, something the region desperately needs. With this announcement, he is suggesting that years after the state put the property up for bid, Albany should reverse course and turn the land into a park. 
 The former state psychiatric hospital sits on a sprawling 368-acre site along the northern border of Smithtown. Some 10 years ago, the state moved the last of its patients out of Kings Park's forbidding 19th-century dormitories, leaving behind environmental problems like the tons of asbestos in the old buildings. The price tag attached to that remediation is huge and is driving, in large part, what happens next to the site. Why? Because the cleanup costs must be borne by the developers, which, in turn, must pay for them from the profits derived by the redevelopment.
 The prospective developers are Cherokee Northeast of East Rutherford, N.J., a company that specializes in contaminated properties, and Arker Companies of Long Island. The two companies tentatively plan to build up to 1,800 town houses and condominiums, perhaps including a small number of lower-priced housing units, and retail sites. Cherokee and Arker would shoulder the cost of the cleanup along with the task of meeting the town, county and state zoning and planning codes.
 Redevelopment requires leadership from a politician who speaks honestly to both critics and proponents, a politician who seeks compromise from the community while demanding the same and more from the developer. But what Mr. Vecchio is doing instead is opposing the redevelopment in order to appeal to the strong Nimby vote in Smithtown at a time when he faces an unexpected political challenger. It is the cheap way out of making a strategic decision on the fate of this complex. 
 Under Mr. Vecchio's proposed plan, the taxpayers would become liable for the cleanup costs estimated at $50 million. If he can't get Albany to pick up the bill, he will try to persuade Suffolk County to purchase the land as a county park. Both possibilities are unlikely, given the costs involved. His last option will be to try to convince Smithtown property owners that they have to pay if they want to keep the developers at bay. 
 Mr. Vecchio is following in the footsteps of other local elected officials who don't have the will, the vision or the political stamina to engage in land-use politics. In Brookhaven, John Jay LaValle, the town supervisor, is seeking to create a de facto building moratorium by changing the land code that governs how large a structure one can build because it is easier to do nothing than provide a comprehensive plan for economic growth. In Riverhead, Phil Cardinale, the town supervisor, talks about lobbying for a new aviation factory at the former Grumman site in Calverton while he closes one of the runways crucial to winning such a bid. 
 Yet it is Mr. Vecchio who has come to represent so much of what is wrong with how redevelopment is handled on Long Island. In his more than 25 years in office, he has made a habit of opposing innovation. His opposition to the Kings Park redevelopment may ensure that his real legacy is another decade of empty, decaying psychiatric buildings. What a shame it would be to build another park on Long Island when what the region really needs is housing. 
 This is not to say that all Long Island politicians are cast in the same mold as Mr. Vecchio. There are examples of genuine leadership. In Babylon, Steve Bellone, the town supervisor, is considering a string of new retailers in his community, including a Tanger Factory Outlet Center with a movie theater. The Islip town supervisor, Peter McGowan, is using the expansion of his municipal airport to help cut property tax increases. Thomas Suozzi, the Nassau County executive, is forcing a debate on building vertically in suburbia by promoting a plan that could include a 60-story office building and hotel. 
 Love them or hate them, these land-use initiatives are the result of leaders leading. We can dispute, argue, embrace or endorse any or none of them, but for a politician to wait decades to pronounce himself dissatisfied with the Kings Park sale to private developers suggests that we are at risk of becoming an irrelevant economic backwater incapable of managing change.

HEADLINE: Awaiting An Economic Smoke Puff

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
A REPORT due Thursday on the gross domestic product will serve as more than just a reading on the strength of the economy during the first three months of the year.
 While focused on first-quarter growth, the report should also give investors a better idea of whether the economy will grow less briskly than expected in the months ahead. Fears of slower growth sent the stock market stumbling last week to new lows for the year. 
 Edward McKelvey, senior economist at Goldman Sachs, says he expects that Goldman will reduce its forecast of 4 percent growth for the second quarter.
 The size of the reduction will depend on the composition of first-quarter growth, Mr. McKelvey said. If demand slowed in the first quarter, it will be important to see how much the decline in buying added to producer inventories. If inventories rose significantly, then production would be expected to be much slower in the second quarter as inventories were reduced.
 For that reason, Mr. McKelvey said that the surprising weakness of retail sales in March could have more impact on the second quarter than the first quarter. And the downward revision in the second-quarter growth estimate could be as large as a full percentage point or two, he warned. 
 The G.D.P. report will also be a test of the art of economic forecasting under the gun. If the first-quarter growth rate comes in at 3.5 percent or less, the forecasters who altered their outlooks in the last two weeks will appear smart. But if the growth rate is closer to 4 percent, those who held the line -- including Goldman -- will look good. The consensus forecast is 3.5 percent, according to Bloomberg News.
 Less than three weeks ago, the consensus forecast for first-quarter growth was 3.9 percent at an annual rate, according to the Blue Chip Economic Indicators. The average of the 10 highest forecasts was 4.6 percent and the average of the 10 lowest was 3.1 percent.
 The 53 economists who participated in the survey, conducted April 4 and 5, knew that job growth in March, at 110,000, was much weaker than had been expected.
 But they did not know then that retail sales in March would grow just 0.3 percent, below the Wall Street forecast of 0.8 percent. And they did not know that the trade deficit in February would balloon to a record $61 billion, reflecting sluggish American exports.
 Randell Moore, the editor of the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, said that if the survey had been done after those economic reports, the estimate would have been lower. ''I am guessing, but it would be closer to 3.5 percent,'' he said. ''But certainly not 3 percent.''

DATA WATCH -- The core personal consumption expenditures price index, watched closely by Federal Reserve policy makers, is due on Friday. The index, which excludes food and energy, is expected to have climbed 1.7 percent over the 12 months through March. A bigger increase would be disturbing after the surprising 0.4 percent jump in core consumer prices in March, reported last week.
 Orders for durable goods, due Wednesday, are expected to have risen 0.3 percent in March, after a 0.5 percent increase in February.

HEADLINE: MEDICARE CHANGE WILL LIMIT ACCESS TO CLAIM HEARING

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 23 

 BODY:
A new federal policy will make it significantly more difficult for Medicare beneficiaries to obtain hearings in person before a judge when the government denies their claims for home care, nursing home services, prescription drugs and other treatments.
 For years, hearings have been held at more than 140 Social Security offices around the country. In July, the Department of Health and Human Services will take over the responsibility, and department officials said all judges would then be located at just four sites -- in Cleveland; Miami; Irvine, Calif.; and Arlington, Va.
 Under the new policy, Medicare officials said, most hearings will be held with videoconference equipment or by telephone. A beneficiary who wants to appear in person before a judge must show that ''special or extraordinary circumstances exist,'' the rules say. 
 But a beneficiary who insists on a face-to-face hearing will lose the right to receive a decision within 90 days, the deadline set by statute.
 The policy change comes as Bush administration officials are predicting an increase in the volume of cases, with the creation of a Medicare drug benefit expected to generate large numbers of claims and appeals. But in a recent study, the Government Accountability Office, an investigative arm of Congress, questioned the heavy reliance on videoconferences, saying that ''beneficiaries are often uncomfortable using videoconference facilities and prefer to have their cases heard face to face.'' 
 All beneficiaries are 65 or older or disabled. About 5 million of the 41 million beneficiaries are 85 or older, and some are so sick they die while pursuing appeals.
 When claims are denied, beneficiaries and their health care providers can challenge the decisions in an appeals process that has several levels of review. Their best chance to win coverage comes when they appear before impartial, independent adjudicators known as administrative law judges.
 Over the last five years, beneficiaries and providers prevailed in two-thirds of the 283,000 cases decided by these judges.
 The Department of Health and Human Services defended its new policy, saying the use of videoconference equipment would enable judges to ''complete more cases'' within the 90-day deadline, because they would not have to spend time traveling to remote sites. In a summary of its plans, the department said it was ''not economically or administratively feasible'' to station judges around the country. 
 ''Having fewer offices is more cost-effective in terms of management, technology and training,'' the department said in a letter answering questions from Congress.
 Michael O. Leavitt, the secretary of health and human services, said, ''Access to hearings for Medicare beneficiaries will be as good as or better than'' what is now available. For some beneficiaries, he said, video hearings could be more convenient. 
 ''Video teleconferences will allow hearings to be provided more timely, with vastly more access points than Social Security currently provides through its offices,'' Mr. Leavitt said.
 But lawmakers, judges, consumer groups and lawyers for beneficiaries expressed concern.
 Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the Finance Committee, and Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the senior Democrat on the panel, said four hearing offices were not enough. 
 Mr. Grassley and Mr. Baucus were among the principal authors of the 2003 Medicare law. The law, they noted, says Medicare judges are to be distributed ''throughout the United States.'' 
 Under the new arrangement, hearings for Medicare beneficiaries in New York, New Jersey and all of New England will normally be held by judges in Cleveland. Hearings for people in Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska will be held by judges in Southern California. 
 Judith A. Stein, director of the Center for Medicare Advocacy, which has represented thousands of people in hearings since 1986, said: ''The videoconferences are one of many changes that will reduce the beneficiaries' ability to get fair, favorable decisions. Sick, old and disabled people can be much more effective in person because the judge can see their illnesses and infirmities -- how they walk, how they get up from a chair, how their hands shake with tremors.''
 Nancy M. Coleman, director of the Commission on Law and Aging, a policy and research arm of the American Bar Association, said, ''It's a travesty, what's happening to the appeal rights of Medicare beneficiaries.''
 Videoconference equipment transmits a picture and sound so that a Medicare beneficiary, a judge and witnesses in different parts of the country can see and hear one another over secure networks. Signals will be encrypted to protect the privacy of medical information. The judge will have the file, but a beneficiary can send and receive additional documents using a fax machine.
 Ronald G. Bernoski, president of the Association of Administrative Law Judges, said face-to-face hearings were valuable for judges and beneficiaries alike. 
 ''Video teleconferences will undermine the judges' ability to assess the credibility and demeanor of witnesses,'' said Mr. Bernoski, a judge based in Milwaukee. ''And it could reduce the beneficiaries' confidence in the proceedings. The intrinsic value of a Medicare hearing is that citizens have an opportunity to sit down in front of a high-ranking official and tell their story to someone who listens carefully and makes a reasoned decision.''
 One person who benefited from a Medicare hearing is Ethel L. Swarm, 76, of Bethel, Conn. She said she had excruciating pain in her left leg, was unable to walk and spent four days at Danbury Hospital. But Medicare refused to cover her stay, saying it was not medically necessary. Medicare also refused to pay for a subsequent 37-day stay in a nursing home.
 After reviewing the medical evidence, administrative law judges ruled in favor of Mrs. Swarm. She won $7,437 for her hospital care and $9,250 for the nursing home stay, which helped her walk again.
 The 2003 law shifted the responsibility for hearing Medicare appeals from Social Security to the Department of Health and Human Services, which is in the process of hiring 50 judges. 
 The government is still working out details and lining up sites with the necessary videoconference links. Nancy A. Thompson, director of the transition team at the department, refused to answer questions about the new hearing and appeal procedures or the logistical arrangements.
 Ronald T. Osborn of Charlotte, N.C., who has been an administrative law judge since 1974 and has specialized in Medicare cases since 1996, said he had no interest in moving to the Department of Health and Human Services.
 ''Under the department's procedural rules,'' Mr. Osborn said, ''judges will have less freedom to handle individual cases as they see fit.''
 Ms. Stein said that under the rules ''it will be easier for Medicare officials to participate in hearings and to influence decisions, often to the detriment of beneficiaries.''
 Bill Hall, a spokesman for the department, said such concerns were unfounded because the judges would report to the health secretary, not the Medicare program chief.
 Medicare and Social Security officials have long contended that some administrative law judges were improperly favoring beneficiaries. For their part, the judges have periodically complained that officials put pressure on them to approve fewer claims. In the early 1980's, the tension became so acute that the judges filed suit against the secretary of health and human services to preserve their independence.
 Under the new rules, issued in March by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, administrative law judges must follow the Medicare law and regulations and must ''give substantial deference'' to manuals and guidelines issued by Medicare officials. In a particular case, a judge can decline to follow a Medicare policy but must explain why.

HEADLINE: When You Contain Multitudes

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
GEETHA Lakshminarayanan says it is easy for her to figure out which guys to blow off at a bar. They are the ones who approach her by asking, ''What are you?'' or ''Where are you from?''
 ''It's always nice to be seen as attractive, but I don't want people to date me because I'm exotic, like an animal at the zoo,'' said Ms. Lakshminarayanan, 22, who works for an organization in Ann Arbor, Mich., that teaches management skills to nonprofit groups. Ms. Lakshminarayanan, whose heritage is white and Asian Indian, is mistaken for Latina or Filipina because of her olive skin and straight black hair. ''It's like they're taking a walk on the wild side,'' she said. ''I don't trust them.''
 Mass culture awakened some time ago to growing multiracial demographics, and today public figures who are either mixed race or part of an interracial couple are more visible than ever. It is hard to miss Heidi Klum and Seal in celebrity magazines (among the expecting couples of the moment) or Mariah Carey and Senator Barack Obama of Illinois talking about their mixed heritage. Movies like ''Guess Who'' use interracial relationships as a subject for laughs, while in ''Sideways'' the relationship between a white man and an Asian woman was treated as so unremarkable that it went without note. 
 The so-called ambiguous look is hip; so is borrowing ethnic styles and cultures. 
 But scratch the surface, many multiracial Americans say, and the reality is much more complex. Despite being perceived as cool, people of mixed races say they often function in a world where friends will eventually offend with a comment that overlooks a white mother or an Asian father, and where exotic is another word for ''other.'' As they navigate social landmines that can be annoying and funny at times, hurtful and depressing at others, young people of mixed race are becoming increasingly assertive, starting groups and demanding recognition. 
 ''People make a lot of assumptions based on race, and they can't put us into categories,'' Ms. Lakshminarayanan said as she sat relaxing in her room at a Chinatown hotel. She was taking a break during a 15-city road trip, called Generation Mix, that was organized to raise awareness about the mixed-race experience and issues like the need for more multiracial bone marrow donors. The 26-foot-long recreational vehicle, which she shares with four others, was parked on the street outside. 
 Generation Mix is sponsored by the Mavin Foundation, an advocacy organization in Seattle. Formed in the late 1990's, Mavin was among the forerunners of the dozens of multiracial groups -- with names like Swirl, Fusion and Mixed -- that have sprung up in the last five years in an attempt to bring multiethnic issues to the fore. Some efforts focus on earnest outreach; others are more irreverent. 
 On Race-O-Rama, produced by VH1 and the five-man humor collective Ego Trip, Shakara Ledard, a model who is both white and black, riffs about how she used to make fun of herself as an ''Oreo cookie.'' Meanwhile Web sites like mixedmediawatch.com keep tabs on the way multiracial people are portrayed in the media, and T-shirt designers are busy spreading their message. At the University of Maryland in College Park, multiracial students are wearing the T-shirt with the message ''Mixed Terp,'' which plays on the university's mascot, the diamondback terrapin.
 Roberto Suro, director of the Pew Hispanic Center in Washington, which studies issues of race, said today's multiethnic young people are forging new racial terrain. ''It's more of an internally developed form of identity than just a social category, and it's fundamentally different from the way race has been expressed in this country before,'' he said.
 The assertive attitude, along with this new crop of youth organizations, is fueled in large part by the 2000 census, which for the first time counted people of more than one race. Among the more than seven million people identified as multiracial, 41 percent were younger than 18, the census showed, compared with 26 percent for the overall population. Now, nearly 40 years after the Supreme Court struck down the last of the nation's anti-miscegenation laws, these young people are challenging a society they say is still very much hung up on racial labels.
 ''Most Asians perceive me as white, and most whites perceive me as Asian,'' said Derrick Pfeffer, 21, who is Chinese and white and founded the Multiracial Biracial Student Association at the University of Maryland two years ago. As a result, he said, his white friends are surprised that he's extroverted and outspoken because it counters the Asian stereotype. His Asian friends are surprised when he speaks Mandarin and talks about Chinese family gatherings because they think of him as white. No matter what he does, he said, ''people won't completely embrace you.''
 Bethonie Butler, 20, who is a journalism student at the University of Maryland, said many of the social slights multiethnic people experience are hard to address because they seem inadvertent. 
 Not long ago, she said, she discovered a new posting on the bulletin board she shares with her roommates. It read, ''I'd rather have a black woman take my man, but a white woman, I can't have.''
 Ms. Butler, who is black like her roommates, is also part white. She said she did not make a big deal about the sign -- ''Wow, that's nice,'' was her only comment to her roommates -- but it bothers her that people sometimes forget her father is black and her mother white.
 ''It's one of the weirdest things, but that happens a lot, especially around dating,'' she said. ''A lot of people say they are against interracial dating and I'd take offense because what they're telling me is that what my parents did was wrong.''
 Among the common complaints that many mixed-race people mention are television commercials that only show families of one race, school forms that pigeonhole students into one racial category, and portrayals in the media that assume mixed means only black and white. (According to a report issued this month by the Census Bureau, of all the people who identified themselves as being of mixed race in 2000, only 11 percent claimed their heritage to be black and white.) 
 Matt Kelley, the 26-year-old founder of the Mavin Foundation whose parents are Korean and white, said that rather than creating yet another race-based category, groups like his want to expand notions of race so that Americans ''reject the idea that you have to pick a team.''
 Still, the country has come a long way in shedding the historical baggage that once made interracial couplings shameful if not illegal, many of those interviewed agreed. In many communities in the Northeast and on the West Coast, being mixed may not be a big deal, and for many the idea of passing for one race when you are in fact two or more is now unimaginable.
 Away from those areas, however, ''multiracial individuals may find it economically advantageous not to advertise their heritage,'' said Juanita Brooks, a clinical psychologist in Florida who ran a Web site for multiracial people with ''a white appearance'' like herself. 
 With intermarriage rates on the rise, some multiracial groups are trying to reinforce a positive self-image in younger generations. Fusion, a group that formed three years ago in San Francisco, is starting a summer camp this year for multiracial an multiethnic children as well as for transracial adoptees so ''they can interact with role models and kids their own age,'' said Joemy Ito-Gates, a third-grade teacher who founded the group. 
 Many young people of mixed race said they are heartened by the increasing number of public figures like Tiger Woods, who refuses to be singularly categorized. Jen Chau, 28, an administrative assistant at New York University who also is a founder of mixedmediawatch.com and Swirl, a social group in New York that has chapters in several cities, said that there was a measure of respect for those like Halle Berry, who accepted her Oscar for best actress in the 2001 film, ''Monster's Ball,'' on behalf of African-Americans though her mother is white.
 ''Mixed people should identify the way they want,'' Ms. Chau said. ''They shouldn't be questioned. That's how they feel.''
 Researchers who study questions of racial identity say multiracial people vary in how they relate to their different backgrounds, with some embracing all parts of their heritage equally, and others choosing to be more one than another. And as a group, said Larry Hajime Shinagawa, director of the Center for the Study of Culture, Race and Ethnicity at Ithaca College in New York, ''the multiracial population is too diverse itself to unite under a banner. ''People will still need a community of interest and identification,'' he said.
 Some, like Ms. Lakshminarayanan, say they are still exploring their identities and questions like how being part white might lend certain advantages. ''This tour has made me think about the fact that although I'm a person of color, my white background has in fact given me a lot of white privilege,'' she recently wrote on Generation Mix's Web log. ''But this white privilege thing is a whole new dimension for me.'' 
 Aaron Kendeall, 21, a student at West Virginia University and a Generation Mix tour member, said appearing to be white sometimes comes with its own problems. Mr. Kendeall, who grew up in Pittsburgh, said his high school experiences included a fight with a hockey teammate who used a racial slur about blacks while telling a joke in the locker room. Mr. Kendeall looks white like his mother, but his father is black, which he made clear immediately. 
 ''I took my belt off and hit him,'' he said. His teammate had to apologize.
 ''When you're mixed,'' Mr. Kendeall added, ''you're put in a lot of awkward situations other people would not be put in.''

HEADLINE: Very Different Calls to Arms, and Legs, in Round 1

BYLINE: By CLIFTON BROWN

 BODY:
Alex Smith went first, running backs went early and Aaron Rodgers went into an embarrassing free fall, from a potential No. 1 pick to No. 24.
 N.F.L. draft day at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan offered a potpourri of story lines, led by Smith, the seventh quarterback in the past eight years selected as the top pick. Ending weeks of speculation, the San Francisco 49ers decided Smith, a 20-year-old from the University of Utah, would be their best hope to turn around a struggling franchise.
 While the 49ers banked on Smith's arm, this was a year for legs. Three running backs went in the first five picks -- Ronnie Brown (Auburn) at No. 2 to Miami, Cedric Benson (Texas) at No. 4 to Chicago and Carnell Williams (Auburn) at No. 5 to Tampa Bay. It was the first time since 1989 that three running backs were selected in the top 10. 
 Braylon Edwards (Michigan), widely considered the draft's top wide receiver, interrupted the parade of running backs when he went No. 3 to Cleveland. But this was an offensive-minded draft, with no defensive player taken until cornerback Adam Jones (West Virginia) went No. 6 to Tennessee.
 As the draft's top prize, Smith will face the challenge of joining a team that was 2-14 last season. He must also deal with the pressure of joining a franchise that boasts two Hall of Fame quarterbacks in the Super Bowl era, Joe Montana and Steve Young.
 ''People talk about the legacy and the pressure associated with it, but I'm honored to follow in their footsteps,'' said Smith, who had a 21-1 record as a college starter and graduated in two years with a 3.74 grade point average in economics. ''It's only going to provide motivation. Hopefully, I can carry on the legacy. I feel like I fall right in line with those guys. You're talking about smart quarterbacks who make good decisions, and they're winners. I feel like I fit that mold.''
 It was a difficult day for Rodgers, rated the second-best quarterback in the draft by many scouts, just a shade behind Smith. But more than four hours after Smith went No. 1, Rodgers sat uncomfortably in the green room -- until Green Bay finally selected him at No. 24.
 ''We were joking around yesterday about putting some money in the pool, to see who the last guy would be in the green room,'' said Rodgers, who starred at California. ''But it's not so funny when you're the last guy in the green room.''
 Completing the top 10, wide receiver Troy Williamson (South Carolina) went No. 7 to Minnesota, cornerback Antrel Rolle (Miami) went No. 8 to Arizona, cornerback Carlos Rogers (Auburn) went No. 9 to Washington and wide receiver Mike Williams (Southern California) went No. 10 to Detroit.
 Though trade rumors circulated for weeks, there were only two first-round deals yesterday. Houston dealt the 13th pick to New Orleans for the 16th selection and a third-round pick next year, and Seattle traded the No. 23 pick to Oakland for the No. 26 pick and a fourth-round pick (No. 105). 
 It was not that San Francisco did not try to make a deal. Less than an hour before selecting Smith, the 49ers were shopping the No. 1 pick because they needed help at many positions, and some scouts wondered if Smith had a strong enough arm to develop into a star quarterback.
 But this draft was long on depth and short on players who looked like sure-fire stars. Teams with multiple first-round picks, like Minnesota and Washington, did not want to surrender those picks to move up. Other teams balked at trading future picks or established veterans.
 Smith expected to be chosen No. 1 after receiving a Friday night telephone call from 49ers Coach Mike Nolan. 
 ''I asked if he had made a decision,'' Smith said. ''He said he had made his decision a long time ago.''
 Now the 49ers must work on signing Smith to avoid a training-camp holdout. Smith's agent, Tom Condon, negotiated the contract signed by last year's No. 1 overall pick, Eli Manning, who received a six-year deal with the Giants worth up to $54 million, including a $20 million signing bonus.
 San Francisco has balked at paying Smith that kind of money, and a long holdout would hurt the development of a young quarterback who may experience several years of growing pains.
 The 49ers would face a public-relations nightmare if Smith missed much of training camp, but he sounded eager to bridge the huge gap in negotiations quickly.
 ''Contracts are pretty complicated, but I don't think it's going to be an issue,'' Smith said.
 Early surprises included the drafting of Jones by Tennessee. Many scouts rated Rolle as the top cornerback, but when Jones's name was called, Rolle was forced to squirm before Arizona selected him. 
 Williamson's early selection was another surprise. The Vikings needed a wide receiver after trading Randy Moss to Oakland, but Minnesota could have taken Williams, who had a brilliant two-year career at U.S.C., scoring 30 touchdowns.
 But Williams sat out all of last season when he left the Trojans and hired an agent; he was declared ineligible for the draft. The Vikings obviously felt Williams was hurt by the one-year layoff, and there were also questions about whether Williams had the speed to be a game-breaking N.F.L. receiver.
 Williamson, who averaged 19.3 yards a catch last season, is regarded as the fastest receiver in the draft, a nice fit for the Vikings' big-play offense, which is led by quarterback Daunte Culpepper.
 The Redskins addressed their need in the secondary after losing cornerback Fred Smoot to free agency. They made Carlos Rogers the third Auburn player to be taken among the top nine selections, an indication why Auburn was 13-0 last season.
 The 49ers faced the most pressure yesterday, holding the first pick and so many options. ''This is something that's going to be associated with my name for the rest of my life, and that motivates me,'' Smith said.
 ''I'm going to work hard to prove that I'm worthy of the selection, that they didn't make a mistake.''

HEADLINE: The Fight Over the Future of Pennsauken

BYLINE: By JILL P. CAPUZZO

DATELINE: PENNSAUKEN 

 BODY:
FOR the third spring in a row, a pair of bald eagles has returned to Petty's Island, a 392-acre tract in the Delaware River where a North Carolina firm -- with billions of dollars in projects planned throughout the state -- has proposed a golf course, a 250-room hotel and 721 homes. 
 But Pennsauken is not Capistrano and the developer, Cherokee Investment Partners of Raleigh, N.C., is already heavily invested in what the company envisions as a $1 billion redevelopment of the Pennsauken riverfront and the nearby island.
 Indeed, Cherokee -- which in the last five years has come to dominate the development landscape of New Jersey -- sees cleaning up and developing the island as the linchpin of a much larger plan to turn around the fortunes of this working-class suburb across the river from Philadelphia, as well as those of neighboring Camden, where it has another billion-dollar project in the works. 
 Environmental advocates see things differently. Seeking to protect the only known eagle's nest in the history of Camden County and several other species that have taken up residence on this former industrial site, environmental groups have banded together to try to preserve Pettty's Island. 
 Being on the opposite side of environmentalists is an uncomfortable place for Cherokee, which prides itself on being the country's largest redeveloper of former industrial sites tainted with toxins, called brownfields, in heavily populated areas. 
 ''In the density vs. sprawl wars, Cherokee are the density guys,'' Tom Darden, the chief executive of Cherokee, said in a telephone interview from North Carolina. 
 According to Mr. Darden's formula, Petty's Island -- in the most densely populated region of southern New Jersey -- is a perfect candidate for Cherokee's redevelopment model. 
 Again, environmental advocates disagree. ''If we were going to fix the world, Petty's Island is one place you'd fix,'' said Emil DeVito, science and stewardship manager for the New Jersey Conservation Foundation. ''There's virtually no open space in that area. There's only one fate for Petty's Island. Any other fate is greedy.''
 Those who concur with Mr. DeVito insist that Cherokee is more interested in the bottom line than in the environment. With 10 to 15 percent of its more than $1 billion in capital investments tied up in New Jersey, the state has become the single most important component in Cherokee's portfolio.
 ''They promote themselves as being environmentally sensitive developers, but we haven't seen any indication of that,'' said Sharon Finlayson, chairwoman of the New Jersey Environmental Federation. ''Cherokee is not interested in protecting this island. They're interested in building on this island, without any impediment.''
 One day after the United States Supreme Court heard arguments over a municipality's right to acquire property for private development through eminent domain, the town council voted to condemn Petty's Island. Unless the court rules against such uses of eminent domain, the condemnation will give Pennsauken officials the tool they need to acquire Petty's Island and turn it over to Cherokee. The island's owner, Citgo Petroleum Corporation, refuses to sell the tract and has offered to turn it over to the state as a nature preserve.

Jewel in the Crown
 Driving past the rusted smokestacks along River Road in Pennsauken, it is not difficult to see why many residents and local officials in this blue-collar town are eager to embrace a developer's rose-colored vision of marinas, waterfront marketplaces and upscale housing, and why Cherokee is equally eager to build such a project. 
 If the proposed development had been limited to replacing the old industrial sites on the mainland, the project might already be under way. But Cherokee included Petty's Island -- the jewel in the crown of the billion-dollar project because of its unfettered view of the Philadelphia skyline -- and without it the company has indicated that the undertaking is not financially feasible.
 ''It's the real economic driver for the entire project,'' said Eric Wisler, a managing partner of DeCotiis, FitzPatrick Cole & Wisler, an influential New Jersey law firm that represents Cherokee on most of its projects in the state. 
 For nearly 100 years, the island has been owned by Citgo. From 1915 to 1945, the company operated a refinery there, and until two years ago it stored underground tanks at the site. A container shipping operation is also situated there, but much of the rest of the island has become overgrown and inhabited by wildlife. 
 And therein lies the dispute.
 In recent years, Citgo had been trying to sell the island, and Cherokee was an interested party. The two companies were close to negotiating a sale -- estimated at $25 million to $30 million -- when two bald eagles were sighted there in the spring of 2003. 
 ''The birds were discovered, and everybody said, 'Now what?''' said Jack McCrossin, the environmental manager of the island for Citgo. ''Of course, that threw the discussion of development into a tailspin.''
 The question quickly became: How much of the island could even be developed? As one of the state's endangered species, eagles -- and their habitats -- are strictly protected, with buffer zones of 1,000 feet around the nest, and up to a half-mile, including foraging grounds, off limits to development 
 After a heron rookery was discovered at the southern end of the island, and another eagle nesting site was found to the north, extensive development looked less and less likely. At that point talks broke off between Citgo and Cherokee, which then focused its energy on redeveloping the Cramer Hill section of Camden, while Citgo came up with a new plan for Petty's Island. 
 For its part, Citgo offered to clean up whatever contaminants it had created over the years and donate the land to the state for a wildlife preserve. ''The ecological value of Petty's became close enough to the economic value of Petty's to make the decision palatable,'' Mr. McCrossin said.
 Those who doubt Citgo's newfound environmentalism call the company's offer a public relations ploy or an attempt to perform a substandard cleanup while wiping out millions of dollars in fines that the oil company is expected to owe for damage to natural resources in other parts of the state.
 Mr. McCrossin acknowledged that Citgo was motivated in part by the cost of cleanup, noting, ''If somebody else would come in and clean up the island and hand us a bill, it would be more than if we did it.'' 
 Nevertheless, he said the company's primary motivation in offering to donate the land was the recognition that ''it's the right thing to do.''
 Initially, state officials were enthusiastic.
 ''It was extremely generous,'' said Michael Catania, executive director of the New Jersey Natural Lands Trust, the agency that would act as receiver and manager of the donated island. ''We would be completely indemnified: no charges to clean up, we'd get title to the island. It doesn't get much better than that in terms of donations.''
 After a meeting with Citgo officials in February 2004, Mr. Catania said the state was ''completely on board'' -- so much so that plans were made for Gov. James E. McGreevey to announce the gift. But then came pressure from local officials. 
 Months earlier, Governor McGreevey had joined Mr. Darden of Cherokee in announcing the redevelopment of Cramer Hill. The next day, Mr. Wisler said, he got a call from the city attorney in Pennsauken asking if Cherokee was interested in revisiting the development of Petty's Island as well as a sizable stretch of the town's mainland. 
 ''The hope was that Citgo would divest themselves of the property without having to take it by condemnation,'' Mr. Wisler said. ''Cherokee's philosophy is not to fight, contrary to what others may think.''
 Nevertheless, Cherokee was assured by Pennsauken officials that they would be willing to take the land by eminent domain, according to Mr. Wisler. So last May, without public meetings, open bids or proposal requests, Pennsauken officials announced a partnership with Cherokee in which the company would build 2,700 homes, 500,0000 square feet of office and retail space, a conference center and a golf course. 
 When a lawyer for Citgo contacted Cherokee to ask about the eagles, Mr. McCrossin said the lawyer was told, ''If the governor wants Petty's Island developed, it will get developed.''
 ''The fact that the presence of eagles didn't concern them any longer makes you wonder if there were discussions that we weren't party to,'' Mr. McCrossin said.
 On May 27, with much fanfare, Mr. Darden promised that development on Petty's Island would be contained to the ''industrial footprint,'' estimated at 40 to 50 percent of the island, and that the rest would remain open space. ''We will protect the habitat of those magnificent creatures,'' he promised.
 But the actions of a consultant working for Cherokee has put doubts in the minds of environmentalists.
 In March 2004, Cherokee hired Thomas Cullen, a falconry expert, to monitor the bald eagles on Petty's Island during mating season. Mr. Cullen had pleaded guilty 17 years earlier to bird-possession and exporting charges after he was found climbing a tree with a hatchet near a cockatoo nest at a wildlife sanctuary in Australia. He is currently under indictment on charges of orchestrating a bird-smuggling scheme in 2000. And his resume included claims that he managed an eagle reintroduction program in Manhattan in which one bird died of dehydration.
 Without the permission of federal environmental officials or the New Jersey Fish and Wildlife divisions, Mr. Cullen spent the next 15 weeks observing the eagles. According to a subsequent report by the state Department of Environmental Protection, the same day Cherokee and local officials were announcing plans to develop the island, Mr. Cullen was setting up a tent on Petty's Island to serve as an observation blind, 94 feet from eagles' nest despite a state law requiring a minimum buffer of 1,000 feet.

Eaglet Is Killed
 Then, on June 10, an 11-week-old eaglet was found limping on a service road on the island, its tail covered with maggots. The fledgling eagle, which had been raised by the Petty's Island eagles, died on the way to a rescue center. While Mr. Cullen told investigators that the eaglet must have been hit by a car, officers from the state environmental agency blamed Mr. Cullen.
 ''It is apparent that the point at which the eagles would become disturbed was desired by Cherokee and sought by Cullen,'' wrote Lt. Tod Eisenhuth, the lead investigator for the state Department of Environmental Protection. ''It seems that one of the purposes of erecting the blind so close to the nest was to test this threshold repeatedly.''
 William Gauger, president of Cherokee Northeast, a subsidiary of Cherokee Investment Partners, said that he ordered Mr. Cullen fired ''the second I found out he was going on the island.'' 
 Yet the letter of termination was dated July 21 -- almost six weeks after the injured eaglet was discovered, and 10 days after Mr. Cullen delivered a report to Cherokee in which he outlined his activities, including setting up the blind and approaching the nest site on foot. 
 In a memorandum issued after a July 15 meeting with Cherokee consultants, Lawrence Niles, chief of the state environmental agency's endangered-species program, wrote: ''I said I thought he was responsible for the bird prematurely leaving the nest, which caused it to break a bone and be unable to fly back to the nest. The bird eventually became dehydrated and, without any food for days, died.''
 In October, the Department of Environmental Protection charged Mr. Cullen with harassing endangered birds and offered a $20,000 fine as settlement, which he turned down. Last month, the state attorney general's office filed a civil suit against both Mr. Cullen and Cherokee, charging them with violating the state Endangered and Nongame Species Conservation Act in their deliberate disruption of the eagles' nest. 
 In addition to the state's charges, Bradley M. Campbell, commissioner of the state Department of Environmental Protection, said his office referred the investigation to the United States attorney's office.
 ''Eagles are a federally protected species, so I thought it was appropriate it be investigated by the federal authorities,'' Mr. Campbell said. 
 A spokesman for Cherokee, Rich Ochab, said that the company had recently learned of the federal investigation and that Cherokee has ''offered to help and be cooperative.'' 
 But while the environmental commissioner has pursued legal action against Cherokee's eagle consultant, he has also been fully cooperative with Cherokee in helping the development go forward.
 Ignoring the announcement of Cherokee as the chosen developer, Citgo continued pressing its offer to make Petty's Island a wildlife preserve. To sweeten the offer to the state's Natural Lands Trust, the oil company offered to create a $2 million endowment to cover costs of managing the island, and promised to remediate the land.
 At the same time, Cherokee representatives continued to meet with Mr. Campbell and other state officials to discuss their plans to take the island by eminent domain. In a letter to Mr. Campbell in late July, Mr. Gauger said that the company would back off condemnation efforts for 30 days, as requested by the environmental commissioner, but at the same time asked him to intervene to give Cherokee access to the island for preliminary site testing.
 ''Cherokee appreciates your efforts in trying to bring about a reasonable and beneficial solution to the difficult issues presented by this project,'' Mr. Gauger wrote.
 As the date for a meeting of the Natural Lands Trust approached, supporters lined up behind both sides of a divided board. While nearly every environmental group in the state lobbied on behalf of preservation, a letter signed by state legislators from South Jersey urged the state to support Cherokee's proposed development in Pennsauken. It certainly did not hurt that from 2001 to 2004, Cherokee and its consulting agencies contributed $87,825 to the Camden County Democrats, and close to $1.5 million to the state Democratic Committee.
 On Sept. 29, a day before the board of the Natural Lands Trust was to vote on the conservation easement, George E. Norcross III of Camden County, one of the state's most influential Democrats, faxed a memo to Mr. Campbell asking him to review a report by Pennsauken's attorney, David Luthman, outlining the benefits of developing Petty's Island and the adjacent coast.
 This was not the first time Mr. Norcross had weighed in. Two weeks before the May announcement of the Pennsauken waterfront plan, Pennsauken's mayor, Ricardo Taylor, sent Cherokee's proposal to Mr. Campbell and Mr. McGreevey, with Mr. Norcross's business card attached. 
 Mr. Campbell said he never met with Mr. Norcross on the matter, but that he did ask him to meet with local officials. Some have questioned the financial motives of Mr. Norcross, a native of Pennsauken and chief executive of the insurance division of Commerce Bank, who has been eager to see the hardscrabble town get on its feet. 
 In Mr. Luthman's report, he described Citgo's history on the island as contributing to what he called ''one of the most contaminated sites within South Jersey'' and advised that ''the time to allow these same corporate entities an opportunity to plan for the future of these lands has to be at an end.''
 On Sept. 30, the Natural Lands Trust board voted 5-3 in favor of accepting Citgo's proposed conservation easement. But the three votes against the plan were cast by the representatives of the state, and according to the Trust's enabling legislation, at least one state employee had to vote for a proposal to get approved.
 ''They knew whose arms they had to twist, and it didn't really matter what we did,'' said Mr. Catania, the chairman of the trust.
 Ultimately, Mr. Campbell said, the case for preserving Petty's Island was weak.

Officials Trump Environmentalists
 ''This is a case in which the conservation merits had to be balanced against the views of local officials,'' the commissioner said. ''From a public policy perspective, you have to give weight to the views of the elected officials of the area.''
 Further, the environmental commissioner said the wildlife value of the island -- inhabited by eagles, herons, egrets and other migratory birds -- had been exaggerated.
 ''The island is industrial in character,'' Mr. Campbell said. ''There have been some idyllic characterizations that really don't square with the facts on the ground.''
 In January, Mr. Campbell sent a letter to the mayor of Pennsauken and to Mr. Gauger in which he outlined the terms of the agreement between the Department of Environmental Protection, the township and Cherokee -- including the stipulation that Cherokee would pay the state $10 million to make up for the fines the environmental agency would otherwise seek to collect from Citgo. In turn, Mr. Campbell wrote, the agency would enforce Citgo's obligation to clean up contaminated land, while reimbursing Cherokee for its remediation costs as well as paying the company for any portion of Petty's Island that could not be developed because of state-imposed conservation restrictions.
 To Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Chapter of the Sierra Club, the deal brokered by the state agency ''undermines the whole concept of environmental regulation.''
 ''We regulate land for the public good,'' Mr. Tittel said. ''But now we have a system where the value of that land will be paid to Cherokee, at market rate, because they can't build on it?''
 With that, Citgo's effort to preserve Petty's Island shifted to the federal government, with the petroleum company offering to donate the island as part of National Wildlife Refuge System. 
 But Tony Leger, regional chief of the National Wildlife Refuge System, said the island did not meet his agency's criteria.
 ''It's a developed, polluted, small parcel of land, in the middle of a river surrounded by a sea of humanity,'' Mr. Leger said. ''That may raise the value for people, but it doesn't raise the value for wildlife.''
 Moreover, Mr. Leger said his agency, which had not acquired land in New Jersey since the early 1990's, was reluctant to get involved in what was perceived as a local turf war.
 ''It is rare for us to get in the middle and say we're going to muscle the local municipality out,'' he said. ''For us to do that, it would have to be the cream of the crop, and I don't think Petty's Island is that.''
 But Robert Shinn of the Cooper River Watershed Association, an environmental advocacy group, who has been fighting Cherokee over Pennsauken and Camden, said that the willingness of local officials to turn over large tracts of land to the North Carolina firm was a ''a failure of imagination.''
 ''On the surface, it has to be a good thing,'' Mr. Shinn said. ''But when you peel back the layers, look at the methods -- who they hire, how they leverage, and that they are going to use eminent domain to condemn two zip codes -- you have to ask, 'How does that make sense?'''
 Cherokee officials say the company -- which has already spent about $2.5 million on the Pennsauken project -- expects to be back before a federal judge shortly to press for the next step toward condemnation, while Citgo officials and environmentalists say they will continue to fight Cherokee. 
 For his part, Mr. Darden is confident his company is providing what the people want: 
 ''Ninety percent of the people would say: 'Christmas only comes once a year. Santa Claus is here.' The worst thing that could happen would be for us to go away.''

An article on April 17 about Cherokee Investment Partners and its role in redeveloping several former industrial sites in New Jersey -- the first of two parts -- included an incorrect estimate of fees that Cherokee received for accepting dredge from the Army Corps of Engineers. From information provided by the corps that it pays $10 to $35 a cubic yard to dispose of the material, the article concluded that Cherokee would receive $40 million to $140 million for four million cubic yards of dredge. A contract shows that the corps has agreed to pay the company $5 a cubic yard. 
 The second article, on April 24, about the redevelopment of Pennsauken and Petty's Island, the site of a former Citgo petroleum refinery, quoted the island's environmental manager for Citgo, Jack McCrossin. By his account, a lawyer for Citgo said that when the company approached Cherokee to ask about the eagles, the lawyer was told, ''If the governor wants Petty's Island developed, it will get developed.'' A lawyer for Cherokee, Eric Wisler, denies that he or the company made the comment. 
 In each case, in fairness, The Times should have given Cherokee an opportunity to comment. 
 In addition, the April 24 article suggested erroneously that a falconry expert working for Cherokee needed state and federal permission before observing two bald eagles on Petty's Island. No such permission is required.
 Because of an editing error, the article said incorrectly that the National Wildlife Refuge System -- to whom Citgo was offering the land in exchange for sparing it millions of dollars in cleanup costs in other parts of the state --had not acquired land in New Jersey since the early 1990's. While the system has not acquired new tracts in recent years, it has indeed added acreage to its current holdings.

HEADLINE: Taking Some of the Air Out of a President's Big Day

BYLINE: By JOHN SULLIVAN

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
FOR months, the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey has been preening -- some say too much -- as it prepares for a week of celebration marking the inauguration of the third president in the institution's 35-year history. But along with the preening, there is sure to be squirming under the academic robes that were being dusted off last week. 
 Instead of basking in the glow of anticipation at the nation's largest public health-care university, questions have been swirling over the institution's financial practices, including the awarding of no-bid contracts and grants to non-affiliated organizations, charitable donations and a general concern about a lack of oversight. 
 Indeed, after the number of disclosures seemed to reach a critical mass, acting Gov. Richard J. Codey called for an investigation into the awarding of one contract, the trustees of the university called for its own review of other transactions, and one legislator even urged the university to postpone the inauguration until the air was cleared -- a suggestion it dismissed out of hand. 
 Some of the loudest criticism has involved the cost of the ceremonies -- which begin on Tuesday with the inauguration of the new president, John J. Petillo -- with state legislators and medical students questioning why the state-financed university was prepared to spend lavishly on a weeklong series of celebrations at a time when New Jersey is struggling to make up a multibillion-dollar budget deficit.
 ''I think there are a lot more pressing issues to be addressed before spending all this money on an inauguration,'' Joseph A. Ting, a second-year dental student, said last week as he took a break with fellow students on the Newark campus. 
 ''All this money'' means the more than $100,000 that the university plans to spend on the inauguration, starting with the swearing-in of Dr. Petillo at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center at which ''Tiffany-inspired'' key chains will be handed out, followed by a reception for 2,500 dignitaries and guests. 
 Assemblywoman Loretta Weinberg, a Democrat from Bergen County who called for the postponement of the inauguration, returned her invitation last month, along with an angry note to university leaders that said, ''This is not a king's coronation.'' 
 ''This is completely inappropriate,'' Ms. Weinberg, chairwoman of the Assembly Health and Human Services Committee, said later in an interview.
 Criticism of the inauguration has become more pointed as the school and Dr. Petillo -- who has been functioning as president of the university since his appointment in mid-November -- faces increasing scrutiny from state officials. In recent weeks, state Medicaid officials have said they are examining billing problems at a university hospital, and the trustees placed a moratorium on charitable donations after questions were raised about grants made with university funds. Recently, state legislators asked to examine the employment contracts of senior university officers.
 ''We don't want to see politics insinuated into the university,'' said Assemblyman Robert Lewis Morgan, a Democrat of Red Bank who is a professor of pediatric medicine at the university.
 Since Ms. Weinberg and others raised objections over the lavish inauguration, the university has scaled back its original plans. Although Dr. Petillo is still scheduled to meet with students at each of the university's four campuses during the week, the events will be low-key and feature snacks in the school's auditoriums. In addition, a university-wide celebration scheduled for New Brunswick has been canceled altogether. 
 ''It's not a black tie and champagne reception,'' R. Michael Gallagher, dean of the School of Osteopathic Medicine and cochairman of the inauguration committee, said of the festivities scheduled for the performing arts center. ''It's not like we are going overboard here.''
 Last week, university officials said that they could not estimate a final cost, although Dr. Gallagher said the price would be more than $100,000, but less than $200,000.
 ''What we are spending is pretty comparable to what other institutions would be spending,'' he said. 
 That depends on the institution. Two years ago, Rutgers spent about $100,000 for the rather spartan inauguration of its current president, Richard McCormick. Steve Manas, a university spokesman, said the ceremony was held in the gym, and guests received a bottle of water and two cookies. 
 ''There was a decision not to do anything elaborate because the economy was tough,'' he said.
 Of course, for low-key inaugurations it is hard to beat Mr. Codey's introduction to the perquisites of the governor's office. In November, he took the oath in the living room of his house in West Orange while State Senator Leonard Lance held the Bible.
 ''The university says the inaugural signifies a new day,'' Ms. Weinberg said. ''Governor Codey's swearing in signified a new day -- four people in his living room.''
 Even with the university's scaled-back plans, many students interviewed here last week seemed to think the money could be better spent. Asked to identify a more pressing need, Mr. Ting gestured across the quad toward the new Oral Health Pavilion as several classmates -- wearing navy-blue surgical scrubs -- grinned broadly.
 The building looks great, he said, but dental classes are still being held in sagging old rooms in the nearby New Jersey Medical School. In one class the ceiling leaks, another student said, and in another a foam ceiling tile fell on her head during an exam.
 The old rooms are still being used because much of the Oral Health Pavilion is an illusion in concrete and glass: only the upper floors of the three-story building are usable. Construction was begun on the $45 million pavilion in September 2002, but the school needs to raise more funds before the lower levels can be completed.
 ''The building was designed in anticipation of future expansion to support the future needs of the dental school,'' said Susan Preston, a spokeswoman for the university.
 Against this backdrop of half-finished buildings and increasing tuition for the 5,000 students enrolled in the university's eight schools of medicine, nursing and other biomedical sciences around the state, the announcement earlier this year of a lavish celebration marking Dr. Petillo's inauguration hit a decidedly wrong note. 
 For Ms. Weinberg, administering the oath of office followed by a small luncheon for faculty and guests on campus would have been more appropriate.
 ''This is public money,'' she said in an interview. ''It is a public university and we are in the throes of a terrific budget crisis. The Assembly, along with the Senate, are going to be called upon to cut all sorts of worthy programs. It is completely inappropriate to put on this extravaganza.''
 Controversy is nothing new to Dr. Petillo, the first president of the university not to have a medical degree; his doctorate is in counseling and personnel. 
 The university raised eyebrows last November, when it disclosed that the board of trustees -- of which Dr. Petillo was then chairman -- spent $350,000 on a national search for a successor to the departing president, Stuart Cook. In the end, the trustees found they did not have to look far; they selected Dr. Petillo, who at the time was executive director of the Newark Alliance, a coalition of business groups dedicated to improving Newark, for the $575,000-a-year job.
 To be sure, a number of faculty members have praised Dr. Petillo's work since taking office. Frederick Lepore, head of the faculty association at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick -- one of the eight schools that make up UMDNJ -- said Dr. Petillo had made a concerted effort to work with the university's disparate schools, a longtime organizational problem. 
 ''I am impressed so far with what is going on,'' Dr. Lepore said.
 Others say Dr. Petillo -- a former Roman Catholic priest who was the chancellor of Seton Hall University from 1983 to 1990 -- is a tireless worker with an encyclopedic grasp of the issues facing the university.
 These days, the issues keep piling up. 
 Not long after Dr. Petillo assumed the presidency, it was disclosed that he had issued a $95,000 grant to Casa Israel, a nonprofit organization run by Stephen N. Adubato, an influential community leader in Newark and a supporter of Dr. Petillo. 
 Then The Star-Ledger reported that the university had issued a no-bid contract to a politically connected lobbyist -- before Dr. Petillo took office -- leading Mr. Codey to call for a report on the lobbying contract from the university. Since then, the university has asked a retired state Supreme Court justice, James Coleman, to oversee an audit of all no-bid contracts issued by the university over the past several years.
 The university also imposed a moratorium on charitable contributions after The Star-Ledger reported that a $10,000 donation was made by UMDNJ to a charity associated with a Newark city council member.
 More recently, university officials have said they have notified state Medicaid officials of possible problems with bills paid to university clinics. For their part, university officials say they plan to meet with state Medicaid representatives to answer questions about the billing.
 And so as the university community is poised to don caps and gowns and embrace a new president, members of the state Legislature are beginning to ask their own questions about dealings at UMDNJ. Ms. Weinberg and Dr. Morgan have asked for details of the employment contracts of all senior university employees.
 Assemblyman Morgan said legislators ''want to see that every dollar is focused on its core mission, which is health care.''
 Dr. Morgan, who like Ms. Weinberg is a member of the Assembly Health and Human Services Committee, said legislators need to exercise oversight of the spending because the university -- one of the largest employers in Newark -- is crucial to the state's economy and the health of many residents.
 ''We are in an era when the university is trying to transform itself into a national research center,'' he said. ''It all revolves around the integrity of the university. We cannot afford to see that wither away. It takes decades to build a good reputation, but you can lose it in a fortnight through bad management.''

HEADLINE: The Irish Patient And Dr. Lawsuit

BYLINE: By WARREN ST. JOHN

 BODY:
WHEN Liam Cregan got a call from the Irish Consulate in New York on March 15, telling him that his wife, Kathleen Kelly Cregan, was in critical condition at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital, he thought it had to be a mistake, that someone had stolen her passport. 
 Mrs. Cregan had left her home in rural Ireland two days before, telling her husband, a farmer and part-time plumber, that she would be attending a business course in Dublin. 
 In fact she had flown to the United States to have a face-lift performed by Dr. Michael E. Sachs in his offices on Central Park South. Hours after surgery she went into cardiac arrest and was rushed to the hospital. 
 There, on March 17, with her husband and two sisters at her side, Mrs. Cregan, 42 and the mother of two young sons, was taken off life support and died. Her death is under investigation by the New York State Health Department. An autopsy was inconclusive, and the New York City medical examiner is awaiting toxicology reports that might explain what went wrong. 
 But from the time of her death her family had a simpler question: How did a farmer's wife from outside Limerick meet her end in such an improbable place? 
 Examining Mrs. Cregan's knapsack after her death, her family found a folded copy of an article from The Sunday Independent of Ireland. It was a glowing account of a face-lift performed by Dr. Sachs, ''a leading cosmetic and facial reconstruction surgeon'' in the United States, the article said, with a ''highly confidential client list.''
 ''There's a lot of money and interest here when it comes to plastic surgery,'' the article continued, ''but there is also confusion and ignorance.''
 There were certainly things Mrs. Cregan was confused by and ignorant about. She had no idea, said her sister, Agnes Kelly, a nurse who lives outside Boston, that Dr. Sachs is among the most sued doctors in New York State, having settled 33 malpractice suits since 1995. She did not know that last year the State Health Department took the extraordinary step of banning Dr. Sachs -- an ear, nose and throat specialist -- from performing complex nasal surgeries without the supervision of another surgeon; that the operating room in his office is not accredited, as many of the best ones are; or that while he states on his Web site that he has been affiliated with the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary ''for the last 23 years,'' he is not affiliated with that hospital or any other.
 What Mrs. Cregan knew about Dr. Sachs came from publicity he helped generate through newspapers, magazines and television shows in Ireland, just as earlier he had paid publicists in the United States to help make him a celebrity doctor and attract patients. Her journey from Ireland to a private operating room in Manhattan offers a cautionary tale about the ability of doctors with tarnished records to promote themselves to trusting patients and the news media's role in abetting these efforts. 
 Dr. Sachs maintains that he has been unfairly singled out by New York State, by patients with unrealistic expectations of plastic surgery and by the media. He said he had settled the large number of lawsuits at the urging of insurance companies that favored payouts over the cost of litigation. And Dr. Sachs said he was confident that the state investigation into Mrs. Cregan's death would show he did nothing wrong.
 ''I'm a good surgeon and a caring doctor and a good doctor,'' he said. ''We certainly had absolutely nothing to do with this.''
 THE son of a wealthy Manhattan real estate family, Dr. Sachs ignored his father's wishes by choosing medicine over the family business. From early on, colleagues say, he distinguished himself not just with his surgical skills -- he once directed the residency program at New York Eye and Ear -- but with his flair for self-promotion. Nancy Behrman, a publicist who worked for Dr. Sachs in 2003, said that while many surgeons come across as reserved or even taciturn, he was a favorite of magazine editors and television producers because he was outgoing and personable. McCall's and Harpers Bazaar featured him in makeover stories in the 1980's and early 90's. In 1991 and again in 1993 he appeared on the Oprah Winfrey show.
 But because of the exposure he ran afoul of some in the medical establishment. On ''Oprah,'' Dr. Sachs boasted he spent much of his time fixing the botched work of lesser surgeons, comments that angered the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, a medical society Dr. Sachs had joined 10 years before. The group demanded that Dr. Sachs appear before its ethics committee to explain his remarks. Instead he quit. 
 ''I said, 'You know what, I'd rather not be in an inquisition like that, and I'm just going to resign,''' Dr. Sachs said in an interview last week. ''And I did.''
 Not long after his second appearance on ''Oprah,'' the lawsuits began. He settled 4 in 1995, 1 in 1996, 2 in 1997 and 11 in 1999. One woman sued Dr. Sachs after cotton packing was inadvertently left in her sinuses after surgery, infecting the cartilage and bones in her face and requiring multiple surgeries to correct. Another patient charged that Dr. Sachs improperly removed cartilage from her sinuses, causing her breathing passages to collapse. In all, Dr. Sachs said, his insurers have paid around $3 million in settlements.
 Jay R. Butterman, a lawyer for Dr. Sachs, said the number of suits stemmed from Dr. Sachs's specialty, revisional rhinoplasty -- fixing botched nose jobs -- which, Mr. Butterman said, carries higher risks than first-time nose jobs. ''We're talking surgery a literal handful of physicians in this country are willing to do,'' Mr. Butterman said.
 But Dr. Peter B. Fodor, the president of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, said revisional rhinoplasty was quite common and not a viable explanation for the large number of suits. ''That's a very lame excuse,'' he said. ''A lot of us do it.''
 How was a much-sued doctor able to get malpractice insurance? It would be difficult in many states, experts said. But in New York all doctors are guaranteed coverage through the state's malpractice risk pool, which was set up to ensure that even those with small, high-risk practices can buy insurance, said Bruce R. Swicker, the president of Earhart Leigh Associates, which sells malpractice insurance. ''It guarantees that even doctors like Dr. Sachs can keep practicing,'' Mr. Swicker said. ''The private market in other states probably would have priced him out by now.''
 Despite the wave of suits Dr. Sachs did not lack for patients. Dr. John J. Grillo, who worked with him as an anesthesiologist for six years, beginning in 1996, said Dr. Sachs often crammed as many as 10 surgeries into a single day. Dr. Grillo said he became concerned about Dr. Sachs's furious pace and what he perceived as a lax attitude towards patient follow-up. In 2001 he quit, fearful, he said, that the number of lawsuits might portend something far worse.
 ''I wasn't comfortable working in an environment with so many lawsuits,'' Dr. Grillo said. ''In my opinion he lost his compassion. I didn't think he cared.''
 In response, Dr. Sachs said: ''I'm shocked he would say that. That's absolutely untrue. I really care about my patients.''
 Many patients were happy with Dr. Sachs's work. Michael Longo, a hair stylist at the Stephen Knoll Salon in Manhattan, who has had his eyes and nose done by Dr. Sachs, said he had sent more than 100 patients to him since the mid-1980's.
 ''He's done my mother, my friends, my clients,'' Mr. Longo said. ''My reputation is at stake when I refer people to him.'' Mr. Longo said that Dr. Sachs showed his appreciation for the referrals by giving surgery to Mr. Longo's friends and relatives free.
 In 2000 The Daily News in New York included Dr. Sachs on a list of the ''most sued doctors in New York.'' State health authorities soon began investigating a case in which Dr. Sachs had performed 16 surgeries on the same patient. The next year, as a routine review of his credientials was approaching at New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, Dr. Sachs said he decided to end his affiliation because of what he called negativity from his peers there. From then on, Dr. Sachs would operate exclusively at his office without the oversight of other physicians. 
 At the conclusion of the state investigation in 2004, the Health Department allowed Dr. Sachs to keep his license but prohibited him from doing any nose procedures that required more than two surgeries unless he was supervised by another surgeon. Despite the finding, Dr. Sachs said he was relieved.
 ''I said, 'If it's a very complicated congenital case, fine, we'll do a team approach.' I welcomed them coming in and observing, and it got twisted in the press that I was somehow being punished.''
 Dr. Sachs continued to appear in magazines with no questioning of his qualifications. He also appeared in an article in The Wall Street Journal about Botox parties, in The New York Observer commenting on the appearance of Senator John Kerry and in an article in The New York Times about holiday tipping habits in Manhattan. (Dr. Sachs had given his masseuse and nanny cosmetic surgery for their tips.) 
 In 2002 Dr. Sachs expanded his practice to Ireland, a country with a booming economy that was just getting past the view of plastic surgery as taboo. In interviews there he displayed his familiar confidence. He told The Irish Examiner that most Irish plastic surgeons ''wouldn't be allowed to practice for five minutes in New York.'' Appearing in 2003 on a broadcast of ''Ireland AM,'' the country's most popular morning television show, he stated he had done 42,000 rhinoplasties.
 ''Forty-two thousand rhinoplasties?'' asked the host. ''Lot of noses.''
 ''That's right,'' Dr. Sachs said. ''Lot of noses.'' Indeed it was: an average of more than four every day since he graduated from medical school at Loyola University in Chicago. 
 In 2004 an Irish grandmother named Helen Donaghy agreed to allow a reporter from The Sunday Independent to chronicle a face-lift that Dr. Sachs would perform free. Most medical societies prohibit members from bartering surgery for public relations purposes. ''We'd frown on that,'' said Kelly Miller, a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery, of which Dr. Sachs is a member. ''It's a conflict of interest.''
 Dr. Sachs said he was unaware of the policy.
 The result of his agreement with Mrs. Donaghy was a cover article in the Independent's Sunday magazine. ''People have been stopping me on the street to tell me how good I look,'' Mrs. Donaghy was quoted as saying. ''I'm having the time of my life.'' The article gave contact information and a Web site for Dr. Sachs but omitted any mention of the problems he faced. 
 ''If this guy is fit to practice medicine in the United States, who are we to say he's not fit to practice?'' said Brendan O'Connor, the editor of The Sunday Independent magazine. But Mr. O'Connor said last week he was unaware of the 33 lawsuits or the restrictions placed on Dr. Sachs by New York State health authorities. 
 The article made an impression on Mrs. Cregan, a town clerk in Limerick, who was quietly despairing over her appearance. ''I am 42 years old but look 56 to 58,'' she confided in an e-mail message to Dr. Sachs. ''I have become very self-conscious when meeting people.'' 
 Mrs. Cregan had visited the doctor's Web site, www.MichaelEvanSachs.com, her sister said, where Dr. Sachs identifies himself as surgical director of the Sachs Institute for Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. In fact, he acknowledged, he is the institute's only surgeon, and the institute is merely his office. 
 The Web site also identifies Dr. Sachs as a founding member of the American Society of Revisional Surgery and a clinical professor at New York Eye and Ear Infirmary and implies he has ''courtesy privileges'' at the prestigious Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital.
 IN reality Dr. Sachs had had no affiliation with Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat since 1991, the hospital said, and he ended his affiliation with New York Eye and Ear in 2001. The American Society of Revisional Surgeons was an organization Dr. Sachs said he had once tried to start, but that ''never really got off the ground.''
 Dr. Scott L. Spear, the president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, commenting on Dr. Sachs's curriculum vitae and biography, said: ''This thing is full of puffery, self-aggrandizement and not professional. This is not a surgeon of high professional standing.''
 Dr. Sachs acknowledged that the credentials on the two-year-old Web site were ''confusing'' and out of date, adding that he would soon correct them.
 Although Mrs. Cregan may not have had the expertise to decode Dr. Sachs's resume, an Internet search might have revealed his inclusion in The Daily News's list of most sued doctors. A New York State-run Web site, www.NYDoctorProfile.com, lists medical malpractice judgments and disciplinary actions against doctors. 
 Agnes Kelly said her sister would not have thought to doubt what she read about Dr. Sachs in the newspaper or on his Web site. 
 By e-mail Mrs. Cregan told Dr. Sachs she wanted a full face-lift. He said he could do it for 25,000 euros, or $32,600. But there was a twist. Dr. Sachs was planning to be in Ireland in February for a charity event, and if Mrs. Cregan would meet him at his hotel, a lavish golf resort in Kildare, and pay in advance, Dr. Sachs's office manager in New York wrote, Dr. Sachs would reduce the fee to 15,000 euros. 
 Mrs. Cregan took out a loan, her sister said, met Dr. Sachs at the resort and one month later left her home at about 6 a.m. for a flight to Kennedy Airport. By 6 p.m. she was undergoing surgery in Dr. Sachs's office.
 Around 9, the surgery was completed, and Mrs. Cregan walked to a recovery room, where a nurse checked on her every hour. At 6:30 the next morning, a nurse's log shows, Mrs. Cregan complained of dizziness. She went into cardiac arrest shortly after. 
 Mr. Cregan arrived in New York the following night, in time for a tense family meeting with Dr. Sachs.
 ''He was full of praise for himself,'' Mrs. Kelly said of Dr. Sachs. ''He said, 'I operate on presidents' wives' and talked about where he is in life, how popular he is.''
 That evening Mrs. Cregan was declared brain-dead. The family had her respirator disconnected the next morning, and she died almost immediately.
 ''Without a doubt it's a tragedy,'' Dr. Sachs said last week. ''We did everything we could to treat her with as much care, respect and love as we could.'' He said he has resumed his normal surgery schedule and has the support of friends and former patients. 
 ''They're patting me on the back, and saying, 'Listen, Dr. Sachs, you're a really fine surgeon, and I trust you to do my surgery.' My patients were consoling me. It made me feel great.''
 Mrs. Kelly said the family was awaiting a final report from the medical examiner and looking into a lawsuit against Dr. Sachs. Whatever the outcome of the report, she said, she is certain her sister was unaware of Dr. Sachs's track record.
 ''If she had known in advance, she would never have gone to Dr. Sachs,'' Ms. Kelly said.

HEADLINE: Discount Airlines Spread Wings Across Asia

BYLINE: By WAYNE ARNOLD

 BODY:
TOMORROW, Asia's first low-cost carrier, three-year-old Air Asia, is scheduled to make its maiden flight into mainland China, inaugurating a route from Bangkok to Xiamen. The fare is less than $50.
 The new route underscores where the region's budget airline industry is going. After mushrooming across Southeast Asia in the past year, discount carriers are rapidly spreading to tap great numbers of potential passengers in China and India. There, low-cost airlines based in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand will compete with domestic budget carriers that are cropping up in both countries. For the cost-conscious traveler, this expansion is creating a network of cheap international connections that make flying around Asia less costly than ever. 
 ''It's happened extraordinarily quickly,'' said Peter Harbison, managing director of the Center for Asia Pacific Aviation in Sydney. Only a year ago, he said, ''there was a majority feeling that these carriers would not survive.''
 Back then, many industry observers said the model used by Ryanair that has been followed by other budget carriers in Europe and in the United States would not work across a region as diverse as Asia. The population was too poor, they argued, and the list of potential routes was limited by thorny international agreements. They were wrong. Now there are more than 15 discount airlines flying from Tianjin to Bombay.
 What the doubters had not anticipated was the pent-up demand for travel between points separated by water. ''It's unlike Europe, where airlines have to compete with high-speed rail or the autobahn,'' said Anthony Chin, a transportation economist at the National University of Singapore.
 Instead, no-frills airlines offer a quicker alternative to run-down and often dangerously overcrowded buses, ferries and trains.
 Since 2002, Air Asia, which is based in Malaysia, has expanded its fleet from two Boeing 737's flying domestic routes there to 30 aircraft flying to Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines and now China. It has a subsidiary based in Bangkok and another in Jakarta. The success of Air Asia (one of its planes is pictured above) has spawned imitators. In Singapore alone, there are three new discount carriers -- Valuair, Tiger Airways and JetStar Asia. The market is potentially enormous. The Center for Asia Pacific Aviation says that there are 235 cities in Asia with 339 airports capable of receiving the short-haul Boeing 737's and Airbus A320's favored by no-frills airlines.
 The fares are enticing. Valuair flies from Singapore to Hong Kong, a three-hour, 45-minute flight, for as little as $130 round trip. And while a seat on the full-service Singapore Airlines from Singapore to Bangkok costs roughly $180, without airport taxes, Air Asia recently advertised promotional fares on that route for $2.40.
 The Bangkok-Singapore corridor has, in fact, become a hotly contested route largely because Singapore and Thailand have dropped regulatory restrictions on each other's airlines as the two countries compete to become the air hub for Southeast Asia.
 Kuala Lumpur is also vying for this position and both the Kuala Lumpur International Airport and Changi International Airport in Singapore are building terminals to handle low-cost carriers.
 Farther north, the Hong Kong and Macau airports are competing to become the budget hub into China. But there are indications that the budget carriers may bypass both cities to fly directly to points inside China. Air Asia, for example, plans to add flights from Bangkok to Kunming and Chengdu this year. Nok Air, the discount subsidiary of Thai Airways International, plans to fly from Bangkok to Shenzhen.
 China's regulators recently began allowing any company with at least three aircraft to operate an airline. That cleared the way for the debut in March of China's first domestic low-cost carrier, Okay, which flies from Tianjin to Kunming and Changsha. At least three other Chinese budget carriers are planning to begin operating this year.
 India's government has also opened its aviation sector to competition. Already the success of India's first discount airline, Air Deccan, has lured new entrants. Air-India, a national carrier, launched its low-cost subsidiary Air-India Express this year with routes from Delhi, Mumbai, Cochin and Trivandrum to the Persian Gulf. In May, two more budget carriers, Kingfisher Airlines and SpiceJet, plan to start operations.
 The process is not entirely smooth, however. Air Asia, for instance, has accused Singapore of protecting Changi airport by preventing the Thai carrier from busing passengers to the cheaper Malaysian airport in nearby Johor Bahru, even arresting its drivers on one occasion.
 For veterans of budget air travel, there will be few surprises -- delays, pushy passengers and restrictions on changing reservations are common.
 But some carriers are blurring the line between no-frills and full service. For example, Valuair, the Singapore carrier, offers reserved seating and free in-flight meals, and flies as far as Perth, Australia, six hours away, for as little as $170. Yet, at the same time -- and unlike their predecessors elsewhere -- Asia's discount airlines are opting to buy new aircraft. Kingfisher and Air Asia, for example, recently signed deals to buy new Airbus A320's.
 The biggest headache may be the fact that, to save on agent fees, these airlines generally don't provide information to online agencies such as Expedia or Travelocity; so prospective passengers must visit each airline's Web site and keep track of rapidly changing route networks.
 Travelers should also make sure that the airline they choose is still around when the time comes to travel. Analysts warn that a shakeout is looming, and the proliferation of budget airlines has already created a shortage of pilots, technicians and flight crew. High oil prices are another problem.
 The full-service airlines aren't sitting idly by, either. Last month, the full-service carrier, Singapore Airlines, offered Internet fares to points around Asia for the no-frills sounding price of just $60.

HEADLINE: 19th-Century Houses, With a 21st-Century to Come

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY. 
E-mail: streetscapes@nytimes.com

 BODY:
IT'S locally famous for two small wooden houses built in the mid-19th century, but there is also current news on the picturesque, steeply sloping block of 92nd Street from Park to Lexington Avenues. On the long-vacant lot at 125 East 92nd -- where the 92nd Street Y tried (and failed) to build a modernist annex -- a banker has gotten permission from the Landmarks Preservation Commission to put up an imposing mansion, a note de luxe on a block of more modest dwellings.
 Several other houses are in flux, and this street is a particularly rewarding destination for the architectural pilgrim.
 The earliest building on the block is the tiny frame house at 122 East 92nd, built in 1859; the other wooden house, its somewhat larger neighbor, at No. 120, was built in 1871. By that time the block was waking up -- the houses at 121-123 East 92nd had been put up the year before. In the 1880's the lovely rows at Nos. 126-128 and 134-138 went up in a mix of brick and stone, shortly before the simple brownstone-front houses at 127-135 East 92nd. 
 Early directory listings indicate that the initial householders were prosperous but not rich -- like Charles Cappa, bandmaster of the Seventh Regiment of the National Guard, who lived at 121 East 92nd. 
 Cappa died in 1893 and thus had no chance to sign an 1894 petition -- along with 40 other owners on the block -- asking the Board of Health to evict a chapter of the Salvation Army from an old building at 107 East 92nd (no longer standing). According to a report in The New York Times, the owners maintained that the occupants were constantly parading around with drums, cymbals and horns. The residents complained that the band was ''using up our nerves'' and attracting ''dangerous characters to the neighborhood,'' The Times said. There was no later report of any action taken by the board.
 The 1930 census indicates that most of the buildings were being run as rooming houses, with residents who listed occupations like bricklayer, poultry dealer, governess and chauffeur. But a few houses were still serving as private residences, like 138 East 92nd, occupied by Allan Hawkins, 40, who was a building superintendent and lived in the house with his family of five. On a block where the census showed that almost everyone had been born in the United States or Europe, the Hawkins family was unusual. Everyone over age 18 had been born in Trinidad; Hawkins had emigrated in 1912, and his was the only black family on the block.
 Continuing elite settlement on the side streets off Fifth, Madison and Park Avenues eventually brought a new group to this block of 92nd Street. In 1935, for instance, the architects William and Geoffrey Platt renovated the old row house at No. 124, removing the stoop and giving the house a severe new facade of stucco.
 It bore the simplest classical detailing, like the frieze panel at the parapet, formed by only four horizontal flutes, a detail usually seen in vertical form. Their client was Helen Roosevelt Robinson, a daughter of James Roosevelt Roosevelt, a half-brother of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1904, she had married Theodore Douglas Robinson, who was a nephew of President Theodore Roosevelt and thus her own distant relation. 
 Mrs. Robinson got a new neighbor in 1938, when Isabella Greenway rebuilt the two old buildings at Nos. 130 and 132 into a single town house, the most ambitious ever on the block. Mrs. Greenway's architect, William Lawrence Bottomley, shaved off the old detail and replaced it with a Regency-style design of high sophistication. The design was meant to be limestone -- a material hitherto unseen on the block -- with a concave, curved front. But economy won out, and the limestone became stucco.
 Bottomley gave it a suave 1930's take on a Palladian window, the three parts joined by a scalloped, fluted panel of marble. Original designs show that Bottomley intended classical ornament in the form of aluminum for the upper part of the facade, but it is not clear if the plan was carried out. 
 Perhaps it was Mrs. Robinson who brought Mrs. Greenway to the block, for the later arrival was also a Roosevelt confidant: a friend from childhood of Theodore Roosevelt, and a bridesmaid at the wedding of Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt. Mrs. Greenway had been active in politics in the Southwest, and when she seconded the nomination of Franklin Roosevelt at the 1932 Democratic presidential convention, The Times said that ''her cheeks have that healthy glow that comes of cow-ranching and flying over mountains in airplanes.'' 
 Mrs. Greenway was elected to Congress from Arizona in 1933; she was re-elected in 1934 but declined to run again in 1936. In office, she found herself sparring with the president. She favored a much more expansive Social Security program and told The Times that the federal government ''must continue to tax and spend with gallantry,'' faulting her colleagues for ''failing to tell the people how serious their difficulties are, how hard it may be to remedy them.''
 In 1993, the block was included in an expanded Carnegie Hill Historic District, and several years later the 92nd Street Y sought to build an annex on a vacant lot at 125 East 92nd, but the project never went ahead. Now excavation is under way for a new house, for which the owner is listed as Rodney S. Miller, a banker at Credit Suisse First Boston. 
 At the same time, renovators are active at the oldest house, No. 122, where the garden is torn up and workers go in and out. The facade of No. 121, the old Cappa house, offers some interesting detective work -- even a novice can see that trowel marks in what are meant to be seen as individual bricks continue across the fake joints.
 At No. 124, Cathy Franklin, a real estate broker at Brown Harris Stevens, is nearly finished with the renovation of the old Robinson house, which she owns with her husband, Jeffrey Baker. She was not tempted to put back the stoop. ''The houses are much sunnier without them,'' she says. Next door, an interested pedestrian can admire the luscious little stained-glass transom at No. 126, and at night there are glimpses of original interior woodwork. 
 Ms. Franklin says that the Greenway house at Nos. 130-132 has been sold. Any new buyer has considerable rescue work ahead. The beautifully executed ironwork cries out for attention, and an earlier owner discarded Bottomley's multipaned windows and replaced them with single-paned ones with screens, deadening the facade. 
 It now appears that the limestone that Bottomley eliminated from the design of the Greenway house will finally arrive, but on a different building. David Mann, the architect for Mr. Miller's house at No. 125, says the facade will be entirely Indiana limestone, and renderings show a gridlike elevation.
 Mr. Mann says that during community review of the design, there was some criticism that the stone was ''out of place'' on this otherwise modest block. No one knew that Bottomley had called for the same material, almost directly across the street.

HEADLINE: The Government's Pyramid Scheme

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
THE Department of Agriculture unveiled its new and improved food pyramid last week, and a predictable onslaught of jokes followed.
 The pyramid, an illustration of dietary guidelines that has adorned cereal boxes and bread wrappers for more than a decade, now comes in 12 versions to guide Americans more precisely about their nutritional needs. But, the joke goes, why did the U.S.D.A. leave out the Saturday night version? Martinis, steak and cigarettes.
 Others contend the pyramid, with its colorful vertical stripes representing the food groups, is the nutritional equivalent of the Homeland Security advisory system, and about as useful. Which leads to a more serious question: In an age when consumers can easily get nutritional information from so many sources, has the pyramid's relevance gone the way of the evening news anchor? 
 Government-issued nutrition advice once served a critical purpose. In the first half of the 20th century, the dietary guidelines helped Americans eat economically during the Depression, and, later, navigate rationing through World War II.
 Reacting to a population more sophisticated about food and health and a growing body of nutrition science, the U.S.D.A. introduced the pyramid in 1992, but innovation hasn't done much for the American diet. While more than 80 percent of Americans recognize the food pyramid, only 2 percent to 4 percent eat according to its principles, the department has found. In the years since the pyramid was introduced, obesity rates have climbed in every state. The government reports that 65 percent of adults aged 20 to 74 are overweight, and that nearly one-half of this group qualify as obese.
 Reversing those numbers is a lot to ask from a government graphic, said Bill Layden, a food and health marketing executive who once worked for the public relations giant Porter Novelli, which designed the food pyramid for the government.
 ''We don't expect people to learn how to drive a car by showing them an icon,'' he said. ''Changing how people eat is going to require a whole lot more than one image.''
 Part of the problem is that the dietary guidelines, the blueprint the pyramid is built with, are first and foremost intended for the $46 billion in federal food and education programs. Everything from the meals served in school lunchrooms to those in federal prisons must meet the guidelines.
 Critics of the food industry say the pyramid is really more of a marketing tool for food manufacturers than an educational tool for consumers. ''The U.S.D.A. seems to have bent over backward to avoid upsetting any particular commodity group or food company by not showing any foods that Americans should eat less of,'' said Margo Wootan of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.
 Among critics, the new program's name -- MyPyramid -- is being mocked as McPyramid. And they even speculate that the program's new emphasis on exercise can be seen as a way to get people to eat more, thus assuring more sales and profits for food companies.
 Since the Agriculture Department's mission is to promote American agriculture, the critics say, it can't be an impartial dispenser of dietary advice. 
 Jeanne Goldberg, director of the Center on Nutrition at Tufts University, worked on the original pyramid and said similar concerns surfaced then. ''The headline was 'the foxes are guarding the henhouse,''' she said. ''How can the U.S.D.A. be the lead agency in nutrition education if it's also the organization responsible for protecting the commodity groups? I think it's tough.''
 There are signs, however, that Americans are starting to address the problem on their own. The rate of snacking is down, and concern about sugar in food is up, according to researchers at the NPD Group, which tracks American eating patterns. In addition, people are eating out less and 27 percent report they are conscious of the calories in each meal. That figure is the highest it has been since 1999.
 A new health-consciousness is apparent in grocery aisles as well. Organic and natural foods are the fastest-growing segment within the food industry. Although organics still account for only about 2 percent of the food business in this country, their market share has grown by nearly 20 percent a year since 1997.
 It's the shopper who is really deciding, said Stephanie Childs of the Grocery Manufacturers of America, which represents about 350 food companies and submitted pages of testimony to help create the new pyramid. ''There's just been this critical mass of forward motion to improve products,'' she said. ''Taste is still No. 1, but consumers are very in tune to improving their families' health.''
 Like others in the food industry, the grocery manufacturers group is taking the food pyramid seriously. The new graphic will be used to market products that meet the guidelines. Shoppers are already seeing guideline-related advertising for products promoting whole-grain cereals and milk because the new pyramid calls for consuming more of these foods.
 Even people involved with the guidelines say changing what's on grocery shelves and at restaurants is more important than any set of government advice.
 ''Expecting individual Americans to improve the overall quality of their diet without some further actions is going to be extremely difficult,'' said Janet King, a nutrition expert who led the team of 13 doctors and researchers who wrote the 2005 dietary guidelines. ''When they're bombarded with unhealthy food choices that are cheap, it is very difficult to make these changes.''
 Perhaps, others argue, the answer lies not in science and policy but in the basics: good food eaten in moderation with family and friends.
 Writes Harvey Hartman, a Seattle-area market researcher and author, in a commentary on MyPyramid: ''Perhaps it's time to give our science a much-needed breather and meditate on what it really means to live and eat together, as humans -- in sync not with the regression outputs of biostatisticians but with rhythms and rituals of social life.''

HEADLINE: Ready for Enrichment, Even on a Saturday

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG. 
E-mail: wested@nytimes.com

DATELINE: VALHALLA 

 BODY:
MOST teenagers would rather sleep late on a Saturday morning than listen to a presentation on ''Sleep Deprivation in Teenagers.''
 But not the 45 middle- and high-school students who are part of the Science and Technology Enrichment Program, which runs Saturday mornings at the New York Medical Campus here between September and June. The program is meant to encourage girls and minority students to consider careers in science, technology or health-related fields. 
 The program offers students classes in neuroscience, physics, chemistry, math and bio-ethics, as well as participation in a robotics competition. Students are expected to pursue independent research projects in science. Topics this year included multiple personality disorders and Tourette's syndrome in adolescence.
 ''It's a way to form another pipeline,'' said Marva Richards, program coordinator. The program, which was started in 1987, is paid for by a grant from the New York State Education Department that is distributed through the Associated Medical Schools of New York. Students and their families do not pay to take part, and students are bused to the medical-school campus from five central locations in lower Westchester and the Bronx, although some parents bring their children. Breakfast and lunch are provided. 
 It's not all lectures and presentations. In fact, most of the work is laboratory-focused, with students learning techniques in New York Medical College's state-of-the-art labs. They also perform experiments; this year, students built robots that were intended to give disabled individuals the same abilities as everyone else.
 There are trips to places like the New York Stock Exchange for an economics segment, and guest speakers from local corporations are brought in to help develop interviewing and public-presentation skills. The program also runs a reading club for students, provides sessions to improve writing skills and study techniques and offers academic counseling. Although it is aimed at attracting African-Americans and Hispanics, Asian and low-income white students are also eligible.
 Parents can also attend programs about the college-application process, including how to fill out financial-aid forms and find appropriate internships for their children. 
 The students' Saturday studies meet Regents standards, and there is frequent contact between the students' home districts and program administrators, Ms. Richards said. 
 Sandra Hacker, an eighth- and ninth-grade guidance counselor at Dobbs Ferry Middle School, which sent students to the program for the first time this year, said of the enrichment program: ''It's very structured, offering tutoring, study skills and hands-on education and activities. I'm happy with it, and want to continue with it.''
 Sophia Veiras, 14, a Dobbs Ferry eighth grader and one of the students in the program for the first time, said: ''You don't learn robotics, science and math like this. Here, all the smart people are combined.'' Her classmate, Julian Caldwell, 13, of Dobbs Ferry, added: ''I was more interested in robotics. It was good. It was more relaxed, and a lot different.''
 And the lessons go beyond science and technology. 
 ''I like doing hands-on work,'' said Adrienne Suazo, 14, another Dobbs Ferry eighth grader. ''They teach you a lot in this program about how to manage time, and not to procrastinate.''

HEADLINE: Access Denied: Economics and the Elite

BYLINE: By Karen W. Arenson. 
Karen W. Arenson reports on higher education for The Times.

 BODY:

Equity and Excellence in American Higher EducationBy William G. Bowen, Martin A. Kurzweil and Eugene M. Tobin University of Virginia Press, hardcover Review by Karen W. Arenson
 Since his retirement as president of Princeton in 1988, William G. Bowen has used his post as president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to finance research about higher education and publish books that map out its condition, including critical and controversial issues like affirmative action and the role of sports. 
 Mr. Bowen's newest book, written with two Mellon associates, continues in this tradition, wrestling with the virtual absence of the poorest students from selective colleges and universities. It is a timely volume, since Harvard and other top universities are grappling with how to admit more socioeconomically balanced classes. Young people from low-income families whose parents did not attend college amount to about 19 percent of the total population but only 3 percent of the 1995 entering class at the 19 elite institutions that the book explores in depth. 
 The topic is broad, and so is the book's treatment of it, reaching back to pre-Revolutionary War America, when colleges offered subsidies to students ''from humble origins.'' Disadvantaged young people have long attended college in smaller numbers than the wealthy and the middle class, but that did not have the same ramifications in, say, 1920, when only 5 percent of all young adults attended college, as it does today, when about 60 percent do.
 In 1946, the Truman Commission on Higher Education described the country's failure ''to provide a reasonable equality of educational opportunity for its youth.'' Around the same time, the G.I. Bill of Rights unleashed a flood of World War II veterans into college classrooms, partly to avoid massive unemployment. But efforts since then have fallen short. 
 The Pell Grant was created more than 30 years ago to help needy students attend college. But ''Equity and Excellence'' concludes that the continuing failure of many low-income students to attend college and graduate, despite ''this extraordinary economic incentive,'' is evidence of ''a serious supply-side block'' that threatens the excellence of higher education: poor students attend poor schools and are thus simply not ready for college, especially the most demanding ones.
 The book grew out of lectures that Dr. Bowen presented at the University of Virginia last year, and its conclusions are supported by new data about income and higher education. This includes evaluations of how first-generation students and those from low-income families fared at college and after graduation (pretty well). 
 Dr. Bowen and his colleagues strongly argue that low-income students deserve accommodation in admissions, but that economic status cannot substitute for race and ethnicity. With far more whites than minorities among the least affluent families, the proportion of minority students would shrink if affirmative action disappeared. 
 ''Equity and Excellence'' also emphasizes the close links between higher education and what comes before, adding important new voices to the call for change.

HEADLINE: Cash-and-Carry Missiles in Iraq

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
How do insurgents or terrorists get their hands on portable anti-aircraft missiles, the kind suspected of downing a Bulgarian-owned helicopter in Iraq last week, killing 11 people, including six Americans?
 Pentagon and intelligence officials have been warning for years that shoulder-fired missiles are prized by terrorists plotting to shoot down a commercial airliner, a military transport plane or a helicopter ferrying government officials or business executives. 
 That desire drives a lucrative black market for the weapons, technically known as man-portable air defense systems, or Manpads. They are suitcase-sized, easily smuggled and, it would seem, tempting to underpaid soldiers in nations where government armories are poorly secured. 
 Estimates of the going price vary widely, but security officials say the weapons can be purchased for $50,000 to $250,000.
 The Federal Bureau of Investigation said in 2002 that planes had been hit by these weapons 29 times, mostly in war zones in the third world, causing at least 550 deaths. Until recently, about 2,000 Manpads were thought to be in circulation on the black market.
 But last year, American intelligence agencies tripled their estimates of the number of these missile systems thought to be at large worldwide, saying that another 4,000 Manpads from Iraq's prewar arsenal could not now be accounted for. THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
LIKE most large universities, the University of Arizona is a virtual city: 37,000 students and nearly 14,000 employees on a sprawling campus in Tucson of 174 buildings and 11,000 parking spots. Also like most of the country's colleges and universities, it is not particularly selective. Arizona admits 83 percent of its applicants, although most graduated in the top half of their high school class. They sit in numbing lecture halls with 500 classmates; the only instructor they may know is a teaching assistant, and they are, for all intents and purposes, anonymous.
 This is not exactly the popular image of ivy-covered higher education, but it's the truth of it. Most students do not go to an Amherst or a Williams. They go to enormous public institutions like the Universities of Arizona, Iowa, Connecticut, Minnesota: more than five million undergraduates attend an institution with at least 15,000 students. The freshman class alone exceeds the population of a small town, and the course catalog is the size of a phone book. Mike Morefield, a junior at Arizona, remembers his first year: ''It's like somebody comes along with a pin right after high school, pops your bubble, picks you up, throws you naked into some college, and you've got to figure it out.'' 
 Mr. Morefield figured it out, but 1,291 of his freshmen classmates -- 23 percent of the class -- did not. In that way, too, Arizona is typical. The State University of New York at Buffalo and the University of Kentucky lost 22 percent of their freshmen last year. Three of the four University of Massachusetts campuses lost at least 24 percent. Eastern Michigan University lost 28 percent. And six years after entering Arizona, only 55 percent of freshmen will have earned degrees -- slightly better than the national average of 54 percent.
 Those numbers have roiled state and federal officials from President Bush on down. In a recent survey, education policy makers in 27 states said that financial support for higher education should be tied in some way to a university's ability to keep and graduate its freshmen. Governors of seven states -- Arizona, Arkansas, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, Ohio and Virginia -- say they are making a priority of increasing the accountability of colleges and universities that receive public money, according to the National Governors Association. And when Congress takes up reauthorization of the Higher Education Act later this year, it is expected to consider how to persuade or compel colleges and universities to create what Education Secretary Margaret Spellings calls ''common language and metrics'' about their performance that will give prospective students and their families better tools for deciding where to invest in their education. 
 How can colleges help students stay the course? Educators subscribe to the idea that students need a sense of belonging and commitment. To nurture it, campuses try to create pockets of intimacy -- say, residences for students of similar interests, like women in science and engineering. Arizona also provides special orientation and counseling for Hispanic and American Indian students. And the university's new Integrated Learning Center, built underground at the heart of the campus, is promoted as a ''home base'' for freshmen and sophomores. Open 24 hours, it offers academic advising, access to tutors and computers and 14 classrooms, from auditoriums to seminar rooms, where faculty are supported with multimedia technology.
 ''WE put vastly more money into advising today,'' says Peter H. Likins, the university's president. ''With the Integrated Learning Center, we've made a massive commitment in terms of physical facilities and the advising that goes with it.'' But, he adds, ''it is a more Darwinian environment, a public university of this character.'' Of foundering students, he says: ''We always have the feeling that if we had the resources to recognize them as they fall through, to pick them up, in the way that a liberal arts college does, we could keep them from falling. But we don't have those resources.''
 Even though a university opens the door, it can't make an adolescent walk through it. However lost they may be, college students may never seek out an adviser. Intimidated, shy or alienated, they don't drop in during faculty office hours. Parents out of sight, they struggle with their newfound independence, starting with the freedom not to wake up before midday or to eat pizza any hour of the night -- and again for breakfast -- or to put off reading assignments until cram time at finals. 
 The latest results from the National Survey of Student Engagement -- of 160,000 freshmen and seniors from 470 institutions -- show that one-fifth of undergraduates are ''disengaged.'' To the survey's director, George D. Kuh, that means they do not take part in campus cultural events, do not sample the wide choice of available courses or put much energy into their studies. Nor, he says, do they have to.
 Richard H. Hersh, former president of Trinity College and Hobart and William Smith Colleges, refers to this situation as a ''mutual nonaggression pact.'' Professors see teaching as a requirement they have to fulfill to do the research they prefer, he says, ''so the professor goes into class and doesn't ask much of students, who in return don't ask much of the professor. The professor gives out reasonably high grades as a way of camouflaging that this bargain has been struck, his evaluations will be satisfactory, and students don't complain about grades or about whether they've learned much.'' 
 In the view of Dr. Hersh, a proponent of accountability in higher education, students have to be held responsible for their own initiative, but low standards allow them to coast through their college years with minimal involvement. ''That's the real disgrace,'' he says. 
 The experiences of five young people at the University of Arizona -- four seniors and one who would have been -- illustrate different aspects of the campus experience. For one extraordinary student, college has done exactly what it should: illuminate the possibilities. For another, it has been one long party, little more than a steppingstone to a job. For all, learning seems to be optional.

If This Is Boozeday, This Must Be College
 STUDENTS have names for certain days. Tuesday is Boozeday, Thursday is Thirstday.
 At 9 p.m. on a Boozeday last fall, Robin Bhalla and friends are downing shots of vodka at his off-campus apartment. ''We save money that way,'' he explains to a reporter watching the ritual. ''Get a buzz on at home, then go bar-hopping.'' Sufficiently buzzed, the students who are of drinking age drive to a popular bar near campus, where they chug beer and do more shots. ''I like to get drunk, not blackout drunk, but I like to get drunk,'' Mr. Bhalla says. ''You're able to talk to girls a lot more. And I like girls.'' By 1 a.m. he is ''fubar,'' which politely translates as ''fouled up beyond all recognition,'' and is asked to leave the bar. He spots a student who he is sure insulted him earlier that evening and rushes him, intent on fighting. His friends pull him away, and Mr. Bhalla reels around the parking lot, cursing. 
 Late the next morning, Mr. Bhalla wakes up on the floor of a vacant building, a shuttered fraternity house. ''I was so depressed, and I looked at my face and my hands,'' he recalls, now sitting in a dormitory lounge for an interview. ''I was just like, 'What am I doing with my life?''' But that moment of reflection soon passes. ''If I sat there for days like that, what good's going to come out of it?'' he says. Mr. Bhalla professes not to remember the altercation the night before. 
 About the purpose of college, he says: ''You go so you can get a job and make money when you're older. But at the same time you get life experiences that are priceless, like networking.'' He expects that to pay off: ''I've made so many connections I never would have been able to make without it, and these are all my friends and people that I know from the bars and from classes and, you know, people that I've hung out with that later in life I'm going to be able to call on and be like: 'I know you have a job with this company. Do you know if they're hiring, or can you get me an application? Can I use you as a reference?'''
 Mr. Bhalla, 22, a psychology major with a minor in business (grade point average 3.0, on a 4.0 scale), says he stopped going to most of his classes after sophomore year and drank excessively four nights a week: usually Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. Nonetheless, he made the dean's list last spring. He says he has rarely given more than an hour a night for all his courses. ''Teachers say, 'For every class you should do a certain amount of reading,' but I never do that,'' he says. His routine: toward the end of the semester, scan the readings, review notes to see what the teacher said was important, get the teacher's study guide. He believes he is not alone. ''A lot of people just try and coast by, and don't do the readings. They try and cheat off the homework, copy their friends'. 
 ''Now that I look back on it, it's not really hard work,'' he says. ''I think anybody, if they really sat down and tried to do the work, could do it.''
 Mr. Bhalla, who grew up in the Los Angeles suburb of Oak Park, chose Arizona to get away from the ground rules of home. ''My parents always needed to know where I was, what I was doing,'' he says. '''You can't do this, you can't do that.' And they'd always be hounding me to do my homework. So I always had someone to tell me what to do.'' He went ''a little crazy'' with his new independence. ''My parents are, you know, 1,000 miles away,'' he says. ''Other than phone calls, they can't really watch me, or see what I'm doing. Here it's: 'We're not going to watch you. Turn it in if you want; if you don't turn it in, we don't care.'''
 Charles M. Tatum, dean of the College of Humanities, says he understands how tough it can be to make the transition from high school to college. ''In high school there are direct consequences for not doing your homework,'' he says. ''You lose points on your final mark. In high school there's instant feedback. You're in a class of maybe 25 or 30. Here, you walk into classes where suddenly you're not expected to show the teacher on a daily basis you've done your homework. You're told: 'There's going to be a midterm, and maybe a paper and then a final exam. Go forth and make the best of it.' You'd better believe that certain students can't handle that.''
 Mr. Kuh, who in addition to directing the student engagement survey is a professor of higher education at Indiana University, Bloomington, describes students like Mr. Bhalla as ''maze smart'' -- they have figured out what they have to do to get through: buy the book, find out what's going to be on the exam and stay invisible. ''They'll pick large classes,'' he says. ''They'll go through the distribution of grades in different majors and pick the easiest one. Then they tend to hang together.'' He says these students miss the point of college: ''These are people with enormous potential and talent. We just need to identify them.'' That colleges can't get such students more involved in their education is ''inexcusable,'' he says. 
 Is it really possible to get through a major university with so little effort? ''As much as I would like to say, 'Absolutely not!,' yes, it is possible,'' says Melissa Vito, dean of students at Arizona. ''We have a lot of students whose motivation for coming here is to get a good job. They think, 'How do I get the grades?' instead of trying to learn.'' 
 As for drinking, Dean Vito says problems often start in high school, sometimes earlier. ''Students come here with more habits than they used to,'' she says, and alcohol is the substance of choice. ''It's what causes students to make those bad decisions.'' At one point Mr. Bhalla's drinking caught the university's attention. He was sent to an alcohol education class in sophomore year after being caught driving under the influence, and was put on probation for a semester. He did not get caught again.
 At the end of a three-hour interview, Mr. Bhalla is asked if he regrets anything he has done at Arizona. ''These are the years that I'm not going to have back,'' he says. ''And I don't want to be 30, 50, looking back and wishing I'd partied then because I can't do it now.'' 
 A month after the interview, in December, Mr. Bhalla graduated after four and a half years in college. He moved to Miami to room with a college friend. He has just started working for a pharmaceutical sales company (base salary: $30,000). For the most part, he says, he goes out only on Friday and Saturday nights. ''I definitely miss my college days,'' he says. ''They were the best four years of my life!'' 

Getting Off the Community College Track
 WHEN Melanie Martinez first ran into former high school classmates on the Arizona campus, it jolted her. ''Instead of giving a hug to someone with a Wildcat backpack, I was hugging construction workers wearing hard hats,'' she remembers. ''It was sad and a little frustrating.'' The first thing they would ask: Did she have children yet? ''A lot of people I went to high school with did start off going to college,'' she says. ''We all entered Pima Community College together as a group, but about 90 to 95 percent are no longer in college. People have bills, people have babies and families.'' 
 At the beginning, Ms. Martinez had fit the national profile of Hispanic students. She attended a high school that was 75 percent Hispanic, then a two-year college. Hispanics enroll in college at the same rate as white students, according to a study by the Pew Hispanic Center and the University of Southern California, but one in three attend community colleges, compared with one in five white students. 
 Ms. Martinez had wanted to attend the university since she was in kindergarten. ''It was instilled in me early, the U is prestigious; it's the place where I need to be,'' she says. But in her senior year of high school, with the distraction of the student council and cheerleading, she took ''a less stressful schedule,'' she says, and wound up lacking some admission requirements. Students in the top half of their class are automatically admitted to the university if they have taken three years of math, three years of science and two years of a foreign language. To earn a high school diploma, they need only two years of math, two years of science and no foreign language. Her less stressful schedule had kept her out of the university, so she went to Pima Community College with her high school friends. 
 Beginning next fall, the university will be more selective, limiting automatic acceptance to the top 25 percent of a high school class. The hope is to increase graduation rates by, Mr. Likins says, ''admitting into our freshman class students who may have a better prospect of success.'' 
 After two years at Pima, Ms. Martinez transferred to the U and signed up for business and public administration, the university's second most popular major. ''I wanted to make money and be successful,'' she says. But dry accounting courses convinced her she did not like the field. And there was social opportunity -- she had just turned 21 and was living away from home for the first time, ''making my own rules.'' Three-quarters of the way through the first semester, she stopped going to class. ''I didn't officially drop the classes, but I didn't take the final exams, either,'' she says. She somehow got a C in one course: ''How I managed that, not even taking the final, I still don't know.'' 
 Thinking back over why she wasted a whole semester, she says she missed the close contact she had had with teachers at Pima and disliked the ''e-mail relationship, if there's any connection at all'' with professors. Also, ''at Pima I was in the majority, but here, walking around and seeing so many blue-eyed, blond-haired people was a huge shock,'' she says. ''It made it hard to be comfortable.'' 
 The university's Hispanic enrollment is 13.3 percent, though the state is more than 25 percent Hispanic. Nationally, only 23 percent of Hispanics who start college finish with a bachelor's degree, and only 18 percent who start in a community college and transfer to four-year institutions finish at all, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. The University of Arizona's record is considerably better -- 47 percent graduate -- and it is working to attract more Hispanic students, sending representatives into elementary schools to talk to parents about how to prepare for the U. 
 Ms. Martinez's mediocre academic performance -- a 2.75 G.P.A., dragged down by the semester of goofing off -- taught her a lesson: ''I had to be my own drill sergeant, because nobody else was going to discipline me. No report card to Mom, and nobody to check on whether I went to class.'' 
 Now 24, she has switched her major to elementary education and is student-teaching in her old school district. Like Mr. Bhalla, she says that no matter how many courses she has on her schedule -- or how many hours she spends at her part-time job at Pima County Community Services (now 8 a week, down from 25) -- she has spent only an hour a night on homework. She will graduate in December, seven and a half years after starting her college career. ''I thought it would be a lot more intense and a lot harder,'' she says. ''I'd always thought that people who went to college were these brilliant people who had to stay up hours and hours studying and reading, but I'm not a genius and I'm doing just fine.'' 
 Mr. Kuh says his surveys find that most students start out with high expectations, which are rarely met. ''They expect to read more, write more, spend more time with faculty, and study more,'' he says. ''They expect to be writing three, four or five papers, but students, particularly at large institutions, can get through their first year of college without ever having written a paper at all.''

When No One Knows Your Name
 LIKE many young people, Keith Caywood equates a college diploma with a higher salary. ''You go to college because you don't want middle- and lower-class jobs, because you don't want to sit there making $20,000 to $40,000 a year,'' he says. And that, he adds, necessitates ''that piece of paper.'' 
 So when students come to the Trident, a wood-paneled bar papered with Wildcat memorabilia and photographs, he's sure that some of them look down on him. When he arrived at the university in fall 2000 from Enid, Okla., he expected to be on the other side of the bar, ordering drinks instead of serving them. If he had followed the path of the average Arizona student, who takes 4.7 years to graduate, he would be getting his diploma this academic year. Today, at 22, he's a dropout, managing the Trident, just across East Speedway Avenue on the north side of campus. 
 Mr. Caywood remembers how overwhelmed he felt when he arrived on campus, the ''classic nerd'' with a map and no idea where Old Main was. Course offerings were dizzying. ''You didn't have someone, you know, leading you by the hand,'' he says. ''No one actually sat there and grabbed me and said: 'Hey, you know, this is a scary place. Come with me, and we'll talk this through.' I went ahead and just kind of jumped in, grabbed a schedule and took what I thought was needed.''
 Reminded that the university offers enrollment advice, he acknowledges that he knew that. ''I thought I was, you know, more mature than most of my colleagues, but I really wasn't,'' he says.
 Mr. Caywood took several large lecture courses whose instructors, he says, did not know his name. He did not do well. ''I fell asleep a lot,'' he recalls. ''I got bored and I would talk with my friend. There was no interaction, no one making sure I was obtaining the knowledge that I should have been getting.'' He remembers one class in particular, with 60 or 70 students, taught by a graduate teaching assistant. ''We never actually saw a real professor,'' he says, ''just people who were either working on their graduate degrees or in between jobs, people just three or four years older than I am.'' As he relives the memory, his voice rises in indignation, and several customers look up from their drinks. ''We're reading a book and giving our insights, but how can you get a good view of people's insights when there's 60 people in there?'' he asks. How can a T.A. read 60 papers over the weekend and give each a fair shake? ''It would have been nicer if I had someone more credible, someone I had to call 'professor' who's finished his degrees and has published books.'' 
 Mr. Caywood's recollections do not surprise Lee S. Shulman, president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. ''The great enemies of learning are anonymity and invisibility,'' Mr. Shulman says. ''People who are invisible don't learn. In no sense are they accountable, in no sense are they responsible, and therefore they can simply turn off.'' 
 Mr. Likins, the president, calls the large lecture class ''an unfortunate economic necessity'' at a time when the state Legislature has cut funds by more than $50 million over the past several years. The student-teacher ratio at Arizona is high -- 19.4 to 1 -- but not unusual. It's 18 to 1 at Penn State, 17.3 to 1 at the University of Kansas and 22 to 1 at Texas A&M. By contrast, Amherst has one professor for every nine students. Economic realities dictate that universities rely on T.A.'s to reduce instructional costs and to allow professors to concentrate on their research. Arizona requires T.A.'s to attend weekly training seminars in their first semester of teaching, and Mr. Likins says he encourages senior faculty to teach the general education lecture courses that undergraduates are required to take. 
 Mr. Caywood lasted until midterm exams and then enrolled at Pima Community College. ''I had smaller classes, anywhere from 18 to 25 students,'' he says. ''The teachers knew me by name and were willing to meet me after class and work on projects. It was a whole lot better.'' Still only 18, he got a job in a bar when he boasted to the manager that he could lift a full keg above his head. ''She challenged me to prove it, I did, and she hired me,'' he says. He finished the year at Pima but dropped out to work full time.
 Will he go back to finish college? He hedges, calling it a goal. But it's not going to happen soon. ''I'm making good money right now,'' he says. ''I'm a responsible person paying health insurance and car insurance and rent on a timely basis. I could look back and think 'could of, should of, would of,' but if I keep dwelling on things in the past, that doesn't help.'' He hopes to buy his own bar someday: ''I'm moving on to better things, I believe.''

When Everyone Knows Your Name
 ANONYMITY is not an issue if you're a 6-foot-11 African-American basketball player on a campus that is mad about the Wildcats and whose student body is only 3.6 percent African-American. The state's high school player of the year, Channing Frye began his freshman year on an athletic scholarship. Easing the acclimation to campus life, he roomed with a teammate, and two others lived across the hall. A junior on the team, Jason Gardner, gave him the ABC's. ''Channing, here's what you do,'' Mr. Gardner told him. ''You find the hottest girl you can find and you ask her where your class is, even if you know where it is. That's just how you break the ice and, you know, get comfortable with it.''
 Among athletes' privileges is an academic adviser to see that they stay on track to graduate (and eligible to compete). An assistant head basketball coach, Jim Rosborough, drives around campus in a golf cart monitoring class attendance. One professor says he is asked twice a semester for updates on the academic performance and attendance of athletes in his class. 
 An assistant coach and the adviser helped Mr. Frye select classes. They told him which professors to avoid. ''To be honest,'' he says, ''I think it's better both for the athlete and for the professor, if the professor doesn't want to adjust the rules or, you know, be a little more lenient toward the athlete and his schedule.'' During the season, players may miss classes and tests two or three days a week because of road trips. ''Sometimes you can't take a test,'' Mr. Frye explains, ''because you can't open your eyes because you're so tired from getting back at 2 or 3 in the morning.'' He does not think athletes get a free ride; he says they walk a tougher path than the conventional student because of the responsibility they shoulder.
 Lynne M. Tronsdal, the university's assistant vice president for student retention, wishes regular students could enjoy the hand-holding extended to athletes. ''If we could do for the non student-athlete what we do for the student athlete, we would have a retention rate that is incredible,'' she says. Asked to describe the athlete's path, Ms. Tronsdal smiles. ''They are wooed, from the time they can shoot a basket or play with a ball, whatever it is they do,'' she says. ''They're told, 'You're valuable; we want you to come.' Once they're here, they have academic advisers who work with them on a one-to-one basis, looking at their schedules, arranging tutoring, making sure their classes don't conflict with practice. And if they have an athlete who can't write very well, they have a writing tutor come in to help. They work with professors on the athlete's grades, and if the grade isn't good enough, they'll help petition the grade. They help with deadlines, give career advice, even teach them how to speak with the media.''
 The media training seems evident when Mr. Frye, 21, is asked how many hours a night he spends on schoolwork. His first answer is ''an hour, maybe an hour and a half.'' Then he pauses, smiles and amends his answer, ''Two hours, maybe two and a half.'' He estimates he spends 20 percent of his time on academics, 10 percent ''enjoying college life'' and 70 percent devoted to basketball.
 As a senior, Mr. Frye started every game, averaged more than 15 points and 7.5 rebounds a game and was selected to Basketball Times' All-America team. He scored 24 points, grabbed 12 rebounds and blocked 6 shots in his last collegiate game, a 90-89 overtime loss to Illinois in the quarterfinal round of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament. The coach, Lute Olson, says Mr. Frye represents all that is good about college athletics: ''He is a four-year starter, a wonderful representative within the community and a bright young man.'' 
 A switch in majors -- from physical education to interdisciplinary studies, which allowed him to pursue interests in both religion and African-American studies -- put Mr. Frye one semester behind, he says. And his G.P.A. -- 2.396 -- is low. But that's still ahead of the game. Arizona's record with student athletes, despite the hand-holding, is not good. Since 1995, only two basketball players on scholarship have graduated; nine have left early to play in the N.B.A. The most recent is Andre Iguodala, who dropped out at season's end last year and signed for $9 million with the Philadelphia 76ers. The Arizona team's overall graduation rate is 25 percent; only 14 colleges in the 65-team N.C.A.A. basketball tournament this year had a worse record.
 ''I've often thought what we need to have are athletes who play for a municipality,'' Ms. Tronsdal says. ''Call them the Tucson Wildcats and let them get paid. And then we can all just stop fooling ourselves.''
 The N.C.A.A. is also concerned. Next year it will begin penalizing teams whose players are not progressing toward graduation with their original class and whose graduation rate falls below 50 percent. Mr. Frye did consider leaving for the N.B.A. last year. But, he says: ''I felt like last year, both on and off the court, I wasn't mature enough to step into the real world. I don't know who I would be if I had left last year.'' Mr. Frye is certain to be drafted by the N.B.A. in June, one term shy of graduation requirements. He promises to ''finish the job'' through online courses.

The Open Mind
 BRITNEY SCHMIDT was hunched over a spectroscope in a small physics lab, peering into the eyepiece and scribbling numbers in a notebook. No one is more surprised to be there than she is. She arrived on campus in fall 2000 with a clear plan: because she loved creative writing and horseback riding and was active in the Future Farmers of America, she would study English and agriculture. Now she is a fifth-year senior majoring in physics (3.5 G.P.A.) and heading for graduate school in planetary science. ''I owe it all to my educational identity crisis,'' Ms. Schmidt, 22, says with a laugh. ''I always knew exactly what I wanted to do. I was independent, I was going to go get it, and I was just going to do amazing things.''
 College was a disappointment. Professors gave her the impression they would rather be someplace else. Their attitude was, '''O.K., well, I've got to teach, but I really am interested in research, or I'm really interested in what I'm doing after class,''' she says. ''They'd come for an hour and give their lectures and leave. There's not that ownership that you feel in high school. There, I knew all the teachers and all the students. And then I got here and was one of 37,000 people on campus, and really not an important one. I didn't know where I fit in the picture.''
 All of a sudden, she recalls, ''I was just like: 'I have no idea who I am. I don't know what I'm going to do. I don't know what I want to do.' I was getting A's in all my classes, but I wasn't being challenged, and I wasn't thinking about new things.'' She decided that she needed to start over somewhere else, but meanwhile, she enrolled in a semester's worth of general-education requirements -- ''sampling,'' as she puts it. Students must take 11 courses in different areas: math, composition, a second language, natural science, humanities, art, non-Western studies, traditions and cultures and individuals and society.
 A natural-science class caught her imagination and she began staying after class, talking with the teaching assistants. She had never met a scientist before. ''I began to feel like I really belonged,'' she says. ''I would ask the T.A.'s what they were researching, and why. I asked all these questions I'd always thought about but never had the opportunity to ask.'' As the semester progressed, she felt comfortable enough to approach the professor, Robert Brown.
 Professor Brown remembers Ms. Schmidt as ''just a face in the crowd'' of 160 students until she showed her passion, and then he invited her to get involved in lab work. ''Students like Britney who have that extra motivation usually take leadership roles,'' says Professor Brown, who gave up an appointment at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to combine teaching with research. ''I like to challenge them, to make sure they use their gifts.'' Ms. Schmidt recalls the day he challenged her. ''One day, Dr. Brown sat me down and said: 'Look, you're independent enough to come in and ask questions. In my experience, that level of independence is someone who does really well in science. You should really think about giving it a go.'''
 She appreciates the university's general-education requirement, she says, although ''everyone complains about it.'' It is important for two reasons: ''Students who may have found what they want to do are forced to get a deeper understanding, so they get more context to explain things to others. And students who don't know what they want to do can experiment and study lots of subjects.'' 
 Ms. Schmidt ended up having the experience that Arizona administrators would like all students to go through. ''We don't want our students to feel like they came here and just got a trade, but that they left here educated,'' says Ms. Vito, the dean of students. ''Even if you're going to be a scientist, it's important to have some experience with the humanities and other traditions and cultures.'' The university's fundamental belief is that being educated means, she says, ''having a sense of wisdom and culture, which is different than just being prepared to go into a job.''
 In Ms. Schmidt's estimation, that would be more probable if students were more responsive and if more teachers reached out. ''I was lucky,'' she says. ''I took a class from somebody who really cared, who thought that teaching a general education class gave him a chance to interact with more students of different varieties.'' 
 Tom Fleming, a senior lecturer in astronomy on a yearly appointment with the university, is another professor who sees value in trying to shake up the reluctant underclassmen in a required course. ''I can't sit here and rant and rave and complain that, 'Oh, our standards are low and the students don't learn in high school what they used to.' The fact of the matter is I have 135 students here now, and I can't go back and change history as to what sort of high school education they received. If I publish a paper in the Astrophysical Journal and 12 people in the entire world read it from cover to cover, that's a high readership. On the other hand, every semester I can affect the lives of 100 to 150 people, and it's much more gratifying.'' 
 In Mr. Fleming's classes, there is no hiding in the back. He is just as likely to call on those in the last row as in the front as he moves about the auditorium. If students are reading The Daily Wildcat, sleeping or text-messaging on their cellphones, ''I ask them to leave the room,'' he says. In his lectures, he poses problems that students answer with hand-held transponders supplied by the university: if students understand the concept, he moves on; if not, they discuss it in small groups and then revisit the problem. Understanding is the goal, he says, not ''coverage'' of a topic.
 Ms. Schmidt has been accepted at the University of California, Los Angeles, in planetary physics and at the University of Chicago in cosmo-chemistry but has not decided which graduate school to attend. 
 She offers this advice to incoming freshmen: ''Get out of your comfort zone. You learn so much more when you have to change what you're doing, than if you just came in and said, 'Well, this is me and I'm always going to be like this and I'm always going to study this.' If you think that way, then you never stop to question whether that's what really you're supposed to do. Relax. You haven't lived 20 percent of your life. What's the rush?''

''Here are three pieces of advice that I give all my first-year advisees on how to make the most out of college. And I haven't lost a single one yet!
 ''First, study in small groups that you join or even form yourself. It is entirely clear that the single best way to increase students' engagement with theiracademic work, to connect students with other students around substantive ideas rather than simply socializing, and to raise the graduation rate is to study in groups. Meet at most twice a week for an hour and a half to go over assigned readings or problem sets or to discuss what happened in class yesterday. 
 ''Second, choose classes that give you frequentfeedback, which allows you to make midcoursecorrections. Suppose you signed up for a history class, and the only requirement was a major paper at the end. Then what if you write that final paper and get it back two weeks after the course ends and on the cover page it says 'C-minus -- John, I asked students to analyze what the book said. You didn't analyze it. You simplysummarized it.' Since this was the only paper, the course literally has ended. Too late to learn from this or change anything.
 ''In contrast, suppose you had chosen a history course that asked you to submit several short papers. Then, when getting the identical comment, you still would have six or seven chances to make a midcoursecorrection. And you may end up both learning lots more and getting an A-minus instead of a C-minus.
 ''Third, come to the first year of college with the mindset that you are eager to meet people who hold different views from friends you went to high school with. One of the happiest things about college is being able to change your mind about things.
 ''Students should start at university with the attitude of: 'Maybe I will end up just reaffirming my original beliefs, yet this is a special opportunity to test thosebeliefs and to hear ideas that are new. I may end up rejecting them, yet I certainly should listen.''' RICHARD J. LIGHT Professor of education, Harvard, and author of ''Making the Most of College''

''Rely on your peers. They can provide honest feedback, a sounding board and a sense of belonging in the face of a variety of challenges.'' ASA HILLIARD III Professor of urban education, Georgia State University

''Visit professors at office hours. Get to know them, and let them know you. Forge a connection with the ones you like. They can be a source of advice and mentoring and become your future writers of letters of recommendation.'' MIKE ROSE Professor of education, U.C.L.A., and author of ''The Mind at Work''

''There is too much reading material in the average college course, and sharing the burden come exam time will really help. But choose your study group members carefully. Freeloaders or others who don't contribute thoughtfully should not be included. Also, do not load up on courses for your expected major in freshman year. Take time to explore other areas.'' MICHELE LEVIN Science teacher, United Nations School, and recent Harvard graduate

''Forge at least one friendship with someone who initially intimidates you. Keep in touch with your friends from high school. Do your laundry regularly. Call home weekly. And don't cut class. It's the ultimate 'dis.''' ROBIN G. MAMLET Dean of admission, Stanford

''Find something to study that excites your passions, no matter how crazy, impractical or irrelevant it may seem to others. You'll learn more from pursuing an intellectual passion than from all the core curriculums in the world stacked on top of each other.'' EDWARD B. FISKE Author, ''Fiske Guide to Colleges''

''Take care of your body. Work out a couple of times a week, balance the beer and cold cereal in your diet with fresh fruits and vegetables, and get a good night's sleep every so often. You will feel better and get sick less often.'' LAURENCE STEINBERG Professor of psychology, Temple University

''Don't take no for an answer. If your course schedule isn't what you had hoped, your section leader or teaching assistant isn't inspiring, or you don't get into your first-choice classes, be assertive without being aggressive. Reapply for that seminar, arrange an independent study with a professor, or line up a faculty adviser to supervise you so you can get credit for something you're working on beyond the classroom.And if you ever feel lost or lonely or troubled, don't suffer in silence. College campuses are designed to respond to student needs, but the irony is, if you're feeling down, you are least likely to bein the frame of mind to avail yourself of all the services available to you. Tell a friend, family member, dorm adviser, anyone, that you need help and ask them to steer you to the right place.'' ELLEN REEVES Education editor, The New Press, a nonprofit public-interest publishing company

''Join at least one or two student organizations. They may involve something you do well -- a musical group, a sports team or reporting for the student newspaper -- or they may tap into an interest you'd like to explore even though you have no special talent. You are most likely to enjoy the campus and do well in your classes if you also engage in an extracurricular activity.'' THOMAS EHRLICH President emeritus, Indiana University

''Go very light on the vices, such as carrying on in society, as the social ramble ain't restful.'' SATCHEL PAIGE Member, Baseball Hall of Fame

 CORRECTION:
An article in the quarterly Education Life section last Sunday about the undergraduate experience at a large public university misstated a retention figure for the State University of New York at Buffalo. About 15 percent of freshmen who enrolled in the fall of 2003 did not return in the fall of 2004 -- not 22 percent.
An article in the quarterly Education Life section on April 24 about the undergraduate experience at a large public university included an outdated reference to the graduation rate at the University of Arizona. The percentage of freshmen who earn degrees in six years or sooner is 57, not 55. The number of students on athletic scholarship who have graduated since 1995 is five, not two.
 The article also misstated the punishment given to a student, Robin Bhalla, for driving under the influence of alcohol. He attended classes on alcohol abuse but was not placed on probation. 

GRAPHIC: Photos: Robin Bhalla says he drank four nights a week at Arizona (below, taking a beer swig). Still, he once made the dean's list.
After seven a half years, Melanie Martinez expects to graduate next term and is student-teaching second graders.
Keith Caywood found the University of Arizona overwhelming and impersonal. He transferred to a community college, then dropped out to work in a local bar.
Britney Schmidt found her passion, planetary science, thanks to general education courses. She plans to do graduate work.

HEADLINE: Surviving the College Tour

BYLINE: By James R. Petersen. 
James R. Petersen is a former writer at Playboy.

 BODY:
THE young woman walking through the San Francisco airport was a classic California blonde -- legs up to her ear lobes, a skirt the size of a headband with the letters S-T-A-N-F-O-R-D dancing across the buttocks. I looked from this fashion statement to my 16-year-old daughter, Sierra, and realized I was seeing the future. 
 In the next few days she would acquire similar attire and, if all went well, a new address. The college tour was upon us. A force of nature had us in its clutches as we wandered California like the annual migration of the wildebeests or, more aptly, the cliff dive of the lemmings. 
 Survivors of the experience had given me tons of advice. See for yourself if it helped.

TREAT THE EVENT AS VACATION: The whole family tagged along for this holiday, one that would ultimately cost far more than a week at Club Med. We began our tour at the Powell Street cable car in San Francisco. As we waited to board, a street musician warmed up the crowd. ''How many Deadheads does it take to change a light bulb? None. They watch it burn out, then follow it around for 30 years.''
 I took this as an omen. I would not use the college tour as a pretext to wax nostalgic about my school years. For one thing, I am still under disciplinary probation at Trinity College in Hartford. (For taking over the administration building and briefly holding the trustees captive, the college has put a red flag on my student file that remains until I apologize.)
 We wandered about Fisherman's Wharf, admiring the street performers, the silver-painted human statues, the rap artists. The ''real world'' is full of examples of what happens to people who don't go to college. One guy peered out at us from inside a sanitation can. He held up a sign that said ''White Trash'' and shouted warnings: ''Stay in school. Don't turn out like me.'' I gave him a dollar.

STAY IN THE BACKGROUND: Parents are supposed to hang back and let their children ask the questions. My job was to keep notes that would let us sort through impressions at a later date. I tried to get the pulse of each place by reading the campus newspaper.
 The picture on the front of the Berkeley paper showed three male students staging a vibrator race, sliding the bullet-shaped sex aids down a plywood incline. Students at the University of California, Santa Barbara, were encouraged to consider hooking up with neighbors. A student columnist wrote: ''Just think, if the house next door throws a 'dress as your favorite anime character' theme party, you will have that much less distance to travel the next morning after the hookup, thus, much less sarcastic commentary from strangers you pass as you embark on the walk of shame home. Then again, if you are attending anime theme parties, you should be ashamed of yourself to begin with.'' (Note to parents: I'm told campus papers run such incendiary articles during the weeks scheduled for campus tours, that this is not typical college behavior. Note to students: Yes, it is.)

LEARN THE BRAGGING RIGHTS: In a single week we were given tours by a theater arts major who wanted to run away with Cirque de Soleil, a communications major who wanted to be a stand-up comedian and a political science-economics major who wanted a job, any job. All shared the ability to talk while walking backward.
 Our guide at the University of California, Santa Cruz, an amiable aspiring actor who had studied Warrior Yoga, relayed the useful information that the school's mascot, the banana slug, had been celebrated in the pages of Sports Illustrated. Face it, the mascot is crucial. You will be looking at it on notebook covers, sweatshirts and alumni newsletters for the rest of your life. 
 The guide also bragged that the Santa Cruz campus was as big as 11 Disneylands. Over at Berkeley, the guide told us that the university had invented the particle accelerator and, more important, Tater Tots. (Well, not exactly, a university spokesman says, but at least the technology behind them -- dehydrated mashed potatoes.) Stanford, we learned, had introduced to college football the concept of the helmet and the huddle. And Santa Barbara students, it seemed, had invented fire and, almost immediately thereafter, a novel way to recycle the contents of a keg party. 
 ''Yeah, we have a reputation for setting fire to sofas and then putting out the fire by peeing on the flames,'' our guide said. Seeing the look on some parents' faces, she qualified her remarks: ''It doesn't happen that often, but when it does, it's pretty funny.''

JUDGE A CAMPUS BY ITS ESTEEM FOR INNOVATIVE THOUGHT: The Berkeley faculty has at one time or another included 18 Nobel winners. Banners with their pictures hang from utility poles on Telegraph Avenue, which may be the only place you will get to see them. On campus there are parking spaces reserved for Nobel laureate permit holders. Forget advancing knowledge or improving the fate of mankind. Come up with a history-changing breakthrough, and Berkeley gives you a spot to park your S.U.V. Now that's incentive. Stanford and the California Institute of Technology, on the other hand, tended to play down the prize, perhaps because so many incoming freshmen already have one.

CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE METHODS: There are cheaper ways to do this, said friends. Make use of the Internet. Videos. Catalogs. Watch the college-tour episode of ''The Sopranos,'' in which Tony whacks a snitch while he's showing his daughter, Meadow, around campuses in New England.
 As we strolled around Berkeley, Conor, my 12-year-old son, said, ''I recognize this place.'' 
 A past life? ''It's one of the levels on my Tony Hawk skateboard video game,'' he said. Sure enough. He pointed out a number of landmarks from the game that clearly were inspired by the Berkeley campus. Judging by the number of students on skateboards, it was as accurate a portrait of college life as any.

LOOK INSIDE A DORM: One collection of empty Red Bull cans looks the same as the next. At Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, a student had set up a sofa, desk and lamp in the courtyard outside his dorm. He may have been ''sexiled,'' which, according to a guide to college slang that I had picked up, means ''being forced to vacate your room so that a roommate can romp in private with a member of the opposite (or same) sex.'' Or maybe his financial aid package didn't stretch as far as a room. Whatever. He quietly read as students manning a nearby refreshment stand threw lemons against the side of the building.

EAT A MEAL ON CAMPUS: The guides rhapsodized about the diversity in food. Students could pig out on fare that included vegetarian, vegan, lactose-intolerant, low carb, no carb, low fat, kosher, ethnic. Strangely, it all resembled pizza. Caltech, at least, was honest. Our guide told us the residence halls don't bother serving breakfast because students aren't up at that hour.

IT'S YOUR CHILD'S LIFE, NOT YOURS: We had learned from other parents that nothing in the catalogs or college guides -- that is, rational objective data -- would determine your child's final choice. Children pick up on the intangibles. A friend's daughter chose her college after looking at the shoes students wore. My son was favorably impressed by the ''awesome'' sci-fi art lining the halls at Caltech. He also liked the pranks (rigging the scoreboard at the Rose Bowl to read ''Caltech 60, M.I.T. 0'' and reconfiguring the Hollywood sign to read Caltech).
 There's a lot to be said about a place whose idea of a road trip is the Mars rover. My daughter was also impressed. She liked ''the idea of smart people gathering and working to make themselves smarter.''
 It will be worth every penny.

Miss the Tour?
 LOTS of movies, especially of the horror-slasher variety, show the layout of a given campus. Be advised, though: What you see is not always what you get.
 PRINCETON: For a look at the campus, see the early part of ''A Beautiful Mind.'' Classroom scenes at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, however, were shot at Bronx Community College.
 INDIANA UNIVERSITY: Alfred Kinsey conducted his research on human sexuality at the Bloomington campus, but his chroniclers chose the repressed 50's feel of Fordham in the Bronx and Columbia in Manhattan to film ''Kinsey.'' Bloomington's moment came in ''Breaking Away,'' a look at town-gown conflicts, all things Italian and pre-Lance Armstrong cycling. 
 WELLESLEY: A good visual of this women's college in Massachusetts is ''Mona Lisa Smile,'' one of the few films shot mostly on the right campus (a few scenes were shot at Columbia and Yale). But like ''Kinsey,'' this one feels like time travel. 
 UNIVERSITY OF THE PACIFIC: If college films all look the same, it may be because so many are filmed on the West Coast. This sun-drenched, idyllic campus in Stockton, Calif., is home to Indiana Jones's classroom, ''Flubber'' and John Cusack's dream date in ''The Sure Thing.'' 
 POMONA: With its ivy-covered courtyards, palm trees and Spanish architecture, this California campus has played host to the geeks in ''Real Genius'' as well as the aspiring students in ''How I Got Into College,'' ''The Gilmore Girls'' and ''Teen Wolf Too.'' 
 U.C.L.A.: ''Scream 2'' (also see Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Ga.). 
 U.S.C.: Background in dozens of films, including ''Orange County,'' ''Forrest Gump,'' ''Road Trip,'' ''The Girl Next Door,'' both ''Legally Blondes'' and ''Zombie High (aka the School That Ate My Brain).'' JAMES R. PETERSEN

HEADLINE: The Fine Art of Yale

BYLINE: By Sandra Salmans

 BODY:
BUY what you like, art collectors are often advised, because there are no guarantees a work will increase in value. But here, from a University of Chicago economist, is a tip on beating the art market: Buy the works of graduates of the Yale University School of Art.
 In a paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research, David W. Galenson, who has made a specialty of the economics of modern art, notes that 25 Yale graduates from 1952 to 1989 have produced works that have sold for $50,000 or more at auction. Works by 16, including Robert Mangold and Matthew Barney, have sold for upward of $100,000, and works by four -- Chuck Close, Eva Hesse, Brice Marden and Richard Serra -- have sold for more than $1 million. 
 Professor Galenson advises investors to identify the most promising Yale students by polling their classmates and professors. Then, much like buying bonds of different maturities, pick up art from different periods and wait a decade or more for the purchase to pay off. Professor Galenson crunched the numbers for rival art schools but says no other came close. ''The Art Institute of Chicago would be a pretty distant second,'' he says, trailed by the University of California, Los Angeles, and the California Institute of the Arts. 
 ''The guy's ideas are not irresponsible,'' says the art critic Arthur C. Danto. Yale is an incubator for successful artists, Mr. Danto says, partly because it is in a position to choose the best and partly because the students get the chance to meet established artists and dealers who take an interest in their work. Increasingly, he says, a master of fine arts is a necessary passport to the art world: ''The idea of someone breaking in from outside is far more rare than you would think.'' 
 Richard Benson, dean of Yale's art school, sniffs at the thesis. ''We don't consider success in the marketplace has anything to do with being a successful artist,'' he says. ''So how can I take this whole thing seriously?'' SANDRA SALMANS

HEADLINE: The Academic Boutiques

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER SHEA. 
Christopher Shea writes on academia and ideas for The Boston Globe.

 BODY:
MAGGIE DILLON, a junior at Princeton, arrived on that Gothic patch of New Jersey in the fall of 2002 with a pretty good idea of what she wanted to study. ''From Day 1,'' says Ms. Dillon, a native of Grosse Pointe Farms, Mich., ''I thought I was going to major in English.'' 
 It would certainly have been a well-worn path: this year, 128 Princeton students are concentrating in English literature, making it the university's fifth most popular major, after politics (250), history (245), economics (223) and public policy (164). In fact, in a pattern that is alarming administrators, 43 percent of all juniors and seniors at Princeton major in the ''Big 5'' departments. With the remaining 57 percent of students scattered across 29 other subjects, some departments are strained -- by Princeton's comparatively luxurious standards -- while others are underused. And some are essentially academic boutiques: Slavic languages, for instance, has six majors, German has eight, astrophysics nine. 
 ''When you have that kind of imbalance, it is really hard to deliver the quality of the educational experience that we prize,'' says Nancy Weiss Malkiel, dean of the college. ''The president'' -- Shirley M. Tilghman -- ''asked me about a year and a half ago what would be the one thing I could identify that we could do that would most improve the quality of education. ''I said, without a moment's hesitation, 'Change the patterns of concentration.''' 
 So Ms. Malkiel has put the academic lemmings in her sights. Last fall, Princeton mailed a 71-page booklet promoting the advantages of the smaller majors to every freshman and sophomore and their parents. It featured essays by alumni who had majored in East Asian studies and gone into investment banking, or studied art history and gone to Hollywood, with quotes from law- and medical-school deans and employers reassuring students that all kinds of majors are welcome. This year, upperclassmen and professors are giving talks in residence and dining halls on the benefits of overlooked departments.
 The dean's pitch piqued Ms. Dillon's interest. She had just started studying German but got on an accelerated track in the class and ended up signing with the German department. Last semester, as a major, she took three classes in the department, with 4, 6 and 10 people. This semester she is studying in Berlin -- this reporter's phone call caught her touring Radio Brandenburg, part of her program -- and she has a Princeton-financed job lined up at the Jewish Museum Vienna next summer. ''Majoring in German,'' she says, ''has opened up opportunities that I might not have had in English.''
 ''They are great departments,'' she says of Princeton's underpopulated ones, ''and they have a lot of resources.''
 Lopsided choices of majors is a widespread phenomenon. And as a reform, Princeton's public-relations campaign is brilliant in its simplicity: by distributing students more evenly across classes and advisers, the university could improve undergraduate education significantly at little cost -- at a time when most efforts for new efficiencies center on expensive information technologies or complex, politically charged changes to faculty structure.
 Then there is the college-counseling angle. The argument is that by choosing a major cleverly, a student (at a small college) can turn a good education into something close to the ideal of one-on-one instruction, or (at a large state university) recreate on the cheap the experience at a place like Swarthmore or Reed.
 It's an argument often made by professors who teach in small departments on large campuses.
 ''At a humongous university like ours,'' says Mari Noda, chairwoman of the department of East Asian languages and literatures at Ohio State, ''students are at first bewildered by the fact that teachers all remember their names, and we write individual comments every week on their classroom performance.'' Ohio State, which had 1,300 English majors and about 1,200 biology majors last year -- and about 25 Chinese majors -- has no mechanism for steering students to less-populated majors, according to Martha M. Garland, vice provost and dean of undergraduate studies. But advisers might tell math-adept engineers, for example, to check out the relatively intimate physics department, she says.
 At the University of California, San Diego, 3,368 students are majoring in biology and fewer than 10 each in German and Italian studies. ''I think it's an economic thing,'' says Michael P. Yaffe, associate dean for education in the division of biological sciences. Biotechnology jobs are plentiful in the region.
 But clearly careerism does not explain the popularity of history or English: these are ''default'' majors, administrators say, often chosen because they are intrinsically interesting and students don't know what else to study. So anyone who wants to change the pattern of major choice faces two obstacles: economic logic and sheer inertia.
 For prospective majors in philosophy whose parents worry that the subject is impractical, Nancy Schauber, chairwoman of the department at the University of Richmond (about 25 majors overseen by six professors), has a well-honed pitch. She emphasizes how well philosophy prepares students for law school, and how many corporate leaders (George Soros, Carleton S. Fiorina) studied philosophy. ''If what you are worried about is making lots of money, philosophy turns out to be pretty good preparation,'' Ms. Schauber says. 
 At Princeton, however, where the administration has thrown its weight behind such arguments, Dean Malkiel's pitch has run into a surprising amount of resistance. Take Catherine Rampell, a sophomore who has narrowed her choice of major to economics or East Asian studies. She calls the brochure she got in the mail ''a little bit ridiculous.'' Its exemplar of an East Asian studies major was J.D. Delafield, a fifth-generation Princetonian who graduated in 1989 and went on to help found the investment bank WR Hambrecht & Company. ''Obviously, this is not a representative sample of what majors in the department do with their lives,'' Ms. Rampell says. While tempted by the small classes, she expects it will be harder to land a job if she chooses East Asian studies. ''At least a higher-paying job, let's put it that way,'' she says. 
 Neeta P. Fogg, a professor of economics at Northeastern and an author of ''College Majors Handbook,'' thinks that Ms. Rampell's skepticism is warranted. ''To tell them to study anthropology if they're excited by it -- that's a good thing,'' she says, adding, ''To tell them there is no difference between anthropology and economics'' in future earnings, ''that is misleading.'' 
 Her book draws on a Census Bureau survey of 148,000 college students: its data show, for example, that chemical engineering majors earn, on average, 40 percent more than the average college graduate throughout their careers, and economics majors earn 18 percent more. English majors, by contrast, earn 10 percent less than the average college graduate, anthropology majors 15 percent less and philosophy majors 21 percent less. 
 Princeton students also worry that a concurrent administration campaign to reduce grade inflation -- the goal is to reduce the proportion of A's in courses from about 47 percent to 35 percent -- makes the small major riskier: history is full of smart generalists, but physics and Near Eastern studies tend to attract whizzes in those field, or so students think. ''There are more A's available to you'' in economics than in Chinese, Ms. Rampell says. It's unclear whether that claim is true or just a proxy for the fear of the unknown.
 All agree that change in the patterns of major selection will not come quickly. Professors in the large departments enjoy their popularity; they have no plans to drive students away. And the image of the debonair, black-clad English major may prove too attractive for an academic functionary to alter. Yet Dean Malkiel is certain there are more would-be German majors lurking in crowded Shakespeare lectures -- and that some students in Economics 101 are wondering what it would be like to study physics.
 ''What I'm trying to do,'' she says, ''is liberate them.''

The Pataki administration deserves the heartfelt thanks of all who care about the Hudson Valley for its ruling this week that a proposed cement plant in the city of Hudson would deal great harm to the region's cultural and environmental integrity while doing little to help the economy. 
 The ruling is a severe and perhaps permanent setback for St. Lawrence Cement, the plant's Canadian sponsor. The company may yet appeal. But because the ruling clearly reflects the considered wisdom of not only the region's inhabitants but of the state's political leadership as well, St. Lawrence would be well advised to pack up its blueprints and go home. 
 The ruling was issued by Randy A. Daniels, New York's secretary of state, plainly with the endorsement of Gov. George E. Pataki, who has made the enhancement of the valley a big part of his environmental agenda. Mr. Daniels said the plan -- which called for a 40-story smokestack, a 2-mile conveyer system and extensive waterfront activity -- was inconsistent with the state's coastal management policies because it would impair access to the river, pollute the air, spoil scenic vistas and discourage the small businesses and tourists on which the local economy increasingly depends. 
 Yet to read this decision as simply a rejection of a particular plant at a particular location is to read it too narrowly. In a broader sense, it conveys a deeply affirmative vision of the valley's future as a place where nature, even history itself, can compete on favorable terms with residential and commercial development. 
 Thanks to environmental laws and advocacy groups, the Hudson River has come a long way from the days when it was little more than an industrial sewer. Rulings like this one will insure that it continues to flow in the right direction.

HEADLINE: Democratic Moral Values?

BYLINE: By Matt Bai. 
Matt Bai, a contributing writer for the magazine, is writing a book about the future of the Democrats.

 BODY:
You can forgive Democrats in Washington for feeling somewhat vindicated by the way the controversy over Terri Schiavo played out. For years, after all, they waited in vain for the moment when Republicans might trip over their own arrogance while crusading for moral values, and finally, if polls are to be believed, it happened. Spurred by opportunism and more than a little genuine religious fervor, the heirs to Goldwater and Reagan seemed to forget how they came to control the values debate in America in the first place: not by interfering in the moral choices of families but by promising to stop government from doing exactly that. In truth, it had been a long time since Republican leaders paid more than superficial tribute to their libertarian creed, but it was only now, in the battle over a dying woman's wishes, that the public seemed to call them on it. 
 And yet, satisfying as it was for Democrats to watch Bill Frist and George W. Bush grow mute in the face of voter unease, they couldn't escape from the fact that the Schiavo episode exposed something hollow in their party too. Far from having made a compelling case for euthanasia or against morality by fiat, Democrats, with a few notable exceptions, pretty much became bystanders to the whole unseemly affair. And while Republicans managed to further define themselves as a party that would even go to unpopular lengths to defend the sanctity of ravaged and unborn souls alike, Democrats were again left to ponder their own identity in an age in which religious values and scientific insight seem increasingly to be hurtling toward collision. Even in defeat, Republicans emerged as ''the party of life.'' And as one leading Democratic operative privately warned a roomful of allies, ''We can't just be the party of death.''
 Before Schiavo ever became the story of the moment, Democrats were wrestling over the meaning of moral values, with about as much clarity as you might expect from a bunch of cable-TV pundits debating superstring theory. There are two basic arguments being put forward by national Democrats on how to change their image, and at a breakfast for Democratic officials in Washington last month, I heard two of the party's more serious thinkers lay them out. The first speaker, Harold Ford, the young representative from Tennessee, argued that Democrats needed to speak the same spiritual language as Republicans if they didn't want to continue to be seen as godless elitists. ''We can separate church and state,'' Ford said in a preacherly cadence, ''but, by golly, we ought to be able to say that our spirit, our faith and our morals influence somewhat how we treat people and how we shape laws and how we implement policy.'' After Ford sat down, Howard Dean, the party's new chairman, counseled that if Democrats really wanted to win back churchgoers, they had to make the case that traditionally liberal programs like health care and community-development block grants were moral values, too. ''I am tired of having decent Americans who don't happen to wear their religious beliefs on their sleeves called immoral,'' Dean said. 
 There was something useful in each of these prescriptions, and yet each also sounded a little wishful; it's not easy to imagine most Democrats credibly sermonizing, any more than it is to envision Southern congregations shouting hallelujahs at the mention of block grants. The deeper problem lies in the party's positions, which have sent much of America a confusing and not especially credible message on questions of morality. While the Democratic Party traces its ideological lineage on economic issues to the New Deal, its DNA on social issues was created by the union of the two principal movements of the 1960's: civil rights and the antiwar counterculture. The two are generally discussed as part of the same transformative social force of the era, but in fact, in the political arena, they reinforced very different instincts. The civil rights movement legitimized the idea of legislating and codifying morality. Where activist lawmakers or judges could find a constitutional rationale for overruling states and communities on a discriminatory social policy, Democrats came to believe that they had not just the right but also the responsibility to intervene. The counterculture, however, was all about radical individualism -- the attitude Republicans now snidely describe as ''if it feels good, do it.'' In the context of the time, these contradictory ideas weren't hard to reconcile; to Democrats, and to most Americans, government's integrating swimming pools seemed clearly to be right, while government's banning books seemed clearly to be wrong. But as often happens in law and politics, the specific circumstances that created each impulse were outlived by the conflicting precedents they established.
 The inheritors of the party, children of the 60's and 70's, have never been able to reconcile this contradiction, and neither have a lot of their constituents. Where their own communities are concerned, Democrats reflexively resist any notion of government as a moral umpire; they don't want some politician dressing up their kids in school uniforms or deciding which video game they should be allowed to play. Joe Lieberman has carried on a long and lonely fight within the party to hold Hollywood accountable for the content of its movies, and for this he has been savaged by liberal activists. And yet when it comes to the more rural and religious communities where other voters live, Democrats tend to view government, conveniently, through the activist prism of civil rights. Legislation limiting gun ownership or legal decisions restricting school prayer seem eminently reasonable, because they reflect urban and secular values that, to most Democrats, constitute an obvious moral imperative.
 This kind of hypocrisy isn't limited to Democrats -- Republicans, those lovers of states' rights, made that clear enough when they tried to bully Florida's courts and Legislature in the Schiavo case -- and it probably says as much about human nature as it does about any one political ideology. All of us are inclined to see our own values as sacrosanct, while the choices of others are subject to review: if I put a statue of Zeus in front of my house, that's my decision as an owner; but if my neighbor sets a rusty car atop a pile of cinder blocks, it's suddenly an issue of our collective property values. When it comes to morality, our first instincts always tend toward tyranny. Moral issues bring out the worst in our two political parties because the parties seek to capitalize on those instincts, motivating voters by turning them against one another and pushing them toward extremes. What Republicans have managed to do is to dress up their particular brand of moral tyranny as a defense of life and piety in all its forms. The Democratic alternative, relying as it does on the moral judgments of Ph.D.'s and Oscar winners, subscribes to no such pretension. It simply smacks of boundless elitism.
 Democrats can try to change the conversation by playing with language and definitions, but in the end, any meaningful re-evaluation of their approach to moral values -- like just about everything else on the Democratic agenda -- will require more intellectual rigor as well. Like Bill Clinton in 1992, Democrats now may have to confront some of their most powerful interest groups, which have grown accustomed to demanding absolute fealty on issues like abortion and obscenity, if they want their notions of morality to feel more consistent and inclusive to many Americans. This may be a transitional moment for both parties. More voters now are refusing to join either party, rejecting the notion that either holds a monopoly on values. And as technology advances, so, too, does the shading of moral choices that used to seem black or white. Can Roe v. Wade still be the sole arbiter of life's starting point, for instance, now that a mother can watch her 12-week-old fetus spinning in the womb? Perhaps the party that builds a national consensus in the era after Terri Schiavo will be the one that has the courage not to exploit moral choices but to wrestle with them. Most Americans seem to understand that we are entering a time of complex, wrenching decisions that defy facile and self-righteous answers. Maybe it's time for politicians to admit that, too.

HEADLINE: Acela, Built to Be Rail's Savior, Bedevils Amtrak at Every Turn

BYLINE: This article was reported by James Dao, Matthew L. Wald and Don Phillips and written by Mr. Dao.; James Dao and Matthew L. Wald reported for this article from Washington, and Don Phillips from Paris. Anne E. Kornblut contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 23 

 BODY:
It was called the American Flyer, and its goals were ambitious: to speed train travel between Northeastern cities, steal customers from air shuttles, provide the model for a nationwide fast rail system and help its deficit-prone parent, Amtrak, earn a profit. 
 ''These trains will enable Amtrak to carry its customers into the 21st century aboard 21st-century trains,'' said Thomas M. Downs, Amtrak's president, at a 1996 ceremony announcing a $611 million contract for the new trains.
 Today that train is called the Acela, and instead of being Amtrak's savior, it has become a frustrating burden. On Wednesday, the company announced plans to sideline all 20 Acelas until summer to replace cracked brakes. It was the third major disruption of the high-speed service since it came on line in 2001. 
 The tale of the Acela is in many ways the story of Amtrak itself, where political pressures, tight budgets, contested regulations and design changes turned a high-speed train into something slower, more expensive and less reliable than what Amtrak had promised. 
 A reconstruction of Acela's history involving dozens of interviews and a review of court documents and other records shows that Amtrak was under intense pressure to deliver its new train as quickly as possible. And that rush to do something bigger and more complicated than the railroad had ever done led to a series of missteps that many experts believe contributed to the problems that have plagued the Acela to this day.
 ''There is an old saying in the acquisition world: you want it bad, you get it bad,'' said Tom Till, who led the Amtrak Reform Council, a group created by Congress to study the railroad's problems. ''That's exactly what happened with Acela.''
 Before the first train was built, the Federal Railroad Administration required it to meet crash safety standards that senior Amtrak officials considered too strict. That forced the manufacturers, Bombardier Inc. of Canada and GEC Alstom of France, to make the trains twice as heavy as European models. Workers dubbed the trains ''le cochon'' -- the pig. 
 Some experts have speculated that the added weight contributed to a series of problems, including the latest one, with Acela's wheels, brakes and shock-absorbing assemblies. Federal regulators are still investigating the cause of those problems.
 During construction, Amtrak also discovered that the coaches were four inches too wide to use their full tilting mechanisms, which allowed the trains to speed around curves. As a result, trip times were slower.
 Once the first trains were delivered, Amtrak -- which had counted on the Acela to wean it off federal subsidies -- pushed the trains into service without extensive testing.
 ''The company at that time, as it always is, was under intense pressure to produce results and revenue,'' said George Warrington, Amtrak's president from 1998 to 2002 and now executive director of New Jersey Transit.
 All told, Amtrak ordered 9,000 engineering changes that increased costs, delayed production -- just selecting draperies for the windows took two years -- and added thousands of pounds of weight, the French-Canadian consortium said in a lawsuit filed in 2001. Amtrak argued that the manufacturers produced shoddy equipment and an outdated interior design, all behind schedule. The litigation was settled out of court in 2004. 
 The design problems, breakdowns, production delays and litigation have caused some rail experts to question why Amtrak selected a bid that involved an essentially new design.
 One reason, current and former Amtrak officials say, was that the ideal off-the-shelf train did not exist. But another reason was money: the French-Canadian consortium offered the lowest bid and best financing deal, one heavily subsidized by the Canadian government. And cutting costs was paramount to Amtrak.
 ''They didn't have the cash,'' said Amtrak's president, David Gunn, who took office after the contract was negotiated and the trains had begun running. ''There wouldn't be anything if they hadn't done it this way.'' 
 Despite its many problems, Acela remains Amtrak's most successful service. Until last week, it was generating about $300 million a year, enough to cover its operating costs. Ridership had been increasing, and surveys showed passengers liked its quiet coaches and plush amenities.
 But even Mr. Gunn has said openly that the train was poorly conceived and badly built, and he has vowed never to buy another one.
 ''If you're buying equipment, you want evolutionary change, not revolutionary change,'' he said this week. ''For us, this was revolutionary.'' 
 With Amtrak running annual deficits of over $1 billion, the Bush administration has called for ending federal subsidies and breaking the company up through bankruptcy. Some Amtrak supporters in Congress worry that their efforts to maintain federal support for the railroad has been weakened by the Acela's continuing problems.
 ''For those of us who care about Amtrak, the Acela mess couldn't come at a worse time,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. ''It makes our job harder to fight for it.''

Search for a Fast Train
 A high-speed rail system had long been the dream of Amtrak officials. W. Graham Claytor Jr., Amtrak's president from 1982 to 1993, envisioned a system of sleek trains that would be tested on the corridor between Boston and Washington, adapted to the Midwest and the South, and eventually run down the spine of the California coast. 
 Inspired by the successes of Japan's bullet train and high-speed networks across France, Germany and Spain, Congress also became involved. In 1976, and again in 1992, it authorized billions of dollars to improve the railbeds and electrical systems along the Northeast Corridor. And it set a goal that Amtrak must provide Boston-to-New York service in under three hours. 
 It was more than an arbitrary benchmark. Marketing experts said that travelers would consistently choose to fly, even with the added costs and inconveniences of traveling to airports and waiting for flights, over train rides lasting longer than three hours. And bankers demanded that Amtrak reduce its train times to receive financing.
 ''Literally,'' said Joseph Vranich, the author of a book about Amtrak, ''minutes matter.''
 To reach that goal, Amtrak repaired bridges, replaced wooden ties with concrete ones and electrified the track from New Haven to Boston. But it did not have the billions of dollars required for changes that would allow trains to travel over 150 miles an hour consistently: constructing straighter tracks and replacing aging overhead electric lines.
 Instead, they focused on acquiring a new train to replace Amtrak's aging fleet of Metroliners, which were built in the 1960's. 
 In 1992, Amtrak began testing two European trains between Washington and New York: the Intercity Express, or ICE train, from Germany and the X2000 from Sweden. Some Amtrak officials thought the X2000 was well suited for the Northeast Corridor because of a tilting mechanism that reduced centrifugal force on passengers when the train sped around curves. The line between Boston and New York is among the most winding in the country.
 But the Swedish company decided not to bid on the contract because it did not want to make the changes required by federal regulators to adapt its lightweight European train to America, said a former senior Amtrak official who asked not to be identified because he has taken another job in the transportation industry.
 At the same time, the new Republican majority in Congress was pressing Amtrak to become self-sufficient. The railroad's board was looking for a high-speed train that could help achieve that goal by attracting new riders without costing too much. Bombardier-Alstom's bid seemed to promise all that. 
 The companies proposed adapting the fast French TGV train, which Alstom had designed, with tilt technology. They pledged to assemble the cars with American workers in Plattsburgh, N.Y., and Barre, Vt. They agreed to maintain the trains for a relatively low price. And they offered, with the assistance of the Canadian government, a generous package of loans worth more than $600 million to help Amtrak buy the trains, a virtual no-money-down deal.
 ''We were under the gun'' to cut costs, said Tommy G. Thompson, who was chairman of the Amtrak board from 1998 through 2001. ''The Acela was a vehicle by which we thought we could reach self-sufficiency.''
 But, he added, ''We had problems with Bombardier from the get-go.''
 When Amtrak began seeking bids for a new train, it hoped to avoid creating ''some customized product that looked like a Defense Department project,'' Mr. Downs, the former Amtrak chairman, said in an interview. ''But it didn't work that way.''
 Instead, in Bombardier-Alstom, Amtrak had chosen a company that had to design an almost entirely new train. In addition, Amtrak and the Federal Railroad Administration, which oversees the railroad, began issuing thousands of design demands. Some were trivial, ranging from wall coverings to door chimes. But others were not.

'High-Velocity Bank Vault'
 Unlike European and Japanese high-speed trains, most of which run on dedicated lines, Amtrak shares the Northeast Corridor with bulky, slow freight trains. The railroad agency has long required that passenger trains be heavier than European ones to withstand crashes. 
 Bombardier knew its new train would have to meet those requirements, a spokeswoman said. But Mr. Downs said he asked the rail agency to ease that standard for the new high-speed trains, to no avail. 
 ''They decided they wanted to make this the safest train in the world,'' he said. ''All my engineers thought the rules were nuts.'' 
 He dubbed the Acela ''the high-velocity bank vault.''
 Railroad Administration officials contend that Amtrak did not object to the safety requirements.
 The result was that the new train weighed more than double the French TGV train on which it was based. The added weight did not slow the new train down, as it ran up to 170 miles an hour in tests. 
 But several former Amtrak officials say the suspension system on the Acela may have been designed for a lighter train. ''Heavier trains are harder to get started, and they are harder to stop,'' said Mr. Downs, noting the brake problems.
 When asked if the problems were the result of marrying a European underbody to an American car, Robert D. Jameson, the acting federal railroad administrator, said that the cause was still under investigation. 
 ''To the extent you take something built for another purpose and associate with the car bodies on these trailers and power cars, and they're not compatible, then potentially you have problems,'' Mr. Jameson said.
 While the trains were being assembled, Amtrak discovered an embarrassing error, one that would provide fodder for late-night talk shows. Engineers realized that the car bodies were four inches too wide for their tilt systems to work properly.
 If two Acela trains were going around a curve in opposite directions, and the tilt system on one broke, the trains could brush against each other. Limiting their tilt meant the trains would have to run at slower speeds around bends, but Amtrak said it would still meet its goals for trip times.
 The consortium blamed Amtrak for making a sudden change in its safety requirements. But David J. Carol, Amtrak's vice president of high-speed rail, said at the time that ''Bombardier has never been particularly candid with us about how this happened.''
 Consortium officials also complained about excessive meddling by Amtrak on the interior design. But a former Amtrak official, who asked that his name be withheld because he did not want to be publicly involved in the dispute, said railroad officials believed that the interior was being given short shrift, even though the train was supposed to attract sophisticated customers.
 ''It looked like a commuter car from the 1970's,'' the official said of the manufacturer's original plan.
 Even Amtrak's initial $16 million marketing campaign for the new train drew criticism.
 In the summer of 1999, the company announced that it had dropped ''American Flyer'' in favor of Acela, a fusion of ''acceleration'' and ''excellence'' devised by a New York consultant. (When he became Amtrak president, Mr. Gunn ridiculed the train's name, often opening speeches with a joke: ''What is Acela? It's the room under the first floor.'')
 Rather than emphasizing the train's speed or convenience, the first advertisements featured dreamlike images with offbeat captions. Some riders told The Philadelphia Inquirer that one advertisement, picturing a man with an overcoat around his head and the words, ''Depart from your inhibitions,'' made them think of a flasher.
 The campaign was intended to build excitement for Acela's scheduled arrival in late 1999. But it ended well before the train's inaugural run, which was delayed for a year because testing uncovered cracked bolts and a tendency of the wheels to oscillate on the rails, a dangerous condition known as ''truck hunting.''
 When the Acela finally made its first trip from Washington's Union Station on Dec. 12, 2000, Secretary of Transportation Rodney E. Slater said it would ''transform transportation along the Northeast Corridor'' and ''serve as an engine for economic growth.''
 The train arrived in Boston 6 hours 43 minutes later, just 12 minutes late.
 Today, Acela is capable of reaching 150 m.p.h., but travels that fast only on an 18-mile stretch in Rhode Island and a 10-mile stretch in Massachusetts. It has not achieved Congress's goal of a three-hour trip from Boston to New York, typically making the run in 3 hours 20 minutes. And about a quarter of the time the trains are late, recent Amtrak statistics show.
 Now, with the train out of service, frustrations are at a boiling point on the Metroliners that Amtrak has deployed to replace the Acelas. On the jam-packed ''Vermonter'' that pulled out of Union Station on Friday afternoon, dozens of passengers were left standing in the aisles, sprawled across luggage and pushed against walls. By the time it reached New York, the bar car was out of wine, and the train was an hour behind.
 ''It's been horrible, horrible, horrible,'' said Debbie Sugiyama, 37. ''But they had no problem taking our tickets and our money.''

Trouble in Washington
 Amtrak officials are confident that customers will flock back to the Acela once it returns to service, whenever that may be. Less certain is the railroad's future on Capitol Hill.
 Created by Congress to be a for-profit private corporation, Amtrak is also required to provide a minimum level of intercity passenger service -- even if that means maintaining unprofitable lines.
 Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, underscored that conflicting mandate this past week. Defending Amtrak's money-losing long-distance trains, which serve her state, Ms. Hutchinson said, ''My motto for passenger rails is 'national or nothing.'''
 While Amtrak has some bipartisan support in Congress, it is also strongly disliked by a significant block of conservative lawmakers who view it as a poorly managed drain on the treasury and want it privatized.
 Neither side can prevail, but they can fight to a stalemate. And the result is often that Amtrak receives enough to survive, but never quite enough to meet its needs for new equipment and better railways.
 ''The basic problem with Amtrak is that it has been on a starvation budget for 20 years,'' said Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York.
 The standoff in Congress makes it less likely that President Bush's proposal for radically restructuring the passenger rail system will gain traction on Capitol Hill. Representative John L. Mica, Republican of Florida, who strongly supports privatizing the railroad, said he is not optimistic about change.
 ''At some point, Congress and people in the Northeast Corridor are going to have to wake up and look at some serious alternatives to Amtrak,'' he said. ''But maybe it hasn't gotten quite bad enough yet.''

HEADLINE: The Ties That Bind at Morgan Stanley

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
A CHIEF executive is under pressure to resign. Representing a rival faction from an awkward merger, he is roundly criticized for his aloof management style. Irate investors attack him over the stock's sluggish performance. 
 That pretty much sums up the ordeal facing Philip J. Purcell, the chairman and chief executive of Morgan Stanley, who is locked in a battle with eight retired executives calling for his ouster. And it's also similar to what happened to one of his main allies, Michael A. Miles, the influential chairman of the investment bank's governance committee and the board's unofficial lead director. 
 In the early 1990's, Mr. Miles was the chief executive of Philip Morris, having joined the company when it merged with Kraft a few years earlier. He cut cigarette prices, watched the stock plummet and finally resigned. As a nonsmoker from Chicago, he never quite hit it off with the company's power base, its top cigarette executives in New York. 
 For Mr. Miles, it was a searing experience that ended a distinguished managerial career, and it sheds light on the stubborn resistance of the tightknit Morgan Stanley board to the demand by dissident former executives that Mr. Purcell step down. 
 And as the bilious debate over Mr. Purcell's leadership rages on, it is the board that has come to occupy center stage. After all, Morgan Stanley is one of few companies that require a 75 percent vote by directors to replace a chief executive; that provision was written into the bylaws in 1997, after Morgan Stanley's merger with Dean Witter. At nearly all other companies, a simple majority will do.
 The standoff has cost the firm dearly. William Kourakos, who once ran its high-yield bond division, a unit that produced hundreds of millions in revenue, was the latest top executive to leave, submitting his resignation late last week. Mr. Kourakos was a managing director and a 20-year veteran of the firm, and his departure adds to the growing discontent within Morgan Stanley. 
 Pressure on Mr. Purcell and the board is building. Late last week, he and Mr. Miles traveled to Baltimore to meet with T. Rowe Price, one of the firm's larger shareholders and one that has been critical of Mr. Purcell, according to people who were briefed on the meeting. These people, who described the meeting as contentious, said it was significant that T. Rowe Price had asked for a director to accompany Mr. Purcell. T. Rowe Price declined to comment.
 Even if directors are dead set against compromising with the eight executives, the erosion of good will within the firm, its languishing stock price and growing unease among shareholders may eventually force their hand. It remains to be seen whether the close relationships that many of the directors have with Mr. Purcell will color their judgment in any way. 
 Indeed, Morgan Stanley bankers, not to mention the dissident executives, have accused the board of coddling him. It is packed with former chief executives, many from the Chicago area, where Mr. Purcell lives. Some have golfed together; others have worked for one another. 
 FOR all the board's interconnections, the most profound bond may be the shared experiences of two directors who have led the way in defending Mr. Purcell: Mr. Miles and Edward A. Brennan, the former chief executive of Sears, Roebuck. 
 Like Mr. Miles, Mr. Brennan was the target of a shareholder revolt in the early 1990's, when Sears stock slumped as the company struggled to remain competitive. Bowing to the pressure, Mr. Brennan, who nurtured Mr. Purcell's career while he was at Sears, reshuffled his board, asking Mr. Miles to join it in 1992. He capitulated further when he reversed the company's foray into financial services, spinning off Dean Witter in 1993 and paving the way for Mr. Purcell's subsequent ascent on Wall Street.
 For the two men who rose to power in the 1970's and 80's, accustomed to the imperial trappings of their position, the shareholder revolts of the early 1990's were in many ways a shared crucible that appears to be steeling their resolve as they face down the retired Morgan executives.
 Clearly, Mr. Brennan and Mr. Miles know what it takes to topple a chief executive: a united group of vocal shareholders and public pension fund managers lobbying for a change. But that combination has yet to materialize during the current battle. 
 ''I think that having gone through these experiences and having been subjected to these pressures, these guys realize it's a long game and that they have a lot of cards,'' said Robert A.G. Monks, a corporate governance activist who led the shareholder putsch against Mr. Brennan. ''And in the absence of a coalescing of major shareholders, they and Purcell could say, 'How many troops does the pope have?'''
 In recent years, the board has become more diversified, adding John E. Jacob, a communications executive at Anheuser-Busch and an African-American, in 2001; Klaus Zumwinkel, the chairman of Deutsch Post; and Sir Howard Davies, a former top securities regulator in Britain, in 2004. But its core members remain remarkably monolithic -- and the ties that bind them go well beyond the shared experience of Mr. Miles and Mr. Brennan. 
 First, there is the Kraft connection. Mr. Miles, the chairman of the nominating committee and an original Dean Witter director, recruited two former executives who worked for him at Kraft in the mid-1980's: Miles L. Marsh and C. Robert Kidder.
 Then there is the McKinsey connection. Four directors were partners at McKinsey, the management consulting firm, as was Mr. Purcell himself. And finally, there is the fact that a number of directors, notably Mr. Brennan and Mr. Miles, serve together on boards at other companies. 
 Governance watchdogs frown upon such board overlaps, saying that it restricts directors from taking contrary positions. Mr. Miles, for example, serves on six boards, including that of the AMR Corporation, where he serves alongside Mr. Purcell and Mr. Brennan. Mr. Brennan also serves on six boards, and Charles F. Knight, a former chief executive of Emerson Electric, sits on five, including those of SBC Communications (where he serves with another Morgan Stanley director, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a former top economist in the Clinton administration) and Anheuser-Busch, where he serves with Mr. Jacob.
 Besides having a lot in common with one another, these executives also share a lot with Mr. Purcell. They hail from the Midwest, and all have been top executives. 
 Morgan Stanley's directors say their work as former corporate executives underscores their independent thinking and trumps any ties they may have with one another. ''I think this board is competent and independent of Phil,'' said one independent director who asked not to be identified. ''To dwell upon issues of geography and the fact that some might have worked at the same firm is really quite shallow. Obviously, the board is very concerned about these issues and is acting responsibly to deal with them.''
 Charles Elson, a governance specialist at the University of Delaware, said the issues of overlap were a matter of nuance. ''None of these relationships are problematic legally,'' he said. ''The concern for shareholders is, do these ties make it harder for directors to stand up and take a contrary position? And even if the relationships don't impact you, they impact the public view, which is why you need to avoid them.''
 Others say such ties are not harmful if they are disclosed. In a recent note to clients, Martin Lipton, the takeover lawyer at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz who also advises companies on governance matters, criticized the new class of institutional investors and academic gadflies who say social and philanthropic ties among directors may compromise their independence.
 ''These types of requirement are the antithesis of the kind of collegiality and relationship with the C.E.O. that is necessary for the board and C.E.O. together to promote the appropriate tone at the top,'' he wrote. ''The concept of the board as remote strangers and as the agency for discipline of management, rather than as partner of management in setting the strategic course for the corporation is contrary to all prior experience and will not lead to better performance.''
 Strong words, to be sure, especially considering that Mr. Lipton advised Mr. Brennan during his battle with shareholders. Mr. Lipton also famously earned $20 million for two weeks of work when he advised Mr. Miles and Kraft on its 1988 merger with Philip Morris, and he is now advising the independent directors at Morgan Stanley on a range of matters, including their strategy for dealing with their antagonists. 
 One point made by the retired executives is that until recently, no director -- including Mr. Purcell -- had ever operated a line of business for a securities firm. That set Morgan Stanley apart from nearly every other Wall Street firm. 
 Last month, in response to that criticism, Mr. Purcell appointed his new co-presidents, Stephen S. Crawford and Zoe Cruz, to the board. He has also cited Mr. Madigan's Wall Street background, though his experience as a junior investment banker at Paine Webber and Salomon Brothers in the 1960's and 70's pales in comparison with those of industry veterans on other boards.
 SO what happens next? Assuming that the board remains firm in its support for Mr. Purcell, it will face a much larger hurdle later this year, when the forces allied against management will do their best to rally shareholders to withhold proxy votes against the current directors.
 At that point, if there has been no sharp upswing in the stock, the perceived coziness of the board will be an added spur for unhappy investors to take action. A similar situation occurred at Walt Disney, where directors had close ties to Michael D. Eisner, the chairman and chief executive. But in Disney's case, it was not discontent with the board that motivated shareholders as much as it was frustration over Mr. Eisner's management of the company.
 So Morgan Stanley directors may have helped Mr. Purcell survive so far. But if he fails to quell the rebellion within the firm and drive the stock price up, there may be little they can do to save him later.

HEADLINE: Why the Baby Boomers Won't Wreck the Market

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT. 
Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a service of MarketWatch. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
YOU'VE probably heard the predictions that a prolonged bear market will begin as the baby boomers retire and sell their stocks. While the historical record provides some support for such a view, a new study suggests that the consequences of the population's aging will not be anything nearly that bad.
 The study, by James M. Poterba, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has found that changes in the proportion of retirees in the population have only a modest impact on stock market returns. So while the market is likely to come under some downward pressure from the retirement of boomers over the next couple of decades, he says he believes that there is no reason to expect the effects to be severe. 
 Professor Poterba's study, ''The Impact of Population Aging on the Financial Markets,'' has been circulating since last autumn as an academic working paper. A copy is at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract-id=609226.
 He compared the market's year-to-year returns from 1926 to 2003 with the annual changes in a number of demographic indicators, including the proportion of the population in retirement -- a phase of life when investors are presumably net sellers of stock. He also looked at the share of the population in the 40-to-64 age group -- people who tend to be net buyers of stocks. Regardless of the statistical test used, however, he found little evidence to support a forecast of a long-term bear market over the next couple of decades.
 Predicting the effect of population patterns on the stock market, Professor Poterba noted, is not an exact science. Immigration, for example, may significantly reduce the proportion of people in retirement, making predictions based on current data inaccurate. And if population trends ever do cause the market to decline, more foreign investors may enter the market in search of bargains, reducing or even reversing the damage. Professor Poterba's testing did not explicitly take these potentially ameliorating factors into account, so, if anything, it may have exaggerated the bearish consequences of the baby boomers' aging. 
 Even so, the professor found very little evidence that demographic patterns have any effect whatsoever on the stock market's returns. Given the imprecision of the statistical tests, however, he is willing to allow that the huge number of baby-boom retirees may reduce the market's annualized return by about one-half of 1 percent over the next couple of decades.
 Clearly, a half-point reduction in annual returns would dampen the stock market's performance, but it wouldn't be devastating in and of itself. For example, at any given time, it certainly wouldn't be enough to turn a bull market into a bear market. 
 Professor Poterba's research has some important implications. The most important is that demographic analysis should not be used to make short-term forecasts, because the age distribution of the population changes very slowly. The markets may be surprised by the latest inflation or unemployment report, but not by the proportion of the population that will turn 65 this year. According to Professor Poterba, that means the stock market's performance this year will result primarily from developments that have nothing to do with demographic trends.
 At the same time, he suggests that long-term forecasts based on population patterns are also problematic. That's because the long-range effects of the population's aging depend on imponderables like immigration and international capital flows, which can negate the impact of currently perceivable demographic trends. In essence, Professor Poterba is sending this message to anyone making bold forecasts on the basis of demographic trends: ''Proceed with caution.''
 WHILE he disagrees with those who draw doom-and-gloom conclusions from demographic analysis, Professor Poterba does not argue that the age distribution of the population makes no difference. After all, a half-point a year adds up to a significant amount over a long period. Compounded over 30 years, it would mean that an amount invested in the market today would be worth 14 percent less than would otherwise be the case.
 In any case, Professor Poterba argues that the investment implications of demographic analysis are not obvious. Even if boomers' retirement dampens returns for stocks, it is likely to reduce returns of other major asset classes, too. 
 So even if you are inclined to draw bearish conclusions from the aging of the baby boomers, it isn't clear that they should lead to reducing your stock market exposure.

HEADLINE: Television Is Changing. Can Any Magazine Keep Up?

BYLINE: By JOHN MOTAVALLI

 BODY:
DOES the world need another brightly colored magazine filled with articles about TV stars and the latest gossip from ''Desperate Housewives''? Gemstar-TV Guide International, whose new celebrity magazine, Inside TV, hit supermarket checkout lines last Thursday, sure hopes so. 
 Inside TV, aimed at young women, is an important step in Gemstar's bid to revive its sagging fortunes. Much of the problem lies with its most visible businesses: the once mighty TV Guide, with a circulation of more than nine million a week, and the TV Guide Channel, which offers scrolling basic cable listings in 77 million homes. 
 The two businesses account for more than half of its revenue, and both are in trouble. Subscribers, particularly younger television viewers, are jumping to interactive program guides -- essentially search engines for TV listings -- and advertisers are following them. The company posted a net loss of $94.5 million last year on revenue of $732 million, and its stock has been hovering only slightly above its 52-week low of $3.97. 
 Gemstar has interactive guides of its own. It started an updated product called i-Guide last August and has entered into a joint venture, called GuideWorks, to develop products with Comcast. Whether they will grow enough to assuage concerns about the future of the TV Guide franchise is unclear, particularly because viewers who sign up for an on-screen guide will have less need for TV Guide magazine and the TV Guide Channel.
 Some people in the industry doubt that the company can transform itself. ''There wasn't much that the horse-and-buggy factory could do when people started driving cars,'' said Robert B. Crosland III, a managing director at AdMedia Partners, a media investment bank and advisory firm.
 Recent advertising numbers for TV Guide have done little to convince skeptics. The magazine had almost a quarter fewer ad pages this year through its April 3 issue, compared with the same period last year, according to figures from the Media Industry Newsletter. Among major weeklies, only USA Today Sports Weekly fell further. Many, including Us Weekly and People, increased 15 percent or more.
 ''We're using TV Guide less and less,'' said Eric Blankfein, senior vice president and director of communication channel planning at Horizon Media, an ad buying firm. ''We're concerned about reader flight and the quality of their audience.'' Horizon Media buys program promotion ads for A&E Networks.
 John Loughlin, the president of the TV Guide Publishing Group, acknowledged the magazine's challenges. ''The questions you're posing are the same questions we think about,'' he said in an interview at his office in Midtown Manhattan.
 In a presentation to Gemstar's biggest investors, the company identified a quandary for TV Guide, 95 percent of whose circulation is by subscription: a large portion of the subscribers are ''traditionalist,'' ''older, 65-plus'' and ''more analog,'' compared with those who are listed as younger and ''digital.'' Mr. Loughlin did not say what percentage was in the ''older'' category, but he conceded that TV Guide's subscribers were unlikely to impress the advertisers in a more upscale publication like, say, Vanity Fair. ''It's a mass book,'' he said of TV Guide. ''It isn't Traditional Home.''
 In its 2004 annual report, Gemstar acknowledged a ''substantial decline'' in program advertising -- the ads for particular movies and shows in the listings. It added that the decline of these ads, the core of TV Guide's ad revenue, ''could be permanent.'' 
 Consumer ads are not faring much better. In the interview, Mr. Loughlin said a decrease in pharmaceutical advertising hurt ad revenue in the first quarter. And, in general, TV Guide's readers are not the kind of consumers whom advertisers are most eager to reach. According to calculations by Mediamark Research, an audience research firm, the median household income of TV Guide readers is $48,516, about $3,000 less than the national median as computed by the firm. The median age of TV Guide readers, 44.1, is about the same as the age of USA Today readers, but it is still older than the 18-to-34 group that many advertisers covet -- hence the need for Inside TV.
 Circulation revenue is also a problem. In a recent regulatory filing, Gemstar suggested that some subscribers received the magazine at very low cost. ''We have provided subscribers with various forms of promotional offerings,'' such as low or at-cost subscriptions, the company reported.
 Gemstar has struggled with two possible strategies for TV Guide, according to people who previously worked at the magazine or had discussed working there. One would have been a radical change in TV Guide itself, with a more targeted circulation. The other option, the road apparently taken, was to create satellite magazines and to leave TV Guide more or less as is. Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corporation owns 42 percent of Gemstar, warned Mr. Loughlin not to alienate TV Guide's existing readers, according to someone who has discussed strategy with Mr. Loughlin.
 The first issue of Inside TV features Eva Longoria of ''Desperate Housewives'' on the cover. As a sign of the competition it faces, Vanity Fair, In Touch and The Star also had ''Desperate Housewives'' stars on covers of issues at checkout counters last week.
 Mr. Loughlin said Inside TV would be different from other celebrity magazines because of its focus on one medium. A tag line identifies it as being ''for young women who love television.''
 There is no shortage of celebrity magazines. Just this month, American Media Inc., which publishes The Star and The National Enquirer, said it planned to start Celebrity Living Weekly. The new offering looks like a low-cost version of In Style, the celebrity lifestyle magazine from Time Warner, which also publishes People. 
 Other competitors are In Touch and Life and Style, from Bauer Publishing USA. And still more rivals may appear: Wenner Media, which already publishes Us Weekly in a joint venture with the Walt Disney Company, has said that it is thinking about starting another celebrity magazine.
 ''Three years ago, the only celebrity weekly magazine that counted was People,'' said Michelle Myers, vice president and publisher of The Star. ''In the last several years, we brought in Bonnie Fuller from Us, and reinvented the category.'' Ms. Fuller is the chief editorial director of American Media.
 Kent Brownridge, senior vice president at Wenner Media, said weekly celebrity titles could be very profitable. ''If Inside TV makes it, the economics are just astounding,'' he said, adding that a publisher could make $25 million a year on a successful weekly of this type. But of TV Guide itself, he said: ''Time has passed it by, and it is already sinking into the sunset. Its readers are older people for whom it is a part of their acculturation.''
 The reinvention of celebrity magazines has increased competition not only for reader loyalty and access to celebrities, but also for space in the magazine racks at supermarket checkout counters. These recast magazines, which emphasize bright pictures over text, rely on impulse buying by food shoppers looking for a bit of fun.
 As a result of that competition, the cost of renting supermarket space has climbed sharply. Magazine executives say their companies have to pay a one-time set-up fee of as much as $70 for each ''pocket'' in a rack, although Mr. Loughlin said Gemstar paid much less when setting up distribution for Inside TV. Still, it doesn't help Gemstar that the biggest supermarket magazine distributors are owned or controlled by competitors -- Time Warner, American Media, Hearst and Conde Nast.
 One indication of the depth of Gemstar's problems is the extent of a recent executive shakeup. Its chief executive, Jeff Shell, quit last December. And on a single day last month, three other executives left: Ian Aaron, president of the TV Guide Television Group, which includes the TV Guide Channel; Douglas Macrae, president of the company's consumer electronics division; and Gloria Dickey, executive vice president for administration.
 The News Corporation has sent over two of its executives to help Gemstar: Richard Battista, the former executive vice president for business development and strategy at the Fox Entertainment Group, is the new chief executive, and Anthea Disney is the new executive chairman. Ms. Disney retains her job as executive vice president for content at the News Corporation. 
 Marla Backer, an analyst at Soleil-Research Associates, said she sensed that Gemstar's new senior executives were beginning to lose faith in TV Guide. ''Read the transcripts of the last four conference calls,'' she said, referring to conference calls with stock analysts. ''You get a sense of a decline of optimism about the magazine.''
 Ms. Backer said she thought that reviving the TV Guide Channel would be difficult, because it is supposed to make money on advertising while steering viewers to other channels. ''It's a difficult balance to present it as a guide and also say, 'Watch me,''' she said. 
 Gemstar cannot stray too far from the TV Guide Channel's original format, she added, because its contracts with many cable operators, including Time Warner Cable, have a ''content clause'' that allows the operator to drop a channel if its programming changes.
 Mr. Crosland of AdMedia Partners said, ''They are in a very tough position.''

HEADLINE: Do Families and Big Business Mix?

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
BRIAN L. ROBERTS stood out on his very first day at Comcast, and not just because he was 12 years old. His father, Ralph J. Roberts, who founded the company, took him along to a meeting nearly four decades ago, when Comcast was planning to go public. Around midnight, executives produced a new draft of the offering document and pored over it for accuracy. It was the boy, however, who noticed that one of the charts read backward, and excitedly told his father. 
 ''That's a good point. Let's change it,'' Brian Roberts recalled his father saying.
 ''Right from the start, he gave me confidence,'' he added. ''There are a million fathers who would say, 'Sit still and don't open your mouth.''' 
 The younger Mr. Roberts, of course, went on to become chief executive and chairman of Comcast, which he and his father, who remains a director, have turned into the nation's largest cable company. But while theirs is an example of a corporate dynasty that seems to be working, the headlines these days show that the relationship between fathers and their offspring at other family-dominated companies can be fraught with peril. 
 At Cablevision, James L. Dolan has been feuding publicly with his father, Charles F. Dolan, over the father's desire to start a satellite TV business. At Adelphia, the cable company that is now bankrupt, a son of the founder, John J. Rigas, shared his father's sense of entitlement, using the company coffers as a personal piggy bank. And at A.I.G., which is being investigated for accounting irregularities, the former chief executive, Maurice R. Greenberg, had a rocky relationship with his two sons during their time at the insurer. 
 So is keeping control in the family good for business, not to mention good for the families, who, after all, have to talk about something over Thanksgiving dinner? The short answer, most experts agree, is that even the best-run family companies present a special, often daunting set of challenges.
 A recent study suggests that the odds are clearly not in favor of corporate dynasties. David M. Reeb, associate professor of finance at Temple University in Philadelphia, and Ronald C. Anderson, associate professor of finance at American University in Washington, examined the performance of 403 family-controlled companies from 1992 to 1999. They found that in the first generation, when the founder is in control, these companies tend to outshine their peers. Companies where families bring in professional managers also do well.
 The problems start when the baton is passed from one generation to the next. ''When the company is turned over to a family member,'' Mr. Anderson said, ''it is likely to underperform family firms run by the other two groups.'' 
 The explanation, he said, is simple: family-first companies are selecting from a tiny list of candidates. ''There is no reason to think that you can look at one of your three or four kids and think that this is the best you can do,'' he said. ''It is likely you could have found a more talented pool from a larger sample.''
 OBVIOUSLY, there are plenty of examples of family dynasties that get it right -- from McGraw-Hill to International Speedway. In fact, Thomas Russo, a partner at Gardner Russo & Gardner, manages $2 billion for wealthy investors and seeks out well-managed family businesses. Mr. Russo has large positions in Heineken, the Dutch brewer (run by several generations of Heinekens until a few years ago), and in Brown-Forman (four generations of Browns), a liquor company whose brands include Jack Daniels and Southern Comfort, as well as in Comcast. 
 ''Finding the right company is very labor intensive,'' Mr. Russo said. ''But when you find them, their strategy is often far more long-term oriented than companies with professional management.'' Well-run family-controlled companies ''want to preserve the franchise for future generations,'' he said, ''and are less likely to risk long-term value for short-term gains.''
 One company that will undergo a closely watched generational change is Viacom, the media giant. Sumner M. Redstone, 81, its founder, chief executive and controlling shareholder, plans to turn over voting control eventually to his daughter, Shari. She is now president of National Amusements, the family's privately held movie theater business. 
 At her father's urging, Ms. Redstone, 51, has been spending more time at Viacom, learning the ins and outs. Her father says he expects to appoint her as vice chairman in the near future. ''You should only put family in your company if you believe in their competence and commitment,'' he said in an interview.
 But Ms. Redstone is aware that her new role should be clearly defined. ''I tell my children that doors open fast, but they close even faster,'' she said, referring to her situation as Mr. Redstone's daughter.
 Neither Mr. Redstone nor his daughter expects that she will play an operational role, as Viacom is already in the hands of managers outside the family: the co-presidents Tom Freston and Leslie Moonves. And that, as Professor Anderson suggested, may give the company a better chance of succeeding over the long haul.
 In a recent twist that may have the effect of loosening family control over some transactions, Viacom is also considering splitting itself into two separate companies. If that happens, the family will retain ownership of its shares and dominate both entities. But one media company executive said that there could be times when the controlling shareholder would not be able to act -- for example, if the two companies were chasing the same acquisition. ''Then the controlling shareholders would have to step back from the voting,'' this executive noted.
 Whether or not the company goes forward with that plan, Mr. Redstone is holding on to the reins for now. ''I don't think there is any particular reason to turn over voting control as long as I am physically and mentally able,'' he said.
 Experts on family businesses view an inability to step aside, despite advancing age, as the greatest potential pitfall for entrepreneurial founders. Why do some of them hang on so long? Corporate patriarchs may have an especially tough time separating other life roles from running the business, because their work and personal identities are so intertwined, said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, an associate dean at the Yale School of Management. 
 That precludes their children and even professional managers from getting the opportunity to take risks that would help them prepare for larger roles. Or, as Leon A. Danco, a consultant in Cleveland to family businesses, likes to put it: ''It is not as hard to get the son to step up to the plate as to get the father to get off the plate.''
 Nowhere was that clearer than at A.I.G., where at different points Mr. Greenberg's two sons, Jeffrey and Evan, appeared to be heir apparent to their powerful father, who is known as Hank. ''Even though Hank Greenberg did not have a controlling stake in A.I.G., he effectively controlled the firm via management and the board,'' said Professor Anderson, who wrote the study on family businesses.
 Yet Mr. Greenberg is said to have been even harder on his sons than on other company officials. He once was so angry at Jeffrey that he said in front of other employees: ''You either fix your management problem or I'll fix mine,'' according to Noam Scheiber, whose article on the family appeared in New York magazine.
 Nikki Finke, a veteran journalist who was married to Jeffrey Greenberg, said that the father loved his sons but was incapable of praising them. ''If Jeff said, 'When I got there, the division was in trouble, and I think I have turned things around now,' Hank would go: 'You think that's a problem? You want to hear problems. Look what I had to deal with.''' 
 Representatives for the Greenbergs said they declined to comment. 
 ACCORDING to Professor Sonnenfeld, founders often do not view themselves as mentors grooming ideal successors, but as judges of invariably flawed candidates failing in trial assignments. By the time A.I.G.'s problems arose earlier this year, Hank Greenberg was 79 and had no immediate plans to leave, although A.I.G. had put a nonfamily succession plan in place. 
 Just how closely some founders see themselves allied to their companies has also become clear at Cablevision Systems, which was founded by Charles Dolan, now 78 and its chairman. Mr. Dolan has always run the company like a general, dispensing various sons to management positions but keeping voting control effectively in his own hands. In 1995, he made his son James the chief executive but still tended to infantilize him. Two years later, he even told a reporter than when Jim lost his temper, ''I let him run up and down until he cools off.''
 Several people who have worked with the younger Mr. Dolan say that he is given to dressing down employees and will even argue with his father in public. The father manages through ''quiet persuasion'' while the son can be prone to ''histrionics,'' according to Leo Hindery, managing partner at InterMedia Partners and a former director and chief executive of AT&T Broadband.
 The professional style of the younger Mr. Dolan does not surprise John A. Davis, a senior lecturer at Harvard Business School and faculty chairman of a program there on families in business. He believes that the younger generations may ''feel they don't have any real power,'' he said, ''so they bluster out of a sense of powerlessness.'' 
 At Cablevision, the elder Mr. Dolan sometimes acts as if he is still chief executive of the company, despite his son's title. That was evident late last year, when he pushed forward with a money-losing satellite television business that Wall Street disliked and that worried the board.
 For the first time, an ugly battle between father and son erupted into public view. James Dolan opposed his father on the issue, and, along with most board members, voted against any additional support for the project. So angered was the father that he immediately reconfigured the board. He removed three people who had opposed him and added three new board members who are major media industry figures. 
 Cablevision has decided to virtually shut down the satellite business, and James Dolan is still at the helm. ''It was a case where the exiting general does not always prevail,'' Professor Sonnenfeld said. ''It was impressive that James Dolan and the board decided not to blindly endorse the patriarch.''
 STILL, there had been some industry speculation that Mr. Dolan might try to marshal board support to dismiss his son and that the family might come apart as a result. That is what happened in the vicious battle over Dart Drug in 1993, when Herbert Haft fired his son Robert, the chief executive, and replaced him with another child, Ronald, who had never run a public company and with whom the father began feuding immediately. 
 The wife of the elder Mr. Haft, Gloria, sided with Robert as the family fighting intensified. (She later divorced her husband.) By the time the battle ended in 1997, no Haft was involved in the business that the family had founded 50 years earlier.
 But such public feuds are still relatively rare at family-run corporations. Even the elder Mr. Dolan recently pointed to the fact that under his son Cablevision's results have been better each year. The company's stock has gone to about $27 a share from $7 since James Dolan took over as chief executive.
 Experts say that it is far more common for families to unite when their business is under attack. The Rigases are a case in point. John Rigas and his son Timothy, who ran Adelphia Communications, were convicted last summer by a federal jury of looting the company to line their own pockets and hiding more than $2 billion of debt. (A hung jury was declared for another son, Michael.) 
 A third son, James, was never charged with any wrongdoing. He used to check his father's spending and sent back some items as inappropriate, said a lawyer involved in the case. James had distanced himself from the rest of the family, marrying and moving away from the Rigas homestead while his brothers remained bachelors and lived at home.
 Still, last November in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, James Rigas testified for the family. When he was asked if he believed his father or brother did anything unlawful, he answered, ''No.'' 
 Some experts on family-owned companies said that a board with more independent members might have helped to avoid the kinds of problems that permeated Adelphia. ''Family firms do well when there is a lot of scrutiny,'' Professor Reeb said. ''The family monitors the firm, but who monitors them? Adelphia was a good example. The board was dominated by the family so there was no counterbalance to the family presence.'' 
 But Nell Minow, editor of the Corporate Library, an independent firm that rates corporate boards, dismisses that notion. ''Even when you make an attempt to diversify the board, everyone knows you are invited on or off by the family,'' she said.
 NOT everyone is critical of family members on boards. Because they have a large economic stake in the company and don't want to see it destroyed, they can be useful, said Professor Anderson at American University. ''But if there are too many, you lose the oversight of independent professionals.''
 At Comcast, Ralph Roberts says he believes that the best solution is to have just one family member with voting authority. After examining what had gone wrong in other family businesses, he concluded that problems arose when there were too many family members with their fingers in the pie. ''Our other children did not want to go into the business,'' Mr. Roberts said, ''so we ended up with one voice.'' 
 Mr. Roberts gave voting control to his son Brian when the son was just 35. Experts generally believe that such a move is valuable because management control is an illusion if the founder has the final say. The elder Mr. Roberts said: ''The way for a person to grow rapidly is to know that you have control of the situation, and so I thought that this would demonstrate my faith and confidence in Brian.'' 
 His son likes to think of it this way: ''You're playing the back 9 and the question is whether the father wants to make birdies or does he want his kid to make birdies,'' he said. ''Every time I see things go wrong, I can see it there.''

HEADLINE: Hollywood's New Old Girls' Network

BYLINE: By NANCY HASS

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
NOT long after the talent manager and television producer Brad Grey was named the new chief of Paramount Pictures this year, he did something that has become almost routine in Hollywood: he put a woman in charge of the show.
 Last month Mr. Grey -- who succeeded Sherry Lansing, 60, in Paramount's top job -- named Gail Berman, a respected television executive, to lead the studio's creative team. As a woman deciding what gets to the world's movie screens, Ms. Berman becomes the latest player in a quiet revolution transforming a business that until recently was regarded as a male preserve. 
 Four of the six major studios have women in the top creative decision-making roles, as Ms. Berman joins Stacey Snider, chairman of Universal; Amy Pascal, chairman of Sony Pictures; and Nina Jacobson, president of Walt Disney Company's Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group. Earlier this month, Ms. Snider announced that Mary Parent and Scott Stuber, would be stepping down as vice chairmen at Universal to become producers on the lot; their replacement is Donna Langley, the Universal executive who oversaw ''Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason'' and ''In Good Company.'' 
 Though men still figure most prominently in the corporate echelons of the media companies that own the studios, and talent agencies like William Morris and Creative Artists Agency are still male dominated, these women, who over the years have fought and fostered one another as part of a loose sisterhood, have finally buried the notion that Hollywood is a man's world. 
 So striking is the change that some now see Hollywood as a gender-balanced model for the rest of corporate America. ''It's astonishing,'' said Elizabeth Daley, dean of the film school at the University of Southern California. ''You don't see that kind of progress in any other industry.''
 Women have come to predominate in Hollywood at a time when less than 1 percent of chief executive officers in the Fortune 500 are female, and none of the nation's top 100 publicly held companies have a female chief. According to the National Association of Law Placement in Washington, 87 percent of the partners in law firms are male, although for two decades more than 50 percent of law school graduates have been female.
 It's true that women have yet to own studios -- there is no female Rupert Murdoch or Sumner Redstone -- and that executives like the Sony Pictures chairman, Michael Lynton, and the Walt Disney Studios chairman, Dick Cook, outrank their studios' female executives. But the power to buy scripts, hire directors and even to greenlight films has become so thoroughly vested in a generation of women that the very notion of a female power ranking, like the one done at the end of the year by The Hollywood Reporter, has been deemed quaint. 
 ''That kind of thing may be vaguely interesting in other businesses, but at this point, here, separating the genders is, well, pretty silly,'' Ms. Snider said.
 While it's true that women have been kicking around -- and getting kicked around -- behind the scenes in Hollywood since the beginning, mostly as story editors, they only began to infiltrate the power structure in the mid-70's. The names from that era are near legendary, from Marsha Nasatir (executive producer of ''The Big Chill''), a New York book editor who came to Los Angeles at 40 and became vice president at United Artists, and Rosilyn Heller and Paula Weinstein who rose to be vice presidents at Columbia and Warner Brothers respectively.
 Ms. Weinstein recalls the competition among them as ''incredibly intense.'' While women in the rest of the country were having their feminist consciousnesses raised, she said, Hollywood was ''quite retarded.'' 
 ''A lot of the women had a sort of 1950's hangover,'' she continued. ''They got together at Ma Maison and talked about engagement rings.''
 By the mid-1980's, as women were gingerly entering the executive ranks throughout corporate America, two female powerhouses emerged in Hollywood: Dawn Steel and Ms. Lansing. (Ms. Steel, who was president of production at Paramount and then president of Columbia, died of a brain tumor in 1997.) Lucy Fisher, a producer, said one reason that the two women were allowed to rise was Hollywood's ''immigrant, outsider ethos.'' 
 ''Here,'' she said, ''if it makes money and you're a gorilla, you're in.''
 The competitive ethos among women seemed to have reached its apotheosis in the 1980's; to this day, few in Hollywood will mention Ms. Steel and Ms. Lansing in the same breath without quickly adding -- as if the pugnacious Ms. Steel were eavesdropping on them from above -- that both staked a claim throughout their careers to being the first woman to run a studio. (Ms. Lansing was the first to land a spot as president of production, at 20th Century Fox, in 1980; Ms. Steel became the first female studio president when she took over Columbia in 1987.) 
 By then, more women were making their way to Hollywood. They had grown up during the auteur 1970's, when Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola made films that set cinephiles' hearts on fire, and the Ivy League universities, with their newly minted film studies departments, proved a particularly fertile breeding ground. Studio jobs, with their unusual combination of high pay, glamour and artiness lured graduates away from more traditional career paths like investment banking and law, said Ms. Fisher, who made her way to Los Angeles soon after graduating from Harvard. She became vice chairman of Columbia during the mid-1990's before leaving to produce such films as ''Stuart Little'' and the coming ''Bewitched'' with her husband Doug Wick. 
 The roles of producer or of executive attracted women, she and others surmise, because they held the promise of a steady paycheck and a chance to work on a team. It was alluring, Ms. Fisher said, ''to those of us who didn't have the heart for the all-consuming horror that is a director's life, but wanted to be intimately involved with movies.''
 Many of the women gravitated toward Warner Brothers, where Ms. Weinstein was a vice president, including Ms. Fisher and, later, the daughter of the puppeteer Jim Henson, Lisa Henson, who went on to become president of Columbia in 1993. Vanity Fair memorialized some of them in a photograph in the mid-1980's as ''The Warner Sisters.'' By then, there were enough women around to spawn a more collegial attitude, said Ms. Fisher, who added that her own attitudes were shaped by Ms. Weinstein's generosity.
 But it was not only women who nurtured the new generation of female executives. Two men at Warners, Peter Guber and his partner, Jon Peters -- the producers of ''Batman'' -- proved to be unlikely mentors. Although known for slash-and-burn machismo, Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters, who both eventually moved to Sony, regularly filled their staffs with tough, talented women. 
 ''These guys loved women, in the wrong way maybe sometimes, but also in the right way,'' said Laura Ziskin, who worked for Mr. Peters in the 1970's and credits his tutelage for helping her become the founding chairman of Fox 2000 in 1994. ''Jon Peters was a hairdresser, you know? These men had a tendency to get into fistfights with other men. They were less threatened by women.''
 Mr. Guber, who over the years hired Ms. Heller, Ms. Snider, Ms. Pascal and Ms. Fisher, said he saw in the young women an obvious temperamental advantage, especially when it came to the core of a producer's job: handling actors and directors. ''Most men at the time, including me, just roughed people up, they had no governor on their testosterone,'' he explained in a recent interview. ''These women used their power elegantly. And it turned out they were right. That's why they're on top now.''
 If there was a moment when the accumulated force of women in Hollywood began to show itself, it probably was during the spring of 1993 on the macho terrain of the Sony Pictures lot in Culver City.
 As swashbuckling executives and producers including Mr. Guber, Mike Medavoy and Jonathan Dolgen clashed over Arnold Schwarzenegger's ill-fated, high-budget ''The Last Action Hero,'' a cadre of ambitious female executives was massing. The women included Ms. Henson; Ms. Pascal, who was a newly minted vice president; Ms. Snider, who had come to work for Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters; and Laurie MacDonald, who later led DreamWorks SKG's movie division with her husband Walter Parkes. There was also a powerful stable of female producers on the lot, including Lynda Obst (''Sleepless in Seattle''), Wendy Finerman (''Forrest Gump'') and Christine Peters (''How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days'').
 As the men sweated and screamed over Mr. Schwarzenegger's gold-plated action extravaganza, some of the women worked on a modest project that came to symbolize the new order: ''Little Women.'' Made for $19 million and shot in Canada with a female director, Gillian Armstrong, and producer, Denise DiNovi, it made nearly $50 million in the United States, virtually the same amount that ''The Last Action Hero,'' which cost $60 million, a fortune at the time, was able to eke out in the domestic market.
 ''I didn't realize it at the time, but those two films really represent the beginning of a real shift,'' Ms. Pascal, 46, said. ''At that moment, the female talent at the studio was just amazing.''
 From there, the women fanned out to different studios, often employing one another. ''There's a little bit of an old girls club at this point,'' Ms. Pascal said. By the late 1990's, female executives, particularly Ms. Fisher, who cut her work week to as little as three days when she had young children, had smoothed some of the edges off the industry's go-go, late-night culture. ''We needed each other for cover, so we could cut out for that concert our kid was in and not seem like slackers,'' said Ms. Jacobson, who has a 6-year-old son and a 3-year-old daughter. (Such habits spread: even Steven Spielberg has joked publicly about the joy of taking ''a Lucy Fisher day'' with his children.)
 Today, some female executives gladly talk about how gender has affected their jobs and their choices, but others are uncomfortable with undue focus on them as women. Ms. Pascal, for example, is well known for her effusive personality and her outspoken support of other women. Ms. Snider, all business, quickly switches the subject to the financial nuts and bolts of running a studio. ''She's always talking about moving units in the home video market, which everyone knows is immensely boring,'' a female executive said of Ms. Snider, ''but she wants to make sure people know she can play with the big boys when it comes to the bottom line.''
 Despite the differences in their styles, Ms. Snider and Ms. Pascal frequently ponder a bigger question, one that hovers in the background of any discussion about women and the movies: whether their gender has much of an effect on what, in the end, gets made. ''It can't help but have at least a subtle influence on your decisions.'' Ms. Pascal said. ''When I first started, I wanted to do movies about girl bands. I still do.''
 Ms. Ziskin noted that the decline of the pumped-up action figure epitomized by Mr. Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone and Steven Seagal coincided with the rise of female executives. Tobey Maguire's character in the ''Spider-Man'' films, for example, which she produced under Ms. Pascal's aegis, was clearly a more multidimensional superhero, Ms. Ziskin said. While at Fox 2000, she pointed out with considerable pride, she had produced the ultra-violent ''The Fight Club,'' which was hugely popular with young men, but ultimately questioned the futility of male aggression.
 Even Ms. Snider of Universal, who is hesitant to say that gender influences her, agrees that her studio's ''Bourne Supremacy'' and ''Bourne Identity,'' with Matt Damon, presented a protagonist who was more complex and more ambivalent than many of his screen predecessors.
 But Stacey Sher, a president of Double Feature Films, who was a producer of ''Along Came Polly'' and ''Pulp Fiction,'' said she believed that the Schwarzenegger ethos is still alive and well, albeit sometimes in drag. ''The Bride is the new Arnold,'' she said, referring to the female assassin in Quentin Tarantino's ''Kill Bill.'' It's unclear, she added, whether that shift can be directly traced to women behind the scenes or is simply a mirror of society's increased acceptance of aggressive females.
 But one thing the women can claim as their own is a new genre, the ''tween'' girl flick. ''It's not an accident that I'm a woman and I have a daughter and we've had the 'Princess Diaries' and 'Freaky Friday' here,'' said Ms. Jacobson of Disney's Buena Vista group. Those two movies, produced on modest budgets, have taken in more than $300 million at the domestic box office. Ms. Jacobson, who keeps a slightly tattered VHS of ''Little Women'' on her desk as inspiration, says the genre was born in the wake of ''Titanic'' in 1997, a blockbuster whose success was attributed largely to the packs of young girls who saw it over and over. The market has grown to encompass less-than-sugary movies like ''Mean Girls'' and, for better or worse, helped created such stars as Hilary Duff and Lindsay Lohan.
 Still, when it comes to the large-scale economics of making a studio profitable, whether Hollywood's women remain on top will depend on these executives' ability to serve a popular taste that demands new sensations. A female studio boss, even one whose business sense is as exquisite as her cinematic aesthetic, remains as much at the mercy of the moviegoing public as any mortal man. ''We make as many good movies as bad movies,'' said Ms. Snider, who has had hits as big as ''Meet the Fockers,'' and disappointments as troubling as ''Van Helsing.'' ''Ultimately you answer to the marketplace. It's a matter of what the audience wants to see, no matter who you are.''

Directed by Mr. So-and-So
 Women may have reached parity with men on the executive end of the movie business, but they are still rarely chosen to direct feature films. Only four of the top 100 films last year were directed by women, according to the Directors Guild of America, continuing a trend that has long plagued Hollywood.
 ''It's our No. 1 concern,'' said Elizabeth Daley, dean of the film school at the University of Southern California. 
 Some producers say the problem is a dearth of women studying directing in film school. ''They just don't want a director's life,'' said Laura Ziskin, a producer who made the recent ''Spider-Man'' movies for Sony Pictures. ''It's a 24-hour a day job. How can you go on a 120-day shoot when you have kids?''
 Ms. Daley said the pipeline is indeed part of the explanation -- only about a third of the women who come to the U.S.C. program are interested in directing -- but not all of it. ''There are talented girls who want to do this, but so far they haven't done what the boys do -- band together and sacrifice everything to make a small film,'' she said. It's those films that eventually find their way into the hands of studio executives looking for the next hot young thing.
 Young women are less likely to get support, both financial and emotional, from their parents, Ms. Daley added. ''In my experience, parents of girls aren't as eager to give them their life savings to make a movie,'' she said.
 But some executives, male and female, suggested that directing might require personal characteristics that few women possess. ''The fact is that to be a director you have to be unbelievably ruthless,'' said a woman who has been both a studio chief and a producer, but didn't want her name used for fear of alienating temperamental directors. ''They have a cold streak that most women I know don't have and don't want to have. They are both artist and commander, and they have a maniacal vision that precludes them from caring about anything but the film.'' NANCY HASS

HEADLINE: Private Accounts, and Priorities

BYLINE: By MATT MILLER

 BODY:
WHATEVER you think of President Bush's proposal to let people divert a third of their Social Security payroll taxes into new private accounts, one thing seems a mystery. 
 If the White House and its allies think that private accounts are such a good idea, why don't they propose paying for the fiscal hole that the payroll tax diversion creates, rather than borrowing a fresh $200 billion or so each year for a few decades? Why isn't the idea of paying for the accounts -- through spending trims elsewhere, or, more likely, through some new tax stream -- even part of the debate? 
 As Republican economists and former presidential advisers like Michael J. Boskin, N. Gregory Mankiw and R. Glenn Hubbard take to the op-ed pages to defend the president's idea, they never mention options other than borrowing, focusing instead on a defense of why outsized borrowing is nothing to fear. 
 It wasn't always this way. As privatization proposals kicked around in the 1990's, some advocates talked about a ''temporary'' tax -- usually lasting 30 years! -- to finance the transition. Edward M. Gramlich, the Federal Reserve governor who previously served on a presidential commission on Social Security, wanted to require individuals to pay for new accounts atop Social Security out of their own pockets. In President Bush's first term, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill lost his battle to preserve the budget surplus rather than use it for big tax cuts, so that it would have been available to pay for a potential Social Security transition. Today, Laurence J. Kotlikoff, an economics professor at Boston University, has a plan that would divert more of the payroll tax to private accounts than the president's plan would. But Professor Kotlikoff would finance this without new borrowing by enacting a 12 percent retail sales tax that phases out over several decades.
 So why don't today's brand-name G.O.P. economists consider paying for these accounts? Recent conversations with Mr. Boskin and Mr. Mankiw suggest that they view this as an almost unintelligible question.
 Their first answer is that we are ''paying for it'' already, because the president's plan would reduce people's future Social Security benefits dollar for dollar with what they chose to put into private accounts today. As Mr. Mankiw, who recently stepped down as Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser, explains, this makes the plan a wash, or ''financially neutral to the government in a present-value sense.''
 ''There's no reason why making an implicit liability explicit should change the path of taxes or of other spending behavior,'' he said.
 But one can acknowledge Mr. Mankiw's point and still think that it's a bad idea to soon add $200 billion or more a year to today's sky-high deficits. For one thing, it's not clear that financial markets will agree that huge deficits today are fine because our leaders have instructed their successors 50 years from now to cut benefits, and thus future deficits. What's more, even if you believe that leaders now in diapers will honor this deal, with deficits already topping $400 billion, the borrow-it-all approach essentially says that it is O.K. if we run $600 billion deficits before long. Does Mr. Boskin really want to make that assumption explicit?
 In response, he asserts that deficits above today's $400 billion range simply aren't in the cards. The Congressional Budget Office's forecast, he notes, shows deficits shrinking to a manageable 2 percent of gross domestic product, or in the low $200 billions, in the years ahead. But as Robert D. Reischauer, an economist who directed the C.B.O. when Democrats controlled Congress and is now president of the Urban Institute, points out, the budget office's forecast also assumes that all of President Bush's tax cuts will expire, that doctors' fees paid by Medicare will be cut by 35 percent and that a host of other budget fantasies will come true. 
 Moreover, if the president's approach is enacted, it will mean that the energy and political capital absorbed by Social Security reform will come and go without seizing this moment to increase the paltry national savings rate -- which we could do if we offset the gap created by the diversion of payroll taxes. That means we would be likely to squander the chance to enlarge the economic pie out of which all retirement needs must be met. Mr. Mankiw and Mr. Boskin say that they share this concern, but that it's a question we should address later. 
 Mr. Boskin's other argument is political. ''If you add that amount of taxes,'' he told me, ''it will greatly reduce what little amount of spending restraint remains'' in Washington. This ''starve the beast'' argument is direct enough, but it's fair to question whether it's too impractical to justify rolling the dice on huge new debt. After all, the Republican-controlled Congress has just balked at trimming a few billion from the next trillion in soaring Medicaid subsidies to the states. Does anyone need further proof that spending restraint alone can't cut it? 
 If we took this line of thought seriously -- that it's O.K. to borrow like mad so long as we promise to trim later -- we may march farther down a path that has already resulted in our slipping the bill to our children for large tax cuts for the most wealthy -- and for a $300 billion war to boot. 
 A CYNIC would say that today's top Republican economists have found fancy ways of staying on message -- which means not questioning the wisdom of making Mr. Bush's tax cuts permanent, and justifying the president's plan to Leave Huge Debts Behind. To be sure, Democratic economists face similar pressures to rationalize policy when their side is in power; the secret angst of the White House economist is a bipartisan tradition. Still, it's hard not to scratch your head when conservative Republican senators like Lindsey O. Graham of South Carolina and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa talk about finding new revenue for Social Security so we don't borrow fresh trillions, while the policy professionals trumpet the miracle of the free lunch. They don't call it ''political economy'' for nothing.

HEADLINE: It's a Flat World, After All

 BODY:
 I found Thomas L. Friedman's notion that the outsourcing of information-technology jobs is symptomatic of a failure of America's educational system specious (April 3). 
In the years leading up to the bursting of the dot-com bubble, Americans were encouraged to train in the fields of computers and the Internet, where, it was claimed, the opportunities were virtually unlimited. Many followed this advice. A scant few years later, we are witnessing a headlong race by corporate America to ship these very jobs overseas in a quest for ''greater efficiencies'' and ''more productivity'' (read: bigger executive bonuses). 
 I am hardly surprised that Bill Gates is criticizing American high-school education; but I wonder what Friedman was expecting him to say? That Microsoft is tickled pink that it can pay a foreign engineer a fraction of what it would pay an American? How much easier to cop out by claiming that it's America's miserable schools that leave his company unable to find qualified employees in the United States, and thus give him no choice but to move jobs to China and India?

HEADLINE: Behind The Bush Budget: A Pell-Perkins Switcheroo

BYLINE: By Greg Winter

 BODY:
WHAT would you do if someone had been giving you money for years, lots and lots of it, then suddenly wanted it all back? Nearly half of the nation's colleges and universities will have to do just that under President Bush's proposed budget for fiscal 2006. In it, the administration seeks to eliminate the Perkins Loan program, a $7.5 billion pool of money that low-income students use to make ends meet. In a coda of sorts to the program, the government would get back its share -- as much as $6 billion -- as students repay their Perkinses in coming years, instead of the money being recycled into future loans.
 The idea of losing the Perkins has spread a fair amount of shock across college campuses, and it is likely to be a topic of fierce debate in the next few months. The Senate has already approved by a narrow margin an amendment from Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, to restore the Perkins and other education cuts. But whether the amendment will survive Congress is uncertain. 
 COLLEGES, and therefore their students, have been receiving millions of dollars for decades under the program, which traces its roots to the space race and the government's desire to train more scientists after the launching of Sputnik. Today, Perkins Loans are given to well over half a million low-income students nationwide. 
 The Bush administration says that its portion, which was supplemented by funds from colleges themselves, would be better spent on grants than on loans, an impulse that few in higher education would argue with. The administration also says that because hundreds of campuses do not offer Perkins Loans, the money would be better spent with a ubiquitous program like the Pell Grant, the nation's primary scholarship for low-income students. 
 But the president's budget does not increase grants nearly enough to compensate for the loss of Perkins Loans, educators say. Now, the largest Pell Grant a student can receive is $4,050 a year, and only the poorest students get the maximum award. Under the president's plan, that ceiling would go up by $100 a year for the next five years, for an eventual increase of $500 for the neediest students. 
 With tuitions so high, that still leaves a big hole, and Perkins Loans have been a favorite way for students to fill it, mainly because the loans carry lower interest rates than many private loans and are available to low-income families with less-than-solid credit. At 5 percent, the interest rate on a Perkins Loan is a little higher than federally subsidized Stafford Loans, at least until interest rates rise a bit more. But Stafford Loans carry such strict borrowing limits that many students continue to need other loan sources.
 The president's budget hopes to change that, somewhat. It would raise the borrowing limit on Stafford Loans for freshmen to $3,500 from about $2,600. That should help, experts say, but would not plug the hole created by the termination of the Perkins program. 
 ''If colleges can't offer those loans, there's nowhere else to get them,'' says Brian K. Fitzgerald, executive director of the Business-Higher Education Forum, an association of business and university leaders. ''You could go to private loans, but the interest rates will be higher, and you may not be able to get them.'' 
 TO a lesser extent, college administrators have also voiced concern about other cuts in the president's budget totaling nearly $800 million. The proposed budget eliminates the Leap program, which provides matching grants to states for scholarships, and the Trio program, which grew out of the Johnson administration's war on poverty and helps disadvantaged students prepare for college, including concentrated instruction in math and science. In addition, the budget reduces by more than half the money for Gear-Up, which offers grants for services at high-poverty middle and high schools and college scholarships for low-income students. 
 ''The budget is abandoning low-income students' access to postsecondary education,'' says Joan Becker, associate vice provost for academic support services at the University of Massachusetts, Boston. ''We're rolling the ball back on access.''

HEADLINE: Where Will Shoppers Go for Sea Moss?

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
Stanley Mayer, president of the Bronx Terminal Market Preservation Association, would like to take this opportunity to address himself to Michael R. Bloomberg, the mayor of New York.
 ''Mr. Mayor,'' he says, as if addressing Mr. Bloomberg, ''We are 20-some-odd merchants in the Bronx Terminal Market. We want to remain together as a viable market and serve the community. We are not against development. We want to be part of the development. We are reasonable and fair people who want to be treated reasonably and fairly.'' 
 Mr. Mayer, a bearded and bespectacled man of 56 who has sold meat at the market for more than 30 years, was referring to a developer's plan to transform the market from the East Coast's largest clearinghouse for ethnic foods to a collection of big-box retail stores.
 The developer, Related Companies, signed a lease on the property last April. The plan is for the construction of a suburban-style mall and esplanade where there are now at least two dozen small and mid-sized businesses selling Guatemalan collard greens, Ghanaian smoked shrimp, goat meat and hot Jamaican peppers.
 Mr. Mayer and his colleagues see the plan as working people being pushed out by what their lawyers describe as ''the fish and chardonnay crowd.'' City officials and Related see it as a rare opportunity to develop, and create jobs for, a blighted section of the Bronx.
 Mr. Mayer's appeals to city officials are necessary because the merchants at the market face eviction starting at the end of the month. Under the lease, Related had to take part in an $8 million relocation plan for the merchants, but it was rejected by most of them last month, and negotiations broke down.
 Now two lawsuits have been filed. Lawyers for the merchants have sued the city and Related in separate actions, claiming that the lease should be nullified, in part because the city did not take other bids on the project. 
 The market, which sits on 31 acres amid the noise and shadows of the Major Deegan Expressway, was built in the 1920's. In sight of Yankee Stadium, it is one of the few spots in the city where a curious palate can indulge a taste for burnt cow feet or sea moss from the Philippines.
 The men who work there, and mostly they are men, are the sort who rise at 4 a.m. and spend their days hauling crates of papayas or stacking pallets of bean paste with a forklift. 
 They are men like Marc Strauss, part of the third generation at the meat purveyor Siegmund and Strauss. Or Ralph Lelia, who sells watermelons and wine grapes -- the only job he has had in his 58 years. 
 ''We're normal, everyday, middle-class people,'' Mr. Lelia said the other day. ''This is about big money and big business moving in.''
 The chief lawyer for the merchants, Adrian Zuckerman, describes the lease that Related has as ''a sweetheart deal.'' 
 Under a memorandum of agreement signed last April by Related and the city, the developer has been excused from paying certain construction-related taxes as well as the expense of producing an environmental impact statement. The city has agreed to use as much as $80 million in Liberty Bonds, originally meant to help rebuild Lower Manhattan, to finance the project and has said it will repay a $32.5 million loan should the project fail. 
 Mr. Zuckerman and the other lawyers for the merchants are particularly bothered that under the lease Related is paying rent of about $20,000 a month. The lawyers said their clients, as subtenants on the lease, are paying a total of about $250,000 a month in rent.
 Jesse Masyr, a lawyer for Related, disputed the notion that the lease should be nullified because the city did not follow the rules for renting public property set out in the City Charter. He said the charter included a provision allowing the city to enter freely into any lease it wants when markets are concerned. 
 Mr. Masyr said that the rent charged by Related is the same as what the former landlord, the Buntzman family, charged. ''In no way is the market a profit center for us,'' he said.
 The plan to relocate the merchants also is in dispute. Andrew M. Alper, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, described it as a three-way deal.
 Mr. Alper said the city would pay the merchants $10 per square foot of their property to move. The Bronx Empowerment Zone would offer the merchants $3 million in interest-free loans of up to $500,000 for each vendor. And Related would offer the merchants a rent abatement for their last six months. 
 The merchants rejected the plan because, they said, it would scatter them across the city. Their business relies on customers who drive in -- from as far away as Ohio -- for a one-stop shopping trip. 
 ''To go to various stores takes more time and more money,'' said Charlie Paul, who drives to the market twice a week from Albany to supply his West Indian grocery store. If the market splits up, he said, shopping that now takes two hours would take two days.
 The merchants also objected to the amount of the interest-free loans, saying $500,000 was nowhere near enough to move large wholesale operations, which, in some cases, have refrigeration units the size of a warehouse and worth $2 million.
 Worst of all, they say, the loans are being offered on a first-come-first-served basis. The relocation package, they complain, encourages colleagues to fight among themselves. ''It's not even peanuts,'' Mr. Mayer said. ''It's peanut shells.''
 For now, he and his fellow merchants are hoping that a deal can be struck that would allow construction of the shopping mall around them. 
 ''Big box stores may be great for Main Street, but they're not great for New York,'' he said. ''You've been in one, you've been in them all.''
 Later, picking up a calabaza squash, he said: ''We have stuff here you can't find anywhere else. ''There's an old saying,'' he said. '''Nothing tastes like what your mother tasted.'''

HEADLINE: For New York's Bagel Shops, Passover Week Is No Festival

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Terrace Bagels in Brooklyn is bracing for the annual spring slowdown, its worst week all year. 
 Sidewalk vendors on the Upper West Side say they'll cut their bagel orders by as much as 50 percent. 
 And Florence Wilpon, the owner of Ess-a-Bagel in Manhattan, admits it's a little strange to stay open during most of Passover, when for many New Yorkers the name of your store might as well mean ''Eat a Forbidden Food.''
 If it is hard to be a Jew on Christmas, it may be even tougher to run a bagel shop at Passover. The eight-day festival, which started Saturday evening, celebrates the Jewish people's exodus from slavery in Egypt, and in accordance with tradition, many Jews eat only unleavened bread. 
 For bagel store owners, that means steering through a maze of religious, cultural and, of course, business issues.
 ''Every bagel shop owner knows about it, and we have to prepare,'' said Benjamin Choi, the owner of Lenny's Bagels at 98th Street and Broadway, who will roll about 10 percent fewer strips of yeast-laden dough and step up production of macaroons. ''Otherwise, you'll have lots of leftovers and little profits.''
 While the bagel has evolved from an ethnic treat to one that is universally enjoyed, Passover still manages to put a crimp in New York's bagel economy.
 Bagel shops that are strictly observant simply shut down during Passover because they cannot bake leavened products. Arye Lewkovitz, the owner of Daniel's Bagels in Midtown, said he closed during Passover week because business is so poor. Sales dropped 50 percent the one year he did stay open, he said. 
 ''The business was slow. I think it was bad luck,'' said Mr. Lewkovitz, who said he was going to Mexico on his only extended vacation of the year.
 Others muddle through. H&H Bagels, which has a retail shop on the Upper West Side and a plant on 12th Avenue, will sell about 30 percent fewer bagels during Passover week, said the owner, Helmer Toro. He said he would give some employees a few days off, and also use the time to upgrade and service the baking equipment. 
 Meanwhile, at Terrace Bagels, in Park Slope, the owner, Louis Thompson, said sales typically dropped by about 25 percent during the holiday. ''Passover would be the slowest holiday of the year, as compared to Christmas, New Year's, Easter and Thanksgiving,'' he said. 
 Mr. Thompson said he usually saw a small jump in sales on St. Patrick's Day, for green bagels, as well as on the day after Passover ends. 
 But those occasions pale in comparison with the bonanza that is Yom Kippur, with orders 50 percent higher than normal. Each fall, the Day of Atonement traditionally ends with a dairy dinner to break a fast.
 Of course, the slowdown is not evident in all parts of the city. ''Let's put it this way, business drops maybe 5 percent to 10 percent during Passover,'' said Adam Pomerantz, who owns two Murray's Bagels shops, in Chelsea and Greenwich Village.
 ''Either the Jews in the Village aren't as observant as those on the Upper West Side, or everyone is eating bagels,'' he said.
 For Jewish bagel shop owners who are observant, Passover can present all kinds of ethical dilemmas.
 ''I used to keep the store closed for religious reasons,'' said Mrs. Wilpon, a Conservative Jew who started Ess-a-Bagel with her husband and her brother in 1976 and now owns two shops on the East Side. But for the past 25 years, business has prevailed. She said many customers, Jews and non-Jews, complained ''I wasn't being fair.'' 
 As a result, Mrs. Wilpon has struck a convoluted compromise. Ess-a-Bagel closes for the first two days of Passover, and for the rest of the week sells its bread-and-butter staples -- not to mention its schmears. But in the days leading up to the holiday, the staff takes out flashlights to inspect a large display case for the tiniest trace of bread. After they've scrubbed it using boiling water, they fill the case with holiday foods.
 That way, when customers come in and say they cannot have a bagel because of Passover, Bill Glasser, a longtime Ess-a-Bagel employee, directs them to the gefilte fish, chopped liver and nonrising cakes. 
 If that fails to whet their appetites, Mr. Glasser employs the bagel sale sleight-of-hand. ''I say: 'I have an imitation bagel. It's called a matzo.'''

HEADLINE: Rapidly Shrinking Buffalo Is Left With Half-Empty Hospitals

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

DATELINE: BUFFALO 

 BODY:
In the last half century, this city has been hemorrhaging residents, with a weak economy and municipal turmoil cutting the population in half to just 292,000 people. But even as Buffalo's citizens have fled, eight of the city's state-licensed hospitals remain open, with 2,425 beds, as well as five open-heart-surgery programs.
 On average, nearly half the beds are empty in those hospitals and four others in suburban Buffalo that draw from the same population. Their occupancy rate is 54 percent, below the state average of 61 percent and considerably lower than New York's goal of 90 percent, according to the State Department of Health. 
 Even in New York State, which ranks in the top third nationally in terms of beds per capita, that rate reflects an extraordinary amount of excess capacity. 
 All of this should make Buffalo ripe for the kind of shrinkage and belt-tightening that New York officials say is finally inevitable. Even some city and hospital officials concede that at least one and possibly two hospitals here should close, if only to shore up the remaining ones.
 But closing hospitals remains a challenge in New York, and it is no different in this city, where fierce community loyalty to neighborhood hospitals, the high cost of paying off debt and a lack of cooperation have kept things in an excruciating limbo.
 ''Debt is the principal obstacle to closing hospitals,'' said William D. McGuire, the chief executive of Kaleida Health, which owns three hospitals in Buffalo and two in the suburbs. 
 ''But an awful lot of the obstacle is C.E.O. ego,'' he said. ''We're kingdom builders as a group: 'I've got to have more beds than you do. I've got to have more hospitals than you do. I've got to have the biggest empire.''' 
 With Gov. George E. Pataki and state lawmakers ready to appoint a commission to recommend hospital closings, as a way to rein in the state's spiraling Medicaid expenditures, Buffalo would seem to be a good place to start.
 The eight hospitals -- ranging from squat, yellow-brick centers to sleek concrete-and-glass towers -- include a money-losing county hospital; a highly regarded cancer institute; a cluster of hospitals run by a savvy nonprofit corporation; two Catholic hospitals; and a 40-bed center struggling to emerge from bankruptcy. (There is also a Veterans Administration hospital in Buffalo, which is under federal control and is not state-licensed.) 
 In a city of strongly defined communities, laid out along ethnic, racial and religious lines, the eight have managed to stay open despite recording huge losses as a group in recent years. 
 One tentative proposal in 2002 to shut Women and Children's Hospital of Buffalo met with a rally downtown that drew thousands of protesters. One of the speakers was the former Buffalo Bills quarterback Jim Kelly.
 ''Everybody in Buffalo is very neighborhood-oriented,'' said Sheila K. Kee, chief executive of Sheehan Memorial, the hospital in bankruptcy. ''If it's beyond 20 minutes, forget it. To Buffalonians, that's a big deal.''
 Within those hospitals are many duplicative services. ''It's an area where a tremendous amount of money is wasted,'' Mr. McGuire said. In addition to the five heart programs (three of which belong to Kaleida), there are two kidney transplant programs, two neonatal intensive care units and several oncology services.
 Although the occupancy rates in Buffalo are among the worst in the state, the health care picture has slightly improved, because of some self-imposed downsizing. (State officials would like to see the state occupancy rate close to 90 percent, said Rob Kenny, a health department spokesman.)
 Since 1998, Catholic Health System has closed two hospitals in the suburbs, a move that prompted outcries but strengthened its four remaining hospitals, including two in the city. Roswell Park Cancer Institute dynamited its old 200-bed hospital and built a new one, with expanded outpatient services but with half the number of beds.
 Kaleida Health has taken a different tack: decertifying, or eliminating, 634 beds -- about a third of its total -- and preparing to sell off or demolish 750,000 square feet of space. Mr. McGuire has made it known that he would like to serve on the governor's hospital-closing commission. And, he said, he is willing to consider shutting one of his three city hospitals.
 The downsizing, along with management improvements, has already paid off. Until recently, Kaleida and Catholic Health lost $125 million and $100 million, respectively, over several years. But both are now posting slight surpluses of several million dollars a year.
 Mayor Anthony M. Masiello points to the reduction of beds, as well as three closings of small city hospitals in the early 1990's, as proof that Buffalo is ahead of the curve. 
 ''This city and region have been in the forefront of making tough decisions,'' he said. ''Can we afford to do some more retrenchings? Probably so. But while the governor should be applauded for trying to do this responsibly, it has to be done on merit and in the context of overall quality.''
 Bruce A. Boissonnault, president of the Niagara Health Quality Coalition, a nonprofit group that publishes the New York State Hospital Report Card, insists that the Buffalo region needs to eliminate hospitals, not just beds. ''Hospitals are high fixed-cost factories,'' said Mr. Boissonnault, referring to expenses like real estate, computers and utilities. ''It's only after you get over that fixed-cost barrier that you can start putting money into imaging equipment, new doctors and bedside staff.''
 Yet which hospital or hospitals should close or restructure in Buffalo remains a source of tension.
 Catholic Health, which already closed two hospitals, offers colorful PowerPoint charts comparing its patient discharges, number of births and inpatient surgical procedures to Kaleida's, to show that its four remaining hospitals are alive and well. In every instance, Kaleida's numbers were flat or falling, while Catholic Health's rose.
 And while the Western New York Healthcare Association is forming a committee to guide the governor's hospital-closing commission, efforts to form a Buffalo committee have lagged.
 Ms. Kee of Sheehan said the strain resulted from too few patients for too many beds. ''Everyone has their own little silo,'' she said of the hospital chiefs. ''When you're in a dying economy and someone stands on the roof of the building and throws a bone on the ground, everyone fights over it.''
 Buffalo's weak economy means that any closing will be acutely felt. The city's streets are pocked with boarded-up apartment buildings, and the police investigate dozens of homicides each year. The city's average unemployment rate was 7.3 percent last year, compared with the statewide average of 5.8 percent.
 ''Our economy has already taken a big hit from hospital closings and downsizing,'' Mayor Masiello said.
 But most agree that a well-chosen commission has the potential to work objectively and for the good of all.
 ''In light of all the complexities of closing hospitals, a commission may actually be what has to happen as we begin to look at the entire state,'' said Joseph D. McDonald, the chief executive of Catholic Health. ''We need regional clarity about what we really need in terms of health care infrastructure, and not just right now, but over the next 15 years.''
 Hospital officials say a commission has an additional benefit: political and financial cover. It could provide a desired financial incentive as state officials try to secure $1.5 billion in federal aid. That could smooth the way toward a smaller system by, among other things, helping hospitals pay off their long-term debt.
 Some hospital officials who have pushed through difficult closings without such safety nets are sure to be resentful. ''We did it without anybody flying cover for us in terms of a base-closing commission,'' Mr. McDonald said.
 One challenge facing the commission will be to figure out which hospitals are underused. While the state uses the total number of certified beds to calculate occupancy, Catholic Health and other hospital networks prefer to focus on the number of operational beds, meaning the ones they actually staff.
 At Sisters of Charity Hospital, for instance, there are 413 certified beds, but only 227 are in use. In fact, many exist only on paper, with patient rooms converted into administrative offices. Mr. McDonald said he was reluctant to relinquish the potential beds at Sisters, as Kaleida did, because he could not predict future demand, especially given possible closings elsewhere in the city.
 On a recent weekday morning, the emergency room at Mercy Hospital of Buffalo appeared to be going at full tilt, with several patients waiting on gurneys in the halls, despite a doctor's insistence that it wasn't that busy. During flu season, which can seem interminable during the long Buffalo winters, Mercy's emergency room is often swamped. 
 ''The metro area is known for having emergency departments on divert, when they can't accept patients,'' said Dennis McCarthy, a Catholic Health spokesman.
 While Governor Pataki has said the commission will consider restructurings as well as closings, getting rid of redundancies could prove tricky. Catholic Health is particularly proud that it won permission from the State Department of Health two years ago to start an open-heart-surgery program at Mercy.
 ''Why wouldn't a system of this size and strength have an open-heart program?'' asked Mr. McCarthy, pointing out that the network has 800 beds across four hospitals.
 But some administrators hope a state commission will spend as much time considering ways for hospitals to restructure as it does recommending their demise. Ms. Kee said Sheehan has cut its certified beds to 40 from 109 as it shifts its inpatient focus exclusively to drug and alcohol detoxification and rehabilitation.
 ''I'm willing to say that we will restructure,'' she said. ''We're changing our emphasis, maybe changing licensure. I do intend to be a poster child for that.''
 David C. Hohn, the chief executive of Roswell Park Cancer Institute, agreed that restructuring should be an important component of the commission's work. ''This will turn into something more complex than simple closure,'' he said.
 More than anything, Dr. Hohn said, the trend toward outpatient care in recent years had accelerated the need to revamp the entire health care system. ''A lot of this is painful,'' he said, ''but it's the price of progress.''

HEADLINE: The Oblivious Right

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
According to John Snow, the Treasury secretary, the global economy is in a ''sweet spot.'' Conservative pundits close to the administration talk, without irony, about a ''Bush boom.'' 
 Yet two-thirds of Americans polled by Gallup say that the economy is ''only fair'' or ''poor.'' And only 33 percent of those polled believe the economy is improving, while 59 percent think it's getting worse. 
 Is the administration's obliviousness to the public's economic anxiety just partisanship? I don't think so: President Bush and other Republican leaders honestly think that we're living in the best of times. After all, everyone they talk to says so. 
 Since November's election, the victors have managed to be on the wrong side of public opinion on one issue after another: the economy, Social Security privatization, Terri Schiavo, Tom DeLay. By large margins, Americans say that the country is headed in the wrong direction, and Mr. Bush is the least popular second-term president on record.
 What's going on? Actually, it's quite simple: Mr. Bush and his party talk only to their base -- corporate interests and the religious right -- and are oblivious to everyone else's concerns.
 The administration's upbeat view of the economy is a case in point. Corporate interests are doing very well. As a recent report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities points out, over the last three years profits grew at an annual rate of 14.5 percent after inflation, the fastest growth since World War II.
 The story is very different for the great majority of Americans, who live off their wages, not dividends or capital gains, and aren't doing well at all. Over the past three years, wage and salary income grew less than in any other postwar recovery -- less than a tenth as fast as profits. But wage-earning Americans aren't part of the base.
 The same obliviousness explains Mr. Bush's decision to make Social Security privatization his main policy priority. He doesn't talk to anyone outside the base, so he didn't realize what he was getting into. 
 In retrospect, it was a terrible political blunder: the privatization campaign has quickly degenerated from juggernaut to joke. According to CBS, only 25 percent of the public have confidence in Mr. Bush's ability to make the right decisions about Social Security; 70 percent are ''uneasy.'' 
 The point is that people sense, correctly, that Mr. Bush doesn't understand their concerns. He was sold on privatization by people who have made their careers in the self-referential, corporate-sponsored world of conservative think tanks. And he himself has no personal experience with the risks that working families face. He's probably never imagined what it would be like to be destitute in his old age, with no guaranteed income. 
 The same syndrome has been visible on cultural issues. Republican leaders in Congress, who talk only to the religious right, were shocked at the public backlash over their meddling in the Schiavo case. Did I mention that Rick Santorum is 14 points behind his likely challenger? 
 It all makes you wonder how these people ever ended up running the country in the first place. But remember that in 2000, Mr. Bush pretended to be a moderate, and that in the next two elections he used the Iraq war as a wedge to divide and perplex the Democrats. 
 In that context, it's worth noting two more poll results: in one taken before the recent resurgence of violence in Iraq, and the administration's announcement that it needs yet another $80 billion, 53 percent of Americans said that the Iraq war wasn't worth it. And 50 percent say that ''the administration deliberately misled the public about whether Iraq has weapons of mass destruction.''
 Democracy Corps, the Democratic pollsters, say that there is a ''crisis of confidence in the Republican direction for the country.'' As they're careful to point out, this won't necessarily translate into a surge of support for Democrats. 
 But Americans are feeling a sense of dread: they're worried about a weak job market, soaring health care costs, rising oil prices and a war that seems to have no end. And they're starting to notice that nobody in power is even trying to deal with these problems, because the people in charge are too busy catering to a base that has other priorities.

HEADLINE: Fiscal Growth In Latin Lands Fails to Fill Social Needs

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: QUITO, Ecuador, April 24 

 BODY:
Last year, Ecuador's economy grew at an astounding 6.6 percent, its inflation rate was the lowest in 30 years, and foreign investment surged. Wall Street celebrated, with a New York-based analyst of Latin American economies, LatinSource, praising Ecuador for ''outperforming even the most optimistic scenarios.''
 But those rosy numbers did not translate into better lives for Ecuador's poor or political support for Lucio Gutierrez, who took power 28 months ago, was removed from power by Ecuador's Congress on Wednesday and left Sunday for asylum in Brazil. 
 Though his interference with the judiciary was ostensibly the reason for his fall, many Ecuadoreans had become deeply disillusioned with his government, saying little had changed despite promises of more jobs, better schools and health care. 
 At the shabby, 57-year-old Baca Ortiz public hospital in Quito, considered the country's leading children's hospital, patients have to bring their own medicine, and doctors say they lack clean facilities, decent living wages and even the most rudimentary equipment.
 ''The last thing the state cares about is education and health care,'' said Jose Acosta, a staff doctor. ''If the state doesn't provide medicine, doesn't provide funding, how are we supposed to provide good care?''
 The discontent over a lack of state attention to basic social needs, despite increasingly positive macro-economic figures, is being played out across Latin America. 
 Economic growth for the region hit 5.5 percent last year, the best in a generation, inflation is down, foreign reserves are growing, and credit ratings are solid. But the positive economic news has not translated into housing for the poor, more teachers, better hospitals or social peace. 
 After years of fiscal prudence, privatizations and other market reforms prescribed by Washington, unjobless and poverty rates have hardly budged. Poverty remains pervasive, engulfing 44 percent of the population.
 ''The growth rate is not always an accurate benchmark for a country's authentic prosperity,'' said Larry Birns, director of the Washington-based Council on Hemispheric Affairs, which tracks social and economic trends in Latin America. ''Expectations have risen, and they've risen faster than the growth rate.''
 The high price of oil and other commodities provided by these countries is fueling the solid economic growth across Latin America. Wall Street is particularly bullish about Peru, which has had strong long-term growth. The economy of Bolivia, one of the region's poorest countries, grew by nearly 4 percent last year, while Mexico topped 4 percent and Brazil, Latin America's largest economy, registered 5.2 percent growth.
 But Peru's president, Alejandro Toledo, remains the least popular leader in Latin America, and President Carlos Mesa in Bolivia has been battered by public protests. Vicente Fox's administration in Mexico is lacking popular support for its initiatives, and in Brazil many among the legions of poor believe they have been abandoned by President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who embraced policies of fiscal restraint despite his leftist credentials.
 The reasons for the lack of gains are myriad, from corruption to ineptitude to poorly organized social systems. But many experts also say fiscal restraints, coupled with large public debts, are a chokehold on governments like Mr. Gutierrez's. The public debt in many countries tops 40 percent of economic output.
 The cynicism among Latin Americans who feel shortchanged is palpable. Monica Patino, 44, and other parents at the 23 of May Elementary School in the poor southern part of Quito pool money to pay for blackboards, classroom benches, paint jobs and even the salaries of English and computer science teachers. Her son, Armando Estrella, 6, ''is beaten by a mile compared to a private school boy,'' she said, noting that the poorly paid teachers deal with 45 children in a classroom. ''It's totally a mess.'' 
 An exception is Venezuela, where a boom in oil has generated the region's highest growth -- 18 percent last year -- providing billions of dollars that President Hugo Chavez has used to solidify his popularity by directing it into social programs.
 The new government here, well aware of how Mr. Gutierrez was debilitated, is moving in another direction. The new president, Alfredo Palacio, 66, a cardiologist and former health minister, was Mr. Gutierrez's vice president but had long ago broken with the president over the government's fiscal restraints.
 Indeed, Mr. Gutierrez, who shifted from a critic of market reforms to a buttoned-down capitalist after he took office, had pledged to maintain fiscal discipline at all costs. He went so far as to cut subsidies for cooking fuel and food, enraging the poor.
 Mr. Palacio now offers a wholesale change. ''The country needs to invest in health, education, invest in the social,'' he told the Quito newspaper El Pais. ''The 6.6 percent growth that is hyped is a farce.''

HEADLINE: A Fragile Success in Africa

 BODY:
Teetering on the verge of success, but with failure always threatening to knock at the door, Ghana has lately taken up the mantle of what passes for a success story in Africa. It is the new darling in the halls where donors like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the United States and Britain talk about making sure foreign aid does not end up in the hands of corrupt regimes. 
 What they have in mind are people like Kofi Asare, who labors mightily on his modest farm high in the hills near his village SamSam, carrying his ripe yellow pineapples on his head to get them from the fields to his truck. Dripping with sweat, the 28-year-old Mr. Asare is the very picture of Africa getting its act together. Last year, he made $10,000; enough to make the transition from mud hut to cement house. This year, with an eye warily on the future, he has planted 2,500 of a new ''low acid'' pineapple pioneered by the Del Monte Foods Company that threatens to smoke the Ghana ''smooth cayenne'' variety out of Europe's supermarkets. 
 But Ghana is a good kid in a really bad neighborhood. Its West African neighbors, from Liberia to Sierra Leone to the Ivory Coast, have bred so much fighting in the last 10 years that they make Ghana seem like Iowa. Ghana does not have insurgents running around its hinterlands dressed in wedding gowns and wigs (like Liberia and Sierra Leone) or 8-year-old rebel soldiers toting machine guns (Liberia, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast). 
 It has had four successful elections since 1993, and has actually experienced a peaceful transfer of power between democratically elected governments, another rarity in the neighborhood. Indeed, it is becoming a haven for refugees who come not only from Ghana's unruly neighbors to the west, but also from other conflict zones in Africa. Last week, a group of refugees from Darfur, Sudan, showed up. It remains unclear how they made it across the continent, crossing the Togolese border from five countries away, but the Accra government is busy making plans to settle the Sudanese refugees.
 Ghanaians like to brag that they have passed the point of no return in making their humid patch of West Africa a functioning democracy with all the perks that brings: a free and vibrant press, steady though slow economic growth, tourism. There is even a shopping mall with a multiplex cinema going up in Accra. With such obvious payoffs for adopting good governance, many Ghanaians say it is inconceivable that the country will turn back to the failed-state practices that have taken so many other African countries down the drain. ''If anyone tried anything like a coup here, this place would immediately become ungovernable,'' says Kweku Sakyi Addo, the host of one of Ghana's innumerable political talk shows. ''We've seen what happens in other African countries. There is no way people will put up with that here.''
 But for all the talk of what a model African country Ghana is, it is still, literally, dirt poor, a fact of life that demonstrates just how removed Africa is from the proverbial rising tide of the global economy that is supposed to be lifting all boats. Ghana has a per capita income of $421 a year; most people survive here on $300 to $400. Ten-year-old girls still run barefoot up to stopped cars in the sweltering midday heat trying to sell anything they think will bring in money -- from oranges to cellphone batteries to toilet paper. Street children still sleep on the median separating highway lanes.
 And while the Ghanaian government appears to have a clear idea of exactly what steps it must take to try to alleviate the huge divide between Accra's growing middle class and the country's rural poor, some goals are already slipping. Child mortality rates, already high, increased in 2004; nobody seems to know why. A huge gender gap remains in primary-school education: far more boys make it to school than girls. 
 Almost half of Ghana's national budget comes from foreign aid; Britain is its largest single-country donor. But the size of the country's budget, a scant $3 billion, supporting some 20 million people, is testament to just how far Ghana still has to go, and just how much more it still needs to climb out of poverty. British Prime Minister Tony Blair's proposal for rich countries to drastically increase their aid to Africa in a Marshall Plan approach would be a huge step toward helping to bring the continent back into the folds of the rest of the world. 
 Ghana shows what a tough road this is going to be. But it also shows that bringing Africa back is eminently doable.

HEADLINE: Dreams, Hunches and 600-to-1 Keep the Numbers Game Going

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BRICK

 BODY:
New York City, so famous for tearing down and plastering over, has made a pastime of lamenting lost folkways. But where the Automat, trolleys and Ebbets Field disappeared, the numbers games remain.
 Twenty-five years after New York State started a legal version of these small-time tests of chance, the underground games survive, a pounding ventricle of New York neighborhood life run on a heady concoction of numerology and poverty, superstition and fate.
 The games' endurance, particularly in big East Coast cities, is no great mystery. The street pays better odds than the state, tax-free, and money speaks every language in the city. 
 There is a woman in Upper Manhattan who takes bets in the back of a dive, a union man in the elevator of a newspaper office. Countless young men keep the books by memory, moving money from bodegas to banks, pleasing their mothers with a job safer than running drugs. The music of the dance is the promise of a tiny windfall, enough to change life a bit for a short while, for the price of a lucky number.
 ''It flourishes,'' Daniel Castleman, chief of investigations in the Manhattan district attorney's office, said of the illegal numbers game. ''It gets ingrained in people who aren't looking for mega-millions. It's mostly a street game, and the numbers in aggregate can be fairly significant.'' While the big multistate games like Mega Millions, in which a Michigan ticket won $205 million on Friday, get most of the publicity, the illegal numbers quietly persist.
 There are estimates that the old-time numbers rackets took in $20 million a year, unadjusted for inflation, back in the 1920's. Their latter-day counterparts, like the Perez organization, which controlled 80 numbers spots in four boroughs but was dismantled last summer after a two-year investigation, generated $5 million a year in profits, according to the Bronx district attorney's office.
 But the police say that trying to gauge the total taken through the numbers is a fool's game.
 ''Who knows?'' said Lt. Ralph Garcia of the New York City Police Department's Vice Enforcement Unit. ''We may put a small dent in it. For every individual we apprehend, there's got to be 10 times that out there.''
 The basic structure of the games has been the same for generations. A player picks a number, usually three digits, and bets anywhere from a fistful of coins to $30 that the number will hit, meaning that it will be chosen as a winning number of the day.
 The chances of winning with a three-digit number are 1,000 to 1, and the payoff is usually 600 to 1, sometimes less. New York Numbers, the state-sponsored game, pays 500 to 1. 
 Methods for determining the winning numbers in the street game vary. Court and other records show that the Brooklyn Handle game gets its winning number from the total sum of money -- the handle -- bet during the day on all the races at a given horse track, with the last three digits of the handle being the hit. The game known as the 3-5-7 Old Way gets its first digit from the last digit of the total paid by the track on $2 bets to win, place and show for the day's first three races, its second digit from repeating the formula using the first five races and the last digit using the first seven races.
 The day's track is chosen by a service run by Italian organized crime families, whose first involvement in numbers rackets decades ago involved protection money, said Detective Terrence Donnelly of Vice Enforcement. ''If it was snowing, they might pick a track in Florida, or run dogs,'' he said. ''They determine where the number's coming from, so they're pretty important.'' 
 The incentive to hit is great. Six hundred-to-one is king for a night. Six hundred-to-one is buying rounds at the corner bar. Six hundred-to-one is not like the state lottery; it brings no tax lawyer, no TV cameras and no telephone calls from long-lost relatives.
 One way to place a numbers game bet is with a runner, a street-level operative who works a single block or a section of a neighborhood, collecting bets in the morning and making payouts after the hits are announced. Runners have to remember to put in bets for regular customers, and good runners write down as little as possible.
 ''People made a living on it; a number runner was respected,'' said Donald Semenza, 70, who grew up in the West Village. 
 Mr. Semenza used to play a quarter every day with his runner, Black Mike. When his number hit, it paid off $125 for Mr. Semenza and a $35 commission for Black Mike.
 Mr. Semenza's number, 7-2-1, which he played every day, came from the date he made his first bet: July 21, 1956.
 ''Something would happen,'' he recalled, ''somebody would get a job on January 14, and they'd say, 'Oh, I should have that number, 1-1-4.'''
 In neighborhoods without runners, bets are placed at spots. The police distinguish between hard spots and soft spots. Soft spots are beauty salons and grocery stores, places where you can record a bet on a slip of paper, talk with neighbors and pick up a beer.
 ''A bodega is a soft spot,'' said Detective Donnelly. ''A hard spot has a buzzer. You go down a hallway and it's set up like a bank or a check-cashing place, with two or three people behind the plexiglass taking bets.''
 At night, some hard spots turn into social clubs.
 ''The pool tables are set up,'' said Lieutenant Garcia. ''You might have a few gambling machines set up, slot machines, one-armed bandits.''
 To maintain relationships in a neighborhood, runners and operators of hard spots give out turkeys at Thanksgiving and trips to Atlantic City, Detective Donnelly said. And ethnicity helps seal neighborhood ties.
 ''You've got a Dominican lottery in Washington Heights, a Puerto Rican lottery, Midtown, everywhere,'' Detective Donnelly said. 
 The runners and spot operators take wagers to policy banks, like one the police raided in the Inwood section of Manhattan last July. At the banks, records of bets and payouts, carbon copy sheets known as the work, can be hidden in floorboards and other places in case of a raid.
 ''And they do protect themselves,'' Detective Donnelly said. ''We seized seven guns in one location.''
 Versions of the numbers games, called policy or bolita in some circles, have been documented in New Jersey, Philadelphia, Florida and Havana, mostly in urban areas where living quarters are close enough to make large betting pools and an easy flow of cash. 
 In New York, the police have been trying to shut down the numbers games for generations, at least when they were not helping to run them. Newspaper accounts from the 1880's chronicle an investigation by the (Theodore) Roosevelt Commission into a cabal of police commissioners and district attorneys paid to protect numbers operations on the Bowery and on Broadway. There were cycles of corruption and crackdowns, yet over the years control of the rackets shifted to blacks in Harlem and to Italian crime families.
 March 1972 was supposed to be the beginning of the end. The Fund for the City of New York proposed a legal version of the numbers games, to be run by a hybrid of the Tax Commission, which had overseen the state lottery since 1967, and the Off-Track Betting Corporation, founded in 1970 in part to loosen the Mafia's grip on horse betting. 
 On April 2, 1980, the authorized numbers game was born. Sales grew quickly, surpassing $600 million a year by 1990, but after that the growth rate slowed to single digits, and there were a few years when sales declined. In the last fiscal year, sales were $757.5 million, but the legal game never took over the way the city fathers had imagined.
 Raymond V. Casey, president of the New York City Off-Track Betting Corporation and a former executive director of the city's Gambling Control Commission, said that efforts to eradicate the games using legal alternatives were bound to fail. Legal games, he said, face certain competitive disadvantages. One is that they do not take 25-cent bets; the minimum is 50 cents.
 ''We don't let people bet on credit; we also report everything that happens if there's a taxable event,'' he said. In contrast, he said, the numbers rackets are ''very convenient.''
 ''And the guy who's taking the number in the luncheonette is a guy they've known for 20 years and is in the bar on Friday night,'' he said.
 Eugene Christiansen, a financial adviser to the casino gambling industry, had forgotten about the numbers games altogether until he went to a pub last year and saw a woman taking numbers at the back of the room.
 ''I had assumed that numbers had vanished, that it was an artifact,'' he said. ''Culture is durable. It was woven into the fabric of the city's life.''

HEADLINE: Serbia Acts on War Crimes To Strengthen Ties to West

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS WOOD

DATELINE: BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina, April 22 

 BODY:
On Oct. 22, 1999, the morning of his 45th birthday, Zelko Kopanja got into his car in this Bosnian Serb city and turned on the ignition, detonating a bomb. 
 Mr. Kopanja, editor of the newspaper Nezavisne Novine, contends that the bomb, which cost him both his legs, was planted by Serbia's security services to stop him from publishing articles detailing atrocities committed by Serbs against Muslims during Bosnia's civil war, from 1992 to 1995. A subsequent F.B.I. investigation supported his suspicions. 
 Six years after the bombing, though, he says he is witnessing a remarkable turn of events, with governments across the region seeking closer ties with the West by taking action against those his articles said were responsible for war crimes.
 In the last three months the Serbian government and the authorities in Bosnia's Serb Republic have transferred 11 Serbs accused of involvement in atrocities during the wars of the 1990's to the World Court in The Hague. Another suspect, Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, the commander of the Yugoslav Army during the 1999 conflict in Kosovo, is expected to be transferred to the court on Monday.
 ''Those who labeled me as a traitor and a spy today believe in my concept of life,'' said Mr. Kopanja, who now walks with prosthetic legs and crutches. ''They have become the biggest supporters of Nezavisne Novine.'' While he said he was not necessarily comfortable with the newfound support, he also said it indicated substantial change in the region.
 While many Serbs still regard the war crimes suspects as heroes, the readiness of their governments to surrender them to the court represents weakening nationalism across the region, diplomats and political analysts say. Diplomats say the change results from international pressure, including United States penalties and threats from Bosnia's international administrator to dismiss politicians who did not comply.
 But politicians here also say they have little choice but to seek membership in the European Union and NATO to help flagging economies.
 The benefits of membership to Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia have become more evident as their former Communist bloc neighbors Bulgaria and Romania have moved within two years of possible membership and have grown substantially. 
 ''We need a proper vision for the future, and right now we can find that in the European vision,'' said Serbia's agriculture minister, Ivana Dulic-Markova, a member of the G17 Plus change-oriented party. 
 Serbia has become the last of the former Yugoslav states embroiled in the wars of the 1990's to drop its opposition to the World Court. Croatia transferred eight suspects to the court in 2004. Bosnia's Serb Republic began to comply late last year, and Serbia stepped up its hitherto lackluster cooperation in February.
 Serbia has begun to arrest war crimes suspects, albeit declaring they have surrendered ''voluntarily,'' the deputy prime minister, Miroljub Labus, said. Previously, they left it up to those sought on war crimes charges to decide whether to surrender. ''We decided to make it or break it,'' Mr. Labus said recently. He said that G17 Plus, which is also his party, had threatened to quit Serbia's minority government unless it changed its policy and tried to forge closer ties with the European Union.
 Serbia's bid for European Union membership had been blocked over its lack of cooperation with the court.
 On April 12, the European Commission, the European Union's executive branch, rewarded Serbia for its policy shift with a recommendation for talks on a Stabilization and Association Agreement, a first step toward membership. European foreign ministers are expected to approve that decision on Monday if General Pavkovic surrenders.
 Full membership is unlikely, however, until Serbia turns over the tribunal's two most-wanted suspects, Ratko Mladic, the former commander of the Bosnian Serb Army, and Radovan Karadzic, the former leader of the Bosnian Serb government.
 Conservatives, including Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, have long contended that it would be hard for Serbia to cooperate with the tribunal because of the strength of the highly nationalistic Serbian Radical Party, which has the largest number of seats in Parliament of any party. Nationalist parties emerged as the strongest in elections in neighboring Bosnia and Croatia in 2003. 
 But people seem to be realizing that nationalism will not bring them prosperity, analysts say. ''The environment is different to what it used to be,'' Mr. Kopanja said.
 ''Karadzic and Mladic are less and less the heroes, and more and more of a burden to people psychologically and economically,'' he said.
 Bogdan Ivanisevic, the director of Human Rights Watch in Serbia Montenegro and Bosnia, said, ''The public has become more and more aware of the E.U. component in cooperation with The Hague.''
 Nationalism remains a vocal element of Serbian political life. Ms. Dulic-Markova was condemned after she said Serbia had squandered time in the 1990's in wars with its neighbors instead of undertaking major economic changes. 
 The government still calls the arrests of war crimes suspects ''surrenders,'' which human rights groups say shows it is still ideologically opposed to the court's mission. 
 ''Absolutely nothing in how the government is cooperating with The Hague tribunal would affect the way a person in the street thinks about war crimes,'' Mr. Ivanisevic said. Serbia's decision to cooperate with the tribunal, like Croatia's and Bosnia's Serb Republic before it, was a pragmatic one, he said, and while public opinion might be shifting, politicians were not yet ready to examine their country's past.


CORRECTION-DATE: April 28, 2005

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about a new willingness by Serbia and other countries in the region to turn over those accused of war crimes for international prosecution misidentified the court at The Hague that tries such cases. It is the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, not the World Court.

HEADLINE: Transit News Is a Click Away, and About 5 Years Behind Schedule 

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
The good news for commuters is that a new, publicly financed Web site established this month offers up-to-date information on highway, traffic and transit conditions in the New York City region.
 But the road to the site's creation has been long and circuitous.
 Originating with a $10.4 million federal grant, the site -- trips123.com -- is a cooperative effort by 16 regional agencies, including two transportation giants: the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. 
 The site was supposed to be operational by 1999, and it is supposed to eventually raise money to support the member agencies. Because of administrative delays and the financial collapse of a subcontractor during the dot-com bust, however, the project is nearly five years behind schedule and has made no money. 
 Adding to the complexity facing the taxpayer-financed project, a similar Web site -- hopstop.com -- was established last fall, although it has information only on city subways and buses. 
 Trips123 is a creation of Transcom, an entity the Port Authority created in the mid-1980's to coordinate the timing and location of highway construction projects in the hope of easing congestion.
 Transcom, which became an independent nonprofit organization in 2000, specializes in ''intelligent transportation systems'': the use of computers, telecommunications and broadcast signals to move vehicles and people more efficiently. 
 Trips123, which to date has cost about $20 million, was formally established April 6, though it has operated since October. The site, which is still being developed, covers 14 counties in New Jersey, 12 in New York and 3 in Connecticut.
 It has two free features. One is a traveler information center fed by constant updates from highway and transit agencies. 
 Users can zoom in on maps of any part of the region. Congestion is denoted by color: green for normal, yellow for moderate, orange for heavy. A red road means drivers should expect delays. Icons warn motorists of possible trouble: a red X for a traffic incident, a yellow triangle for a construction site and a purple star for sports or a special event.
 The other free feature, TransitAdvisor, allows users to plan trips using a combination of subways, buses, commuter railroads and ferries. The program suggests the quickest way to get between two points, using an algorithm that takes into account transit schedules and walking times.
 Eventually, the site will offer a subscription-based feature. For $5.95 a month, commuters will be notified about delays or disruptions in their normal daily routes. The customized notices will be sent by telephone, cellphone, pager, fax or e-mail message.
 But Joseph M. Sussman, a leading proponent of the integration of technology and transportation, questioned whether money could made off the Web site, as its creators hope. 
 ''The market really hasn't established that people are willing to pony up their own personal resources for these services, even modest amounts,'' said Dr. Sussman, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
 Officials at Transcom, which is an abbreviation for the Transportation Operations Coordinating Committee, acknowledged that the Web site had taken far longer to develop than anyone had imagined and that the potential for raising money remained to be seen. 
 ''This is a 16-agency cooperative effort,'' said Matthew L. Edelman, the executive director. ''We have no authority, and this coalition works because we have no authority. Things need to be approved cooperatively and implemented cooperatively.'' 
 The history of the project, however, shows that bad luck may have had as much to do with the delay as any lack of cooperation.
 In January 1997, the Federal Highway Administration gave grants to four metropolitan areas -- New York City, Phoenix, San Antonio and Seattle -- to develop models for managing transportation through technology.
 After talks with one prospective contractor fell through, Transcom hired two firms to design the effort: PB Farradyne, a unit of the engineering firm Parsons Brinckerhoff, and TransCore, which specializes in toll collection. 
 Construction began in May 1999 and was to be completed the next year. Then, after months of delays and disagreements over the project's requirements, a subcontractor, a Los Angeles firm called TrafficStation, suddenly shut its doors and stopped returning calls, according to Robert H. Bamford, the project manager for Trips123. 
 The founder of TrafficStation, Geoffrey S. Halstead, attributed the difficulties to unwieldy and cumbersome data provided by Transcom. 
 Legal wrangling continued until 2001. It took Transcom until January 2003 to award a new contract to do the development work, Mr. Bamford said. He attributed the delay to contracting requirements imposed by the New York State Department of Transportation, which administered the federal grants. 
 Meanwhile, Transcom could not even settle on a name for the site. Its first choice, iTravel, was already taken. Even the logo for Trips123 -- a curved arrow, broken into three segments representing three states -- had to be vetted by all the agencies, which include the Transportation Departments of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. 
 Even as Transcom struggled with the project, a similar site was being formed. 
 In November, a Manhattan entrepreneur, Chinedu U. Echeruo, established Hopstop, which allows users to plan travel itineraries based on New York City subway and bus schedules. 
 Mr. Echeruo, 32, who was born in Nigeria and graduated from Harvard Business School in 2000, said he created the site to solve a problem he encountered when he moved to New York. ''The frustration of finding directions in the city is something most New Yorkers experience every day,'' he said. 
 While Hopstop seems more user-friendly than Trips123, it is far more limited in scope. Mr. Echeruo said he hoped to incorporate commuter railroads soon. The site is free but has some advertising. 
 It is difficult to tell which site is doing better. On Thursday, Trips123 recorded 88,000 page views and 125,000 hits, according to Mr. Bamford. On Friday, Hopstop had 47,718 page views and 171,577 hits, Mr. Echeruo said. 
 Officials at Transcom said they did not think Hopstop was a threat to Trips123. They noted that only their site directly received information from transit agencies like the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, although most of the authority's schedules and routes are available on its own site, at mta.info.
 Mr. Edelman, who oversees a $4 million budget and nearly 35 employees, conceded that getting the site up had been a long and difficult process.
 In an interview at Transcom's office in Jersey City, he focused on the organization's successes. Coordination of road repair projects, he said, is vastly better than it was 20 years ago. Transcom's annual March meeting, where agencies gather to compare their construction calendars, has become a tradition.
 Inside the organization's 24-hour control center, which overlooks the Hudson River, workers are constantly gathering information about traffic and transit conditions. They send information about highway incidents to all affected agencies, from the state police to various turnpike and thruway authorities.
 The organization maintains eight servers and 50 workstations, many of which are housed with the member agencies, which use the computers to enter data. Transcom also uses video networking, highway message signs, radio signals and special readers that use a car's E-ZPass, the toll-payment device, to detect its speed. 
 Louis J. Gambaccini, a former New Jersey transportation commissioner who was Transcom's first chairman, said he had not visited the Web site but felt confident that the group had made a significant impact. The need for information and coordination has never been greater, he said. 
 ''Probably the single most significant event that drove me to set up Transcom was being trapped in traffic that easily could have been avoided with proper knowledge, signage and information about detours,'' he said.

HEADLINE: West Street Is a Scar

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Assemblywoman Deborah J. Glick (letter, April 12) claims that ''residents of Lower Manhattan have vociferously objected'' to the proposed West Street tunnel. 
 I live in Lower Manhattan, two blocks from the World Trade Center site and West Street. I support the proposal to bury West Street, and for exactly the reasons Ms. Glick suggests that residents are opposed -- because the area is residential and not just an economic center. 
 West Street runs like a scar through Lower Manhattan, cutting off the increasingly residential areas around Greenwich, Washington and John Streets from the Hudson River waterfront and its parks. 
 Nothing would help the residential nature of Lower Manhattan more than burying West Street.

HEADLINE: Small Increase in Full-Year Profit Is Expected at Nissan

BYLINE: By TODD ZAUN

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 24 

 BODY:
The Nissan Motor Company will post a small increase on Monday in its net profit for the recent fiscal year, a result of big gains in the sales of its vehicles in the United States and China, company officials said Sunday. 
 Nissan's income rose 1.7 percent, to a record 512.3 billion yen ($4.8 billion) in the year ended March 31, from 503.7 billion yen a year earlier. The company cited strong sales of its luxury Infiniti sedans and an expanded line of light trucks. The results were slightly above Nissan's forecast for a profit of 510 billion yen. 
 Nissan, Japan's second-largest carmaker after Toyota, had an operating profit of 861.2 billion yen, up 4.4 percent -- giving it, the company said, an operating profit margin of 10 percent. It said it expected this figure to be the highest in the industry for a second year. 
 Nissan's profit growth was in contrast to the recent performance of American rivals, especially General Motors, which reported a $1.1 billion first-quarter loss last week. 
 Revenue at Nissan increased more than 15 percent in the fiscal year, to 8.58 trillion yen from 7.43 trillion yen a year earlier, as its unit sales worldwide increased 11 percent, to 3.39 million vehicles. Much of the growth was in the United States, Nissan's biggest market, where it sold 1.01 million vehicles, up 11 percent from the previous year. Sales of the Altima and Infiniti G35 sedans were strong, and Nissan offered an expanded line of trucks, including the Titan pickup. 
 The rates of increase in Nissan's profit and sales last year were almost identical to those a year earlier, suggesting that the company had settled into a period of steady growth. The gains were less spectacular than those several years earlier, when a team of managers dispatched from Nissan's top shareholder, Renault of France, extracted Nissan from near-bankruptcy and turned it into an industry leader. 
 For the new fiscal year, Nissan forecast a net profit of 517 billion yen, up just under 1 percent from the year ended in March. 
 The positive results came as the chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, outlined his third three-year plan since taking over at Nissan in 1999. Like the previous plan, this one included an ambitious growth target as well as a goal for Nissan to be the most profitable major automaker as measured by the ratio of operating profit to revenue.
 The company reiterated a goal to expand global sales to 4.2 million vehicles by March 2008, nearly a quarter more than it sold in the year just ended. 
 ''We're cruising now at a very high speed,'' Mr. Ghosn said.
 Nissan faces challenges. Some, like the possibilities of higher steel and oil prices and rising interest rates, are common to all carmakers. But Nissan has a new challenge of its own -- the greatly expanded duties of its chief executive. Mr. Ghosn has become a star of the auto industry for reviving Nissan with a stringent cost-cutting program and a new emphasis on vehicle design. Later this month, he will begin splitting his time between Nissan and Renault, where he is also taking on the role of chief executive. 
 Mr. Ghosn said he planned to spend about 70 percent of his time at Renault and 30 percent at Nissan here, and insisted that he would be able to manage the double duty by leaving a larger share of day-to-day decision-making at Nissan to deputies. ''Both companies are adjusting very well,'' he said. ''I don't think we'll have any problems.''

HEADLINE: Europe May Impose Limits On Chinese Textile Imports

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, April 24 

 BODY:
The European Union's top trade official, Peter Mandelson, said on Sunday that he would open a formal, two-month investigation of the flood of Chinese textiles into European markets.
 He also warned of possible sanctions by summer and swifter measures that could allow Europe to impose limits on a range of Chinese-made items, like T-shirts and brassieres, within weeks. ''Europe cannot stand by and watch its industry disappear,'' Mr. Mandelson said at a news conference. 
 Mr. Mandelson cited a 534 percent rise in sweater imports and a 413 percent rise in imports of men's trousers during the first three months of 2005, compared with a year earlier, as examples of why the inquiry was necessary.
 The European Commission will examine evidence of surging imports in nine product categories, including blouses, women's overcoats, and flax and yarn products. 
 The investigation comes as French and Italian clothing manufacturers, in particular, are pressuring Mr. Mandelson to limit imports from China, where rivals are making huge gains after an end to global quotas.
 But getting tough with China -- Europe's second-biggest trading partner after the United States -- is a delicate matter.
 While irked by China's low-cost clothing exports, European officials are mindful of keeping good relations to smooth the way for sales of lucrative Western technologies like nuclear power stations, high-speed trains and aerospace equipment as the Chinese economy booms.
 Mr. Mandelson emphasized Sunday that Europe's choice to move forward with an investigation should not sour commercial relations with Beijing. 
 The move ''is not a threat to China's textile interests and it is not an attempt to block China's rising position in the international trading system,'' he said. 
 ''Nothing I do or say is going to jeopardize or imperil China's international trading position or that vitally important trading relationship between China and Europe.''
 Mr. Mandelson said he expected to continue discussions -- already under way for several weeks -- with Chinese officials during a visit to Hong Kong and Southeast Asia in coming days, but he declined to give details.
 Mr. Mandelson said that above all, he wanted to avoid a trade war with China even as calls from some European politicians grew louder to impose immediate measures to prevent job losses in Europe.
 ''We're talking about people's livelihoods, we're talking about their jobs and their businesses,'' he said, while adding that the revamping of some European industries was necessary to keep Europe competitive in global markets.
 Before imposing sanctions, investigators must establish that harm has been done to European manufacturers. 
 Penalties could involve freezing imports at current levels and capping growth at 7.5 percent a year, a measure foreseen under China's accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001.
 But rather than punitive steps, Mr. Mandelson said he wanted China to step up its own limits on exports to relieve the need for Europe to impose measures that could be used to restrict Chinese products but that might also pose a risk to harmonious relations.

HEADLINE: White House May Go to U.N. Over North Korean Shipments

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 24 

 BODY:
The Bush administration, facing a series of recent provocations from North Korea, is debating a plan to seek a United Nations resolution empowering all nations to intercept shipments in or out of the country that may contain nuclear materials or components, say senior administration officials and diplomats who have been briefed on the proposal.
 The resolution envisioned by a growing number of senior administration officials would amount to a quarantine of North Korea, though, so far at least, President Bush's aides are not using that word. It would enable the United States and other nations to intercept shipments in international waters off the Korean Peninsula and to force down aircraft for inspection.
 But, said several American and Asian officials, the main purpose would be to give China political cover to police its border with North Korea, the country's lifeline for food and oil. That border is now largely open for shipments of arms, drugs and counterfeit currencies, North Korea's main source of hard currency. 
 Two years of six-nation negotiations with North Korea have proved fruitless so far. It is uncertain, however, that China and South Korea would go along with any plan to step up pressure. To ward off a confrontation with the North, the two nations have opposed taking the issue to the United Nations Security Council. 
 Until last week, the administration insisted it was committed to solving the North Korean crisis through six-nation negotiations. But the discovery this month that North Korea has shut down its main nuclear reactor -- perhaps to harvest plutonium for more weapons -- prompted Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to raise publicly the possibility of seeking United Nations action, a route the Clinton administration took in 1994.
 ''We are willing -- when the time is right, when we believe that we have exhausted the possibilities of the framework we are in -- to go to the Security Council,'' Ms. Rice said on Thursday on Fox News.
 But the administration has never said publicly what it would seek from the United Nations. Though Ms. Rice made no mention of it, American intelligence agencies were also trying to decipher the meaning of renewed activity at a suspected North Korean nuclear test site.
 Activity at the site in October and again in January led to concerns that North Korea may be preparing for the first underground weapons test -- which would end any ambiguity about whether it has the technology to build a warhead.
 [In Seoul on Monday, South Korea's foreign minister, Ban Ki Moon, warned North Korea against conducting any nuclear tests, saying they would further isolate it, The Associated Press reported.]
 ''They are either heading toward a full nuclear breakout, so that we are forced to deal with them as an established nuclear power, or they are putting on quite a show for our satellites,'' said one senior administration official, who added that the quarantine option had not yet been formally presented to President Bush.
 The White House has said little so far about North Korea's actions, following a strategy very different from the one it pursued two years ago with Iraq. Ms. Rice has repeatedly said that North Korea's pattern is to seek a public reaction from Washington, and she has made clear she does not intend to oblige.
 But some experts say the statements and actions North Korea have taken recently could mark a significant shift in strategy: It may now see a chance to build a modest nuclear arsenal while the United States and Asian nations debate how to react. The C.I.A. estimates that North Korea already has enough plutonium for six or eight nuclear weapons.
 ''I'm afraid they are now more interested in getting away with it than getting a reaction out of the United States,'' South Korea's former foreign minister, Han Sung Joo, said in an interview last week. 
 Since February, when it declared itself a nuclear power, North Korea's public statements have changed. It appears to be attempting to establish itself as a nuclear power that, like Pakistan, is now considered a permanent member of the nuclear club.
 North Korea's No. 2 official, Kim Yong Nam, said on Friday that America so threatens North Korea ''it stands to reason'' for it ''to equip itself with a nuclear deterrent as a legitimate self-defensive means.'' 
 On Sunday, North Korea's army chief of staff, General Kim Yong Chun, opened a meeting of military officers with a warning that the country's nuclear program would speed ahead. North Korea often issues strident warnings, many of which Washington dismisses. But the combination of the statements and the satellite imagery have put the White House and Pentagon on edge.
 Administration officials said that even if they go to the United Nations, the White House would not abandon the six-nation talks, which also include Japan, South Korea, Russia and China. They said a resolution could take several forms, including additional political and economic sanctions, all of which North Korea says it would regard as an act of war.
 But the idea of a quarantine has attracted the most interest, especially among administration hawks who never liked the idea of negotiations with North Korea. The quarantine idea has been pressed by the Pentagon and members of Vice President Dick Cheney's staff. 
 If approved, several officials said, it would be loosely modeled on the one President John F. Kennedy ordered against Cuba four decades ago. But in North Korea's case, the operation would be far more complicated -- both because of the weapons that the North may already possess, and because the entire effort will fail if China is not a full partner.

HEADLINE: As Saudi Visits, Bush Seeks Help on Lowering Oil Prices

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and JEFF GERTH; Richard W. Stevenson reported from Crawford for this article, and Jeff Gerth from Washington.

DATELINE: CRAWFORD, Texas, April 24 

 BODY:
When he meets at his ranch here on Monday with Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, President Bush will confront one of his trickiest diplomatic relationships. He will look for help on oil prices, try to find common ground on the Arab-Israeli conflict and prod the crown prince to allow more democracy at home , even as both sides struggle with deep strains set off by the involvement of Saudis in the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, American officials and analysts said.
 Three years after the two leaders held a tense meeting here, American officials and analysts say the atmosphere has improved. But Mr. Bush remains under pressure from members of both parties in Congress to take a hard line with the Saudis when it comes to terrorism and Israel, they said, while the Saudis remain resentful that they do not get more credit for what they see as intensive efforts to be helpful and responsive to the United States. 
 American officials give the Saudis some credit for stepping up their efforts to combat terrorism within their borders and to stop the flow of money from Saudis to terrorist groups. They said Saudi Arabia was also helpful in recent months in pressuring Syria to begin withdrawing from Lebanon.
 At the same time, the Saudis have been heartened by Mr. Bush's stepped-up involvement in seeking peace between the Palestinians and Israelis, analysts said. Now Mr. Bush will be seeking help from the Saudis to help bring down crude oil and gasoline prices, which are taking a toll both on the economy and on Mr. Bush's approval ratings.
 ''Since the Sept. 11 attacks, you've had this growing chorus of anti-Saudi voices in the United States, and not from the fringes,'' said Flynt L. Leverett, a senior fellow at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution and former senior director at the National Security Council under Mr. Bush. ''From the Saudi point of view, this administration, while not joining the anti-Saudi perspective, has not done much to quiet it. But now that Bush has been re-elected, they're in a sense willing to give the administration another shot at improving the quality of the relationship.'' 
 Their meeting is unlikely to result in any big breakthroughs. When it comes to oil, the Saudis have less ability to drive down global prices by increasing output than at many times in the past, because they are already pumping closer to their maximum sustainable capacity than during past price spikes. 
 But in part because of the growing domestic political pressure on Mr. Bush to show that he is doing everything possible to help bring down crude oil and gasoline prices, oil issues will play a more prominent role at this meeting than at the previous one here, in 2002.
 ''This is a new ballgame,'' said Robert W. Jordan, a former United States ambassador to Saudi Arabia. He said he expected Mr. Bush ''to make a pitch to Saudi Arabia to expand production.'' 
 When the two leaders last met at the Bush ranch, the average price of a gallon of regular unleaded gas was $1.41, according to the American Automobile Association. The price is now about 50 percent higher. 
 Over the same period, global demand for oil has risen sharply, fueled by consumers in China and India. In 2002, Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company, says it produced 6.8 million barrels of oil per day. The Saudis are now estimated to produce about 9.5 million barrels a day.
 As demand and production have increased, the Saudis have been left with less spare production capacity to smooth out price spikes. Three years ago it was about three million barrels a day, according to Saudi Aramco. Today ''the cushion is very, very small,'' about 1.2 million barrels, according to Nawaf Obaid, an oil and security consultant. 
 The drop in Saudi spare capacity is a major reason why the Saudis are less able to influence the price of oil today, according to Mr. Jordan and Mr. Obaid.
 The Saudis have announced new development plans. Their aim is to offset declines in older fields and to increase overall capacity to 12.5 million barrels.
 Refineries are operating at more than 90 percent of total capacity in the United States. Still, gasoline prices have not risen as fast as crude oil prices in the last three years. Crude oil traded at $26.36 the day of the 2002 summit meeting, about half the current price.
 Meanwhile, the Saudis have shifted away from their historical dependence on American oil giants, who once controlled Aramco. Six months after the 2002 meeting here, the crown prince complained in a private meeting with American diplomats that the American companies were being too greedy in their negotiations over a plan to give foreign investors access to some of Saudi Arabia's natural gas resources, American and Saudi officials said.
 In relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia, much rides on personal relationships because the diplomacy tends to be conducted at the highest levels. Vice President Dick Cheney met Sunday in Dallas with the crown prince and will be at the Bush ranch on Monday, as will other top officials, including Fran Townsend, the White House's homeland security adviser, who has often been an envoy to the Saudis on terrorism and security issues.
 Analysts said the Saudis remained suspicious about Mr. Bush's intentions when it comes to a final agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians. They said the Saudis were concerned about a number of developments in the Middle East, including the growing Shiite influence in the region, especially in Iraq, where the continued instability is a worry to the Saudis. Saudi Arabia's religious establishment is dominated by the Wahhabi branch of Sunni Islam.
 Members of both parties in Congress are pressing Mr. Bush to do more to compel the Saudi leadership to crack down on clerics who are inciting anti-American and anti-Western feeling within Saudi Arabia, and to take more concrete steps to ensure that money given to charity in Saudi Arabia is not making its way to terrorist groups. 
 ''The alliance between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia in terms of fighting terrorism is still a work in progress,'' said Representative Sue Kelly, Republican of New York, who met recently with Abdullah in Riyadh.

HEADLINE: Miller Unloads, And Silences Fans in Boston

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK

DATELINE: BOSTON, April 25 

 BODY:
In a bleak moment near the tail end of an often-bleak season, Reggie Miller looked up at a 7-point deficit and listened to the taunts rain down from 18,624 exuberant Celtics fans.
 After the roars came the mocking ''Reggie'' chants, and for another brief snippet of time, the Indiana Pacers were the picture of despair. But that plot has been replayed many times this season, and the ending has usually been the same.
 After every near-death experience, a rebirth. 
 But the Pacers never tire of this script, Miller never tires of silencing the braying masses, and the final taunt on Monday was his. He scored 28 points, including a 17-foot leaner down the stretch to secure an 82-79 victory over the Boston Celtics and tie their first-round playoff series at 1-1.
 In retrospect, the ''Reggie'' chants and the yapping at Miller by the rookie guard Tony Allen look like ill-conceived ideas.
 ''When I played against him, I never said anything to Reggie,'' said Miller's teammate Stephen Jackson. ''Because once you upset him or 'P' him off, he's going to wake up and get like five straight 3's. I was kind of glad that they started going at Reg, because that woke him up.''
 So the Pacers, the team that a brawl, suspensions and injuries could not tear asunder, the team that limped into the playoffs seeded sixth, now have home-court advantage and the next two games at home. Game 3 is Thursday at Conseco Fieldhouse.
 Boston's 20-point rout in Game 1 left an impression on the Pacers and raised the possibility of a quick and final exit for Miller, who is retiring after the season. Indiana looked tired on Saturday night, with Jermaine O'Neal rubbing his injured right shoulder and the Celtics pushing the tempo to a furious pace.
 This time, the game was played more to the Pacers' strengths -- more halfcourt activity, more defense and fewer chances for the Celtics to run.
 Paul Pierce rebounded from a quiet Game 1 to score 33 points, and Antoine Walker added 19. But Walker missed two point-blank shots in the final minutes, Pierce missed a free throw and, on the Celtics' final possession, Pierce missed a 3-pointer.
 Boston shot just 38.8 percent from the field and its young bench, which had provided a spark two nights earlier, instead looked its age. Coach Doc Rivers, who has spent much time preaching ball movement, bemoaned too much isolation play.
 ''We went back a little bit to who we were in the past,'' Rivers said. ''I thought each guy came out tonight and tried to do it themselves.''
 O'Neal is still struggling, but he put up 13 points and blocked 3 shots. Jackson provided the rest of the scoring, with 20 points.
 But the night belonged to Miller, who at 39 is still in pursuit of his first championship ring. It became a classic Miller game, with 3-pointers and timely shots and one of those trademark flailing leg-kicks to draw a foul on Ricky Davis.
 Rivers howled over the call, which came in front of the Celtics bench late in the third quarter.
 ''I'm amazed people haven't learned that's not a foul,'' Rivers said.
 Boston led by 75-68 midway through the fourth quarter. Indiana chipped away at the lead, getting a driving dunk from Jackson, a layup and two free throws from O'Neal, a turnaround jumper from Anthony Johnson and finally a flying dunk along the baseline from Jackson to tie the score at 78-78.
 Johnson's driving layup and Miller's final leaner put the game away, and left the Pacers chuckling over the imprudent actions of the Celtics and their fans.
 ''Sometimes, you just let sleeping dogs lie,'' Miller said, referring to Allen's trash talking.
 For his part, Miller said he does not talk much anymore, but he did have the final word on Monday when he considered the crowd's taunts.
 ''Truthfully, I've heard a lot worse, in Philly and in New York,'' he said. ''So this is child's play, what I was hearing tonight.''

REBOUNDS
 Four N.B.A. teams would train and play preseason games in Europe to start the 2006-7 season under a plan being considered by Commissioner David Stern. The effort would also involve the EuroLeague, Stern told reporters before Monday's playoff game between Boston and Indiana. Negotiations have been slow on a new labor deal, despite regular meetings between league officials and the players union the last two months. ''We're trying to be optimistic,'' the deputy commissioner Russ Granik said. The N.B.A. still hopes to put a new age limit into the deal, but the primary sticking points are all economic, said Granik, who added, ''What's separating us shouldn't be the cause for any calamity in our business.'' Stern wants to keep players from entering the league before age 20, a rule the union has resisted. A possible compromise could be a 19-year-old limit. ''I think there's a chance that we'll get something where a player doesn't come right out of high school into the N.B.A.,'' Granik said.

HEADLINE: Existing-Home Sales in U.S. Rose 1% in March

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 25 

 BODY:
Sales of existing homes in the United States rose 1 percent in March to the third-highest level on record as an increase in single-family sales offset a drop in sales of condominiums, a trade group said Monday.
 Sales of previously owned homes rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.89 million units last month, the National Association of Realtors said. 
That figure includes both single-family homes and condominiums.
 Sales of single-family homes increased 1.2 percent in March, to a rate of 6.04 million units, from a rate of 5.97 million in February. Condo sales fell 0.1 percent, to a rate of 845,000 units, from an 846,000 rate in February. Analysts had expected overall sales to climb to a rate of 6.80 million units.
 The national median home price jumped 11.4 percent, to $195,000, from the same month a year ago, the report showed. That price increase was the biggest since December 1980, when prices rose 11.5 percent, the report said.
 ''The market is very strong,'' said David A. Lereah, chief economist for the association group. ''The problem in this country is housing supply. It's still very lean.''
 In March, the supply of homes for sale at the current pace was 4 months' worth, down from 4.2 months' worth in February.
 ''We still have this awkward balance between demand and supply,'' Mr. Lereah said.
 Home sales have been helped by low mortgage rates for more than a year, but some analysts say the housing sector has begun to show signs of easing. Last week, a Commerce Department report showed a 17.6 percent plunge in housing starts for March.
 The national average long-term fixed mortgage rate was 5.93 percent in March, up from 5.63 percent the month before, according to Freddie Mac.

 BODY:

A TIGHTER REBOOKING DEADLINE -- Northwest Airlines has shortened the deadline for rebooking unused nonrefundable tickets to 90 days after a missed flight, from 365 days. ''The ticket can still be used for a year, it's just that the actual change has to be made within 90 days,'' said Kurt Ebenhoch, a Northwest spokesman. The new policy, which he said was adopted for better inventory control, applies to all tickets issued on or after April 15. Terry Trippler, the chief executive of Farefacts.com, a travel adviser based in Minneapolis, said, ''It's a big change.'' As of yesterday, he said, no other airline had followed Northwest's lead. Typically, major airlines allow passengers who cancel an original flight on a nonrefundable ticket to rebook the ticket anytime within a year for a $100 change fee. Over the last five years, business travelers have been rebelling against high walk-up fares by switching to the nonrefundable tickets favored by tourists. Because business travelers change their plans so often, many corporate travel managers use procedures, like American Express's TicketTrax service, to keep track of unused tickets and flag them for rebooking.

EUROPE'S LURE -- Despite a weak dollar, trans-Atlantic air traffic grew in March for the 21st consecutive month, according to Donald N. Martin & Company, a travel marketing specialist based in New York. For all of 2004, travel to Europe (including the Russian Federation) originating in the United States rose to 12.1 million trips, an increase of 12.4 percent over 2003, the company said, citing data from the United States Commerce Department. In 2005, industry analysts say, the volume of travel by Americans to Europe is expected to match or surpass the record of 12.8 million trips in 2000. Economy-class trans-Atlantic fares are expected to remain at last summer's levels, even though domestic carriers have been adding trans-Atlantic capacity, said Hugo Burge, the president of Cheapflights.com, an online fare broker. Premium cabin seats, however, are being discounted, Mr. Burge said. Airlines are sharply cutting fares in business class on trans-Atlantic routes, too, he said.

HANGING UP -- The revenue that hotels derive from guest room telephones fell last year to an average of $2 a day per occupied room, compared with $4.10 in 2000, according to the Hospitality Research Group of PKF Consulting, which is based in San Francisco. The reasons are fairly obvious, said Robert Mandelbaum, the director of research information services: increased use of cellphones and calling cards as well as a reaction against surcharges on telephone calls. While hotel managers struggle to adapt to and even profit from new portable communications technologies, room phones and fax machines could go the way of the in-room fly swatter, Mr. Mandelbaum said.

CHEAPER BY THE MILE -- As competition over fares remained fierce, the revenue airlines squeezed out of travelers for each mile flown fell 6.7 percent on domestic routes in the first quarter for eight major airlines, the Air Transport Association said. Most international routes fared better. Yields rose 2.7 percent on Atlantic routes and 3.7 percent on Pacific routes, while falling 4.4 percent on Latin American routes for the eight airlines surveyed: Alaska; American, America West, Continental, Delta, Northwest, United and US Airways.

HEADLINE: Prospect of a Mine Near a Salmon Fishery Stirs Worry in Alaska

BYLINE: By LISA W. DREW

DATELINE: NEWHALEN, Alaska 

 BODY:
The Bristol Bay watershed, an intricate system of lakes, streams and rivers that are home to some of the world's greatest salmon runs, is remarkably unchanged by human activity. 
 With only sparse trees, it has not been logged. There are no significant dams and few roads. The only way to get here is by air or boat. ''So it's not quite as God made it, but pretty close,'' said Dr. Thomas Quinn, a fish biologist at the University of Washington who has studied the region for almost 20 years. 
 But Bristol Bay is also an economically depressed region that is home to rich mineral deposits. And prospectors are spending tens of millions of dollars on plans for mining operations across the headwaters of the salmon fishery, which could change the region forever. 
 First in line is Northern Dynasty Mines Inc., an American subsidiary of a Canadian mineral company, which is working on feasibility studies for an open-pit gold and copper mine, called Pebble, that could generate jobs for the depressed region. 
 The scale of the proposed mining is vast. The Pebble mine alone would cost $1.5 billion, the company estimates, and would tap the largest gold deposit and the second largest copper deposit in North America. The mine also contains molybdenum, often used to strengthen and harden steel. 
 The open pit would cover 2 square miles, and the whole complex, including a tailings pond that may hold billions of tons, would cover 14 square miles, more than 10 times as large as Central Park. 
 But many environmentalists and local residents worry that the mining would be a disaster for the salmon fishery, on which much of the economy and ecosystem depend.
 While commercial salmon fishing has hit hard times, partly because a rise in fish farms has led to a glut on the market, the region's salmon runs still are spectacular. Fish here are measured in the millions. In 2004, more than 27 million salmon were commercially harvested in Bristol Bay. Most were sockeyes, the most valuable of the five species of salmon.
 ''This is one of the most special places for salmon anywhere,'' said Dr. Quinn, who noted that the region had no farmed fish or hatchery fish. ''It's the center of sockeye diversity,'' he added. ''This is all salmon produced by and evolved under natural processes, and in that sense, for the gene bank of the species, it is really quite remarkable.''
 Other fish include rainbow trout, round whitefish, humpback whitefish, burbot, Dolly Varden and Arctic char. Mammals include brown bears, wolves, moose, one of the state's largest herds of caribou and a rare population of freshwater seals in Lake Iliamna.
 The Native Alaskan people here -- Yupik Eskimos, Aleuts and Athabascan Indians -- have long lived off this bounty. ''I am not a scientist,'' said Raymond Wassillie, chief of the village of Newhalen. ''All I know is I live here. I breathe the air, I fish the waters, I hunt the lands. That's the way the traditional life of my culture has been, and I like it. And if it goes away, I won't have nothing.'' 
 Still, he says, he is willing to consider a mine that will bring jobs. ''Make sure you keep open minds,'' he told the crowd at a meeting on April 7 in the small teen center of this village on the shores of Lake Iliamna.
 As was evident there, others are more skeptical. Lydia Olympic, the village council president of Iguigig, also on Lake Iliamna, replied: ''Is it so wrong for a Native who lives here and off the land to be fearful? We have the right to be fearful.''
 Others echoed the sentiment. ''They're giving us the same promises other mines have promised to other people,'' said Tatiana Askoak of Newhalen. ''We don't have any guarantees.''
 Among many others who have voiced concern about the plans is Jay S. Hammond, a Republican who was governor from 1974 to 1982. ''In my view it's one of the least appropriate spots for a mine, and in my view it's more environmentally sensitive than ANWR development,'' said Mr. Hammond, referring to the move to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil development.
 But Bruce Jenkins, the chief operating officer of Northern Dynasty, warned against ''fearmongering'' and said, ''Do not be swayed by those who would lead you to think that this mine will be an ecological disaster.'' 
 Northern Dynasty is not the only mining company with an interest in the Bristol Bay region. James Briscoe, president of the Liberty Star Gold Corporation, says he has found evidence of a giant buried, collapsed volcanic rim, called a caldera, that forms a huge circle around the Pebble project. The areas around such calderas, he said, often hold clusters of valuable minerals.
 ''To me it's one of the most exciting projects I've seen in 40 years of exploration,'' Mr. Briscoe said. A Liberty Star subsidiary, Big Chunk, has close to 1,000 claims on about 150,000 acres on the presumed caldera or near it.
 Whether any of the region's mines will be allowed to proceed is up to state and federal regulators. Although the state is planning a road to the remote Pebble site that would connect it to a port in Cook Inlet, officials with the Department of Natural Resources say they cannot begin to evaluate the project until it starts through the permit process.
 ''If we can't protect the water, it's not going to get permitted,'' Bob Loeffler, director of the agency's division of mining, land and water, told the crowd in the Newhalen teen center. 
 An open-pit mine can contaminate water in several ways. Typically the rock is crushed and then chemically treated in some way to extract the valuable minerals. Waste may end up in big rock piles or in what is called the tailings pond, depending on the stage at which it is discarded. In some past mine disasters, processing chemicals have leaked into waterways; waste rock has become acidic and leached heavy metals.
 But whether that is likely here depends on the specific geological and chemical makeup of the minerals. And Ed Fogels, Alaska's large-mine permit coordinator, said, ''We don't have a clue yet about the geochemistry of Pebble; for us that's the single most important thing.'' The information is to come from studies conducted or commissioned by Northern Dynasty. 
 If regulators approve Pebble, the door to the Bristol Bay region is more likely to open for other mines as well. And regulatory approval, Mr. Fogels noted, does not rule out the possibility of environmental damage. ''No one can guarantee that nothing can go wrong,'' he said.
 Even Mr. Jenkins, of Northern Dynasty, told the Newhalen crowd: ''We're committed to preserving your subsistence way of life. Does that mean there will be no effects on your subsistence way of life? No, of course not. How could you have an open-pit tailings pond with zero effect on your subsistence way of life? The real question is what's the nature, the timing and the magnitude of the effect.''

HEADLINE: More Executives Are Taking the Controls

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
Allen Warner, who owns two Cleveland industrial-coating companies, got his first hankering for flying when he and his parents watched planes take off and land at a local airstrip. He never did anything to fulfill his childhood dream of becoming a pilot, however, until he sat next to one on a business trip in 2000.
 ''When I told him about wanting to be in the cockpit, the pilot, a veteran of Continental Airlines, looked at me and asked what my excuse was for not flying,'' he said. Mr. Warner, who had often had trouble making connections to small cities to visit his company's dealerships, had no convincing answer.
 Nudged by the pilot, who sent him e-mail messages with names and numbers of local instructors, Mr. Warner, 52, said he called a nearby flying school and got so enthusiastic that ''I plowed through the requirements in record time.'' Now, he can hop into his six-seat Piper Meridian at a moment's notice to fly off to meet candidates to run new dealerships. 
 ''We'll pick up someone in the morning, bring him to Cleveland and show him around, then have him home by dinner,'' Mr. Warner said. ''It's sort of a wow factor, and when we do it, 75 percent of the time we close the deal.'' 
 He says he recently flew to Hickory, N.C.; on to St. Augustine, Fla.; from there to Nashville; then to Muncie, Ind.; and finally back to Cleveland, all in one day. ''It would have taken five days or so commercially,'' he said.
 No one tracks the precise number of executives flying private planes on business, but the National Business Aviation Association says that member businesses that report using a single pilot exclusively -- often the owner of the business -- have risen by 20 percent, to 1,856, since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The Washington trade group has more than 7,000 companies on its rolls, and most of them use more than one pilot.
 Federal Aviation Administration statistics also suggest an increase in the number of corporate executives who fly themselves. The F.A.A.'s latest survey of general aviation activity, taken in 2002, showed a moderate increase in overall business travel as a portion of all air travel, to 24 percent, from 21 percent in a 1997 survey, as well as a 10 percent rise in business travel hours flown. But in that period, the hours flown by turboprop and turbojet aircraft, the two types primarily used by companies, increased by 27 percent, nearly three times as fast, the F.A.A. said. 
 Aside from the fun of flying, convenience is the big draw for executives like Mr. Walker. Peter La Colla, who used to drive to scout locations for his Street Corner convenience stores, says taking up flying has made life a lot easier. 
 ''I owned a minivan, and I would try to hit as many as six stores in one trip,'' said Mr. La Colla, chief executive of the company, which is based in Topeka, Kan. Those driving marathons stopped in 2000, after Mr. La Colla, 38, earned his pilot's license and began flying himself and colleagues to the company's 57 stores. 
 Many executives who take up flying become so enamored that they buy a plane for their company. The cost can be modest. The four-seat Cessna 172 that John Granby flies for Deschutes Optical of Bend, Ore., which makes precision eyeglass lenses, cost $48,500. 
 After his family-owned company bought a laboratory in 1999 in Boise, Idaho, which is a six-hour slog by car through ice and snow in the winter, Mr. Granby decided to switch to flying.
 ''Now it takes about an hour and 45 minutes, and it's a lot safer,'' he said of the four to six round trips made each month. His sales trips to optometry offices, opticians and ophthalmology clinics in the Northwest have been cut to two days from five, he says, allowing him to increase the number of such tours and stay more competitive against big optical chains.
 Surprisingly, Mr. Granby says, he also saves money. ''The Cessna 172 is like the Chevrolet of planes,'' he said. ''It's not terribly fast, but it's economical.'' He estimates that it costs him $65 an hour to operate the craft, including oil, gasoline, insurance, an annual inspection and hangar rentals in Bend and Boise. That means he can make short hops for less money than he used to spend to fill his Chevy Tahoe sport utility vehicle with gas. 
 Mr. La Colla of Street Corner points out another area of savings -- on-ground expenses. ''When I fly commercially, there are more hotel stays, more meals and more labor that has to be included in the trip's cost,'' he said. Pilots who land their own planes at the nation's 5,400 small public airports have fewer hotel, meal and rental car expenses. When necessary, some may make use of courtesy cars and take advantage of cheap rates negotiated for local hotels by the airports. Private flying also offers corporate executives relief from the security crackdown in commercial airports. ''Even last-minute trips are very easy,'' Mr. La Colla said. ''I can be in the air and sometimes even be at a destination in the same amount of time it takes me to drive to Kansas City International, park and go through security.''
 There are some practical limits to going his own way, he concedes. For example, commercial flights are the only real alternative for flying to the West or East Coasts.
 Sometimes it is just love of flying that pushes executives to get a pilot's license. Consider Ann Anderson, a senior executive with Sallie Mae, the student-loan provider, whose region extends from Texas to Hawaii. 
 Ms. Anderson, 45, had a grandfather who was a Border Patrol pilot, but she had never flown herself, though she had been toying with the idea for years. Then one day in 2003, she stepped off her company's corporate jet and resolved to give it a shot.
 She took an introductory flying lesson with Be a Pilot, a national learn-to-fly program started in 1997 by Cessna Aircraft and the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association to counter the declining number of licensed pilots. An introductory lesson by an F.A.A.-licensed flight instructor is about $49, or half the usual lesson cost, and Be a Pilot says that of the 250,000 people who have taken a lesson, half have gone on for further training. 
 That is not to say that learning to fly is cheap. With instruction running at $35 an hour and up, and fees for renting airplanes at $80 to $150 an hour, earning a private pilot's license typically costs $5,000 to $8,000.
 The F.A.A. requires a minimum of 40 hours of practice flying time, including at least 20 hours with an instructor and 10 hours solo. Pilots must pass medical and other exams, too, including a flight test with an instructor, before receiving a license.
 No matter. For Ms. Anderson, flying was so enthralling that she bought her own $322,000 Cessna Turbo 182 -- even though Sallie Mae reimburses her only for her fuel, she can not write off the plane as a business expense and parts of her region are too distant for her to fly to. But for visiting a client in a place like Hobbs, N.M., the Cessna has become almost indispensable because it saves so much time, she says.
 Another advantage is more difficult to measure. ''I see the world from a whole different vantage point now,'' she said. ''You can't put a price tag on that.''

HEADLINE: The Proof's in the Pension

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY. 
E-mail: tierney@nytimes.com

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile 

 BODY:
I made a pilgrimage to Santiago seeking to resolve the Social Security debate with a simple question: What would Pablo Serra do? 
 I wanted to compare our pensions to see the results of an accidental experiment that began in 1961, when he and I were friends in second grade at a school in Chile. He remained in Chile and became the test subject; I returned to America as the control group.
 By the time we finished college, both of our countries' pension systems were going broke. Chile responded by pioneering a system of private accounts in 1981. America rescued its traditional system in the early 1980's by cutting benefits and raising taxes, with the promise that the extra money would go into a trust to finance the baby boomers' retirement. 
 As it happened, our countries have required our employers to set aside roughly the same portion of our income, a little over 12 percent, which pays for disability insurance as well as the pension program. It also covers, in Pablo's case, the fees charged by the mutual-fund company managing his money.
 I visited Pablo, who grew up to become an economist, at his office at the University of Chile and showed him my most recent letter from the Social Security Administration listing my history of earnings and projected pension. Pablo called up his account on his computer and studied the projected retirement options for him, which assume that he'll keep working until age 65 and that the fund will get an annual return of 5 percent (which is lower than its historical average). 
 After comparing our relative payments to our pension systems (since salaries are higher in America, I had contributed more), we extrapolated what would have happened if I'd put my money into Pablo's mutual fund instead of the Social Security trust fund. We came up with three projections for my old age, each one offering a pension that, like Social Security's, would be indexed to compensate for inflation: 
 (1)Retire in 10 years, at age 62, with an annual pension of $55,000. That would be more than triple the $18,000 I can expect from Social Security at that age. 
 (2)Retire at age 65 with an annual pension of $70,000. That would be almost triple the $25,000 pension promised by Social Security starting a year later, at age 66. 
 (3)Retire at age 65 with an annual pension of $53,000 and a one-time cash payment of $223,000.
 You may suspect that Pablo has prospered only because he's a sophisticated investor, but he simply put his money into one of the most popular mutual funds. He has more money in it than most Chileans because his salary is above average, but lower-paid workers who contributed to that fund for the same period of time would be in relatively good shape, too, because their projected pension would amount to more than 90 percent of their salaries.
 By contrast, Social Security replaces less than 60 percent of your salary -- and that's only if you were a low-income worker. Typical recipients get back less than half of their salaries.
 The biggest problem in Chile is that many workers don't contribute regularly to their pensions because they're unemployed or working off the books. That's a common situation in the developing world, no matter what the pension system is. But if you contribute for at least 20 years, Chile guarantees you a minimum pension that, relative to the median salary, is actually more generous than the median Social Security check.
 Still, you may argue, Chileans may someday long for a system like Social Security if the stock market crashes and takes their pensions down with it. The relative risks of the Chilean and American systems are a question for another column. But I can tell you that Pablo is an economist who appreciates the risks of stocks and has no doubt about where he wants to keep putting his money.
 ''I'm very happy with my account,'' he said to me after comparing our pensions. He was kind enough not to gloat. When I enviously suggested that he could expect not only a much heftier pension than mine, but also enough cash to buy himself a vacation home at the shore or in the country, he reassured me that it would pay for only a modest place. 
 I'm not sure how much consolation that is, but I'm trying to look at the bright side. Maybe my Social Security check will cover the airfare to visit him.

HEADLINE: Declining Fears of Inflation Give a Lift to Share Prices

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Share prices rose yesterday amid a flurry of merger activity and a surprising rise in home sales that restored investors' confidence in the economy and eased fears of inflation and higher interest rates.
 The news of Valero Energy's $6.9 billion takeover of oil refiner Premcor, creating the largest oil refiner in North America, reassured investors that corporate America was still willing to make large deals despite economic uncertainty.
 A climb in home sales also encouraged investors, with the unexpected jump illustrating that the higher interest rates by the Federal Reserve -- intended to keep inflation in check -- were not hurting home purchases. The National Association of Realtors said home sales rose to an annualized rate of 6.89 million in March, up from 6.7 million in February. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 84.76 points, or 0.8 percent, to 10,242.47. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 9.98 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,162.10, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 18.59 points, or 1 percent, to 1,950.78.
 Analysts said investors were waiting for next week's meeting of the Federal Reserve. 
 Wall Street was hoping the Fed would give a bullish forecast for the economy, which would continue to allow for gradual rate increases that corporate America could easily digest.
 ''The real key is interest rates,'' said Russ Koesterich, senior portfolio manager at Barclays Global Investments in San Francisco. ''We need to get back to that Goldilocks economy, where we're growing enough to keep things going but keeping inflation at bay and interest rate hikes measured. We do that, we'll see stocks improve.''
 Premcor surged 18.14 percent, or $10.70, to $69.70 on news of its acquisition, while Valero gained 83 cents, to $75.87. The combined company would unseat Exxon Mobil as the largest refiner in North America. 
 Crude futures briefly reached $56 per barrel in early trading, but fell sharply in afternoon trading. A barrel of light crude settled at $54.57, down 82 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 In other merger news, Qwest Communications International was unchanged at $3.55 after MCI said Qwest's $9.75 billion takeover bid was superior to that of Verizon Communications, which is expected to improve its $7.8 billion offer for MCI. Verizon held steady at $34.06, while MCI was down 2 cents, at $26.67, before it lost another 4 cents in after-hours trading.
 The online marketing company DoubleClick slid 45 cents, to $8.12, after it announced it would be acquired by a private equity firm for $1.1 billion. The deal had been rumored for days.
 SBC Communications, preparing to merge with AT&T, said its profits fell 54 percent from a year ago because of costs associated with the purchase of AT&T Wireless by Cingular. SBC surpassed Wall Street's earnings forecasts by a penny per share, however, and its shares added 12 cents, to $23.32, but gave up more than half the gains in after-hours trading.
 The bond market was little changed after last week's gains. The 10-year Treasury note fell 1/32, to a price of 98. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.25 percent from 4.24 percent on Friday.
 Here are the results of the three-month and six-month bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	99.272	98.437	High Rate	2.880	3.090	Investment Rate	2.941	3.183	Low Rate	2.850	3.055	Median Rate	2.870	3.080	Total applied for	$49,497,896	$40,023,219	Accepted	$22,443,084	$19,350,809	Noncompetitive	$1,706,769	$1,142,317	

Both issues are dated April 28, 2005. The three-month bills mature on July 28, 2005 and the six-month bills mature on Oct. 27, 2005.

HEADLINE: China Tries to Isolate Taiwan's President

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: BEIJING, April 25 

 BODY:
Taiwan's two main opposition leaders will make consecutive visits to mainland China over the next two weeks as Beijing steps up a campaign to isolate the island's independence movement.
 Both opposition figures, Lien Chan, chairman of the Nationalist Party, and James Soong, who heads the pro-unification People First Party, are expected to meet Hu Jintao, China's Communist Party chief, and conduct the highest-level dialogue between the rivals since the Communist Party took power in 1949.
 Beijing has not invited Taiwan's president, Chen Shui-bian, to visit the mainland and has ruled out talks with him unless he accepts the ''one China'' formula under which Beijing claims sovereignty over Taiwan, a condition Mr. Chen has rejected. 
 But China's overture to the opposition groups put Mr. Chen's government on the defensive, forcing it to cede ground to politicians who tend to take a softer line on relations with the government in Beijing, Taiwanese officials and Chinese analysts said.
 Mr. Hu, who consolidated his power as China's top leader late last year, has pursued a strategy to halt what the mainland sees as the steady drift toward formal independence by Taiwan, which is separated from the mainland by the 100-mile-wide Taiwan Strait and is regarded by China as a renegade province.
 In early March, the Communist Party-controlled legislature passed a measure authorizing the use of force if Taiwan moves too far toward independence, which the United States, Taiwan's main ally, criticized as a provocation.
 Mr. Hu's subsequent invitations to Taiwanese opposition leaders appear designed to show that China will use force only as a last resort and that it welcomes politicians who want to mend fences.
 The Taiwan strategy has unfolded as China has waged a populist campaign against Japan, which it accuses of whitewashing abuses it committed during World War II. 
 In both cases, Mr. Hu has combined assertions of China's national interests with flashy gestures and hands-on diplomacy that run counter to his reputation as a cautious party apparatchik, analysts said.
 Mr. Lien's trip, which begins on Tuesday, follows a lower profile but groundbreaking visit by his deputy three weeks ago. Mr. Chen condemned that trip as an unauthorized attempt to negotiate with Taiwan's archrival. Mr. Soong has a separate trip scheduled to begin May 5.
 ''It is true that these trips are creating some turmoil in Taiwan politics,'' Joseph Wu, who heads Taiwan's official Mainland Affairs Council, said in a telephone interview. ''They are part of China's tactic of creating divisions in Taiwan that it can exploit.''
 Mr. Wu said the government has warned Mr. Lien and Mr. Soong not to ''sign agreements'' that infringe on Taiwan's rights, which he said would break the law. Mr. Chen and Mr. Lien discussed the opposition leader's trip on Monday to avoid such problems, he said.
 ''If Lien Chan explains some facts to China's leaders about the reality in Taiwan, then we could turn a potential crisis into a positive good,'' said Mr. Wu, who oversees Taiwan's mainland relations.
 Independence-leaning Taiwanese politicians have called Mr. Lien and Mr. Soong traitors for ''selling out Taiwan.'' But the two appear to have calculated that the mood has shifted in favor of warmer cross-strait ties and that they could get credit for helping to lower tensions.
 Chinese officials have not commented publicly on the visits. But Jia Qinglin, a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, promised deeper engagement with Taiwan in a recent address.
 ''As long as it benefits the Taiwanese compatriots, as long as it helps enhance cross-strait exchange, as long as it advances the peaceful reunification of the motherland, we will all try our very best to do it,'' he said.
 Mr. Lien's trip is deeply symbolic because he heads the Nationalists, who governed all of China until Chiang Kai-shek, the party's longtime leader, lost a civil war against the Communists in 1949 and fled to Taiwan. Mr. Lien will be the first party leader to step foot on the mainland since then.
 The Nationalists lost their hold on Taiwan's presidency in 2000 and are now the largest opposition party. Mr. Lien, a former vice president, has lost two presidential contests to Mr. Chen, most recently last year. But he led his party to an unexpected victory in legislative elections against Mr. Chen's Democratic Progressive Party in December.
 His eight-day visit to the mainland includes an extended stay in Nanjing, the old Nationalist capital. He will also stop in Xian, his birthplace, and Shanghai. In Beijing on Friday, Mr. Lien is scheduled to meet Mr. Hu and deliver an address at Beijing University.
 The Nationalists have staked out a moderate position on China relations, rejecting mainland demands for reunification but also opposing Mr. Chen's efforts to solidify the island's de facto independent status. 
 Mr. Lien has proposed negotiating a 50-year moratorium on changes in the status quo that would rule out Taiwanese independence but also oblige the mainland to forswear the use of force against Taiwan. 
 ''The Chinese mainland has experienced dramatic changes both in politics and the economy over the past 18 years,'' Mr. Lien said Monday ahead of his departure Tuesday morning. ''We must face the changes.''
 China, in turn, is expected to offer some concessions to Taiwan during Mr. Lien's visit. But there is no sign of a major shift in approach, with Mr. Hu emphasizing a mix of economic incentives and military threats to keep Taiwan in line.
 Chinese analysts say Beijing has plunged deeply into Taiwan's domestic politics in a bid to isolate the strongest supporters of independence and make Mr. Chen refrain from trying to legalize Taiwan's independence through changes to the Constitution.
 Sun Shengliang, a Taiwan expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, said in a signed commentary in state-run news media on Monday that the strategy is working. He said Taiwan politicians were racing against each other to improve cross-strait relations, putting pressure on Mr. Chen.

HEADLINE: Surging Fuel Prices Catch Most Airlines Unprepared, Adding to the Industry's Gloom

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
Record prices for jet fuel are playing havoc with the nation's airlines.
 Last week, American, Delta, Continental and Northwest reported steeper first-quarter losses than a year earlier and blamed jet fuel, the airlines' single biggest operating expense.
 In March, a gallon of jet fuel averaged $1.59, far above the $1.25 a gallon companies expected this year. Few of the airlines bought hedging contracts to lock in the lower price, meaning they are bearing the full brunt of higher prices. 
 As a result, industry analysts and company officials say, the pain will be widespread. Rising prices ''put the whole industry's future in question,'' said Gary C. Kelly, the chief executive at Southwest Airlines, one of the few airlines to have protected itself against higher fuel prices. 
 Philip A. Baggaley, an industry analyst with Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, said, ''I guess the best description is grim.''
 Airlines already under bankruptcy protection, like United, US Airways and ATA, could be mired there even longer than they predicted. More companies could topple into court protection, particularly Delta, Northwest and Independence Air, whose finances are considered among the most precarious among the solvent airlines.
 Employees, who have been forced to accept deep cuts in wages and benefits across the industry, could see even more compensation slip away, along with more jobs. 
 Passengers, who are already seeing fares rise, may pay even more for tickets in the busy spring and summer travel seasons, and could see service disappear on particularly unprofitable routes.
 Why did the airlines not see this coming, given that prices spiked last year, too? Executives say they were eager to believe predictions that oil prices would drop once the major fighting in Iraq subsided. At this time last year, they say, analysts projected that oil would sell for $24 to $25 a barrel in 2005, half what prices have averaged this year.
 ''I think the airline industry has been very, very slow to come to the reality that this is for real,'' said Joseph B. Leonard, the chief executive at AirTran Airways.
 Even if the airlines had seen the spike coming, for the most part they did not have the millions of dollars in cash needed to acquire hedging contracts.
 That was the case at Delta Air Lines, which was minutes away from a Chapter 11 filing last fall before pilots gave in to its demand for deep wage cuts. 
 Because of its financial squeeze, Delta had to forfeit the hedging contracts it had in place for 2005. It began the year projecting it would pay $1.22 a gallon for jet fuel, which lately has cost 40 cents a gallon more.
 Without protection, Delta has to cover the extra cost out of its operations, offsetting its extensive cost-cutting efforts, which it contends were ahead of projections. ''The issue is simple: with high fuel costs, we are not on plan,'' Delta's chief executive, Gerald A. Grinstein, said last week. 
 Mr. Baggaley at S.&P. said he was most concerned about Delta's prospects. The airline, which had about $1 billion less in cash on hand this year than it had a year ago, could face a liquidity crisis by the end of 2005 if fuel prices do not fall, he said.
 But few in the industry expect much relief, least of all Southwest, the shining example of how to hedge fuel. Its contracts have enabled Southwest to remain profitable even as its rivals have lost billions of dollars the last few years.
 Mr. Kelly said Southwest was preparing itself for oil prices of at least $55 a barrel, versus about $48 now, and already has some hedges in place through 2009. But, he said, ''hedging is not the key.'' 
 Airlines must carry more passengers per plane, improve the fuel economy of their jets, control expenses and sell more tickets at top prices, which Southwest limits to $299 each way, he said. Asked whether Southwest would raise that, he emphatically replied no.
 Concern over fuel prices is spreading to government circles. The federal Air Transportation Stabilization Board, created in 2001 to oversee a $15 billion bailout package from Congress, has loans outstanding to two airlines in bankruptcy protection -- US Airways and ATA -- as well as a loan package with America West Airlines, now in merger talks with US Airways.
 Before they can emerge from bankruptcy protection, both US Airways and ATA will have to demonstrate to potential investors that they can withstand higher fuel prices, said Mark R. Dayton, the federal board's executive director.
 ''Getting out will depend on equity infusions, and fuel prices will affect equity investors,'' Mr. Dayton said in Washington this month. ''I think the fuel problem is a big element. It is uncontrollable.''
 In the meantime, airlines are taking any and all steps to shield themselves. Mr. Leonard points to Northwest's decision to retire 24 reliable but gas-guzzling McDonnell Douglas DC-9's, some of them more than two decades old. 
 Other companies, he said, have to rethink their schedules and eliminate those flights that carry only a handful of passengers, or those where they cannot charge what it costs to operate their planes.
 ''If you had marginal routes at $25 a barrel, they had to go away at $35 a barrel. At $45 they certainly had to go away, and at $55 a barrel they make no sense at all,'' Mr. Leonard said.
 Mr. Baggaley said: ''The airlines must feel they are running a losing race. I think there is a real worry that they are running out of places to cut costs.''
 In the worst of all cases, he said, ''Some of the airlines could run out of cash and see no alternative but bankruptcy.''

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Tuesday about the effect of surging fuel prices on the nation's biggest airlines referred imprecisely to the first-quarter loss at American Airlines. With a one-time gain excluded, the loss was wider than the one in the period a year earlier, but with that gain, the net loss narrowed, to $162 million from $166 million.

HEADLINE: Bush and Saudi Meet at Ranch To Discuss Oil

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON; Jeff Gerth contributed reporting from Washington for this article.

DATELINE: CRAWFORD, Tex., April 25 

 BODY:
President Bush discussed the surge in oil prices with Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia on Monday, but focused on a plan by the Saudis to increase their oil-pumping capacity over the next decade rather than on any short-term efforts to bring prices down. 
 The two leaders talked for three hours here at Mr. Bush's ranch, trying to restore some normality to a relationship that has been tense since the emergence of the role of terrorists from Saudi Arabia in the Sept. 11 attacks. They discussed a variety of issues, including the Arab-Israeli conflict, terrorism, trade and Mr. Bush's call for more democracy in the Middle East, and the men made every effort to portray the relationship as back on track. 
 Mr. Bush even held the crown prince's hand, a traditional Saudi sign of friendship, as he guided Abdullah up the steps through a bed of bluebonnets to his office, the very picture of Saudi-American interdependence. 
 But the focus was on oil prices. Officials from both sides emerged from the meeting to say there was agreement on the value of Saudi Arabia's signaling to global markets that it would push down prices over the long run as demand for energy increased. American officials said they hoped the Saudi policy might put immediate downward pressure on oil prices, even though the expansion plan has been public for weeks.
 ''A high oil price will damage markets, and he knows that,'' Mr. Bush said as he waited for his guest to arrive.
 Officials said there was no explicit request by Mr. Bush for short-term steps to bring down rising oil and gasoline prices, which are threatening to take a toll on the economy in the United States and are already pulling down the president's approval ratings. They said that Mr. Bush and other officials had already signaled to the Saudis that they wanted a commitment to pump more oil in the short run, and that last week the Saudi oil minister had publicly expressed a willingness to do so. 
 The officials said the Saudis used the meeting to detail for Mr. Bush the steps they intended to take to cushion the global market from future increases in demand from fast-growing economies like China and India, and from the United States and other industrial nations.
 Saudi Arabia's plan, which it began discussing publicly weeks ago, calls for spending up to $50 billion to increase its maximum sustainable production capacity to 12.5 million barrels a day by 2009, and to 15 million in the subsequent decade, from about 10.8 million barrels now. The Saudis are currently pumping about 9.5 million barrels a day.
 Asked whether that plan would have any effect soon on gasoline prices in the United States, Stephen J. Hadley, Mr. Bush's national security adviser, told reporters, ''It's hard to say.''
 Mr. Hadley added that increasing capacity ''can't help but have a positive downward effect on prices and deal with some of the volatility in the market by assuring people that supply will be available as the economies grow.''
 A Saudi official said that Mr. Bush had not requested a short-term production increase and that such an increase would not have any effect on gasoline prices in the United States in any case. The high price of gasoline in the United States, the Saudi official said, was mostly a result of a lack of refining capacity here. 
 ''It will not make a difference if Saudi Arabia ships an extra million or two million barrels of crude oil to the United States,'' said the official, Adel al-Jubeir, a senior adviser to the crown prince. ''If you cannot refine it, it will not turn into gasoline, and that will not turn into lower prices.''
 The national average price for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline last week was just under $2.24, up 43 cents from a year earlier. Crude oil prices on Monday were about $54 a barrel, up from $37 a year ago.
 Saudi Arabia's plans to increase production capacity are politically and geologically sensitive. In the Middle East, the Saudis have been criticized for increasing production to help the United States; the most extreme of those critics has been Osama bin Laden.
 Some experts, including past and present officials of Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company, have said the plan may be too optimistic because of geological complexities in the oil fields and challenges in finding enough technology and labor.
 The crown prince arrived at the Bush ranch late Monday morning from Dallas, where he had met Sunday with Vice President Dick Cheney, who was briefed on the Saudi production plan. Reflecting the importance of the meeting to the administration, Mr. Bush was joined for the meeting here by Mr. Cheney; Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice; Mr. Hadley; Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff; and Fran Townsend, the White House's homeland security adviser.
 The atmosphere was considerably less tense than during Abdullah's last visit, three years ago to the day, and the two sides cited progress on a variety of fronts. 
 Saudi officials said only technicalities remained in negotiating a trade deal with the United States, a big step toward Saudi Arabia's goal of joining the World Trade Organization. The two governments agreed to work toward making it easier for Saudi students and military officers to study and train in the United States.
 Mr. Hadley said the Saudis had made ''real good progress'' in fighting terrorism. 
 Ms. Rice said that the Saudis and the United States had a ''common agenda'' when it came to promoting peace between the Israelis and Palestinians and that she had discussed with Abdullah the need for the Saudis to provide financial support for the Palestinians in Gaza once the Israelis pull out this summer.

HEADLINE: Rigas Family To Cede Assets To Adelphia

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
The family that founded the Adelphia Communications Corporation, the big cable operator, will forfeit almost its entire fortune to the company to pay for a $715 million fund to compensate investors who lost money when the company collapsed, the government said yesterday.
 The fund was announced as part of an agreement that Adelphia reached with the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle a fraud case stemming from the management by the company's founders, the Rigas family. 
 ''Today is a day of restitution for the victims of corporate corruption,'' Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales said in a statement.
 Investors in Adelphia's stock and bonds lost billions of dollars when the company collapsed and filed for bankruptcy protection in 2002 after allegations that the Rigas family was misusing corporate money. John J. Rigas, the company's founder, and his son Timothy were convicted last summer of looting Adelphia of $2.3 billion in assets and misrepresenting the company's financial health to investors. 
 Under the terms of the agreement, John Rigas and other members of the family will provide Adelphia with about $1.5 billion in assets, or 95 percent of their holdings. Those assets include $700 million to $900 million in cable systems, which the government said were bought or upgraded with money wrongfully taken from Adelphia; convertible subordinated notes with a face value of $567 million; 44.7 million shares of Adelphia common stock valued at about $6 million; and about $10 million in real estate. The company, which had managed and continues to manage the Rigas cable systems, will keep the balance of the money after paying the $715 million to the government for the fund. 
 Not included in the settlement are two small cable companies in north-central Pennsylvania, near Coudersport, where Adelphia was founded and used to be based. Its headquarters are now in Greenwood Village, Colo. 
 The settlement will close the case of ''one of the most complicated and egregious financial frauds committed at a public company,'' said Mark K. Schonfeld, director of the S.E.C.'s Northeast regional office. The forfeiture by the Rigases is the largest ever made by individuals in a corporate fraud case, Mr. Gonzales said at a news conference, according to The Associated Press.
 Lawrence G. McMichael, a partner at the law firm of Dilworth, Paxson in Philadelphia who represents the Rigases, said yesterday, ''The family is very pleased to have been able to work with the government to achieve a productive economic settlement.''
 ''The family's objective was to provide money to people who lost money when Adelphia collapsed,'' he said. ''We had a mutual goal with the government and with Adelphia and that was accomplished.''
 He said that John and Timothy Rigas planned to appeal their convictions and that even after the settlement they would have the financial resources to make the appeal. Regardless of the outcome, he said, the Adelphia investors will be entitled to keep their restitution. 
 William T. Schleyer, the chairman and chief executive of Adelphia, said in a statement that the settlement ''is the price we must pay to protect against the much larger potential harm of leaving the government claims and fate of the managed cable entities unresolved.''
 The settlement, which is subject to approval from a federal district judge and a bankruptcy court judge, should remove a hurdle to Adelphia's purchase by Time Warner and Comcast, which agreed last week to pay $17.6 billion in cash and stock. Adelphia, with 5.3 million cable subscribers, is the nation's fifth-largest cable operator.
 In turning over their assets to Adelphia, the Rigases are giving up virtually all of their holdings. The settlement would leave the Rigases with about $79 million in assets.
 But the family's acquisition of the cable systems was considered somewhat odd in the first place. Even as Adelphia, as a public company, was buying cable systems, the family was making private and parallel purchases. John Rigas said last year that he owned those systems so that if anything went wrong at Adelphia, he would always be able to count on the private businesses.
 When Adelphia was in its heyday in the late 1990's, investors paid little attention to such purchases, but they eventually worried about whether the family was cherry-picking the best systems for itself. 
 Last December, Adelphia had offered to settle for $325 million, but in a filing last month the company said that it had offered to settle for $725 million and that lawyers for the S.E.C. had told the company that the government might seek ''billions in damages.'' 
 Adelphia will pay the $715 million into the fund when it exits Chapter 11. If the sale to Time Warner and Comcast is completed, $600 million of the settlement will come from proceeds in cash and stock. 
 If a sale is not completed and Adelphia emerges as an independent company, the $600 million will consist entirely of Adelphia stock. The remaining $115 million will come from payments that Adelphia hopes to collect from lawsuits against banks and the accounting firm Deloitte & Touche. 
 The fund will not receive that money if Adelphia loses those suits, a spokesman said yesterday. 
 The Justice Department and the S.E.C. will appoint an administrator for the fund and will announce details later for a process by which investors can submit claims for their losses. 
 Distributions will most likely coincide with Adelphia's emergence from bankruptcy in the next year to 18 months, the government said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Considers Toughening Stance Toward Venezuela

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO

 BODY:
As President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela veers toward greater confrontation with Washington, the Bush administration is weighing a tougher approach, including funneling more money to foundations and business and political groups opposed to his leftist government, American officials say.
 The Bush administration has already begun to urge Venezuela's neighbors to distance themselves from Mr. Chavez and to raise concerns about press freedoms, judicial independence and the Venezuelan government's affinity for leftist groups abroad, including Colombian guerrillas.
 But it has found no allies so far in its attempts to isolate the Venezuelan leader, and it has grown more and more frustrated by Mr. Chavez's strident anti-American outbursts and policies that seem intended to fly in the face of Washington. On Sunday, Mr. Chavez ended a 35-year military cooperation agreement and ordered out four American military instructors he accused of fomenting unrest. 
 The accusation, which American officials denied, was the latest blow to relations that had been bitter since the United States tacitly supported a coup that briefly ousted Mr. Chavez in April 2002. Since then Mr. Chavez's strength has grown. He won a recall election last August, and record high oil prices have left his government flush with money as it provides 15 percent of American oil imports. 
 American officials, who had chosen to ignore Mr. Chavez through much of last year, now recognize the need for a longer-term strategy to deal with a leader who is poised to win a second six-year term in elections next year. 
 A multiagency task force in Washington has been working on shaping a new approach, one that high-ranking American policy makers say would most likely veer toward a harder line. United States support for groups that Chavez supporters say oppose the government has been a source of tension in the past. Under the plans being considered, American officials said, that support may increase.
 ''The conclusion that is increasingly being drawn in Washington is that a realistic, pragmatic relationship, in which we can agree to disagree on some issues but make progress on others, does not seem to be in the cards,'' said an American official who helps guide policy in Latin America.
 The official added, ''We offered them a more pragmatic relationship, but obviously if they do not want it, we can move to a more confrontational approach.'' 
 Already counternarcotics programs have suffered, American officials noted, and meetings among high-ranking officials from the two countries are minimal. 
 ''What's happening here is they realize this thing is deteriorating rapidly and it's going to require some more attention,'' said a high-ranking Republican aide on Capitol Hill who works on Latin America policy. ''The current look-the-other-way policy is not working.''
 The United States, he said, is particularly concerned because Venezuela is one of four top providers of foreign oil to the United States. ''You can't write him off,'' the aide said of Mr. Chavez. ''He's sitting on an energy source that's critical to us.''
 A main problem for the United States is that Washington has little, if any, influence over Caracas. The high price of oil has left Venezuela with no need for the loans or other aid that the United States could use as leverage. 
 Nor does the Bush administration have much support in Latin America, where left-leaning leaders now govern two-thirds of the continent. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is expected to raise concerns about Venezuela in a four-country tour through the region this week. Political analysts say she will have a hard time finding support. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, on a recent trip to Brazil, publicly raised concerns about Mr. Chavez. Days later, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil, in a meeting in Venezuela with Mr. Chavez and the leaders of Colombia and Argentina, pointedly said, ''We don't accept defamation and insinuations against a companero,'' meaning a close friend.
 ''Venezuela has the right to be a sovereign country, to make its own decisions,'' he added.
 For his part, Mr. Chavez, who is famous for his rambling, often outrageous speeches, has grown more belligerent, using his anti-American posturing to bolster his popular support. He has accused the United States of planning an invasion, prompting a threat to cut oil sales, and has hurled sexually tinged insults at Secretary Rice. 
 While other Venezuelan officials stress that oil sales to the United States would never cease, Venezuela's new energy ties with China have worried Washington, as did Mr. Chavez's recent meeting with President Mohammad Khatami of Iran, which he declared ''has every right'' to develop its atomic energy program. 
 Mr. Chavez is also forming a popular militia that he says will eventually have two million members and has plans to buy 100,000 AK-47 assault rifles from Russia and fighter jets from Brazil. 
 ''All governments recognize the democratic character of the Venezuelan government, its peaceful vocation, and they want to establish relations with Venezuela, with just one exception, the United States,'' Ali Rodriguez, the Venezuelan foreign minister, said in an interview. ''It has gone to great lengths to isolate Venezuela, but no government is playing along. It has failed, and that's because there is no reason to isolate Venezuela.''
 Indeed, many of Latin America's largest countries see little benefit in colliding with Mr. Chavez, nor do they support the isolation of Cuba. Venezuela provides oil at below-market prices and has numerous lucrative economic agreements with dozens of nations. Many also do not want to antagonize their own leftist constituencies, who are partial to Mr. Chavez.
 ''The other countries don't want to be drawn into a polemic between Venezuela and the United States,'' said Jennifer L. McCoy, a Venezuela expert at Georgia State University who headed the Carter Center's election observer mission in Caracas last year. ''It's a counterproductive strategy that could result in a negative Latin American reaction if they're forced to take sides.''
 Many influential Democrats in Congress also oppose a more aggressive approach.
 ''I think it creates further estrangement,'' said Representative Bill Delahunt, a Massachusetts Democrat and a member of the House International Relations Committee who has met many times with Mr. Chavez. ''One cannot get around the fact that Hugo Chavez is a democratically elected president.''
 But Bush administration policy planners say that efforts to patch up relations with Venezuela have largely failed. 
 The American ambassador, William Brownfield, who took over in Caracas in September, spent fruitless months before getting a meeting with Mr. Rodriguez, the foreign minister. Requests for meetings with other ministers and even midlevel officials are routinely ignored, and Venezuela has canceled dozens of routine exchange programs with the United States.
 The one option that administration officials increasingly believe they have is to respond much more assertively and publicly to Venezuelan policies the United States does not like, ideally with the help of other countries and respected institutions like the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.
 ''We shouldn't be afraid to say when he's taking away liberties, not at all,'' Robert B. Zoellick, now the deputy secretary of state, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in February during his confirmation hearings.
 Venezuelan Foreign Ministry officials say they still hold out hope that relations will improve. ''There is one condition for us to have healthy relations with the United States,'' said Vice Minister Mari Pili Hernandez, who handles relations with Washington. ''It's called respect.''

HEADLINE: Consumers Are Wary, But Housing Remains Hot

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26 

 BODY:
Consumer confidence fell in April, but the nation's housing market seems hotter than ever.
 Confounding most forecasters, who had expected home sales to decline last month, the government reported on Tuesday that sales of new homes rose sharply by 12.2 percent in March and hit a record annual pace of 1.43 million.
 The unexpected surge came despite slightly higher mortgage rates last month, worries about slowing growth and an escalating debate about a ''housing bubble'' in at least some regions that many specialists argue might be on the verge of bursting.
 Analysts cautioned that the estimate of home sales might be revised down slightly as new data becomes available, and they noted that consumer confidence had been shaken since March by higher gasoline prices, sluggish employment growth and this month's swoon in the stock markets. 
 But despite scattered signs pointing to slower growth, the strong pace of home-buying is expected to reinforce the Federal Reserve's intention to keep raising interest rates until they have reached a level that no longer serves as a stimulus for growth. The central bank is expected to raise short-term rates by another quarter point next Tuesday, to 3 percent, which would be the eighth rate increase since last June.
 The Conference Board reported on Tuesday that its index of consumer confidence dropped to 97.7 in April, from 103 in March, and expectations about the next six months dropped to their lowest level in nearly two years.
 The decline, steeper than forecasters had predicted, comes on the heels of signs of sluggish retail sales. 
 ''Looking ahead, consumers do not anticipate an improvement in economic growth nor in their incomes,'' reported Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center. And many people expect it to be harder to find a job over the summer months, he said.
 But Fed officials have paid relatively little heed to recent data suggesting an economic slowdown, suggesting that they are more concerned about the danger of rising inflation. 
 Surveys of consumer confidence provide an erratic guide at best to consumer spending, because the surveys often reflect the bad news that people have already heard rather than what they actually plan to do in the months ahead.
 By contrast, analysts said the startling rise in new-home sales suggested that the real estate market might continue its expansion despite price increases of 20 percent and more over the last year in many parts of California, Florida and along the East Coast. 
 ''It still appears that it doesn't take much to generate faster home sales,'' said Peter E. Kretzmer, a senior economist at Bank of America. Indeed, Mr. Kretzmer predicted that the housing market might actually gain strength because long-term interest rates have edged down a bit since March.
 The relentless rise of the housing market is a growing puzzle for central bankers. The Fed fueled a housing boom after 2001 by slashing interest rates to their lowest levels since the 1950's, which caused prices to soar and allowed millions of people to cash out some of the new equity in their homes and spend it on everything from kitchens to cars.
 But even though the Fed has been raising short-term rates steadily since last June, the long-term interest rates that determine mortgage rates are still about as low today as they were one year ago. 
 Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, told House lawmakers in February that the continued low level of long-term interest rates was a ''conundrum'' that he could not fully explain. Several economists have suggested that huge inflows of foreign savings into the government bond and mortgage markets have also played a significant role in keeping interest rates low. 
 And while Fed officials have argued that there is little danger of a national housing bubble, they have acknowledged concerns that low interest rates may have encouraged speculative buying by people who have unrealistic expectations about future price increases. 
 ''Low interest rates, in turn, have been a major force driving the phenomenal run-up in residential real estate prices over the past few years,'' Donald L. Kohn, a Fed governor, said in a speech last week. Though he discounted worries about a crash in real estate prices, Mr. Kohn said that prices had climbed high enough to ''raise questions'' about an increase in speculative buying and overvaluations.
 Analysts said part of last month's rush to buy homes probably reflected a race by people to complete deals before mortgage rates start to climb higher. But a growing number of Wall Street economists are convinced that a housing bubble is under way, at least in many parts of the country.
 Housing starts declined precipitously last month, which may have reflected an expectation among builders that higher interest rates would stifle demand later in the year. But sales of existing homes climbed 1 percent in March and have climbed 4.9 percent over the last year, according to the National Association of Realtors.
 ''We think there is a bubble, and we think the risks are higher that it will burst,'' said Sheryl King, a senior economist at Merrill Lynch. ''Even if you adjust for population growth, you're seeing numbers that are bigger than any we have seen at this point in any previous economic cycle.''

HEADLINE: Amid Olympic Talk, a Look Back at 2 World's Fairs

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
In debating what the Olympics might deliver to New York, it might be worth recalling the forgotten legacy of Fishhooks McCarthy. 
 The line connecting Mr. McCarthy with the Summer Games is crooked or, at best, circuitous. But it offers a timely reminder that well before the current debate over whether New York needs the Olympic Games or a new stadium to accommodate them, two ambitious World's Fairs were also touted as cost-effective vehicles to expand the city's parks and public works. The analogy is not precise, but the question it raises is instructive: Did those fairs deliver on their promise of civic improvement? 
 Both fairs were held in Flushing Meadows, Queens, a site immortalized by F. Scott Fitzgerald as the fiery ''valley of ashes'' through which Jay Gatsby commuted in the 1920's between Manhattan and Long Island's gold coast. The valley was manmade, flanked by mounds of ashes up to 90 feet high that John A. McCarthy's company, under a sweetheart deal with his fellow Democrats in Tammany Hall, removed from Brooklyn's coal-burning furnaces and dumped at the rate of 100 or so railroad carloads a day.
 Legend has it that Mr. McCarthy's moniker was inspired by his habit of thrusting his fists immutably into his pockets at the first sighting of any due bill. But when the city finally bowed to reformers and canceled its contract with Mr. McCarthy's company, Brooklyn Ash Removal, in 1934, a door was opened to transform the befouled meadows into New York's second-largest park and Robert Moses bullied his way through. 
 ''Then the miracle happened -- the idea of a World's Fair,'' Moses later wrote.
 He, in effect, seized control of the 1939-40 World's Fair site to begin the meadows's transformation and organized the 1964-65 World's Fair to help finish it. ''I think they were successful probably beyond anybody's expectations,'' said Adrian Benepe, who now holds Moses' old job as city parks commissioner. 
 A 17-day Olympics is not the same as a much-longer-lasting World's Fair, of course. And unlike a fair, the Olympics are typically not concentrated in one venue. 
 New York City's bid for the 2012 Olympics promises what its organizers say would be ''the largest single investment'' in parks and recreational facilities in the city's history and a legacy of other public works, including permanent housing in an Olympic Village in western Queens and transportation improvements in the metropolitan area, including the extension westward of the No. 7 subway line. (One legacy of the 1939 fair, in particular, was to shift New York's focus eastward to the Long Island suburbs.) 
 Beyond the potential economic benefits, the two fairs also had a cultural impact. The 1939 fair introduced television, plastics and the freeways of the future. 
 ''It was influential,'' said Robert A. Caro, Moses' biographer. ''It had a real impact, particularly on the vision of broad sweeping highways.'' 
 The 1964 fair paled in comparison but did expose Michelangelo's ''Pieta'' to millions and popularized the Belgian waffle. 
 ''Fairs are a lot more successful economically than they seem, because we set our sights too narrow,'' said David Gelernter, a professor at Yale and the author of ''1939: The Lost World of the Fair.'' The 1939 fair helped make Flushing Meadows-Corona Park possible, in part, because ''a stupefyingly huge dump got cleaned up,'' Mr. Gelernter said. 
 It also helped improve the city's image. ''The fair brought huge crowds to New York; they didn't spend enough money, but left with the impression that New York was the most exciting place on earth,'' Mr. Gelernter said. ''And the years following the park and the war -- 1945 through the mid-'50's -- were boom years for the city, years in which the city became the art capital of the world and the most glamorous place on earth. Many things helped, but the fair was a huge factor.'' 
 Each of New York's 20th-century World's Fairs drew tens of millions of visitors, provided jobs and generated tax revenue. The first led to the linking of the Grand Central Parkway to the new Triborough Bridge and spurred the completion of the airport that would later be named after Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia. 
 And, in the nation's biggest reclamation project of its time, the meadows's ash heaps were leveled and covered with topsoil. The scooped-out areas were used to create two artificial lakes, including the 84-acre Meadow Lake, now the city's largest. 
 Both fairs failed to generate a projected profit. But to the degree that they were deemed financial failures, they were, in part, victims of unrealistic expectations. Invoking Isaiah, Moses said the two fairs had given the city ''beauty for ashes'' and that the 1964-65 fair did ''more for New York than any other comparable event in three centuries.'' 
 Besides, he maintained, ''a fair is not a business in the ordinary sense'' because corporate lenders profit in other ways, visitors experience a voyage of discovery and the community is left with permanent improvements. ''As to the small minority of acid skeptics, grouches and jaundiced-eyed grumblers,'' he said, ''the public pays them no mind. Critics build nothing.'' 
 The site of the second fair still includes the New York City building, which now houses the Queens Museum, the Unisphere, the heliport (now Terrace on the Park, one of the city's highest-grossing concessions), the Hall of Science, the old Singer Bowl (now part of the National Tennis Center) and the derelict New York State Pavilion. 
 When the second fair relinquished the site after seven years, officials entertained grand plans for, among other things, a great sports park. ''Hopefully,'' Thomas P.F. Hoving, the parks commissioner, said in 1967, ''someday maybe we'll have a world Olympics there.'' 
 Moses compared the fair to the Olympics he had witnessed in Rome and Tokyo. ''The Olympics furnish common ground,'' he wrote. ''The Olympics are a call to action, not a monument to the futility of words.'' 
 Jay L. Kriegel, the executive director of NYC2012, the Olympic organizing committee, said that in the last few decades, ''the Olympics have replaced the worlds fairs as the single biggest event in the world, as the world's gathering place.'' 
 If the city wins the Olympics in 2012, the 1939 Fountain of the Planets in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park would be reconfigured for whitewater rowing and the lakes would be adapted for flat-water rowing. 
 ''The 1939 fair did the heavy lifting, reshaping the landscape, and the '64 fair left behind edifices that have been adaptively used,'' Mr. Benepe said. ''Without them, the dump probably would have been closed down, but there would still be a heavily polluted Flushing River and borderline businesses. All in all, it created the city's second-largest park, left a legacy of cultural facilities and a festival grounds that on an average weekend is more of a World's Fair than ever.''

HEADLINE: Tourists at Market to Look Crowd Those Who Cook

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
ONE early spring morning at the farmers' stalls that surround the landmark Ferry Building, near the $3 bunches of mountain-grown lovage and candy-perfect chioga beets, Lynne Booth of Toronto fumbled through a fanny pack for a map.
 Ms. Booth and her partner, Karen Metcalf, had just come from another San Francisco tourist magnet, Fisherman's Wharf. Now they wanted to browse the famous organic vegetables.
 ''We read about it in the Fodor's book,'' said Ms. Booth. ''If we didn't see it, we would have been disappointed.'' 
 Four days a week, but especially on Saturdays, several thousand tourists, chefs and Bay Area cooks pour into what many consider to be the best of the 3,700 farmers' markets in America. The market fills the outdoor spaces around a freshly renovated Beaux Arts building that for more than a century has punctuated the eastern end of San Francisco. 
 Smart shoppers arrive before to 10 a.m. to assure their share of what farmers like Joe Schirmer of Dirty Girl Produce in Santa Cruz or Rick Knoll of Tairwa Knoll Farms in Brentwood have pulled from the ground. Inside the building is a permanent, well-polished food court where Cowgirl Creamery sells intensely seasonal cheeses and a well-executed pot of Imperial Tea Court oolong, served gongfu style, costs $8 a person.
 The market is by most measures successful beyond expectations. But the cooks and farmers who in the early 90's dreamed up an urban homage to sustainable farming probably did not envision the guy in a Senor Frog's shirt, who on a recent Saturday ate his way through the free bread cubes at the Stonehouse Olive Oil booth as if it were a high-end Hickory Farms. 
 The snacking tourist is exactly what is both great and terrible about San Francisco's effort to create a high temple of sustainable, organic, locally grown food. 
 ''They've got someone selling candles there now,'' said Alice Waters, the owner of Chez Panisse and the restaurateur who helped fix organic food in the nation's consciousness. She gave early, albeit cautious, support to the idea of marrying the farmers' market with the urban renewal project that developed the Ferry Building itself. 
 Two interests share the space. The first is the politically minded Center for Urban Education About Sustainable Agriculture, which organizes the farmers and decides which products can be sold in the stands around the Ferry Building. The other is a group of investors and developers who spent $90 million renovating the building and run its office space and indoor market. 
 While the two interests have found a way to work together, a vendor who might be considered worthy of inclusion by one group is not always embraced by the other.
 Purists like Ms. Waters who support local, sustainable farming above all else worry that the building's managers, who have rented space to a kitchen cookware chain and a burger joint, might have forgotten the mission. The managers, on the other hand, say the Ferry Building cannot survive on sheep's milk ricotta alone. Larger tenants with more retail sophistication need to be part of the mix, but that doesn't mean the point of the project has been lost. Vendors inside and outside the main building mix, buy from each other and share a common vision: to showcase the best of Northern California's artisanal food.
 Griping about tourists might be the common ground. Whether farmer or clerk, everyone has a story about the onslaught of visitors from around the world, the ones more likely to buy a jar of apple butter than an apple or, as a tourist from Dusseldorf did recently, videotape a $9 grass-fed beef sandwich and then go eat elsewhere.
 ''We're slammed with tourists,'' says Joseph Minocchi of White Crane Springs Ranch. He sells greens and flowers grown according to the ecologically pure but arcane principles of biodynamic agriculture.
 One of the smaller of the 75 or so farmers who show up at the market during the height of the season, Mr. Minocchi takes in $1,000 to $2,000 on a Saturday, and then heads back to his mountain enclave in Healdsburg, about 60 miles north.
 ''I feel it's overrun, but what can you do?'' he said. ''It's a beautiful spot. The mission is to educate people, and that means I have to keep talking even when I'm exhausted.''
 Many of the other farmers feel the same way. They are happy to turn a suburbanite from the Midwest on to the connection between the land and the plate, but they tire of the hordes of tourists who sometimes get in the way of the chefs and local cooks that are their real bread and butter. 
 Ms. Waters says the line between a tourist attraction and a working farmers' market is very fine.
 ''It's wonderful that they want to come and see it, but it's what they buy and how it ultimately affects the market,'' she said. ''If people are going home with bunches of dried lavender in their suitcases, is the farmer that grows that going to keep growing green garlic, too?''
 Paul Arenstam, a chef who just opened the restaurant Americano in the new Hotel Vitale across the street from the market, is doing his best to balance the needs of farmer and tourist. Earlier this month he went to the meeting of market farmers to introduce himself. The farmers weren't impressed with the new, eco-friendly hotel or the enthusiastic chef. To them, the hotel was nothing more than another 200 rooms filled with tourists who look but don't buy. 
 Mr. Arenstam recognized that tourists would be tempted to collect armfuls of vegetables at the market, but, away from their kitchens, would have no use for raw ingredients. So he allows visitors to store food in his walk-in until they go home.
 ''Everyone's a tourist sometime,'' he said. ''If you're from Omaha or wherever, you want to see how the farmers here do it.'' 
 And like Mr. Arenstam, a good many San Francisco chefs use the market as a touchstone for what grows in Northern California fields. It is a town square of sorts for San Francisco's food elite. 
 But for some, the market conjures the old Yogi Berra quote ''Nobody goes there anymore; it's too crowded.'' Some locals turn instead to smaller markets in Berkeley or Oakland or to the much older Alemeny farmers' market south of downtown. Farmers and shoppers alike are more ethnically diverse at Alemeny, and the produce, while not as pristinely organic, is less expensive.
 For Molly Watson, a cooking instructor and writer, the Alemeny is a comfortable pair of sweat pants and the Ferry Plaza market a pair of Italian-cut trousers.
 ''Since it's conceived as a foodie tourist site, it takes away the whole neighborhood market feel,'' she said of Ferry Plaza.
 ''You go with $40 or $60 cash and you're out of money within 15 minutes, especially if you want to get a sandwich or something. I go with $20 or $25 to Alemeny and I'm eating salad all week.''
 Frog Hollow Peaches, sold at the Ferry Plaza market by Al Courchesne, have come to be the symbol of the cost debate. Perfectly grown and sweet beyond reason, they are Ms. Waters's favorite. Made into jelly, the peaches coat Thomas Keller's foie gras. They are the juicy couture of produce; one peach can cost around $3.
 ''That makes me crazy, to tell you the truth,'' said Peggy Knickerbocker, vice president of the market board and author of ''The Ferry Plaza Farmers Market Cookbook,'' due out next spring. ''I think people really have to be careful about their price. It becomes cause for ridicule if they're not.''
 In the larger landscape of food production and shopping, Ms. Waters sees paying a few dollars more for sustainably produced food as making a donation to small farmers. ''Maybe they'll make $5,000 more a year. Well, hooray,'' she said. ''We're not making millionaires here. We are supporting sustainable agriculture.''


CORRECTION-DATE: May 11, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article on April 27 about the Ferry Plaza farmers' market in San Francisco misspelled the name of another market there. It is Alemany, not Alemeny. The name of a type of beet was also misspelled. It is Chioggia, not chioga.

HEADLINE: Amid the Rubble, After London Took It

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:

London 1945
Life in the Debris of War
By Maureen Waller
Illustrated. 512 pages. St. Martin's Press. $35.
 In 1940, at the height of the blitz, Britain adopted a defiant slogan: ''London can take it.'' By 1945, the mood had changed. Germany's V-2 rockets were wreaking horrific damage on the city and its suburbs. Years of rationing, scarcity and endless queues had taken a toll. In Croydon, a 57-year-old woman turned on the gas and left a note that read, ''This war lasted too long for me; I can't go on.'' Despite the brave face, London could not take much more.
 In her thoroughly engrossing ''London 1945,'' Maureen Waller describes a city on its last legs, hanging on desperately in the waning months of the war and looking forward, with a forlorn sort of hope, to a newer, better peacetime Britain. 
 Mingling statistical data with eyewitness accounts, she builds up a detailed picture of daily life in London that moves easily from the horrific (mangled flesh hanging from trees) to the mundane (the annoyance of having to wear short socks). Food, fashion and bombs all get equal treatment, for the very good reason that Londoners spent at least as much time worrying about how to get a lamb chop as they did about dodging the next rocket.
 Ms. Waller, the author of ''1700: Scenes From London Life'' and ''Ungrateful Daughters,'' a study of the Glorious Revolution, begins with the bombs. The V-1, or doodlebug, had already claimed thousands of lives by late 1944, when it was supplanted by the even more frightening V-2, which approached its targets silently, prompting one London woman to call them ''bombs with slippers on.'' 
 Somehow, the idea of a pilotless bomb made the ''second blitz'' worse than the one at the beginning of the war. ''You accepted a plane with a man in it,'' one Londoner said. ''You couldn't accept something that was automatic. It was this that struck psychologically at us in such a way that it destroyed our nerves.''
 It was not only the bombs that wore on nerves. Londoners also made do on food rations that Americans could not even begin to imagine. No American ever had to eat the infamous Woolton pie. Named after the minister of food, it was a vegetable pie thickened with oatmeal and commonly topped with potato. The average town dweller could expect to eat three eggs a month. Many women, who did without so that their children could eat more, took up smoking to cut their hunger pangs. Onions were so precious they were offered as raffle prizes. It came as a severe blow that after the war the food situation only grew worse.
 Clothing allowances were just as severe. Trouser cuffs were banned, and young boys had to go on wearing shorts until age 12. Women could only dream of stockings, at least until the Americans began turning up in large numbers. As a makeshift, they painted their legs with gravy browning or cocoa. In February 1945, a small ray of fashion sunshine peeked through the clouds. The ban on heels higher than two inches was lifted. But shoes remained so scarce that they created a new phenomenon, the meta-queue, as women stood in line hoping to get the right to join a queue for shoes. 
 By and large, Ms. Waller writes, Londoners perceived the rationing system as fair and put up with it. That does not mean that the wartime economy was entirely on the up and up. With the police ranks thinned by war, and illegal guns proliferating (some sold by American G.I.'s), opportunity beckoned for a new breed of London criminal, the spiv, ''distinct in his loud, garish clothing, his gait an imitation of the Chicago gangsters in Hollywood films.'' In one of her more colorful chapters, Ms. Waller describes the exploits of the Elephant Boys of Bermondsey and the criminal gangs that flourished along the docks. Sometimes the heist would be jewelry, a smash and grab on Bond Street. But it might just as easily be a consignment of frozen turkeys. There was a white-hot market for anything and everything. ''Sleek in their Savile Row suits, their molls dripping with furs and jewels, London's underworld kings were having the time of their lives,'' Ms. Waller writes.
 It was not only the criminals who benefited from the war. Ms. Waller also finds a silver lining in the social changes brought about by it. Concern for civilian morale forced the government to pay attention to its citizens, and to listen to their fears and hopes in a way it never had before. Like the New Deal in the United States, wartime social-welfare programs in Britain laid the foundation for a different kind of postwar state, one in which government took a much more active role in such areas as health care and housing. Under pressure, class distinctions began to erode.
 ''The war had been a democratizing process,'' Ms. Waller writes. ''Rationing had succeeded in instilling in people's minds the idea of fair shares for all: as Churchill's daughter Sarah pointed out to him, the socialist policies that had been introduced in wartime had proved to be a force for good, not harm.'' 
 After getting a taste of Churchill-sponsored socialism during the war, the British electorate responded by throwing their wartime leader out of office just months after V-E Day and handing the Labor Party a landslide victory. It was a vote for houses, food and jobs, for a new, more equitable Britain. But London in 1945 looked like a defeated city. Cool Britannia was a long way off.

HEADLINE: Often Shunted Into Special Schools, Gypsies Fight Back

BYLINE: By DINAH A. SPRITZER

DATELINE: OSTRAVA, Czech Republic 

 BODY:
Iveta Bihariova recalls how she nervously watched her 9-year-old son, Ivan, while a psychiatrist in a white lab coat threw colored candies on the floor. 
 ''I rushed to pick up the candy because I didn't know that it was a test,'' said Mrs. Bihariova, taking a break from picking up garbage strewn across a Roma, or Gypsy, housing project in the Czech city of Ostrava, close to the Polish border.
 ''After that, the psychiatrist told me that since Ivan didn't pick up the candy, he was too slow and should go to a special school.'' 
 Czech Republic officials estimate that up to 75 percent of the Roma children in the country are like Ivan -- attending schools intended for the mentally disabled and receiving what human rights groups contend is a substandard education that can lead to a lifetime of unemployment, dependence on welfare and even crime. Now, advocates for Roma rights have begun legal action to change the situation. 
 The country's 120 ''special'' schools, the term traditionally used to describe the combined elementary and middle schools for the mentally disabled in the Czech Republic, were created by the Communist government in the 1960's. Their graduates are largely ineligible to apply to college or to obtain a job beyond the most basic manual labor. 
 According to the State Department's annual human rights report issued in March, 90 percent of the children in Czech special schools are Roma. Critics of the government's education policy charge that this is the result of bias, and lawyers representing Roma children have filed the first systematic legal challenge against school discrimination in Europe. 
 The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, is considering whether to hear the case of 18 teenagers from Ostrava who argue that their placement in special schools in the late 1990's violated their right to protection against discrimination granted under Czech and European law.
 Their lawyer, James A. Goldston, senior counsel for the European Roma Rights Center in Budapest, compared the Ostrava case to Brown v. Board of Education, the landmark 1954 United States Supreme Court decision that moved a nation toward desegregation.
 ''What you have in the Czech Republic, and to some extent Eastern Europe, is de facto segregation. The majority of Roma children in the Czech Republic get a second-class education and never get past the eighth grade, by the Czech government's own admission,'' Mr. Goldston said. 
 Jiri Pilar, director of the Department of Special Needs Education for the Czech Republic, denies any systematic discrimination against Roma and, instead, blames parents for their children's poor educational results.
 ''We simply have not been successful in getting Roma parents to take sufficient interest in their children's education,'' he said. ''I worked in a diagnostic institute for 15 years, and even in the case where a Roma child could potentially make it in a normal school, the parents simply didn't care enough. They didn't push.''
 A panel of judges at the Strasbourg court held preliminary hearings in March. A court decision on whether to accept the case is due within a few weeks. If the Ostrava plaintiffs win, experts say, the case could have consequences across Europe, particularly in countries like Bulgaria, Romania and Slovakia.
 ''As Europe continues to grow increasingly diverse, this case is of great significance for all minorities because it makes clear that racial discrimination has no place in Europe,'' said Rachel Denber, director of the Europe and Central Asia division at Human Rights Watch. 
 The Roma, dark in complexion, are thought to have migrated to Europe from India centuries ago. Their nomadic life set them apart from other groups, and their history has been one of poverty and persecution. They are the poorest and largest minority group in Europe, with large numbers concentrated in former Communist countries.
 Under communism, they received generous state subsidies; today, both Roma and government representatives say that assistance has led to a cycle of dependence.
 Making up about 2.5 percent of the Czech population, the country's 300,000 Roma have a 70 percent unemployment rate. They also have significantly higher crime rates than the non-Roma population, Roma leaders concede. Few Roma finish high school.
 ''We have to convince the Roma that to live like regular decent people, if I can put it like that, is a lot better for them than to live from hand to mouth on the edge of society just because they don't want to go to school and work,'' Mr. Pilar said.
 Kumar Vishwanathan, an Ostrava activist and a teacher from India credited with first exposing the inequity in Roma education, argued that the cultural bias of Czech officials relegates Roma children to the special schools, a path that continues the cycle of dependency and social pathology.
 ''First, the tests that evaluate mental ability and determine what school these kids were sent to were always in Czech,'' he said. ''Roma kids speak a Roma dialect or ghetto Czech, so they were doomed to fail.''
 But Mr. Vishwanathan acknowledged that Roma parents, who must approve their children's placement, often want the youngsters to be in special schools because they are more comfortable there. 
 Ms. Bihariova, mother of Ivan, now 14, said he is faring well in special school. ''It's easier for him; the teachers are nicer to Roma there,'' she said. Jan Ziga, a Roma teenager who is also from Ostrava, said he sought a transfer to a special school ''because the teachers in the normal school called Roma nasty names.'' 
 The government has taken several steps to improve Roma education.
 Tests were standardized in 1998, based on a British model that Mr. Pilar said removed cultural bias. Children attending special schools were given the chance to take an extra year of coursework and apply to regular high schools, although only a tiny percentage have done so.
 The state is also continuing to increase the number of Roma teaching assistants, who have proven successful in bridging the gap between Roma students and teachers in regular classrooms. A new education law that went into effect in January requires standard schools to accommodate children with behavioral or learning problems. Officials say they hope this change will mean more Roma children will attend regular schools. 
 The effort may come too late for Katrin Dzurkova, one of the 18 teenagers in the Ostrava lawsuit.
 Now 13, she was 6 when she was told that she belonged in a special school, although she has not given up hope.
 After hesitating and then fighting embarrassment, she explained in an almost inaudible voice why she is going to court.
 ''I want a better education; I want a job. I want to be normal,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Despite Criticisms, Thomas Krens Plans Still Other Guggenheims

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
Sitting in his small SoHo office after returning from Russia recently, Thomas Krens, director of the Guggenheim Museum, was flashing images, graphs and numbers from a laptop onto a flat-screen television. He was consumed by what he had seen in Russia, where he met with officials from the Kremlin Museum, as well as the deputy minister of culture, to negotiate loans for ''Russia!,'' a major exhibition that will fill the entire Fifth Avenue Guggenheim Museum when it opens in September.
 He described the wide range of treasures he hoped to borrow and the exhibition's enormous cost: about $4 million, approximately what the Metropolitan Museum of Art spent to mount its blockbuster Byzantium exhibition last year. He said $2 million of the show's cost was being paid by the charitable foundation run by Vladimir Potanin, president and chairman of one of the largest private Russian conglomerates and a member of the Guggenheim board. Mr. Krens was fascinated by the freewheeling spirit of Russia's new generation of capitalists. 
 ''Russia in the 21st century has the largest concentration of natural resources around the world,'' Mr. Krens said. ''I've never felt such a concentration of money. It's a boom town,'' he said of Moscow, ''as close to Las Vegas as anything I've seen. The entrepreneurial energy is enormous.'' 
 A few weeks ago, three months after triumphing in a ''him or me'' showdown with Peter B. Lewis, then the Guggenheim chairman, who demanded he stay focused on New York, the unchastened Mr. Krens took off for Mexico City with a delegation of board members, including the new chairman and president. Their purpose was to meet with President Vicente Fox about a possible Guggenheim satellite in Guadalajara. The museum is also in serious talks with Singapore. 
 Such developments were at the heart of Mr. Lewis's objections and subsequent resignation in January. Mr. Lewis, the museum's biggest benefactor (during his 11 years on the board, he gave the Guggenheim about $77 million, nearly four times as much as any other board member in the museum's history), walked away, saying the museum should concentrate on housekeeping at home rather than opening more Guggenheims around the world. 
 But Mr. Krens, 58, whose reputation as a motorcycle-mad, globe-trotting visionary unconcerned about costs has made him the talk of the art world, doesn't seem much changed since that three-hour meeting in January. Asked where his priorities are now -- home or abroad -- he said, ''Both.'' 
 The key to his business plan is hiring big-name architects to design buildings that will become tourist destinations in themselves, like the Guggenheim's Frank Lloyd Wright building on Fifth Avenue or its Frank Gehry-designed Guggenheim in Bilbao, Spain. And though the museum's new leaders express caution about the budget, they share Mr. Krens's vision. 
 At a cocktail party last week at the Four Seasons restaurant to celebrate the museum's new chairman, William L. Mack, a real estate developer, and its first female president, Jennifer Stockman, Ms. Stockman talked of ''bringing art and culture to cities around the world.''
 ''We are at a pivotal juncture to make a great institution even greater,'' Ms. Stockman said.
 Mr. Mack, the founder of Apollo Real Estate Advisers and chairman of the Mack-Cali Realty Corporation, a real estate investment trust, stressed that he had created a more active board whose priorities were ''budgetary responsibility, building the endowment and promoting education.'' 
 Still, he emphasized that the Guggenheim was and always would be an international presence: ''It is an international museum whose home is in New York.'' 
 Today's board is driven by leading members of New York's real estate world who share Mr. Krens's dreams of empire building. Besides Mr. Mack, one of five trustees who joined the board two years ago, they include Stephen M. Ross, founder and chief executive of the Related Companies, and Robert C. Baker, the chairman and chief executive of Purchase, a New York-based national realty and development corporation. Ms. Stockman is president of Stockman & Associates, consultants specializing in technology. 
 No one questions the success of the Guggenheim Bilbao, which has been attracting more than 900,000 visitors a year since it opened in 1997, or even the recently expanded Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice, which attracted 350,000 last year, 50,000 more than in 2003. 
 But some board members -- a defeated minority who decline to be quoted but say they believe the success of these satellites are exceptions -- argue that the Guggenheim has no business trying to spread its name any further when there is so much work to be done at home. 
 Attendance at the Guggenheim plummeted after 9/11, as it did at all museums in New York City. But for the Guggenheim, the drop was particularly serious. Because so many of its visitors are tourists who come especially to see the building, a month after 9/11, admissions were down almost 60 percent, and revenue was about half of what it was supposed to be. About one-fifth of its staff had been laid off. It also was also forced to delay the opening of its branch in Las Vegas, and when it did open, only one portion survived: the Guggenheim Hermitage Museum, which is jointly run with the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, Russia, and plans its exhibitions in collaboration with the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. The Guggenheim's SoHo branch also closed in 2001. 
 Slowly, the museum has been making its way back, partly through the success of its satellites, which also include a Guggenheim in Berlin. 
 Mr. Krens said he was constantly approached by cities wanting to share in the so-called Bilbao effect. Besides Guadalajara -- to be designed by the French architect Jean Nouvel, the Mexican architect Enrique Norten or Asymptote Architects in SoHo -- and Singapore, other outposts under consideration include one in Rio de Janeiro, also designed by Mr. Nouvel; a Hong Kong museum that would be part of a larger development designed by Lord Norman Foster; and a collaboration with the Hermitage in St. Petersburg on an extension of the Hermitage with a Guggenheim component. 
 There are financial advantages to opening Guggenheims around the world. Cities that approach the Guggenheim about building a museum can expect to spend $150 million to $200 million, including land and construction, Anthony Calnek, a Guggenheim spokesman, said. The cost depends on the location of the museum and its size and complexity. The host city or country would also be expected to set aside funds every year to buy art; Bilbao, for example, spends $10 million annually on acquisitions and must subsidize operating deficits and pay a licensing fee. The Guggenheim Foundation also works with partners in buying and commissioning art. In Berlin, Deutsche Bank has commissioned works by artists like James Rosenquist, Jeff Koons and Gerhard Richter, which the bank owns 50-50 with the Guggenheim. Museum officials say that they hope that the Guggenheim Bilbao will buy back Deutsche Bank's share. 
 Mr. Krens defends himself against accusations of overspending and neglecting acquisitions and programming. He will probably be forever haunted by the critical ridicule of shows like ''The Art of the Motorcycle,'' in 1998, and ''Giorgio Armani,'' in 2000, even though they drew enthusiastic crowds. 
 ''These perceptions are hard to dislodge,'' Mr. Krens said one morning, sipping an espresso in the lobby of the Mercer hotel in SoHo. He rattled off several historic exhibitions that rank among the 10 best-attended shows in the Guggenheim's history: ''Africa: The Art of a Continent,'' in 1996; ''China: 5,000 Years,'' in 1998, ''Brazil: Body & Soul,'' in 2001; and ''The Aztec Empire,'' which closed in February. He named some major retrospectives: those of Claes Oldenburg, Mr. Rosenquist, Roy Lichtenstein, Ellsworth Kelly, Robert Rauschenberg, Roni Horn and Matthew Barney.
 During his 17 years as director, most of the board has stuck by Mr. Krens. An imposing 6 feet 5 inches tall, with an M.B.A. in management from Yale, he has a kind of shy uneasiness in social situations that is often taken for arrogance. Yet he is able to talk business in an articulate, persuasive manner that the board clearly admires. 
 ''Because of Tom's vision, we are in an exciting moment now,'' Ms. Stockman said. ''He's very smart and very persuasive. But we can't do it all.'' 
 The New York, Venice and Las Vegas museums are part of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, whose endowment was approximately $45.4 million as of Dec. 31, 2004. An additional $25 million in cash and pledges made thus far in 2005 brings the current endowment to $70 million. Another $25 million -- including $15 million from Mr. Lewis -- has been committed by trustees and the city for the restoration of the landmark Wright building. ''By June, we should have another $15 million raised'' for the endowment, Mr. Krens said. ''We're not exactly where we want to be, which is at about $150 million, but we're at a historic high.'' 
 As for the operating budget, ''We are operating at better than break even,'' he said. The museum has also reduced the balance on public bonds issued in 1990 for the expansion and renovation of the Wright building, to $23.5 million as of Dec. 31, 2004,from $54.9 million. Mr. Calnek said, ''We are achieving a balanced budget through vigilant expense management and diversified revenue sources, including income from our affiliates, licensing and subsidiaries, as well as from feasibility studies for new branches.''
 With so many New Yorkers running a museum that has long felt cramped, it would be no surprise if another architect-designed space were proposed for New York. Late in 2002, a proposal for a $950 million Gehry-designed Guggenheim at the foot of Wall Street in Lower Manhattan fell through for lack of funds and negative environmental-impact studies. 
 Mr. Krens makes no secret of his consideration of the Hudson Yards on the West Side, where last summer a Gehry-designed Guggenheim was floated as part of the Jets Stadium proposal. (Mr. Ross of the Related Companies is a friend of Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development, who is pushing for the stadium.) While Mr. Mack said this was not one of the museum's priorities, he added that the board might consider it if a good opportunity came up. Mr. Krens, however, speaks of building a future Guggenheim there in more animated terms: ''Whether there's a stadium there or not, there may be three new subway stations,'' he said. ''This is the future of New York.''

HEADLINE: When the Dollar Bill Comes Due

BYLINE: By Catherine L. Mann and Katharina Pluck. 
Catherine L. Mann is a senior fellow and Katharina Pluck is a research assistant at the Institute for International Economics.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
OVER the last two years, the value of the dollar against the major currencies has dropped by more than 25 percent. With the dollar having depreciated so much, why haven't we seen a narrowing of the trade deficit, which in February (the latest month for which numbers are available) reached a new record of $61 billion? A dollar depreciation should bring about what economists call ''expenditure switching'': as the cost of imports rises, Americans should start buying more goods made at home; in turn, our exports become less expensive for foreigners, which means foreign demand for our products should rise. This shift in exchange rates and prices should eventually correct the country's trade deficit. 
 But so far, Americans' appetite for imports has yet to slow. That's because, with the exception of oil, imports have not become that much more expensive. One reason is that about 30 percent of our imports come from countries whose currencies have either moved little (the Thai baht), stayed stable (the Chinese yuan) or fallen (the Mexican peso) against the dollar. 
 But another reason is the worldwide decline during the 1990's of what economists call ''pass-through rates'': that is, the extent to which changes in the exchange rate induce changes in a country's import and export prices. A study by the economists Linda Goldberg and Jose Manuel Campa found that pass-through rates for the United States were significantly less than for other industrial countries. A 10 percent change in the dollar has generally yielded only a 2.5 percent change in American import prices within one quarter, and only a 4 percent price change after several quarters. Another study by the Federal Reserve found that pass-through was nearly zero. Indeed, in the case of the Japanese yen, even a 25 percent rise in the yen to dollar rate has generated little if any increase in the price we pay for Japanese goods. 
 Several factors help explain America's lower pass-through rate. Reduced inflation around the world has made prices less volatile, enabling exporters to ride out currency fluctuations without changing prices. As the United States imports more consumer goods (which have a lower pass-through rate compared with commodities), the overall pass-through rate for American imports has fallen. But perhaps most important, exporters don't want to risk losing market share in the large and competitive American market -- even if that means decreasing their own profit margins to keep prices stable in the United States. 
 Low pass-through means that Americans have not yet lost their purchasing power abroad despite the dollar depreciation, and therefore we can continue to enjoy living beyond our means. Over the long run, though, the enormous trade imbalance is not sustainable. Low pass-through means that it will take a much bigger drop in the dollar to change prices enough to induce switching and correct the trade deficit. In fact, our colleague Ted Truman calculates that between the depreciation of the dollar and the loss in spending power, this adjustment could end up costing every American $2,350. The larger the eventual depreciation, and the longer we wait, the greater our postponed pain promises to be.

HEADLINE: Earnings at BP Increase 29% On the Strength of Oil Prices

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
BP, the world's second-biggest publicly traded oil company, posted a 29 percent jump in first-quarter profit, helped by higher energy prices.
 Net income rose to $5.49 billion, or 25.6 cents a share, excluding gains in the value of its oil inventories, BP said yesterday. Revenues rose 16 percent, to $79.8 billion, from a year earlier. 
 BP, which is second to the Exxon Mobil Corporation, is the first of the world's large oil companies to report earnings from the first quarter, when New York crude oil averaged $57.60 a barrel, natural gas prices rallied in the United States and Europe and gasoline prices surged. 
 ''The sector has done well, driven by the oil price, but BP has done particularly well,'' said Tony Broccardo, who oversees $235 billion as chief investment officer at F&C Asset Management, an investment company based in London. ''The oil price is dramatically high,'' Mr. Broccardo said.
 Lord John Browne, the chief executive of BP, also based in London, said in an interview that economic growth was pretty good around the world and that demand for oil remained strong.
 BP's exploration and production unit accounted for the bulk of its increase, with pretax profit surging 53 percent from a year earlier, to a record $6.49 billion. First-quarter production averaged 4.1 million barrels a day, up from 4.02 million a day in the year-earlier period.
 BP invested almost $8 billion in Russia during 2003 and 2004 to create its TNK-BP joint venture, which now provides about a fourth of BP's oil and gas output and most of its growth. First-quarter net income for TNK-BP, which is based in Moscow, rose 82 percent from a year ago, to $411 million. 
 Gasoline prices at the pump have not risen as fast as wholesale prices, squeezing what are known as marketing margins. ''Retail marketing margins were extremely weak during the first quarter because of steadily rising product prices,'' and are improving in the second quarter versus a year earlier, Lord Browne said. Marketing sales fell 1.4 percent, to $3.93 billion, in the quarter versus a year earlier.
 In a related matter, BP executives said that they were not particularly bothered about a $936 million bill for back taxes for 2001 levied against TNK-BP by the Russian government.

HEADLINE: The notable prosperity of managed care plans may already be tapering off, some analysts say.

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
EVEN as the nation's health care costs keep climbing, the insurance companies that try to manage those costs have been prospering and increasing their profit. But some analysts see trouble ahead. 
 The share prices of three of the largest insurers -- WellPoint, UnitedHealth Group and Cigna -- reached 52-week highs early this month, at the peak of a two-year surge in the stocks of managed care companies. But since April 7, the big insurers have led the way down as a Standard & Poor's index of managed care stocks fell 8.4 percent while the broader S.&P. 500-stock index slipped only 3.3 percent. 
 It did not help when UnitedHealth, the second-largest managed care company, reported that it had added fewer members in the first quarter than it forecast. Some investors paid more attention to that than to the 41 percent profit increase UnitedHealth reported for the quarter. 
 UnitedHealth was showing the effects of a national trend. Although 175 million Americans are covered by employer-sponsored health insurance, further declines in manufacturing jobs and a spotty economic recovery have braked increases in enrollment. And by the latest count, the number of people without health insurance has risen to 45 million.
 ''Enrollment growth in the industry has slowed to a crawl,'' said Joseph D. France, an analyst at Banc of America Securities.
 So investors will be paying close attention today and tomorrow to the enrollment data for the first quarter to be reported by WellPoint and Aetna as part of their financial results. 
 WellPoint, the largest managed care company, with 28 million people enrolled, is expected today to report a 14 percent increase in profit, to $1.83 a share, from the first quarter a year earlier, according to analysts polled by Thomson Financial. 
 Aetna, the third largest, with 13.7 million enrollees, plans to report its results tomorrow. The analysts' consensus is $1.07 a share, up 22 percent from last year. 
 UnitedHealth, with 22.4 million members in its medical care programs, is widely admired for its strong management and its strategic moves into new product lines. One expanding business is sales to large employers offering their workers high-deductible policies combined with health savings accounts, although the 135,000 new members in the first quarter were a relatively modest addition by UnitedHealth standards.
 United's sharply higher profit was helped by lower-than-expected medical costs for hospitals and drugs. Patients spent less time in hospitals, possibly reflecting a push by insurers for prompt discharges, as well as higher co-payments required of patients. Drug outlays dropped as some doctors stopped prescribing Vioxx, Celebrex and similar expensive painkillers amid concern about their cardiovascular risks. And analysts say managed care stocks also benefited when many investors responded by bailing out of drug stocks and putting their money into organizations like WellPoint and UnitedHealth. 
 Whether this tide will soon turn is hard to predict. But movements in and out of drug stocks can make very big waves, said Jason Nogueira, a managed care analyst at T. Rowe Price. He said that the market capitalization of Pfizer, the biggest drug company, was greater than the combined market value of all the managed care companies. 
 Charles A. Boorady, an analyst at Smith Barney who is bullish on managed care, said some investors returning to pharmaceutical stocks might have contributed to the recent decline in H.M.O. share prices. He is forecasting strong earnings growth for managed care companies from 2006 to 2008, mainly as a result of Medicare drug coverage, which begins next year and will represent a new line of business for insurers that administer some of those drug plans. 
 But Sheryl R. Skolnick, an analyst at Fulcrum Global Partners, said the new Medicare drug benefit was still ''a great unknown opportunity.'' Companies that have said they will participate, including Aetna, UnitedHealth and WellPoint, expect to generate new profits, but, she said, ''until the bids are formulated and awarded, nobody knows how much to expect.'' 
 Certainly the new drug coverage presents plenty of risk for the insurers. They will receive a fixed monthly payment for each Medicare member, and it will be up to the companies to keep their costs below those payments. 
 ''There are danger signs out there,'' said Matthew Borsch, a Goldman Sachs analyst. He discounts the Medicare potential, except for PacifiCare and Humana, which already have lots of Medicare beneficiaries and so are ready to take on more. Medicare will be only ''an incremental positive'' for most of the companies, Mr. Borsch said. ''It doesn't transform the earnings picture.'' 
 He is more concerned about chances that nonprofit Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies, many sitting on fat surpluses, will eventually cut prices and force competitors to follow suit. ''We are pointing to a downside risk in the second half of 2005,'' he said. 
 Mr. France at Banc of America Securities is also gloomy. ''The business is going to get more difficult, after five years of expanding margins,'' he said. ''We think 2006 will be tough.''

HEADLINE: Shares Drop as Confidence Sags and Estimates Fall Short

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks declined yesterday after consumer confidence slipped to a five-month low and earnings from companies including Lexmark International and DuPont trailed analysts' estimates.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 10.36 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,151.74. The Dow Jones industrial average retreated 91.34, or 0.9 percent, to 10,151.13. The Nasdaq composite index declined 23.34 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,927.44. 
 The Conference Board's index of consumer sentiment dropped to 97.7 in April, its lowest since November, amid record gasoline prices and doubts about job prospects. Also, a government report showed home sales climbed to a record.
 ''The data is conflicting enough about whether the economy is slowing or inflation is abating that I think the market is in a holding pattern,'' said Jack White, director of research at Todd Investment Advisers in Louisville, Ky., which helps manage $3.5 billion.
 Concerns about slowing growth and rising interest rates have left benchmark indexes down for the year. The S.&P. 500, which last week set a 2005 low, has retreated 5 percent.
 Almost 10 stocks fell for every 3 that rose yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. Some 1.56 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board, 2.5 percent less than the three-month daily average.
 Lexmark, the maker of printers, slumped $11.05, or 14 percent, to $67.70. The company said it had first-quarter earnings, excluding some items, of 99 cents a share, missing the $1.03 average estimate in a Thomson Financial survey. 
 Hewlett-Packard, Lexmark's larger rival, fell 63 cents, to $20.47. The 3 percent drop was the second-biggest in the Dow average.
 DuPont, the chemical manufacturer, lost $1.55, to $47.03. The 3.2 percent decline was the steepest in the Dow average. First-quarter profit was 96 cents a share, less than the average analyst estimate of $1.01 in a Thomson poll.
 An S.&P. 500 gauge of materials shares declined 1.9 percent, the biggest drop among 10 industry groups, amid concern that slowing economic growth may curb demand for raw materials.
 U.S. Steel lost $1.91, to $44.51, erasing a 3.8 percent gain ignited by its better-than-expected earnings. The company said domestic prices would fall this quarter and earnings would decline in Europe because of rising raw material costs.
 Rockwell Automation, the world's largest maker of factory controls, fell $8.38, or 15 percent, to $48. The company said it had fiscal second- quarter profit, excluding some items, of 61 cents a share, 5 cents less than the average analyst estimate in a Thomson poll.
 Homebuilders' shares were helped by a Commerce Department report showing that new-home sales unexpectedly increased to the highest level on record. D.R. Horton added 28 cents, to $30.36. Hovnanian Enterprises rose 88 cents, to $50.90.
 Not all earnings reports trailed analysts' estimates. Altera, a maker of programmable chips, rose $1.35, to $20.60, after it reported first-quarter net income of 17 cents a share on sales of $264.8 million. Analysts had expected profit of 15 cents and revenue of $263.7 million.
 Genentech shares jumped $3.12, to $72.55. The company, citing two government studies, said its Herceptin breast-cancer medicine cut the risk of relapse among women newly diagnosed with an aggressive form of the disease.
 Treasury prices fell yesterday. By late in the day, the price of the benchmark 10-year note dropped 4/32, to 97 28/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 4.26 percent, from 4.25 percent on Monday. 
 Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of five-year inflation-protected notes and four-week bills:

HEADLINE: The Taking Of the Picture Lasts Longer

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Newburgh, N.Y. 

 BODY:
HAD Roger Sayre not sold his six-month, Amish-style beard on eBay -- or more precisely the exclusive worldwide rights to cut it off, however one saw fit -- we would not be sitting staring, staring, staring into the tinted mirror of a homemade 250-pound photography contraption at a tiny gallery on a deserted street on a cold night in this hard-luck city on the Hudson.
 But, as at least 23,000 eBay aficionados and attentive readers of newspaper minutiae learned around Labor Day last year, Mr. Sayre's historic sale was a smashing success, with one of his neighbors in Jersey City shelling out $129.99 for her prize.
 That event, despite some discussions, failed to make it into this newspaper, but Mr. Sayre, nothing if not persistent, was soon back with word of his next endeavor, a sort of ''Matthew Brady Meets the Twilight Zone'' art exhibit, then in Pleasantville, N.Y., which he described as a work that ''combines primitive photography with meditation, collaboration and endurance.'' 
 And now, three years after he first got the germ of the idea while commuting from Jersey City to his teaching job at Pace University in Pleasantville, here we were in a town that in its own way evokes meditation, collaboration and endurance, a place that is at once the Hudson Valley's economic laggard and so intriguing that maybe there is a cosmic purpose to Mr. Sayre's arrival here. But we get ahead of ourselves.
 Mr. Sayre, 41, whose other works include a kinetic sculpture made out of cascading lawn chairs, called ''Jacob's Lawnchair,'' and another called ''Aesop's Dog,'' in which the image of a dog is created by light passing through dog biscuits suspended from a chain-link gate, was driving home one day in 2002 when he had an idea.
 What, he wondered, would it look like if you took a slow-exposure picture of the lights from cars on the Saw Mill Parkway? So, naturally, he went out and rigged up a primitive device, a plywood box with a pinhole and photographic paper inside, positioned it on the roof of his 1993 Mazda and, risking looking like a terrorist transporting lord knows what, drove around to test it out. Sadly, it produced little more than a shadowy murk.
 Then he had another idea. What if you took the same sort of device and photographed people doing their best to sit still for an hour in a meditative experience designed to capture something close to their essential visage freed from posturing and artifice -- the complicated choreography of expression distilled to a single image?
 Soon he had constructed a device that looks like an outhouse with a mirror in front, or a sadistic interrogation station with an hour timer on top and two bare light bulbs suspended from bright orange extension cords. Subjects sit in the world's most uncomfortable metal chair, the better to keep them from falling asleep, staring at their faces reflected in the tinted mirror with a pinhole in the middle, as a 16-by-20-inch photographic image slowly takes form over the course of an hour. Before long, he had a collection of almost 100 spectral black and white photos, each one the distillation of an hour of sitting -- some blurred, some amazingly clear and distinct, with the air of the pictures psychics triumphantly produce of the dead.
 BUT then ghostly blurry images compacted over time feel right at home in Newburgh, a place of palpable decay and vibrant history, its distilled essence not at all clear. This is where George Washington had his military headquarters for more than a year, where Broadway was once the prime shopping street of the Hudson Valley, where Thomas Alva Edison created one of the first municipal power systems, where the glorious Victorian, neo-Classical and Federal architecture from the town's better days contrasts with dreary decrepitude, where shadowy packs of youths roam Broadway at night, where the resurgence of neighboring towns like Beacon, across the river, serves as a constant rebuke.
 ''This town is like a fly frozen in amber,'' said Don Herron, an artist and writer, who lives in a house built in 1836 where Edison stayed and experimented with the wiring ''It has so much history, and it's so underappreciated. You hope it's finally making a turnaround.'' 
 Outside the PhotoNewburgh gallery, a dog barks across the street from the House of Joy -- the First Born Church of the Living God. There's the wail of a freight train along the river, percussive thumps of Latin rap, raspy traffic on Liberty Street. The second hand of the timer sweeps along as the picture slowly takes form in the quiet of the empty gallery.

HEADLINE: World Briefing United Nations: Turk To Lead Influential Development Post

BYLINE: By Warren Hoge (NYT)

 BODY:
Secretary General Kofi Annan has chosen Kemal Dervis, left, a former Turkish finance minister and longtime World Bank official, to head up the United Nations Development Program, the organization's largest agency. Once confirmed by the General Assembly, Mr. Dervis, 56, will succeed Mark Malloch Brown, 51, now Mr. Annan's chief of staff, and will be the first head of the office from a recipient rather than a donor nation. Mr. Malloch Brown is a Briton, and the five previous administrators were Americans. As finance minister from 2001 to 2003, Mr. Dervis was widely credited with saving Turkey from economic collapse.

HEADLINE: Small Business Bets Big on Technology, Study Says

BYLINE: By EVE TAHMINCIOGLU

 BODY:
Small businesses are living up to their reputation as engines of economic growth, a new study shows. 
 In a survey to be released today by the Hewlett-Packard Company, 81 percent of 399 small businesses polled last month said they planned to increase their technology spending an average 20 percent in the next two to three years, and 68 percent said they would do so over the coming year. 
 The dollars will go toward items like computer hardware and software, upgrading of company Web sites, online services and even Web logs, the respondents said. 
 The Home Office Solutions Group, a seller of ergonomic chairs in Northbrook, Ill., is a case in point. Richard Burke, president of Home Office Solutions, says the company plans to double its technology spending this year. 
 Home Office was encouraged by results last year from its $50,000 investment in an ordering system, computers and an additional server. The equipment helped increase sales 25 percent, to $20 million, Mr. Burke said. The company projects a similar revenue increase this year, to $25 million, he said.
 But to achieve that, it needs a computer system able to track order flows ''from the moment a customer picks up the phone, goes into our stores or goes to our Web site'' to the moment the product is picked up or shipped, he said. 
 That means Home Office Solutions, which has 45 employees at three sites in the Chicago area, must invest $100,000 this year in programming time and hardware, he said. 
 John Rutledge, chairman and economist of Rutledge Capital, a private equity investment firm in Greenwich, Conn., said the Hewlett-Packard study had huge implications for the economy because small businesses account for half of the gross domestic product and for three out of every four new hires. 
 ''It means more growth, more productivity, more employment,'' he said. ''They are all going to grow faster than Wall Street thinks. I think this is going to continue for some time, so you don't want to bet against the economy.'' 
 Kevin Gilroy, senior vice president and general manager of Hewlett-Packard's segment for small and medium-size businesses, said increased investment in technology was inevitable, given that it had moved ''from being an appendage of small business to being the spinal cord.''
 Those questioned in the survey, he said, listed retaining customers and streamlining operations as their top objectives, and technology as the means to achieve them.
 The poll, which was conducted by Harris Interactive, is the latest barometer of small-business optimism in an economy that some analysts worry may be vulnerable to rising oil prices and interest rates. Last month, American Express released a survey that said 85 percent of the 627 small businesses it surveyed saw growth opportunities in the next six months, up from 72 percent in a similar poll a year earlier. The survey also found that 66 percent planned to make capital investments within the next six months, up from 59 percent in 2004. 
 ''Small businesses will progressively build out the technology, hardware, software adoption because there is real value to be derived,'' said Carl Haacke, a former White House economic policy adviser in the Clinton administration. Now that the dust has settled from the technology boom and busts, he said, ''they can focus on how to best apply and implement these technologies to their business needs.'' 
 Several factors are promoting the trend, Mr. Gilroy said. According to the survey, small-business owners spend an average of 27 percent of their time outside the office. That leads them to buy equipment like laptops and BlackBerry wireless e-mail devices that give them the freedom to roam. In the survey, 32 percent considered notebook computers a critical part of their business, and 36 percent ranked them as their highest priority in technology spending. 
 In addition, Mr. Gilroy said, small-business owners are more comfortable with technology today. And in many cases, their large customers require that they offer certain abilities, like online billing and ways to look up product information electronically. 
 Despite Home Office Solutions' optimistic expectations for sales this year, Mr. Burke said, only continuing investment in technology can sustain the growth.
 ''We need to have the right systems in place or else we'll fall short on the service end of our business,'' he said. ''That's what it's all about.''

HEADLINE: New Leader At University In Newark

BYLINE: By TINA KELLEY

DATELINE: NEWARK, April 26 

 BODY:
A new president was officially installed at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey on Tuesday, at a time when the school faces mounting questions about its financial practices, including the awarding of millions of dollars in bonuses to top officials and the spending of millions more on no-bid contracts. 
 John J. Petillo, who was appointed in November and had been interim president since June, was sworn in as the school's third president at a ceremony attended by about 2,400 people at the New Jersey Center for the Performing Arts. 
 Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey predicted in the ceremony that Dr. Petillo would serve ''with integrity and public accountability'' as the head of the nation's largest public health care university, and praised his plan to build the school's first residential halls in Newark. 
 The university ''is entering a new era, and Dr. Petillo is the best person to lead us that way,'' Mr. Codey said.
 Dr. Petillo, 58, a former chancellor at Seton Hall University and chief executive of Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, quoted from Mark Twain, Michelangelo, Daniel Boorstin, Thomas Edison, Aristotle, Maya Angelou and Toni Morrison, and referred to his roots as a son of Italian immigrants and the first in his family to graduate from college.
 ''Education was our salvation,'' Dr. Petillo said in his speech, part of which was delivered in Spanish.
 ''Today, I clearly and unequivocally reaffirm this university's service to the poor, the underserved, and the uninsured,'' he said.
 He only indirectly mentioned the recent controversies at the university and instead sought to draw connections to the revival of Newark and the growth of the university. 
 Before moving to the university, Dr. Petillo was the president of the Newark Alliance, a nonprofit group working for economic redevelopment and improved educational opportunities in the state's largest city. His doctorate is in counseling and personnel services, and he is the first president of the university without a medical degree. 
 The inauguration cost an estimated $200,000, according to Susan Preston, a university spokeswoman, who said it was paid for by the university's nonprofit foundation. The event followed a series of disclosures that have raised questions about spending at the public university. 
 Last month, the university and University Physician Associates of New Jersey Inc. agreed to pay a total of $1,407,448 to settle claims that they overcharged Medicare. In a separate matter, the office of insurance fraud prosecutor, part of the state attorney general's office, is reviewing the university's Medicaid billing system.
 Soon after Dr. Petillo was chosen as president, it was disclosed that he issued a $95,000 grant to Casa Israel, a nonprofit organization run by Stephen N. Adubato, an influential community leader in Newark. In addition, The Star-Ledger of Newark reported in March that the university had also issued a no-bid contract to a politically connected lobbyist, Ronald White. 
 The university has asked a retired state Supreme Court justice, James Coleman, to oversee an audit of all its recent no-bid contracts.
 Assemblywoman Loretta Weinberg, a Democrat from Bergen County who had criticized earlier, more elaborate plans for Dr. Petillo's inauguration and had called for its postponement, said Tuesday that as chairwoman of the Assembly Health and Human Services Committee she would hold a hearing on the university's steps to prevent future financial excesses. 
 She questioned $3 million in bonuses to the university's senior managers, including the outgoing president, Stuart Cook. ''They get over $200 million of taxpayer money there,'' she said, adding that she was confident of Dr. Petillo's abilities, but would wait and see if the problems are corrected.
 The university has 5,000 students in eight schools, with campuses in Newark, Camden, New Brunswick/Piscataway, and Stratford.

HEADLINE: Up, Down or Out

BYLINE: By Bob Dole. 
Bob Dole, the author of ''One Soldier's Story,'' is a former majority leader of the Senate.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IN the coming weeks, we may witness a vote in the United States Senate that will define the 109th Congress for the ages. This vote will not be about war and peace, the economy or the threat from terrorism. It will focus instead on procedure: whether the Senate should amend its own rules to ensure that nominees to the federal bench can be confirmed by a simple majority vote.
 I have publicly urged caution in this matter. Amending the Senate rules over the objection of a substantial minority should be the option of last resort. I still hold out hope that the two Senate leaders will find a way to ensure that senators have the opportunity to fulfill their constitutional duty to offer ''advice and consent'' on the president's judicial nominees while protecting minority rights. Time has not yet run out. 
 But let's be honest: By creating a new threshold for the confirmation of judicial nominees, the Democratic minority has abandoned the tradition of mutual self-restraint that has long allowed the Senate to function as an institution.
 This tradition has a bipartisan pedigree. When I was the Senate Republican leader, President Bill Clinton nominated two judges to the federal bench -- H. Lee Sarokin and Rosemary Barkett -- whose records, especially in criminal law, were particularly troubling to me and my Republican colleagues. Despite my misgivings, both received an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor and were confirmed. In fact, joined by 32 other Republicans, I voted to end debate on the nomination of Judge Sarokin. Then, in the very next roll call, I exercised my constitutional duty to offer ''advice and consent'' by voting against his nomination.
 When I was a leader in the Senate, a judicial filibuster was not part of my procedural playbook. Asking a senator to filibuster a judicial nomination was considered an abrogation of some 200 years of Senate tradition.
 To be fair, the Democrats have previously refrained from resorting to the filibuster even when confronted with controversial judicial nominees like Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. Although these men were treated poorly, they were at least given the courtesy of an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. At the time, filibustering their nominations was not considered a legitimate option by my Democratic colleagues -- if it had been, Justice Thomas might not be on the Supreme Court today, since his nomination was approved with only 52 votes, eight short of the 60 votes needed to close debate.
 That's why the current obstruction effort of the Democratic leadership is so extraordinary. President Bush has the lowest appellate-court confirmation rate of any modern president. Each of the 10 filibuster victims has been rated ''qualified'' or ''well qualified'' by the American Bar Association. Each has the support of a majority in the Senate. And each would now be serving on the federal bench if his or her nomination were subject to the traditional majority-vote standard. 
 This 60-vote standard for judicial nominees has the effect of arrogating power from the president to the Senate. Future presidents must now ask themselves whether their judicial nominees can secure the supermajority needed to break a potential filibuster. Political considerations will now become even more central to the judicial selection process. Is this what the framers intended?
 If the majority leader, Bill Frist, is unable to persuade the Democratic leadership to end its obstruction, he may move to change the Senate rules through majority vote. By doing so, he will be acting in accordance with Article I of the Constitution (which gives Congress the power to set its own rules) and consistently with the tradition of altering these rules by establishing new precedents. Senator Frist was right this past weekend when he observed there is nothing ''radical'' about a procedural technique that gives senators the opportunity to vote on a nominee.
 Although the Democrats don't like to admit it, in the past they have voted to end delaying tactics previously allowed under Senate rules or precedents. In fact, one of today's leading opponents of changing the Senate's rules, Senator Robert Byrd, was once a proponent of doing so, and on several occasions altered Senate rules through majoritarian means. I have great respect for Senator Byrd, but Senate Republicans are simply exploring the procedural road map that he himself helped create.
 In the coming days, I hope changing the Senate's rules won't be necessary, but Senator Frist will be fully justified in doing so if he believes he has exhausted every effort at compromise. Of course, there is an easier solution to the impasse: Democrats can stop playing their obstruction game and let President Bush's judicial nominees receive what they are entitled to: an up-or-down vote on the floor of the world's greatest deliberative body.

HEADLINE: Italians Angry Over Inquiry On Iraq Death

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL; Jason Horowitz contributed reporting for this article.; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: ROME, April 26 

 BODY:
Tensions between the United States and Italy surged Tuesday, as Italian politicians and citizens reacted furiously to leaked reports in the Italian news media that a joint investigation into the shooting death of an Italian agent in Baghdad would absolve American soldiers of guilt in the incident.
 The United States ambassador to Rome, Mel Sembler, met twice with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and his top aide at the government's headquarters to try to avert a crisis that could cost the United States one of its staunchest European allies in the Iraq conflict. 
 Mr. Berlusconi has kept 3,000 Italian troops in Iraq, even though Italy's involvement is wildly unpopular here. The news that the inquiry might absolve the American soldiers of all guilt comes at an extremely vulnerable moment for the beleaguered Mr. Berlusconi, who was forced to resign temporarily last week; he has since formed a new and tenuous coalition government. 
 On Tuesday, in a speech before Parliament, Mr. Berlusconi insisted that the investigation into the death of the intelligence agent, Nicola Calipari, was not finished, and criticized the news reports as ''unfortunate indiscretion.'' The speech had been intended to highlight Mr. Berlusconi's economic plans for Italy.
 ''The government will talk only at the opportune moment, when the investigation is finished,'' he said. ''The committee was formed to find out the truth, to give justice to the hero Calipari, to whom we bow. Our representatives are working well.''
 The findings of the investigating team, which includes an Italian general and an Italian ambassador, have not yet been released. But on Sunday and Monday, unidentified Army officials in the United States described some of its conclusions to reporters, setting off the imbroglio. 
 According to these accounts, the investigators found that the American soldiers who shot at a car carrying Mr. Calipari and an Italian journalist, Giuliana Sgrena, on the road to Baghdad's airport had generally followed standard procedures and instructions. 
 The two Italian members of the team returned to Rome from Baghdad on Saturday night, although it was not clear if they had come back in protest or for routine consultations. 
 United States officials here in Rome sought to play down the leaks about the investigation, also saying the two sides were still working on the report. ''We have not abandoned hope for a combined report,'' said an official with the American Embassy here. ''But there's some more work that needs to be done before that's going to happen,'' 
 Mr. Calipari was returning to Baghdad in a car on March 4 after securing the release of Ms. Sgrena, who had been kidnapped by insurgents. The car was peppered with bullets as it approached a temporary American military checkpoint, killing Mr. Calipari and wounding Ms. Sgrena and two other intelligence agents. 
 After the killing, the United States and Italian governments agreed to conduct a joint investigation, because accounts of witnesses -- including the journalist and the American soldiers -- varied greatly as to whether the car had been warned to slow down and how fast it had been traveling.
 The bullet-riddled car in which Mr. Calipari and Ms. Sgrena were riding was returned to Italy on Tuesday, now that the evidence-gathering phase of the investigation is over.
 In the last two days, the Italian news media has been filled with unattributed reports that the two Italian members of the team have refused to sign the investigation's report, because they disagree with its conclusions. On Tuesday, Ms. Sgrena, who is now recovered, called the investigation's conclusions ''a slap'' for the Berlusconi government. 
 Likewise, in Parliament, the many politicians who are antiwar and anti-Berlusconi, wasted no time in condemning the investigation, even as they confessed they had no formal knowledge of its findings. 
 Laura Cima, a member of Parliament with the Green Party, called the findings, ''a big slap in the face for the Italian government,'' and said the government should demand the truth ''if it can find any pride at all.''
 Antonio Falomi, a leftist senator, criticized the report that he said he had not yet seen, saying: ''The conclusions made by the report are not satisfactory. There are too many shadowy points.''
 As if the rain of political criticism was not enough for Mr. Berlusconi, Italian prosecutors in Milan were once again planning to indict him, a former media magnate, for financial crimes, Reuters reported Tuesday.

HEADLINE: LAST SYRIA FORCE LEAVES LEBANON

BYLINE: By HASSAN M. FATTAH; Katherine Zoepf contributed reporting from Damascus, Syria, for this article, and John Kifner and Warren Hoge from New York.

DATELINE: RIYAQ, Lebanon, April 26 

 BODY:
The last of Syria's troops left Lebanon on Tuesday after a bittersweet ceremony near the border, ending a military presence that for 29 years helped Syria control Lebanon and confront Israel through proxy militias. 
 Some Lebanese politicians and American officials expressed concern, however, that Syria might continue exercising influence here through intelligence officials and its Lebanese political allies. And Secretary General Kofi Annan expressed concern at the United Nations that Lebanese militias, including Hezbollah, had not yet been disarmed. 
 As the remaining soldiers crossed into Syria -- driven out by international pressure and by Lebanese demonstrations over the past two months -- politicians here also acknowledged that serious challenges now faced a more independent Lebanon, not least a democracy hobbled by sectarian divisions and bitter memories of civil war. The first test is fast approaching, with the cabinet expected to call for new elections before May 31. 
 On Tuesday morning, Lebanese and Syrian military officers gathered at an airbase in this Bekaa town, about 10 miles from the Syrian border, to bid farewell to 300 or so crisply uniformed Syrian troops and top intelligence officers, and hundreds of other troops securing roads to the border. Military bands from both countries played as commanders exchanged medals before dignitaries and military attaches from numerous countries, including the United States, France and North Korea. 
 ''Brothers in arms, thank you for your sacrifices,'' said Gen. Michel Suleiman, commander of Lebanon's army, who bid the soldiers goodbye with an Arabic term meaning ''Until we meet again.'' ''Together we shall always remain brothers in arms in the face of the Israeli enemy.''
 Prominently featured in the audience was Maj. Gen. Rustom Ghazali, Syria's latest top intelligence chief in Lebanon, a post from which Syria was widely believed to have held the reins of Lebanese politics for years. 
 Syria entered Lebanon in 1976, a year after civil war broke out, as part of an Arab peacekeeping force. But the Syrian role took a serpentine course. The government of the late Hafez al-Assad, father of the current Syrian president, Bashir al-Assad, befriended and betrayed various factions, and for the past 15 years, Syria was dominant. 
 The Syrians were invited in by Suleiman Franjieh, a Maronite Catholic who was then president, as a counterweight to Palestinian guerrillas who had allied with leftist Muslim forces. But the Christians later became enemies of the Syrians and, in recent years, their sharpest critics. 
 Meanwhile, while ostensibly championing the Palestinians, Syria set compliant Shiite Muslim militiamen against refugee camps in the 1980's. And the Syrians were blamed by most Lebanese for assassinations of prominent political figures.
 The Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 seemed likely at first to end Syrian influence. But then Bashir Gemayel, who was Israel's ally, was assassinated shortly after his election as president, and his militiamen massacred Palestinians. The United States sent a peacekeeping force but it left after 242 marines and sailors died in a Shiite suicide bombing. Israeli troops eventually withdrew under attacks by the Shiite group Hezbollah.
 After another half-decade of civil war, a fragile peace was reached in 1989 and Syria was to leave. But Syria only solidified its power in 1990 when the United States and France, in effect, turned a blind eye in Lebanon and in exchange got a symbolic deployment of Syrian troops in the first Persian Gulf war. 
 By then, in the anarchic fighting, the Christian-led Lebanese Army had massacred a Christian militia and the Syrians, in turn, had attacked and crushed the Lebanese Army. At that point, the civil war ended with Syria firmly in charge.
 Last September the United Nations, in Resolution 1559, called for Syria's withdrawal, and for the disarming of all militias in the country. Late last year, Prime Minister Rafik Hariri resigned his post and called for Syria to comply. He was assassinated Feb. 14, setting off popular demonstrations fueled by a widespread belief that Syria was involved in the killing. The protests only increased international pressure on Syria to get out. 
 ''Syria has now fulfilled that demand,'' said Gen. Ali Habib, leader of the Syrian Army. ''Syria never had any desires or ambitions in Lebanon except to preserve its unity.''
 Shortly after the two-hour ceremony ended, General Ghazali and his intelligence officers piled into cars and drove across the border. Buses and jeeps filled with troops followed. The last four Syrian soldiers in Lebanon, who had been holding watch at the border, left in a television van. 
 A United Nations team was given the task of verifying that the Syrians had indeed pulled out completely.
 ''I respect the Syrians for having left without any conflict with us,'' said Tanious Abu Hamad, mayor of Saghbin, who attended the ceremony. ''But now it all comes down to us. Our problems are now our own.'' 
 The problems are numerous. Lebanon's Syrian-backed president, Emile Lahoud, remains in power; the security services are still modeled on Syria's and have a reputation for corruption, and the Lebanese political system, by law, remains built on sectarianism. 
 At the United Nations, Mr. Annan said the departure of the Syrians represented ''significant and noticeable progress.'' 
 But in a report to the Security Council, he noted that there had been no action by Lebanon on disarming militias, armed Palestinian groups and vigilantes, as mandated by the Council, and that the Beirut government had not heeded calls to extend its authority to areas of southern Lebanon vacated by Israel in May 2000 and now under the authority of Hezbollah.
 Meanwhile, the future of the economy, which depends on tourism and foreign investment, will remain uncertain as long as confidence in the government and the prospects for security are in question. 
 ''We have clearly succeeded in our sovereignty revolution, but we have not yet succeeded in our democratic revolution,'' said Chibli Mallat, director of the Center for the Study of the European Union and a prominent lawyer in Beirut. ''The revolution only succeeds when the president resigns and when the confessionalism in politics gives way to national representation.'' ''Confessionalism'' means sectarianism in Lebanese parlance. 
 But on Tuesday night, the Parliament was still squabbling over a districting law just two days before a constitutional deadline for scheduling elections in time to hold them by May 29, as Prime Minister Najib Mikati has promised. 
 ''We are all waiting for the elections as a prerequisite for defining the role of Lebanon,'' said an opposition legislator, Nayla Mouawad. 
 In Syria the soldiers were met by rice-throwing well-wishers apparently organized by the government. But the sense of humiliation was hard to hide. The Syrians generally dismissed the Lebanese as ungrateful, said Sami Moubayed, a Syrian political analyst. 
 ''But the intellectual elite understands very well how Syria's place in the world has changed,'' Mr. Moubayed said. ''The nationalists among them feel that everything Hafez al-Assad built is being squandered.''

HEADLINE: Survey Finds Many Have Poor Grasp of Basic Economics

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
With Washington considering whether to strengthen Social Security by giving Americans more responsibility for their own retirements, a survey released yesterday suggested that the typical American does not know enough about economics to prosper in such a system.
 The survey, conducted by Harris Interactive, found, for example, that about half of American adults did not know that if they kept their money at home, in cash, they were at greater risk of losing ground to inflation than if they invested it elsewhere. 
 ''Given recent signs that inflation might be increasing, this is quite a frightening finding,'' said Alan B. Krueger, an economics professor at Princeton University who served as chief economist for the National Council on Economic Education, a business group that commissioned the survey. 
 The survey of 3,512 adults and 2,242 high school students also suggested that the intense attention Americans have paid to the pronouncements of the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, in the last few years had done little to help people grasp the role of interest rates. One-third of adults were unable to explain how falling interest rates would affect business. 
 Young people -- those the current Social Security proposals are intended to help the most -- performed more poorly on the survey's questions than adults. Barely half of the high school students polled could correctly state the role of the stock market in the economy, with a few choosing the option that it makes stock prices rise.
 Fewer than half the students could accurately define the term ''budget deficit.'' And there was confusion about the purpose of mutual funds, with some students stating that they provided higher returns than individual stocks, and others stating that they guaranteed a steadier income. Only 15 percent of students understood that the purpose of mutual funds was to provide diversification.
 Mr. Krueger, who contributes a column for the business section of The New York Times, said these findings were disturbing, given the big increase in the number of households that hold stocks and mutual funds. 
 ''Many Americans are potentially open to scams because they don't understand the purpose of the financial markets,'' he said yesterday. 
 Other analysts said they thought that the findings added to a growing body of evidence that the typical American is poorly equipped to take advantage of what proponents call the ownership society: a future in which individuals are free to invest their own retirement money, rather than having to accept the returns offered by the Social Security program or a group retirement program at work, like a pension plan. Many surveys have shown the public has doubts about the Social Security program, with young people, in particular, confident that they could do better by investing on their own. 
 Yet even their concern is poorly informed, according to the Employee Benefits Research Institute, a nonpartisan research organization that is financed by companies and labor unions. The institute's own research showed that fewer than 20 percent of workers thought that Social Security would be their primary source of income in retirement, even though Social Security is currently the primary income source for more than two-thirds of retirees.
 ''It is abundantly clear that there are a large number of Americans who are completely unprepared to make these decisions,'' said Steve Blakely, the institute's editor and communications director. 
 Mr. Blakely said the institute's own research on financial literacy measures the public's understanding of economics differently from the economic education council's survey, but shows a similarly low level of understanding. The institute has found that fewer than 40 percent of American adults have ever tried to live on a budget, for instance, and that large numbers of Americans cannot tell the difference between a stock and a bond. Even though the Social Security Administration sends all participating workers individual annual statements, the institute found that only 18 percent of Americans know at what age they will be eligible to retire with full benefits. 
 The purpose of the National Council on Economic Education is to raise the public's understanding of the economy. It created a basic standard for high school level financial literacy in 1997 and conducted its first survey in 1999. The economic literacy of both students and adults has improved since then, but only slightly.

HEADLINE: Social Issues That Bolster Bush Fail the Hapless British Tories

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: LONDON, April 26 

 BODY:
At a time when American conservatives are ascendant, the British Conservative Party is adrift, troubled by internal feuding, casting about for a defining theme and struggling to defeat a relatively unpopular incumbent, Prime Minister Tony Blair, in an election nine days away.
 Most polls and analysts say the Conservative Party, led by Michael Howard, is heading for a historic third consecutive defeat against Labor on May 5. This prospect is all the more noteworthy given how vulnerable Mr. Blair is on issues of trust and leadership after his insistent assertions that prohibited weapons would be found in Iraq in the American-led war that he so strongly supported and that remains unpopular in Britain. 
 The political situation underlines what analysts describe as a growing divergence between the conservative movements here and in the United States, a decade and a half after the end of the era of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. It reflects fundamental differences between the political makeup of Britain and the United States, but also the success of Mr. Blair on the left -- and President Bush on the right -- in realigning their political landscape, analysts say. 
 The social issues that have proved crucial to Mr. Bush's success in the United States have little resonance in this country. Unlike Mr. Bush, Mr. Howard has not been able to use abortion and gay marriage to transcend economic matters in appealing to voters, and he voted in Parliament in support of the war in Iraq, the issue on which Labor officials judge Mr. Blair most vulnerable.
 ''Tony Blair has repositioned the Labor Party as a centrist, catch-all political party,'' said Anthony King, a professor of government at Essex University. ''And one of Michael Howard's difficulties is that neither he nor any Conservative Party figure has a clear perception of precisely what the Conservative Party should stand for. After a decade, the party still has not worked out what it wants to say.''
 Irwin M. Stelzer, a conservative scholar with the Hudson Institute in Washington and a columnist for The Sunday Times of London, said: ''There is no reason to vote for the Tories. They're not offering anything different on tax policy. They are not offering anything different on crime policy.''
 ''What the Tories have been unable to do -- partly because Blair has been so successful at stealing their clothes -- is to come up with a distinctively different policy,'' Mr. Stelzer said.
 At a Monday morning news conference, Mr. Blair taunted Mr. Howard with the memory of Mrs. Thatcher, asserting that this Conservative Party had yet to lay out an agenda that offered voters a sharp contrast with Labor. 
 At his own break-of-day news conference at his campaign headquarters up the street from Mr. Blair's campaign offices, Mr. Howard grimaced when Andrew Marr, the political editor of the BBC, asked him if his statement that Britain was about to ''sleepwalk its way to another five years of Labor'' were the words of ''someone who thinks they are losing the election campaign.''
 ''That is absolutely not what I think,'' responded Mr. Howard, who, as the face of the Conservative Party in this fast-paced campaign, has provided a notably colorless alternative to the ever-energetic and telegenic Mr. Blair.
 In many ways, the Conservative Party in its post-Thatcher era is like the Democratic Party in the post-Clinton era. Each is struggling to find a new defining theme in the face of an ideologically changing electorate and declining support.
 Since Mr. Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher reinvigorated political conservatism on both sides of the Atlantic in the 1980's, their movements have headed in notably different directions. Americans combined a free-market philosophy with a religious appeal and an emphasis on social issues. But British conservatives, having remade what was essential European social democracy, complete with government ownership of industry, have since stalled, providing an opening for Mr. Blair.
 Mr. Blair has seized the center on issues including taxes, crime, immigration and Iraq, leaving Mr. Howard little room to maneuver as he tries to persuade voters to oust Labor next week. Any effort he might make to exploit the Iraq war is complicated by his vote, and those of many other Conservatives, to support it. More fundamentally, as became clear since the departure of Mrs. Thatcher, there is a much stronger appetite here than in the United States for governmental social programs, constraining what would traditionally be a bedrock conservative call to cut government spending and taxes.
 As a result, Mr. Howard has been as apt in recent days to talk about increasing spending -- at a World Poverty event on Sunday, he called for a $:700 million ($1.3 billion) increase in British foreign aid -- as he has been to cut government spending and taxes. Tony Travers, a political analyst at the London School of Economics, noted that Conservatives had proposed shaving just $:4 billion off the $:450 billion budget proposed by Labor -- a difference that The Sun, a conservative newspaper, described as ''pathetic.'' 
 ''One of the abiding problems that Blair has presented the Conservatives is that he has managed to position himself just to the right of the British political center -- in a party that tends to be to the left of the political center,'' Mr. Travers said. ''It's not like Bush and Kerry where you had a massive gap in terms of their outlook of the world.''
 Mr. Travers argued that the Tories had been unable to keep pace with the social changes that have swept Britain over the past 30 years, as it evolved from a ''rather repressed society'' to a decidedly more socially liberal one. ''The Conservative Party still finds it quite difficult to operate in this kind of world,'' he said.
 So it is that Mr. Howard raised abortion for just a flicker of a moment -- and only to the extent of suggesting that the time period where abortion should be permitted should be cut from 24 weeks to 20 weeks. And when Mr. Howard appeared in the pulpit at the Tabernacle Christian Center on the outskirts of London on Sunday, he did not mention God or religion once in the course of a 20-minute speech, an omission that would have been unthinkable for Mr. Bush or John Kerry, the former Democratic presidential candidate.
 The social issue that Mr. Howard has used to try to drive up support -- a strongly worded call for tough immigration restrictions -- has inspired a backlash even among some of his own supporters as well as critics, who suggest that his appeal, encapsulated in the campaign motto, ''Are you thinking what we're thinking?'' was at the very least ham-handed.
 ''You can't ride the conservative tide from America here,'' said Stanley Greenberg, a Democratic pollster from the United States who is advising Mr. Blair. ''You have the leader of the free world being a self-conscious conservative, but based on ideas that seem foreign in Britain.''
 In a sign of the woes bedeviling the party, The Sun, owned by Rupert Murdoch, endorsed Mr. Blair last week in what was widely seen here as an example of Mr. Murdoch's placing pragmatism (he has a history of going with a winner) over ideology. ''When the Tories start acting like Conservatives, they might deserve our support,'' the paper said.
 While it is hard to walk through Labor Party headquarters without spotting some familiar Democratic Party face who has flown over to help out -- Bill Clinton appeared by satellite hookup to speak in support of Mr. Blair at a rally on Sunday -- there are few if any American Republicans helping out the Conservatives. Mr. Bush, grateful for Mr. Blair's unwavering support on Iraq, has kept out of the contest. 
 Mr. Howard appeared exasperated Monday when he was asked what American president was supporting his campaign. ''I'm more interested in the backing of the British people than the backing of American presidents,'' he said.

HEADLINE: U.N.leash Woolly Bully Bolton

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD. 
E-mail: liberties@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Why are they picking on poor John Bolton? Everyone knows the man is perfect for the United Nations job.
 For one thing, his raging-bull temperament is ideally suited to an organization steeped in global pettifoggers and oil-for-food pilferers. 
 The uncombed, untethered Mr. Bolton is fabulously operatic -- the Naomi Campbell of the Bush administration, ready at a moment's notice to beat up on underlings. 
 Who doesn't want to see Old Yeller chasing the Syrian ambassador down the hall, throwing a stapler at his head and biting at his ankles?
 Who doesn't want to see him foaming at the mouth -- yes, it will be hard to tell -- at the Cuban delegate over Castro's imaginary W.M.D.?
 Who doesn't want to see him mau-mauing the Iranian mullahs?
 Who doesn't want to see him once more misusing National Security Agency eavesdropping technology, this time to spy on Kofi and son?
 Who doesn't want to see him outrage North Korea by calling Kim Jong Il a fat, maniacal munchkin? 
 Even if his suave statesmanship were not so perfectly suited to high-level diplomacy, Mr. Bolton should still get the job. A ruthless ogre who tried to fire intelligence analysts who disagreed with his attempts to stretch the truth on foreign weapons programs deserves to be rewarded as other Bush officials have been.
 After all, he was in sync with the approach of Condi Rice, Paul Wolfowitz, Stephen Hadley and Bob Joseph -- who were all up for big jobs after they torqued up intelligence to fit the White House's theological beliefs. 
 Condi breezed into the secretary of state job, even after she helped Dick Cheney gin up the Iraq war, ignoring reports debunking the notion of Iraqi nuclear tubes, and even after she told Congress she'd shrugged at the Aug. 6, 2001, presidential daily brief headlined ''Bin Laden Determined to Attack Inside the United States.''
 Mr. Wolfowitz was eager to sell the war, ignoring predictions of insurgency and possible civil war. So he and Donald Rumsfeld left our troops so stretched and vulnerable that they were reduced to using cardboard cutouts to stand sentry, and to jury-rigging Humvees that had not been properly armored, resulting in many lost limbs and lives. 
 So Mr. Wolfowitz now has the prestigious job of World Bank president.
 George Tenet presided over the two biggest intelligence failures in modern history. He slam-dunked a Medal of Freedom out of them.
 Just as Mr. Bolton and Mr. Cheney tried to shovel distortions into Colin Powell's U.N. speech, Mr. Hadley and Mr. Joseph put distortions into President Bush's State of the Union address. 
 Dick Cheney intimidated C.I.A. analysts before the war. And he and President Bush let North Korea and Iran race ahead with their nuclear programs, and let Osama roam free, while they indulged their idee fixe on Iraq. Their reward? A second term. 
 In the Bush 41 era, good manners and judiciousness were prized. In Bush 43's Washington, bristling and bullying are the cardinal virtues. Putting an ideological filter on reality is a good career move.
 Once more using 9/11 as a rationale, Karl Rove told USA Today that the terrorist attacks proved that officials should ''be contesting, not simply supinely receiving, information from security analysts.'' He also rejected a deal with Senate Democrats on judiciary nominations and defended the rip-out-their-eyeballs tactics of Mr. Bolton and Tom DeLay. 
 Mr. DeLay, who makes Donald Rumsfeld seem shy, created what The Washington Post called ''an ethics-free zone'' in the capital by bullying the House ethics panel, and now he and Dick Cheney are trying to bully the judiciary. Mr. Cheney also defended Mr. Bolton against criticism from the Colin Powell camp.
 Colin Powell never got it: there's nothing wrong with a little abrasiveness to win global domination.
 We should give the Bush administration credit for not being hypocritical by supporting a mealy-mouthed, mewling conciliator along the lines of Jeanne Kirkpatrick. If John Bolton is unfairly denied a chance to ply his diplomatic talents at the U.N., maybe he can work for Bill Gates.
 After Mr. Gates shamefully backed down from supporting gay rights legislation -- a Washington State preacher had threatened to boycott the company -- Microsoft could use a feral muscleman to face down the evangelical bully.
 That's a job -- or an ankle -- Mr. Bolton could really sink his teeth into.

HEADLINE: Justices Limit Gun Law That Bars Possession by Felons

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26 

 BODY:
The Supreme Court on Tuesday curbed the reach of a federal law that prohibits convicted felons from possessing guns, ruling 5 to 3 that the law does not apply to those who were convicted by courts in foreign countries.
 The majority arrived at that conclusion by interpreting the statute's reference to a conviction in ''any court'' to mean ''any court in the United States.'' Justice Stephen G. Breyer's majority opinion said that in the absence of any indication that Congress even considered the issue when it enacted the law in 1968, the court should apply a legal presumption that ''Congress ordinarily intends its statutes to have domestic, not extraterritorial, application.''
 Justice Breyer said the gun law would create anomalies if applied to foreign convictions, because foreign legal systems have made different choices of what conduct to regard as criminal. Citing the Russian criminal code as an example, he said that someone might be regarded as a felon ''for engaging in economic conduct that our society might encourage.'' A foreign conviction does not necessarily indicate that a person is dangerous, Justice Breyer said. 
 The law, often referred to as the felon-in-possession statute, makes it illegal for someone ''who has been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year'' to possess a firearm. Because it imposes mandatory sentences on the basis of a record of previous convictions, prosecutors commonly add a felon-in-possession charge when seeking an indictment for other offenses.
 In this case, Small v. United States, No. 03-750, the gun possession itself was the offense. Gary Small, who had been convicted in Japan of smuggling guns into that country and served three years in a Japanese prison, bought a gun within a week of returning to the United States. 
 Mr. Small pleaded guilty to a gun possession charge, while reserving the right to appeal on the ground that the felon-in-possession statute did not apply to his Japanese conviction. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, rejected his argument in a 2003 decision that the Supreme Court overturned on Tuesday.
 Dissenting, Justice Clarence Thomas said the majority had stretched to create an exception that the law itself did not provide. ''In concluding that 'any' means not what it says, but rather 'a subset of any,' the court distorts the plain meaning of the statute,'' Justice Thomas said.
 He also objected to the majority's assumption that application of the law to Mr. Small would give it an ''extraterritorial'' dimension.
 ''The statute criminalizes gun possession in this country, not abroad,'' he said. ''In prosecuting Small, the government is enforcing a domestic criminal statute to punish domestic criminal conduct.''
 Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy joined the dissenting opinion. Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined the majority. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who had just begun treatment for thyroid cancer when the case was argued on Nov. 3, did not participate.
 The case was the court's latest of several efforts to interpret federal gun laws in which simple language masks layers of legal complexity. In 1995, for example, the court examined a federal law that makes it a crime to ''use'' a gun in connection with a narcotics offense, and decided that ''use'' meant ''active employment'' of the gun rather than keeping it locked in a car trunk.
 In the new case, the majority said that to discern the meaning of ''any'' in the statute, ''we must look beyond that word itself'' to the way the word would ordinarily be used. In announcing the decision from the bench, Justice Breyer gave an example. If he offered to see a particular movie at ''any theater,'' he said, ''I'm not talking about theaters in Japan.''
 A second case on Tuesday involved ''any'' in a different statute, the federal wire fraud law, which makes it a crime to use interstate wires to carry out ''any'' scheme to defraud. 
 The question was whether the law applied to a smuggling operation intended to evade Canada's high liquor taxes by hiding liquor in trucks and driving them across the border from New York. The operation involved telephoning orders from New York to discount liquor stores in Maryland. The government's theory was that the scheme defrauded Canada of its rightful tax revenue.
 The three defendants, David and Carl Pasquantino and Arthur Hilts, argued both before trial and after their convictions that a legal doctrine known as the revenue rule meant that the wire fraud law could not apply to their case. Under this rule, one government cannot use the courts of another to collect taxes. 
 But the rule does not apply in this case, Justice Thomas wrote in a majority opinion affirming a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, Va., which had upheld the men's convictions. ''This is a criminal prosecution brought by the United States in its sovereign capacity to punish domestic criminal conduct,'' he said.
 The vote in this case, Pasquantino v. United States, No. 03-725, was 5 to 4, with Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Scalia and Souter dissenting. ''The court has ascribed an exorbitant scope to the wire fraud statute'' in giving it ''an extraordinary extraterritorial effect,'' Justice Ginsburg said in her dissenting opinion.
 Justice Thomas replied in his majority opinion that neither the government's use of the statute nor the court's interpretation of it gave it an extraterritorial effect. The defendants' ''offense was complete the moment they executed the scheme inside the United States,'' he said.
 At the end of his opinion, Justice Thomas observed that ''it may seem an odd use of the federal government's resources to prosecute a U.S. citizen for smuggling cheap liquor into Canada.'' But the ''broad language of the statute'' permitted the prosecution, he said.

HEADLINE: At Opening Social Security Hearing, Bush's Fight Looks Largely Uphill

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM and ROBIN TONER; Richard W. Stevenson contributed reporting from Galveston, Tex., for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26 

 BODY:
The Senate Finance Committee's first full-scale debate on Social Security raised new doubt Tuesday about whether a majority of the committee would vote for President Bush's proposal for individual investment accounts.
 All the Democrats on the panel who spoke said they were resolutely opposed to the president's plan. And the reservations of Republicans were more ominous for the White House.
 As a last resort, some administration officials have said, they might be able to keep their plan alive by pushing a private accounts bill through the Finance Committee on a party-line vote rather than in a bipartisan manner. But at the hearing, one Republican, Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, said she did not want to tamper with ''the foundation for our seniors,'' and another, Senator Craig Thomas of Wyoming, expressed concern over the amount of borrowing that proposals like the president's would require. 
 The committee has 11 Republicans and 9 Democrats. If only one Republican joins a solid bloc of Democrats, the measure will fail for lack of a majority and will not be sent to the full Senate.
 Winding up his 60-day cross-country campaign to promote his proposal, Mr. Bush spoke Tuesday in Galveston, Tex., saying a county-employee retirement program there that includes private accounts provided real-life proof that putting money in stocks and bonds was a better deal than the current Social Security program.
 ''I'm traveling the country,'' the president said, ''making it clear to people that there are better options available than the current Social Security system, a better deal for younger workers.'' 
 In Washington, meanwhile, the partisan wars on the issue were raging outside the Capitol. In a display of party unity, scores of Democratic lawmakers, including two dozen senators, took the stage at an outdoor rally to declare their commitment to blocking private accounts. Republicans countered by saying Democrats were simply celebrating obstructionism. 
 A standing-room-only crowd packed the largest hearing room on Capitol Hill, where the Finance Committee chairman, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said he hoped ''to bring members to the table to work in our usual bipartisan fashion'' this summer. But as he closed the hearing, he declared, ''I may get fooled, and I may not get to that point.''
 With a rare note of anger in his voice, Mr. Grassley, who supports the president's initiative, demanded of the Democrats, ''Those of you who are bad-mouthing everything out there, suggest your own plan.''
 Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, challenged Mr. Grassley. ''Where's the president's plan?'' Mr. Kerry said. ''There is no plan from the president.''
 Mr. Bush has offered a detailed proposal for allowing workers to put part of their Social Security taxes into accounts that would be invested in the private financial markets, but he has never said what steps he favors to put the Social Security system on sound financial footing. 
 The president's spokesman, Scott McClellan, said Tuesday that Mr. Bush ''will be focusing more on solutions as we move forward.''
 The stated purpose of the Senate hearing was to allow the committee to begin addressing the solvency issue. Four experts on Social Security from outside the government presented the committee different plans for shoring up the system, ranging from one with a substantial tax increase to others with considerable borrowing over the next 40 years and much lower guaranteed benefits.
 No senator endorsed any of the plans, but they prompted a spirited debate among the members and demonstrated that there was no way to make Social Security solvent in the long run without reducing benefits, raising taxes, expanding the budget deficit or taking some combination of those steps.
 Several senators expressed interest in a proposal offered by Robert C. Pozen, an investment company executive from Boston, who would achieve long-term solvency primarily through what he calls ''progressive indexing.'' 
 Under Mr. Pozen's plan, low-income workers would continue to have their initial retirement benefits based on the extent to which wages nationally increased during their working years. 
 In contrast, the retirement benefits of middle- and upper-income workers would be based on price inflation. Over time, wages tend to rise considerably faster than prices, so the benefits of these workers would be much lower than under current law.
 Mr. Pozen would also allow workers to divert 2 percent of their wages, to a maximum of $3,000 a year, into investment accounts.
 Mr. Bush has spoken favorably of the Pozen plan. But in his testimony on Tuesday, Mr. Pozen was implicitly critical of the president's policy of dealing first with investment accounts and considering the system's long-term financing afterward. Lawmakers, he said, should instead ''come to grips with the growth in benefits,'' and only then should they ''figure out what sort of personal accounts would be complementary.''
 At the outdoor rally, Democrats characterized the Bush plan as nothing short of privatization.
 ''We say to all who would hear us, Social Security is sacred ground for the American people,'' declared Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader. The Democratic leader of the Senate, Harry Reid of Nevada, said his party would be unrelenting in fighting Mr. Bush's plan.
 The rally ended with an image composed to spotlight Democratic determination: scores of lawmakers joining hands next to a giant ''Declaration of Unity'' placard vowing to ''stop privatization.''
 In an interview on CNN after the Finance Committee hearing, Mr. Grassley suggested a realization that a majority on the panel might not vote for private accounts. If that proves to be the case, he said, he would still like to move ahead with a bill dealing with solvency in the system and send that to the Senate.
 Democrats, however, said they would try to block any Social Security bill unless Mr. Bush personally promised that investment accounts would not become part of the legislation at a later stage.
 Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, who broke party lines in 2003 to support Mr. Bush's measure offering prescription drug coverage under Medicare, said of Social Security, ''This is a program that needs to be modernized.'' But ''it's going to be hard to modernize this program,'' Mr. Wyden added, ''if the first step unravels the Social Security safety net.'' 
 Asked in an interview after the hearing to explain what he meant, the senator said, ''To make progress, the White House must make clear that no private accounts will be involved.''
 At least for now, Mr. Bush seems unlikely to make such a commitment. 
 Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said he met with the president last week and urged him to take private accounts off the table so the two parties could work on solvency.
 Mr. Rangel said Mr. Bush replied: ''Congressman, I am the president. And private accounts are not coming off the table even if it's the last day I spend in the presidency.''

HEADLINE: Zimbabwe's Role in U.N. Rights Panel Angers U.S.

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 27 

 BODY:
Zimbabwe was re-elected Wednesday to the United Nations Human Rights Commission, a panel that Secretary General Kofi Annan has proposed abolishing because of its practice of naming known rights violators to its membership.
 Zimbabwe's selection as one of the 15 countries winning three-year terms drew protests from Australia, Canada and the United States, with William J. Brencick, the American representative, saying the United States was ''perplexed and dismayed by the decision.''
 In a speech to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, Mr. Brencick said Zimbabwe had repressed political assembly and the news media, harassed civil society groups, conducted fraudulent elections and intimidated government opponents. 
 ''How can we expect the government of Zimbabwe to support international human rights standards at the Commission on Human Rights when it has blatantly disregarded the rights of its own people,'' he said.
 Mr. Annan, in his proposals made last month to bring broad changes to the United Nations, recommended scrapping the commission, which is based in Geneva, saying its practices ''cast a shadow on the reputation of the United Nations as a whole.''
 He said the commission had been undermined by allowing participation by countries whose purpose was ''not to strengthen human rights but to protect themselves against criticism or to criticize others.'' In recent years, members have also included Cuba, Libya and Sudan.
 Mr. Annan proposed replacing the 53-nation commission with a smaller council, whose members would be chosen by a two-thirds vote of the 191-nation General Assembly rather than by regional groups, as is the current practice. Zimbabwe won re-election automatically because it was the choice of the African group.
 Boniface G. Chidyausiku, Zimbabwe's ambassador to the United Nations, said that no country was above reproach when it came to human rights and ''those who live in glass houses should not throw stones.'' He said the United States has ''a lot of dirt on its hands'' because of prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
 The other countries named Wednesday were Argentina, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Botswana, Brazil, Cameroon, China, Germany, Japan, Morocco, the United States and Venezuela.

HEADLINE: They May Be Mundane, but Low-Tech Businesses Are Booming

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
Forget Web sites and molecular imaging. The biggest fields of opportunity for aspiring entrepreneurs are the same mundane ventures that have been kicking around for decades. 
 Think landscaping companies, child-care providers, janitorial services and nail and hair salons. In a generally buoyant market for low-technology businesses, those are four of the biggest winners by far. Altogether, sole proprietorships in the United States, a rough measure of the size of the small-business low-technology sector, grew by nearly 4 percent in 2002, the latest year with statistics available, to 17.6 million, and their combined revenue increased by 5.5 percent, to $770 billion. The figures come from the Census Bureau's Economic Census, a snapshot of the American economy that is taken every five years.
 And the trends that drove the increases in low-tech businesses have only accelerated, the bureau's economists say, as the nation's economy has rebounded and employment has recovered. 
 Growth in housing has increased demand for lawn care, the office construction boom has created a need for cleaning crews, more families than ever have two working spouses and need child care, and more women are treating themselves to trips to the beauty parlor, the economists say. 
 That reflects a truth about American entrepreneurship that is often lost in the breathless news coverage of the latest Silicon Valley start-up or biotechnology wonder: most of the growth involves tried-and-true undertakings that are unlikely to yield overnight riches but are open to anyone with tenacity and grit. 
 Landscaping experienced the most growth in the Census Bureau's survey. 
 The number of sole proprietorships that create and care for people's gardens and lawns surged by 21.5 percent in 2002, to 210,000, and their combined revenue increased by 11.6 percent, to $4.8 billion. 
 Hilary Finn, who runs HomeGrown, a landscaping company in Brooklyn, helps explain the profession's popularity. Ms. Finn, 46, spent a decade as a personal trainer, but after giving birth to a second daughter in 2002, decided to switch occupations, for the flexible hours and the chance to express her artistic impulses. 
 ''Since I was a child, I had been creating gardens,'' she said. ''I had graduated having studied painting and sculpture, but not design, at Empire State College. But I loved spaces and moving things around and creating spaces outside.'' 
 Ms. Finn enrolled in the New York Botanical Garden design program in the Bronx, and started constructing gardens in containers and window boxes. ''Then I realized that Brooklyn backyards are like a container,'' she said, and she began to work with a fellow designer to design plots that are often no bigger than 25 feet by 50 feet. Demand for her work spread quickly by word of mouth. ''My business has doubled every year,'' she said, although she noted that her revenue is not yet a living. 
 Paula Turpin, a former school bus driver, took a different route, borrowing a few thousand dollars from the federal government to launch her hair salon, Truly Blessed Styles, in the Long Island town of Shirley, N.Y., five years ago, primarily because she wanted to run her own show. 
 She joined a thriving trade. The number of hair salons with the same person as owner and stylist grew 5.6 percent in 2002, the Census Bureau says, and the total number of establishments, including ones with paid staff, surpassed 400,000, with $8.4 billion in annual revenue.
 Nail salons, which cater to the same clientele, grew even faster, up 8.7 percent to nearly 90,000, with annual revenue of $1.9 billion, the bureau says.
 Ms. Turpin, drawing on her experience at other hair salons, set up hers in a strip shopping center in April 2000. She styles, cuts and colors hair for her clients by herself. Ms. Turpin's retired mother helps her schedule appointments and keep the books. Her daughter, a college student, pitches in when she can to braid clients' hair. 
 ''Now I have my own business, and I'm able to have flexibility,'' said Ms. Turpin, 36. ''And I definitely have plans to expand. I want to add a barber shop in the back, and a place to sell beauty supplies in the front of the store.'' 
 Ms. Finn and Ms. Turpin share two distinguishing characteristics of single-owner businesses: pride of ownership and desire to take control of their lives, said Erin Fuller, executive director of the National Association of Women Business Owners. 
 ''Often, these owners do not want their business to become super large,'' she said. ''They take pride in their craft and, by keeping small, they can control that.'' 
 Ann Bolf, 36, is a good example of that. After divorcing her husband, she opened a hair salon in her home in Stow, Ohio, in September 2002. She sends her three children, 19, 16 and 12, off to school each morning and then cooks their dinner before her first appointment each day. That way, she can easily put the evening meal on the table. 
 And she has fun in between. ''When it's one chair, one stylist and one client, the relationship takes a different turn,'' she said. ''It's a lot more personal, you can experiment more and I like it much better.'' Most important, Ms. Bolf says she can set her own hours and go on a school field trip or take care of a sick child whenever the need arises. 
 A continuing increase in the number of women in the workplace has helped spur a 5.9 percent rise in the number of child-care providers in 2002, to 619,000 with revenues of more than $7 billion. Many were run in the owner's home. 
 Cleaning companies are in great demand, too. The number of janitorial services without paid employees soared by 20.4 percent in 2002, to 427,600, with almost $6 billion in revenue, the bureau says. One reason, according to a bureau analyst, was the decline in payroll jobs during the 2001 recession, which encouraged or forced many laid-off workers to branch out on their own. The same dynamic was at work in the explosion of landscaping businesses, he said. 
 Greg Littlefield started a lot earlier than that, abandoning his job in office equipment sales and management in 1990 to set up a cleaning company in Montgomery, Ala. But his reason for choosing that career is still valid today: it will never lack customers. 
 ''I knew that I did not want to start a high-tech business,'' he said, ''because I had seen several companies built upon a certain technology go out of business overnight when a new technology emerged.'' 
 His experience is proof that lack of expertise is no barrier to success. ''The early days were rough,'' said Mr. Littlefield, because he had no clue how to clean. 
 So he sold copiers part time and worked at a small moving company, learning the janitorial business by cleaning buildings at night. His company, Professional Facilities Management, eventually grew into a $15 million-a-year business, taking advantage of an increasing number of office buildings that needed cleaning. Mr. Littlefield is also president of the cleaning industry's association, the Building Service Contractors Association International,
 The industry has been helped by schools, hospitals and government agencies that traditionally had in-house janitorial staffs but are now using contractors for the work, said Marketdata Enterprises, a independent research firm based in Tampa, Fla., that studies service industries. 
 The commercial cleaning industry rolled unscathed through the 2001 recession, according to Marketdata, with revenue growing 5.5 percent in 2002 and 5.9 percent in 2003, to $94.5 billion. John LaRosa, a spokesman for Marketdata, said his firm estimated that growth last year was 6.3 percent and that total receipts could exceed $128 billion by 2008. 
 ''This is a low-tech business that's easy to enter, and many do,'' he said, with some entrepreneurs finding lucrative niches like damage restoration, mold remediation or maid services. 
 That was Mr. Littlefield's experience. He figured that to thrive in an industry where two out of three firms lose their contracts within a few years, his company had to become what he called a total facilities service provider. So he began developing a package of services, including housekeeping, landscaping, labor, minor maintenance and security services. 
 That meant eventually expanding to 900 employees, a far cry from the single-employee businesses that are proliferating now. But Mr. Littlefield said that he stayed true to his initial goal of maintaining control and flexibility by paring clients when they were not working out, providing extensive staff training and adopting company policies that were family-friendly.

HEADLINE: Shares Reverse Early Drop As Oil Prices Fall Sharply

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday as sharply lower oil prices buoyed confidence about consumer spending and corporate profits, while telecommunications stocks were helped by better-than-expected earnings at Verizon Communications.
 Boeing also helped the Dow, gaining 1 percent after it said that commercial jet orders would enhance its future results.
 Crude oil prices dropped nearly 5 percent, turning the market around from an early slide. Trading started poorly as data showing a plunge in new orders for durable goods hurt investor sentiment about the economy. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 47.67 points, or 0.5 percent, to end at 10,198.80. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.64 points, or 0.40 percent, to 1,156.38. The Nasdaq composite index increased 2.99 points, or 0.16 percent, to 1,930.43.
 ''The decline in the price of crude superseded the negative of the decline in durable goods orders,'' said Ned Riley, chief executive and chief investment officer of Riley Asset Management in Boston. ''I think investors believe that there's life beyond this recession-type scenario -- and that that life involves investing in financials, consumer nondurables and health care, and avoiding cyclical stocks such as steels and oil companies.''
 Energy-related stocks fell, including Exxon Mobil, which was down 89 cents at $58.38. 
 Government data showed new orders for durable goods made in the United States unexpectedly fell by 2.8 percent in March, the biggest drop since September 2002. 
 The stocks hurt by the report on durable goods, which are items expected to last three or more years, included Caterpillar and Maytag.
 Caterpillar, which makes construction and mining equipment, was down 81 cents a share, to $88.05. Maytag, which manufactures washing machines and other major household appliances, was down 18 cents a share, to $9.60.
 But shares of Verizon rose $1.22,, or 3.6 percent, to $35.22 after it reported quarterly earnings that beat Wall Street's estimates.
 The American Stock Exchange's North American telecom index was up 0.52 percent.
 Boeing rose 66 cents, to $59.66, even though it said that its quarterly earnings fell 14 percent as pension and compensation costs rose. That was offset by investor enthusiasm over its report on orders for commercial jets. 
 Financial stocks gained, with Mr. Riley attributing that to a belief that the data on durable goods might help deter the Fed from any aggressive interest rate increases. Citigroup rose 43 cents, to $47.05. 
 Other gainers included Aflac, up 9.6 percent, or $3.48, to $39.63, after Smith Barney raised its stock rating on the insurer, citing better-than-expected operating trends at both Japanese and United States operations.
 On the downside, shares of Amazon.com, the online retailer, fell 3 percent, or 99 cents to $31.72, a day after it posted lower profit because of costs from its discount shipping programs. 
 The technology sector produced another earnings disappointment. Shares of InfoSpace plunged 27 percent, or $12.29, to $32.70, after the company, a provider of Web search and mobile services, issued a forecast that was well below Wall Street expectations. 
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note gained 10/32, to a price of 986/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, declined to 4.23 percent from 4.26 percent.
 Here are the results of the auction of two-year notes:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)
High Price -- 99.951

HEADLINE: Muslim Group in France Is Fertile Soil for Militancy

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH

DATELINE: ST.-DENIS, France 

 BODY:
Raouf Ben Halima, 39, sleeps on his side, never on his stomach. He enters the bathroom leading with his left foot but puts his pants on leading with his right. Instead of using a fork when he eats, he uses his index finger, middle finger and thumb.
 Mr. Halima is a member of the Tablighi Jamaat, or Preaching Party, a global army of Muslim missionaries helping to expand their religion and reinforce their faith. They believe that emulating the habits of the Prophet Muhammad is the surest way to restore Islam to its intended path. 
 So Mr. Halima and his associates shave their upper lips but let their beards grow. They wear their pants or robes above the ankle because the prophet said letting clothes drag on the ground is a sign of arrogance. 
 ''Halfway between the knee and the ankle is best,'' Mr. Halima explains, sitting amid stacks of religious tracts in his small home.
 His comments, made recently to a reporter during conversations about the growth of militant Islam, offered a rare window on the beliefs of a group that is unsettling to many here. The Tablighi are one of the primary forces spreading Islamic fundamentalism in Europe today, and many young Muslim men pass through the group on the way toward an extreme, militant interpretation of the religion. 
 Beyond that, little about the group is known.
 The window Mr. Halima offered was open only briefly: he spoke only about his own experience and refused to accompany a reporter to France's main Tablighi mosque for fear of being seen breaching the sect's strict rules of secrecy. 
 European terrorism officials who follow Tablighi closely say they know many cases in which terrorists have emerged from the movement, but they say they have never been able to penetrate the group sufficiently to prove that it plays any direct role. ''It is definitely fertile ground for breeding terrorism,'' said a French intelligence official who has traced many militants' religious awakening to their membership in the movement. 
 Zacarias Moussaoui, the only person to be charged in the United States in connection with the Sept. 11 attacks, was once a Tablighi adherent in France. Herve Djamel Loiseau, a young Frenchman who died fleeing the 2001 American bombardment of Tora Bora in Afghanistan was, too. Djamel Beghal, an Algerian-born Frenchman and confessed Qaeda member recently convicted in Paris for plotting to blow up the American Embassy, was a Tablighi follower in the French town of Corbeil a decade ago.
 The movement got its start in the mid-1920's when a man named Mawlana Muhammad Ilyas, disturbed by distortions of Islam in the face of India's predominant Hinduism, began preaching in the poor neighborhoods of Delhi. It is now considered the largest Muslim missionary movement in the world. Its yearly November gathering in Raiwind, Pakistan, may be second only to the hajj in drawing Muslims.
 On the Continent, the group's main base is in France, where most of its adherents are North Africans, according to experts watching it. Introduced here in the early 1960's, it grew quickly during the 70's and 80's, one the country's few Islamic organizations at a time when Europe's economic slump had left many Muslim immigrants unemployed. 
 ''They were the first Islamic movement in France and the rest of Europe to target young people who were destabilized,'' said Gilles Kepel, author of ''The War for Muslim Minds.'' ''They targeted young people who were lost in their identity, were involved in delinquency, drinking, petty crime, and proposed reorganizing their life.''
 Mr. Halima, a senior Tablighi activist who once spent a week with the movement's governing council in Pakistan, estimated that 50,000 to 100,000 people had passed through the Tablighi movement in France and that there were about 5,000 active members. But there is no way to confirm these figures.
 Shortly after Islam's twilight prayer here, bearded and robed men stream out of the Tablighi's central mosque in France, a small two-story house freshly painted eggshell white not far from Mr. Halima's home. 
 Their approach to idle young men in this working-class town on the northern outskirts of Paris is usually the same: they offer a handshake, touch their hand to their heart, and ask, ''Do you go to the mosque?''
 Only occasionally do the missionaries return to the mosque with someone in tow. 
 Mr. Halima was once such a person. Now a cheerful proselytizer who publishes pamphlets promoting the Tablighi Jamaat and other aspects of fundamentalist Islam, he took a path to the Tablighi that may well be typical of European recruits. He said he was born to a Tunisian father and an American mother who divorced and moved to Britain when he was a child and brought up with no particular religious training. He began to seek spiritual sustenance by the time he left adolescence.
 At 16, he met a Tablighi member in southwest London and soon attended a three-day mosque retreat. Before long, he was joining outings to visit other mosques across Britain as a missionary.
 The Tablighi's obligation includes proselytizing 3 days every month and 40 days once a year. Every devoted Tablighi is also expected to make one four-month trip to Pakistan to study at the organization's central mosque.
 ''The Tablighi only care about bringing people back to Islam,'' Mr. Halima insisted. ''We are not political.'' But he said Tablighi-sponsored trips to Pakistan put young men in contact with fundamentalists of many stripes, including adherents of Salafism, a fundamentalist school of Islam whose radical fringe advocates war against non-Muslims. 
 Abandoning the Tablighi during such trips is discouraged, he said, but there is no stigma for those who wished to leave for more radical groups later.
 He acknowledged that young men wishing to migrate from the Tablighi to more militant forms of Islam had no trouble finding their way. ''Everyone knows which mosques attract Salafists, and if you go and ask, it's easy to get into the jihadi network,'' he said. 
 He said most people touched by the Tablighi eventually moved on to practice a more moderate form of Islam, but of the hundreds that remain engaged in fundamentalism, he estimated, half are recruited by Salafists.
 ''The Salafists are very aggressive,'' Mr. Halima said, adding that they are growing faster than the Tablighi. 
 In the Tablighi's central mosque here, across a park from the 12th-century basilica where many of France's kings are interred, a young man with a long beard and a long stick watches over the tiled front room where visitors remove their shoes and those coming for prayer perform ablutions in communal sinks. In the small, carpeted worship room, the only decoration is a lone shelf of religious books and a row of clock faces showing the times of Islam's five daily prayers.
 A group of bearded men sit on the floor, talking quietly beside a low wooden box that serves as a desk. Seeing a visitor, one of them gets up and introduces himself, whispering so as not to disturb another man praying in a corner. ''Happiness is inside us all, you only need the right glasses to find it,'' he begins. ''Those glasses are faith.''

HEADLINE: Mourning Mother Russia 

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS. 
E-mail: dabrooks@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Vladimir Putin gave a bizarre speech this week in which he described the fall of the Soviet Union as ''the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century'' and said that an ''epidemic of collapse has spilled over to Russia itself.'' 
 The sad thing is he is half right. 
 Most of us are grateful for the fall of communism, but the phrase ''epidemic of collapse'' is not a bad description of what Russian society is suffering through right now. You can measure that collapse most broadly in the country's phenomenal population decline. According to U.N. projections, Russia's population will plummet from about 146 million in 2000 to about 104 million in 2050. Russia will go from being the 6th-most-populous country in the world to being the 17th. 
 That population decline has a number of causes. The first is the crisis in the Russian family and the decline in fertility rates. Between 1981 and 2001, marriage rates in Russia dropped by a third, and divorce rates rose by a third, according to Russian government estimates. As Nicholas Eberstadt of the American Enterprise Institute pointed out recently in one of the last issues of The Public Interest, Russia now has three divorces for every four marriages, an astounding rate of family breakups.
 As the Soviet regime disintegrated, Russian fertility rates fell through the floor, from 2.19 births per woman in 1986-87 to 1.17 in 1999. Birth rates have now recovered somewhat, but they are not even close to replacement levels. According to Eberstadt, Russia currently has about 160 deaths for every 100 births.
 The more shocking reason Russia's population is declining is that people are dying younger. Russians are now much less healthy than their grandparents were in 1960. In the past three decades, Russian mortality rates have risen by 40 percent. Russian life expectancies now approximate those in Bangladesh and are below India's. 
 The health care system is in shambles. The risk of suffering a violent death is nine times as high for Russian men, compared with men in Israel. There's an explosion of heart attacks and strokes, thanks to smoking, increased vodka consumption and other ruinous lifestyle choices. The H.I.V./AIDS epidemic hasn't even been fully factored into the official statistics. According to Russian statistics, a 20-year-old man in 2000 had only a 46 percent chance of reaching age 65. (American 20-year-olds had about an 80 percent chance.)
 What we are seeing, in short, is a country with nuclear weapons that is enduring a slow-motion version of the medieval Black Death. Perhaps we should be thankful that the political and economic situation there isn't worse than it is.
 For, indeed, the paradox of Russia is that as life has become miserable in many ways, the economy has grown at an impressive clip. We can look back on this and begin to see a pattern that might be called Post-Totalitarian Stress Syndrome.
 When totalitarian regimes take control of a country, they destroy the bonds of civic trust and the normal patterns of social cohesion. They rule by fear, and public life becomes brutish. They pervert private and public morality.
 When those totalitarian regimes fall, different parts of society recover at different rates. Some enterprising people take advantage of economic recovery, and the result of their efforts is economic growth.
 But private morality, the habits of self-control and the social fabric take a lot longer to recover. So you wind up with nations in which high growth rates and lingering military power mask profound social chaos.
 This is what we're seeing in Russia. It's probably what we would be seeing in Iraq even if the insurgency were under control. And most frighteningly, it could be what we will be seeing in China for decades to come.
 On the surface, China looks much more impressive than Russia. But this is a country that will be living with the consequences of totalitarianism for some time. Thanks to the one-child policy, there will be hundreds of millions of elderly people without families to support them. Thanks to that same policy, and the cultural predilection for boys, there will be tens of millions of surplus single men floating around with no marital prospects, no civilizing influences, nothing to prevent them from assembling into violent criminal bands.
 At some point the power-hungry find a way to exploit social misery. At some point internal social chaos has international consequences. Fasten your seat belts. We could be in for a bumpy ride.

HEADLINE: Bush Offers Plan to Bolster Refineries and Nuclear Plants

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27 

 BODY:
President Bush presented a plan on Wednesday to offer federal risk insurance to companies that build nuclear power plants and to encourage the construction of oil refineries on closed military bases in the United States.
 Mr. Bush also proposed giving the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the authority to choose sites for new terminals to receive liquid natural gas from overseas.
 Mr. Bush's proposals, which he laid out to a friendly lunchtime audience of small-business owners at the Washington Hilton, would not lower domestic gasoline prices this summer. But they appeared to be a response to continuing criticism from Saudi Arabia that one reason for the high cost of gasoline is a lack of refining capacity in the United States. 
 ''Because of our foreign energy independence, our ability to take actions at home that will lower prices for American families is diminishing,'' Mr. Bush told the business owners, who were attending a conference organized by the Small Business Administration. ''Our dependence on foreign energy is like a foreign tax on the American people.''
 Recent polls suggest that high gasoline prices have cut into Mr. Bush's popularity, and the president has made two speeches in the last week on efforts to bring down the cost of oil. At the same time, he has used the speeches to keep up pressure on Congress to pass his long-stalled energy bill, which has languished on Capitol Hill for nearly four years.
 The president has acknowledged that his proposals would not lower gasoline prices ''today,'' but has said that they would help in the long run.
 ''This problem did not develop overnight, and it's not going to be fixed overnight,'' Mr. Bush said in his speech at the Hilton. ''But it's now time to fix it. See, we got a fundamental question we got to face here in America: Do we want to continue to grow more dependent on other nations to meet our energy needs, or do we want what is necessary to achieve greater control of our economic destiny?'' Most of Mr. Bush's speech was a restatement of White House energy policy, but the plan to build refineries on closed military bases startled energy experts outside the administration. Administration officials said that bases could either be leased or sold to private companies in open bidding. At present, there are about 100 closed bases in the United States, but some have already been redeveloped as commercial airports or economic free zones for businesses. 
 Building more nuclear power plants has long been a part of Mr. Bush's energy policy, but offering federal risk insurance to companies or investors willing to try to get approval for them is new. In his speech, Mr. Bush said that his goal was to reduce uncertainty in the building and regulatory process, and to protect companies from construction delays beyond their control. 
 Mr. Bush noted that the United States had not ordered a new nuclear power plant since the 1970's, and that since then 35 plants were stopped at various stages of construction because of bureaucratic delays.
 ''No wonder the industry is hesitant to start building again,'' he said.
 There has been a shift in opinion in the industry and among some environmentalists toward more nuclear power, because it is clean and far safer than at the time of the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in 1979.
 White House officials said that they wanted Mr. Bush's proposals to be part of the energy bill now working its way through Congress. Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who is chairman of a Senate subcommittee on energy and water and a major proponent of nuclear power, said in a statement on Tuesday night that he would incorporate some of Mr. Bush's proposals into the bill.
 Democrats criticized Mr. Bush's proposals as ineffective for average consumers. 
 ''The Republican plan won't help the families, truckers, farmers and small businesses suffering from skyrocketing gas prices today,'' Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who ran for president against Mr. Bush in 2004, said in a statement. 
 A consumer group also criticized the president's proposals.
 ''The president is proposing to increase refining capacity in this country ostensibly to reduce our dependence on foreign countries, yet in the same breath he is pushing for increased imports of liquefied natural gas, which will leave us more dependent on other countries,'' the National Association of State Public Interest Groups, a consumer advocacy organization, said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Billionaire Mayor Takes Up the Cause of the Homeless

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
When Michael R. Bloomberg was running for mayor in the fall of 2001, homelessness was far down on his agenda for a city just attacked by terrorists and in a deep economic downturn. In fact, the question of how best to handle the tens of thousands of people in the city's shelters and on the streets barely came up.
 The mayor acknowledges that initially he had little interest in the issue. ''It was not on my radar,'' he said. 
 Now, as he prepares to run for re-election, the Republican mayor is eager for voters to judge him in part on how his administration has dealt with homelessness, and he is issuing the challenge at an intriguing time: with a near-record number of people living in city shelters, he has pledged to reduce homelessness by two-thirds by 2009.
 The very fact that mass homelessness has vexed three previous mayors seems to increase the issue's appeal to him, and in an interview last week, he suggested that by focusing on the problem, he was playing against type. ''Here is this supposedly billionaire Republican capitalist who is focusing on actually trying to do something, when they for years had people that professed to do something but probably never did,'' he said. ''I am the most improbable person in some sense to go and address this issue.'' 
 Just as other mayors had been, Mr. Bloomberg was forced by events to focus on homelessness. When he took office, applications for free city shelter, which had been steadily growing, began to swell as the city suffered from the financial reverberations of Sept. 11. In February 2002 the city sheltered 5,593 families; two years later there were 9,230 families in city shelters, with each family costing the city roughly $2,100 a month. (Thousands more families were turned away as ineligible.) The number of single homeless people in shelters reached the highest point in a decade.
 Only six months into Mr. Bloomberg's tenure, the growing homeless crisis caused a flood of bad publicity for his administration. In August 2002, with families being forced to spend the night illegally in the overwhelmed Bronx office that is the only entry point to shelter, Mr. Bloomberg decided to open a renovated detention center nearby to handle overflow. The move was a classic example of Mr. Bloomberg's practical approach to problems. Homeless advocates and the media pummeled him for the seeming cold-heartedness of using the former jail. Insisting that he was right, Mr. Bloomberg held firm for nearly three weeks until a court ordered the center closed.
 To outsiders it seemed like a debacle, but to Linda Gibbs, the commissioner of the Department of Homeless Services, it was a turning point.
 ''It was an extremely difficult spring and summer,''' she recalled, ''and he jumped in and defended the agency, and me as commissioner personally, which sent a very strong message about his willingness to fight and use his own political capital in unpopular battles.''
 Aides say that the crisis forged a close bond between the mayor and Ms. Gibbs that has been at the root of an ambitious agenda for overhauling homeless policies. The mayor thought the city needed more hard information if it was to combat homelessness, so Ms. Gibbs arranged an annual census of street homeless. The mayor worried that city shelters were not safe, and she tripled the security force. He insisted that there must be a way to help people before they entered city-run shelters -- a particularly expensive option -- and she developed a prevention plan that created additional rent subsidies and put money into legal services and counseling that might help families before they lost their homes. 
 The mayor's apparent faith in Ms. Gibbs's stewardship helped spur his promise to reduce homelessness by two-thirds, although by all accounts, the five-year timeline was all his. ''I told them I am not going to be here in 10 years, do it in five. Let's not leave it for somebody else to finish,'' the mayor recalled.
 While the mayor maintains that he will score few points politically by addressing homelessness, it could resonate with Democratic voters wary of pulling the lever for a Republican. Indeed, he has garnered some praise from the city's vociferous community of homeless advocates after adopting some of the ideas they put forward.
 ''He sees the colossal money being paid to run shelters and he believes that there are better ways to spend these resources,'' said Rosanne Haggerty, executive director of Common Ground, the city's largest provider of supportive housing. ''He is approaching this like it is a solvable problem. It is the leadership we have longed for all along.''
 Still, it has been the mayor's insistence on financial accountability and on not letting the homeless system be abused that has resulted in tough new restrictions with which some homeless advocates take issue.
 If families applying for shelter are found to have other places where they can stay, like relatives' apartments, they are forced to reapply for shelter daily, a grueling regimen. In addition, generous federal rent subsidies are no longer available to homeless families. And the rent subsidy provided by the city and state has been replaced by one that declines by 20 percent a year, in large part because the mayor said it was ''not government's job to take away your responsibility for your own behavior or to be self-supporting.''
 In an hourlong interview, the mayor said he was sure the city was on the right track, and that ''any rational'' advocates would agree.
 His deep sense of certainty on this issue annoys his most tenacious critics, the Legal Aid Society and the Coalition for the Homeless. The mayor has been publicly harsh toward Legal Aid, which he says ''reneged'' on a promise to end 20 years of litigation over the city's homeless policy if certain conditions were met.
 But Steve Banks, the society's attorney in chief, says that in an effort to end the litigation, his group made offers to this administration that previous mayors would have jumped at. ''We have been willing to compromise and put things on the table that had not been offered to prior administrations, and the city has been unwilling to yield even an inch,'' he said. ''It has to be their way or no way.''
 But Mayor Bloomberg suggests that New Yorkers judge him on his performance. In five years, he says, there should be roughly 25,000 fewer people in city shelters and 3,000 fewer homeless sleeping on the street. He asked that voters hold him accountable then.


CORRECTION-DATE: May 10, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article on April 28 about Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's pledge to reduce homelessness by two-thirds by 2009 included comments in support of his plan from a longtime advocate for the homeless, Rosanne Haggerty, who is executive director of Common Ground, the city's largest provider of housing with support services. ''He is approaching this like it is a solvable problem,'' she said. 
''It is the leadership we have longed for all along.'' 
 After the article appeared, the Coalition for the Homeless, which is critical of the mayor's policies, wrote to The Times's public editor to point out that last year Ms. Haggerty married Dr. Lloyd Sederer, who is Mr. Bloomberg's executive deputy commissioner for mental hygiene and was involved in development of the homeless plan. 
 The reporter was not aware of the relationship, and Ms. Haggerty says her views on the housing issue were formed many years ago. She has often been interviewed on the subject during more than two decades of involvement. Before she founded the nonprofit Common Ground 15 years ago, she worked as a housing consultant and was director of the housing office of Brooklyn Catholic Charities.

HEADLINE: Economy Hits Energy Prices, And the Brakes

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
The economy braked sharply in the first three months of the year, the government reported yesterday, expanding at its slowest pace in two years as rising energy prices spurred a burst of increased inflation and dragged down spending by businesses and consumers. 
 The Commerce Department estimated that the nation's gross domestic product grew at a 3.1 percent annual rate in the first quarter, substantially slower than the 3.8 percent growth of the final three months of 2004 and the slowest pace since the first quarter of 2003. 
 Investors in financial markets were taken aback by the unexpected sluggishness, sending stocks tumbling and pushing bond yields down as the new data cemented expectations that the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates by another quarter of a percentage point at its meeting on Tuesday even as growth is decelerating.
 On Wall Street, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.14 percent to close at 1,143.22, while the Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 128 points, to 10,070.37. 
 ''I wouldn't panic at this point, but I think we do have to get used to the idea that growth is going to remain substantially slower than in the earlier part of the recovery'' that has been under way since late in 2001, said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at Global Insight, an economic research firm in Lexington, Mass. ''Unfortunately, we will have to get used to seeing softer growth numbers as interest rates go up because of higher inflation.''
 Activity slowed across most of the economy, from consumer spending to government consumption, but the sharpest retreat was in corporate investment, which expanded at barely a third of the pace of its growth in the last three months of 2004.
 Final demand -- real purchases by companies, governments and individuals -- expanded merely 1.9 percent. The rest of the expansion was a result of an $80 billion surge in the accumulation of inventories, from cars parked in dealer lots to clothing piling up on retailer shelves, as businesses were wrong-footed by slower-than-expected demand for their wares.
 The new data provided strong evidence that the rise in the cost of oil has begun to feed into prices of other goods throughout the economy. The price index for personal consumption expenditures minus food and energy, a favorite inflation gauge of the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, jumped to an annual pace of 2.2 percent, the steepest climb since the fourth quarter of 2001.
 ''The inflation risk clearly tilted to the upside now,'' said David Greenlaw, chief United States fixed-income economist at Morgan Stanley. ''This report provided ammunition for the camp that says there is a risk of stagflation,'' the combination of stagnant growth and high inflation.
 A slowing economy is not entirely unexpected. Most economists consider that the United States has the potential to grow at about 3.5 percent, on average, over the long term, substantially less than the 4.4 percent expansion recorded last year.
 Consumer spending, the main buttress for economic growth over the last three years, has been expected to slow somewhat as rising interest rates take some steam out of the housing market and consumer lending. Businesses, however, were expected to invest heavily and pick up some of the slack. 
 ''Most companies don't even have to borrow,'' said Daniel J. Meckstroth, chief economist for the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a public policy and business research organization in Arlington, Va. ''They can fund investments out of cash flow.''
 But the spike in energy prices appears to have thrown a wild card into the expected growth pattern. 
 Consumer spending maintained some vigor in the first quarter, declining to a still healthy 3.5 percent rate, from 4.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004. Residential investment even accelerated, as low mortgage rates kept fanning the flames of a housing boom and builders scrambled to meet demand.
 But business investment, which had been advancing at a double-digit clip since last spring, stalled. The growth of spending on equipment and software, for instance, dropped from 18.4 percent in the last quarter of 2004 to 6.9 percent in the first three months of this year. 
 While some analysts indicated that the slump could stem from the end of a tax break that until December allowed accelerated depreciation of new investments, it rekindled concerns that high energy prices would spook businesses into curtailing spending.
 Still, several analysts said that the economy could yet turn around in coming months. Even as the combination of slower-than-expected growth and higher-than-expected inflation has taken many observers by surprise, some economists noted that the current slowdown has a familiar feel to it.
 Last spring, for example, energy prices surged, taking a bite out of demand and giving some fizz to inflation. But the impact was temporary: lower growth helped keep inflation under wraps and when oil prices receded consumer spending picked up again and economic activity continued at a robust pace.
 Steven Wieting, senior economist at Citigroup, argued that the rise in energy costs this time shaved one percentage point from output growth. But he also argued that the drag was probably over.
 ''We are in a hole we have to dig out of,'' Mr. Wieting said. ''But oil prices have peaked. There are reasonable prospects that the second quarter ends stronger than it began.''
 Nonetheless, there are new reasons for caution. Bloated inventories may serve as an anchor on growth in the second quarter as companies work them off rather than expand factory output. Mushrooming imports are expected to curtail growth as well. In the first quarter, the trade deficit subtracted 1.49 percentage points from domestic economic output, the biggest drag since the fourth quarter of 2002.
 A risk now is that consumer spending may falter and housing activity peak even as businesses keep a tighter rein on investment. 
 ''Everybody is relying on the U.S. consumer and the U.S. housing market,'' Mr. Gault, the Global Insight economist, said. ''But the consumer is starting to sputter and in housing the numbers can't conceivably get much better.''

Three months of jockeying among Iraq's victorious Shiite and Kurdish parties have finally produced a cabinet that won quick ratification from a legislature where those same parties dominate. The January election that began this process was inspiring. The months of petty haggling that followed were not, and while the formation of an elected Iraqi government is a historic moment, its makeup is far from ideal. Crucial choices have been needlessly delayed, and an incomparable opportunity for drawing patriotic Sunni Arabs away from the insurgency was largely squandered. Many Iraqis, particularly supporters of secularism, women's rights and national unity, will greet this government warily. 
 What will matter most is whether Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari can summon the vision and the strength to master his unruly coalition and start living up to voters' expectations. His initial broadcast to the Iraqi people was promising, but he faces a lot of obstacles. 
 The most critical is finding ways to widen Sunni representation in the government, including in the security forces. That representation will have to include Sunnis who served in Saddam Hussein's army, police and intelligence services and former Baath Party members. This is painful for Shiite and Kurdish victims of the old regime to accept. But excluding all Baathists is a prescription for endless civil war and endlessly postponed recovery. Only the Baathist leaders and security officials personally responsible for the worst crimes of the former dictatorship should be automatically excluded. 
 Mr. Jaafari had intended to make an important symbolic gesture by appointing a Sunni defense minister. But at the last minute, Shiite party leaders vetoed his choice, and Mr. Jaafari has temporarily assumed the defense post himself. That is a serious loss, one that Mr. Jaafari must quickly remedy. 
 Another damaging setback was the failure to find some way to include the interim prime minister, Ayad Allawi, and his party in the new cabinet. Mr. Allawi made plenty of mistakes during his tenure. But in recent weeks he emerged as a vital Shiite voice for secular rights and for making overtures to elements of the dangerously estranged Sunni Arab community. Excluding Mr. Allawi will increase the leverage of militantly religious Shiites who want to include harsh elements of Koranic law in the forthcoming constitution and of Kurdish parties, which are more interested in securing autonomy for their region than in protecting secular and minority rights in all of Iraq.
 While Mr. Allawi will not be in the new cabinet, one of his least appealing rivals, Ahmad Chalabi, will, as a deputy prime minister and the acting oil minister. Apart from his double-crossing of the Bush administration, his dodgy financial reputation and his shady dealings with Iran, Mr. Chalabi is openly determined to sabotage any attempt to integrate former Baathists into Iraqi political and economic life. 
 Mr. Jaafari must recognize that he is the prime minister of all Iraqis, including women, Sunnis and secularists, and assert his authority over the scheming politicians and Shiite clerics who have not been shy about instructing him what to do. He needs to insist on appointing credible Sunnis to positions of authority, starting with the Defense Ministry. He has to see to it that intolerant religious zealots do not dominate the writing of Iraq's new constitution. And he must assert control over reconstruction contracts in order to combat corruption and direct as much of the work as possible into Iraqi hands. 
 History will look back on this as the moment when Iraqi democracy had its best chance to preserve a unified country and make good on the promise of human rights and economic well-being. We hope Mr. Jaafari rises to this momentous challenge.

HEADLINE: A Private Obsession

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
American health care is unique among advanced countries in its heavy reliance on the private sector. It's also uniquely inefficient. We spend far more per person on health care than any other country, yet many Americans lack health insurance and don't receive essential care.
 This week yet another report emphasized just how bad a job the American system does at providing basic health care. A study by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation estimates that 20 million working Americans are uninsured; in Texas, which has the worst record, more than 30 percent of the adults under 65 have no insurance. 
 And lack of insurance leads to inadequate medical attention. Over a 12-month period, 41 percent of the uninsured were unable to see a doctor when needed because of cost; 56 percent had no personal doctor or health care provider.
 Our system is desperately in need of reform. Yet it will be very hard to get useful reform, for two reasons: vested interests and ideology.
 I'll have a lot more to say about vested interests and health care in future columns, but let me emphasize one key point: a lot of big companies are essentially in the business of wasting health care resources. 
 The most striking inefficiency of our health system is our huge medical bureaucracy, which is mainly occupied in trying to get someone else to pay the bills. A good guess is that two million to three million Americans are employed by insurers and health care providers not to deliver health care, but to pass the buck to other people.
 Yet any effort to reduce this waste would hurt powerful, well-organized interests, which have already demonstrated their power to block reform. Remember the ''Harry and Louise'' ads that doomed the Clinton health plan? The actors may have seemed like regular folks, but the ads were paid for by the Health Insurance Association of America, an industry lobbying group that liked the health care system just the way it was.
 But vested interests aren't the only obstacle to fixing our health care system. We also have a big problem with ideology.
 You see, America is ruled by conservatives, and they have a private obsession: they believe that more privatization, not less, is always the answer. And their faith persists even when the evidence clearly points to a private sector gone bad.
 I could cite many examples of this obsession at work. But a particularly good illustration of ideology-induced obliviousness is the 2004 Economic Report of the President, which devotes a whole chapter to health care that can be read as a sort of conservative manifesto on the subject.
 The main message of that report is that U.S. health care is doing just fine. Never mind the huge expense, the low life expectancy, the high infant mortality; it's a market-based system, so it must be good.
 The report even takes a Panglossian view of uninsured Americans -- one that is completely at odds with the grim statistics I cited above -- suggesting that ''many of them may remain uninsured as a matter of choice,'' perhaps because ''they are young and healthy and do not see the need for insurance.'' 
 The president's economists had only one criticism of the system: insurance is too comprehensive, which encourages people to consume too much health care. As they see it, insurance covers too large a percentage of medical costs. The answer to this problem is the creation of, you guessed it, private accounts, which have now superseded tax cuts as the answer to all problems. 
 Indeed, a new paper by Martin Feldstein of Harvard, which clearly reflects the administration's views, suggests that Social Security privatization and health savings accounts -- tax shelters designed to encourage people to pay medical costs out of their own pockets -- are only the beginning. ''Investment-based personal accounts,'' he says, are the way to go for unemployment insurance and Medicare, too.
 O.K., let's not turn this into a Bush-bashing session. President Bush didn't cause the crisis in American health care. His health care policies have made things only a little bit worse. 
 The point, instead, is that even though all the evidence suggests that we would be much better off under a system of universal coverage, any such move will be fiercely opposed, on principle, by conservatives who want us to move in the opposite direction.
 And reform will also be opposed by powerful vested interests -- my next subject in this series.

HEADLINE: Europe Loses Sugar Appeal At W.T.O.

BYLINE: By TOM WRIGHT; Todd Benson contributed reporting from Sao Paulo, Brazil, for this article, and Paul Meller from Brussels.

DATELINE: GENEVA, April 28 

 BODY:
The World Trade Organization's highest court issued a final ruling Thursday ordering the European Union to stop illegally dumping subsidized sugar on global markets or face punishment. 
 The decision by the W.T.O.'s appellate court in Geneva gave the European Union up to 15 months to bring itself into compliance with global trade rules. The panel rejected calls by Brazil, Thailand and Australia, which filed the original complaint, for a 90-day deadline to comply. 
 The verdict was nonetheless another victory for Brazil, after the United States lost a similar appeal last month over its cotton subsidies. Brazil, the world's largest sugar exporter and a major cotton producer, has taken the lead at the W.T.O. in arguing that subsidies hurt developing countries by encouraging overproduction, creating excess that is then dumped on world markets.
 ''These two decisions have completely changed the way subsidies for agricultural products are viewed in international trade,'' Eduardo Pereira de Carvalho, president of Unica, Brazil's largest sugar industry association, said. ''And that opens the door for developing countries.'' 
 Still, it is unclear how the European Union will respond to the ruling. Europe and the United States have argued that their subsidy reductions should be part of continuing efforts to liberalize agriculture under the Doha round of trade talks that began in 2001. Poor countries argue that they cannot wait for a deal, which is unlikely to come before the end of 2006 at the earliest. 
 In Brussels, European Union officials criticized the latest ruling, but said they would take it into consideration as they set about overhauling their sugar export subsidy system, which costs some $2 billion a year and is being revamped for the first time in 35 years. 
 ''We presented our case forcefully and I had hoped that the appellate body would take greater account of our arguments,'' Mariann Fischer Boel, the European agriculture commissioner, said. ''Naturally, I will take account of this verdict when I finalize the reform proposals we are due to publish on June 22.''
 The European Union was already addressing its subsidies program because of the high price of sugar in Europe and because advocacy groups like Oxfam had long criticized it for its distortions of world markets. The European proposal envisions cutting the minimum price of sugar in Europe by a third and reducing the export subsidies.
 Roberto Azevedo, a senior trade official at Brazil's foreign ministry in Brasilia, urged the European Union to comply with the ruling ''in the shortest possible time frame.'' 
 Last month, the W.T.O. gave Washington until July 1 to get rid of $3.2 billion in annual subsidies to cotton farmers. The Bush administration has said that it will comply.
 Last year, a panel of W.T.O. experts found that the European Union exported about 4 million metric tons of sugar in 2001, the period under investigation, or about three times what global trade rules allow. The appeals court upheld those findings. 
 Brussels appealed the W.T.O.'s decision in January, arguing that it did not directly subsidize more than 1.3 million metric tons of exports -- the ceiling set during an earlier trade round. The W.T.O., however, upheld an earlier ruling that found that farmers were able to sell another 2.7 million tons of sugar at artificially low prices on global markets because of Europe's sugar system.

Broadway

'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100. (Ben Brantley)

'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol'' (1:45). Plymouth, 236 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES' Jerry Zaks's revival of the 1983 musical often gives the impression of merely going through the motions of its gag-laden, sentimental plot. What makes ''La Cage'' worth visiting is the plumed and spangled all-male ensemble of dancers (2:30). Marquis, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'JULIUS CAESAR' Those cruel forces of history known as the dogs of war are chewing up everything in their path in this tragedy: friends, Romans, countrymen, blank verse and even the noblest movie star of them all. That's Denzel Washington, who plays the conflicted Brutus (2:40). Belasco, 111 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Nobert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005). Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether it fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'THE GLASS MENAGERIE' This revival suggests that to recollect the past is to see life as if it had occurred underwater, in some viscous sea. Folks drown in this treacherous element. Unfortunately, that includes the show's luminous but misdirected and miscast stars: Jessica Lange and Christian Slater (2:30). Barrymore, 243 West 47th Street; (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. and quite a talent, too (2:05). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)

'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitous and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'LITTLE WOMEN' Watching the production is rather like speed-reading Alcott's novel. And the cast members mostly bring to mind 1860's-themed editions of American Girl dolls (2:20). Virginia Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'MONTY PYTHON'S SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'ON GOLDEN POND' Placing a powerhouse like James Earl Jones in Ernest Thompson's teary sentimental comedy about an elderly couple's summer of healing suggests a German shepherd in a poodle-sized dog house. Yet rather than make his surroundings feel small and artificial in this surprisingly fresh revival, Mr. Jones's natural grandeur forces the play to find room for his sweeping emotional breadth (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'700 SUNDAYS' This one-man memoir of a play by Billy Crystal has been set up to suggest a night of home movies with a buddy from your high school days who is equal parts attention-grabbing showoff and softhearted sweetie pie. You would be hard-pressed to find a Broadway show with a more artfully calculated comfort factor (2:20). Broadhurst, 235 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' Despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television, sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE' The capricious gods of casting have not been kind to Tennessee Williams of late. This staging, starring an erratic Natasha Richardson as Blanche, is not the hazy mess that the current ''Glass Menagerie'' is. But it too suffers from fundmental mistmatches of parts, especially John C. Reilly's sexually unmagnetic Stanley (2:45). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley)

* 'TWELVE ANGRY MEN' This stage adaptation of Reginald Rose's celebrated television drama from 1954 (made into a film in 1957) suggests that sometimes the best way to present a fossil is just to polish it up and put it on display without disguise, annotation or apology. Even those who like their theater hip and cerebral might want to lower their eyebrows for this 90-minute production. (1:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley)

* 'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

'ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING' Cheers to the British cabaret trio that calls itself Fascinating Aida. These women revel in the here and now. They are bawdy and political; loopy (in that crisp English way) and whimsical (2:00). Kirk Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, (212)279-4200. (Margo Jefferson)

* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'BEAST ON THE MOON' Richard Kalinoski's musty romantic drama depicts the fractious marriage of two survivors of the Armenian genocide. Larry Moss's production is respectable and effective, but the performances by Omar Metwally and Lena Georgas are exhaustingly busy (2:00). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'DESSA ROSE' It's easy to admire Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens (''Ragtime'') for their belief in the humanist potential in musical theater. But their new show isn't likely to win many converts to the cause (2:30). Newhouse, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THE FALSE SERVANT' Decked out in a smart black tailcoat, Martha Plimpton cuts a debonair figure in this revival of this unusually chilly Marivaux comedy. Ms. Plimpton's dashing performance imbues the proceedings with a bright, puckish spirit, but the mechanical staging emphasizes the nip that never leaves the air (2:00). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200. (Isherwood)

* 'HURLYBURLY' If you are going to inhabit a wasteland, you might as well be thoroughly wasted. That would appear to be the first rule of survival for the characters who have been brought so vibrantly and unforgivingly to life in the New Group's smashing revival of David Rabe's 1984 play. But thanks to a terrific, uncompromising cast, theatergoers are likely to experience a heady buzz of excitement and clarity that any of the desperate characters onstage would kill for (3:15). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'LAZER VAUDEVILLE' If this isn't an ancient showbiz rule, it ought to be: things will look a lot more impressive if they are done in the dark with a heavy dose of fluorescence. That seems to be the guiding principle behind this hodgepodge of juggling, rope twirling and such, delivered wordlessly by the cast (1:30). Houseman, 450 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger)

'MONK' Rome Neal eases his way through this solo play about the jazz musician Thelonious Monk, taking his time to tell the story of an artist he clearly loves. But this is not the show for jazz fans that want to delve deep into Monk's psychology or learn something new about his process (1:30). Havoc, 312 West 36th Street, (718)288-8048. (Jason Zinoman)

'MOONLIGHT AND MAGNOLIAS' Hollywood ghosts squabble like starving chickens in Ron Hutchinson's shrill, obstreperously silly comedy about the making of ''Gone With the Wind'' (1:50). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212)581-1212. (Isherwood)

'ORANGE FLOWER WATER' Craig Wright's play is about two marriages coming apart. The hurt that people cause one another is communicated only through words in this play -- sometimes too many of them (1:30). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, (212)868-4444. (Andrea Stevens)

* 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tender-hearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side-effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'A PICASSO' Jeffrey Hatcher's play is a formulaic two-hander set in occupied Paris in 1941. Pablo Picasso (Dennis Boutsikaris) is brought in for interrogation by the severe Miss Fischer (Jill Eikenberry), who works for the German cultural ministry (1:10). City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212)581-1212. (Isherwood)

'PRIVILEGE' Paul Weitz's delicate if uneven comedy examines the collateral damage sustained by the family of a disgraced titan of Wall Street. Conor Donovan and Harry Zittel are terrific as the sons of the fallen businessman (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, (212)246-4422. (Isherwood)

* 'SHOCKHEADED PETER' A gorgeous ''nasty picture book'' of a musical, in which badly behaved Victorian tots come to ghastly ends. Inspired by Heinrich Hoffmann's droll collection of grisly bedtime stories, ''Shockheaded Peter'' is both the silliest and most sinister show in town. It is also one of the smartest (1:40). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' A giggle of clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin is stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funnybone (1:30). Union Square, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100 . (Lawrence Van Gelder)

'SOULS OF NAPLES' As a lovable dupe who is happier tangling with a family of phantoms than facing the cold truths of his marriage, John Turturro exudes a winsome sincerity that pleasantly perfumes Roman Paska's otherwise flaccid production of this 1946 comedy by Eduardo De Filippo (2:00). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

* 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'WOMAN BEFORE A GLASS' Peggy Guggenheim, doyenne of the 20th-century art world, becomes the latest public figure to be exhumed onstage in this one-woman show starring the formidable Mercedes Ruehl. Written by Lanie Robertson, the play is gaudy and moderately fun (1:40). Promenade, Broadway at 76th Street, (212)239-6200 (Isherwood).

Off Off Broadway

'PLANET BANANA' If you think women's gymnastics would be more interesting if performed in outfits from the Victoria's Secret catalog, then ''Planet Banana'' is the place for you. Featuring incongruous stunts, moderately difficult circus routines and a sketchy searching-for-love story, the show is as enjoyable as it is raucous (1:25). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Genzlinger)

'THE THREE MUSKETEERS' A lot of story and actors have been crammed into this musical version. Unfortunately, that seems to have left little room for other crucial ingredients, like panache (2:30). Wings, 154 Christopher Street, (212)627-2961. (Genzlinger)

Long-Running Shows

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh -- sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street , (212)307-4747. (Brantley)

'BLUE MAN GROUP' Conceptual art as family entertainment (1:45). Astor Place Theater, 434 Lafayette Street, (212)254-4370. (Brantley)

'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador, 219 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'NAKED BOYS SINGING' That's who they are. That's what they do (1:05). 47th Street, 304 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates)

'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'STOMP' And the beat goes on (and on), with percussion unlimited (1:30). Orpheum Theater, Second Avenue at Eighth Street, (212)477-2477. (Brantley)

'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

Last Chance

'BONNIE PARKER' There is probably a lot of rich material in the psyche of Parker, who made her name as the bank-robbing partner of Clyde Barrow, but in her deadly one-woman show, Dixie Lee Sedgwick gives her audience only a one-dimensional character (2:00). Houseman Studio Theater, 450 West 42nd Street, (212)868-4444, closing on Sunday. (Gates)

* 'DAME EDNA; BACK WITH A VENGEANCE!' When she last appeared on Broadway five years ago, she was merely a megastar, Dame Edna condescendingly tells her audience; now she is ''a glittering gigastar.'' In this singing, dancing shrine to herself, she proves it by exploiting our culture's masochistic obsession with the rich and famous (2:30). Music Box, 239 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)

'FAUST IN LOVE' The Target Margin Theater's take on Goethe's metaphysical epic of a professor selling his soul to the devil for knowledge comes off with all the sophistication of an over-long ''Saturday Night Live'' skit (1:15). Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212)358-3657, closing tomorrow. (Phoebe Hoban)

'FINNEGANS WAKE' The idea of basing a musical on James Joyce's epic and near-impenetrable feast of language sounds perilously close to material for a skit on ''Saturday Night Live.'' But to the credit of Barbara Vann, who adapted the piece for the stage, her Medicine Show Theater Ensemble presents pure Joyce (2:30). Medicine Show Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, (212) 868-4444, closing tomorrow. (Anne Midgette).

'FIT TO KILL' It takes a certain type of actor to pull off comic noir, but someone forgot to tell whoever cast this who's-going-to-murder-whom thriller (2:00) . Clurman, 410 West 42nd Street, (212)279-4200, closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger)

'KASIMIR AND KAROLINE' The Slovak director Pavol Liska has a real talent forstaging, but while his production of Odon von Horvath's portrait of a corrupted society -- relocated from Munich in the 1930's to a contemporary world -- is pleasing to the eye, style often overshadows substance (1:30). Nature Theater of Oklahoma, at the Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, (212)726-1578, closing on Sunday. (Zinoman)

'MARGO VEIL' Len Jenkin's one-act play about a young, aspiring actress and intertwined lives falls somewhere between David Lynch and ''Saturday Night Live'' but it's also intricate, clever and solidly entertaining (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)352-3101, closing tomorrow. (Gates)

'ROBESON' The larger-than-life actor and activist Paul Robeson is a tall order for any play -- or for that matter actor -- to capture. But despite its limitations, it serves as a provocative primer to an historical figure who deserves a fuller analysis (2:10). Blue Heron Arts Center, 123 East 24th Street, (212)352-3101, closing on Sunday. (Hoban)

'ROMANCE' In his latest work, David Mamet knocks the four-letter stuffing out of his own staccato style. He then proceeds to beat up on the courtoom drama, the classic farce, ethnic and sexual stereotypes and his audience. It's a take-no-prisoners approach that, unfortunately, doesn't take any laughs either (1:35). Atlantic, 336 West 20th Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)

'WIDOWERS' HOUSES' A surprisingly mischievous rendering of George Bernard Shaw's first play, an 1892 bit of social criticism masquerading as a love story (2:15). 80 St. Mark's Place, at First Avenue, (212)598-9802, closing on Sunday. (Genzlinger)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

'A LOT LIKE LOVE' (PG-13, 107 minutes). A film that isn't half bad and every so often is pretty good, filled with real sentiment, worked-through performances and a story textured enough to sometimes feel a lot like life. (Manohla Dargis)

'ALIENS OF THE DEEP' (G, 48 minutes). A hybrid of undersea documentary and outer-space fantasy. Filmed in Imax 3-D, it is a visual adventure worthy of that much-degraded adjective, awesome. (Stephen Holden)

'THE AMITYVILLE HORROR' (R, 89 minutes). Low-key creepy rather than outright scary, this remake of the soporific 1979 horror flick marks a modest improvement on the original. But this time don't get attached to the family dog. (Dargis)

'BEAUTY SHOP' (PG-13, 105 minutes). Less a sequel than an old-fashioned sitcom spinoff, this loose and genial comedy moves the ''Barbershop'' franchise to Atlanta, and gives the ladies a turn at the warm, salty banter that made the first two installments so popular. (A.O. Scott)

'THE BALLAD OF JACK AND ROSE' (R, 112 minutes). A proud survivor of the 1960's and its utopian promise, Jack (Daniel Day-Lewis) lives alone on an island with his only daughter. A story about the limits of love, ''Ballad'' is also about the limits of idealism as well as, rather unfortunately, those of its restlessly ambitious writer and director, Rebecca Miller. (Dargis)

'BORN INTO BROTHELS' (not rated, 85 minutes, in Bengali), A lovely documentary about children of prostitutes in Calcutta. (Scott)

'BE COOL' (PG-13, 112 minutes). John Travolta returns as Chili Palmer, the reformed mobster he first played in ''Get Shorty,'' which arrived hot on the heels of ''Pulp Fiction.'' But while ''Get Shorty'' rode the ''Pulp Fiction'' craze with finesse, ''Be Cool'' is running on empty. (Dargis)

* 'THE BEST OF YOUTH' (not rated, six hours and 23 minutes, shown in two parts; in Italian). Marco Tullio Giordana's six-hour journey through recent Italian history is nothing less than a masterpiece, combining epic sweep with precise, heart-rending intimacy. (Scott)

'BRIDE AND PREJUDICE' (PG-13, 111 minutes). This Bollywood-style musical -- which transposes Jane Austen's 1813 novel to 21st-century India -- is as high concept and rife with cliche as anything churned out by Hollywood, but with worse production values and a load of sanctimony. (Dargis)

'CONSTANTINE' (R, 122 minutes). Hell's bells! Sprung from the Matrix, Keanu Reeves glowers his way through another effects-heavy, convoluted journey between worlds, in this case defined by theology rather than technology. (Scott)

'DEAD AND BREAKFAST' (not rated, 88 minutes). Matthew Leutwyler's horror movie about six young people trapped in a creepy small town goes for parody and fails. There is no suspense or real fun but tons of gore. (Anita Gates)

'DOWNFALL' (not rated, 155 minutes; in German). Bruno Ganz plays Hitler, palsied and furious, as his Reich collapses. The film's most daring gambit -- to treat Germany's monsters as human -- is also the source of its greatest failure, which is that it uses the conventions of wartime melodrama to elicit sympathy for people who hardly deserve it. (Scott)

'EATING OUT' (not rated, 85 minutes). A dreary erotic roundelay: a modern-day variant on a Shakespeare comedy, only without the verbal felicity or sense of dramatic structure. (Dana Stevens)

* 'ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM' (not rated, 110 minutes). This sober, informative chronicle of the biggest business scandal of the decade is almost indecently entertaining, in part because it offers some of the most satisfying movie villains in quite some time. Recommended for everyone except those likely to be in the Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling jury pools. (Scott)

* 'FEVER PITCH' (PG-13, 98 minutes). To watch this new, thoroughly winning if not especially good romantic comedy is to appreciate, yet again, that the great loves of our lives are rarely perfect. (Dargis)

'15' (not rated, 90 minutes, in Hokkien and Mandarin). A Singaporean film about the desultory adventures of a gang of disaffected youth starring young nonprofessional actors who aren't any good. (Stevens)

* 'GUNNER PALACE' (PG-13, 86 minutes). Raw, powerful and confusing -- less a polished documentary about American soldiers in Iraq than a living, unfinished document of a complicated war and the complicated young men who are fighting it. (Scott)

'GUESS WHO' (PG-13, 103 minutes). A loose, pointless remake of ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.'' (Scott)

'HAPPILY EVER AFTER' (not rated, 100 minutes; in French). A likable skin-deep sex comedy, which tries half-heartedly to present itself as a treatise on marriage. (Holden)

* 'HEAD-ON' (not rated, 118 minutes; in German and Turkish). This film about two strangers with suicidal tendencies and a deep commitment to self-aggrandizing drama is the first very good movie of 2005. (Dargis)

'HITCH' (PG-13, 115 minutes). As soft and sweet as a marshmallow, and about as interesting, this genial romantic comedy features the ever-charming Will Smith as a dating coach. (Scott)

'HOSTAGE' (R, 113 minutes). More than sad, it's slightly sickening to consider the technology, talent and know-how squandered on this pile of blood-soaked toxic waste dumped onto the screen in an attempt to salvage Bruce Willis's fading career as an action hero. (Holden)

'HOUSE OF D' (PG-13, 97 minutes). Robin Williams plays a wise and kindly mentally retarded janitor. Enough said. (Scott)

'IN MY COUNTRY' (R, 104 minutes). Juliette Binoche, playing a South African poet and reporter, is the weepy hand-wringing conscience of this high-minded but hopelessly wooden film. (Holden)

'INSIDE DEEP THROAT' (NC-17, 90 minutes). A lively, if maddeningly reductive documentary about Linda Lovelace, star of the notorious hard-core movie ''Deep Throat.'' (Dargis)

'THE INTERPRETER' (PG-13, 123 minutes). A political thriller, both apolitical and unthrilling, notable for two accomplishments: turning the United Nations into a movie set, and, even more remarkably, giving Nicole Kidman the opportunity to embody the suffering of Africans everywhere. (Scott)

'IT'S ALL GONE PETE TONG' (R, 88 minutes). A dance club D.J. loses his hearing and then his grip in this surprisingly sweet faux documentary, while Paul Kaye keeps us interested in a character who doesn't merit our affection but earns it nonetheless. (Dargis)

'THE JACKET' (R, 102 minutes). Adrien Brody plays Jack Starks, who is sent to a spooky psychiatric hospital for a murder he did not commit. The movie, full of red herrings, visual gimmicks and instances of egregious over-acting, is awfully silly, but not completely awful. (Scott)

'KING'S RANSOM' (PG-13, 97 minutes). The cinematic equivalent of trampled chewing gum on a subway platform. (Holden)

'KONTROLL' (R, 106 minutes; in Hungarian). Shot entirely in the Budapest subway system, Nimrod Antal's debut film is a grungy, shaggy-dog allegory -- a stylish, meandering trip to nowhere in particular. (Scott)

'KUNG FU HUSTLE' (R, 95 minutes, in Mandarin and Cantonese). This kinetic, exhausting, relentlessly entertaining film throws scraps of a half-century of international pop culture into a fast-whirling blender. (Scott)

* 'LOOK AT ME' (PG-13, 110 minutes; in French). A delicious comedy, as tart as it is sweet, of ambition, miscommunication and egoism. Set in a Paris that seems to be populated entirely by artists and writers, the film affectionately tweaks the bad manners and complacency of France's intellectual elite. (Scott)

'MADISON' (PG, 105 minutes). This film about hydroplane racing in a small Indiana town wants to be both heartwarming and quirky but is sometimes just cutesy instead. The cast does a fine job, but only moviegoers who care about nitrous-oxide injection systems are likely to appreciate the story. (Gates)

'THE MAN WHO COPIED' (not rated, 124 minutes, in Portuguese). From kitchen-sink realism, to unconvincing caper fantasy, this Brazilian film about a photocopier-turned-counterfeiter loses its bearings the moment it leaps from one to the other. (Holden)

'MELINDA AND MELINDA' (PG-13, 99 minutes). The same story, more or less, told two different ways -- as serious drama and as comedy. Though Woody Allen's drama lacks emotional intensity and the comedy lacks funny jokes, the director interweaves them deftly enough. (Scott)

* 'MILLION DOLLAR BABY' (PG-13, 135 minutes). Clint Eastwood takes what appears to be a conventional boxing-melodrama plot about a crusty old trainer whose heart is melted by a spirited young fighter and turns it into a glowing, somber meditation on friendship, ambition and death. (Scott)

* 'MILLIONS' (PG, 97 minutes). Given the gaudy violence that frequently moves Danny Boyle's stories forward and keeps them jumping, it may come as something of a surprise that he has directed a heartfelt, emotionally delicate children's movie about life and death and all the parts in between. (Dargis)

'MISS CONGENIALITY 2: ARMED AND FABULOUS' (PG-13, 100 minutes). Wading through this junky sequel to her genial goofball hit ''Miss Congeniality,'' Sandra Bullock looks as if she would rather be shoveling pig waste, though of course in some respects that is exactly what she's doing. (Dargis)

'NIGHT OF HENNA' (not rated, 95 minutes). In the tradition of ''The Jazz Singer'' and ''My Big Fat Greek Wedding'': a young Pakistani woman living in San Francisco rebels against her impending arranged marriage. Sincere but amateurish. (Scott)

'ODESSA ... ODESSA!' (not rated, 96 minutes). Most of the people who gather to reminisce and sing the old songs in this mournful, slowly paced cinematic poem are Jewish exiles from the decrepit Ukrainian city, which they remember as paradise. (Holden)

'OLD BOY' (R, 118 minutes; in Korean). The latest in dubious pulp-fiction cool, ''Oldboy'' centers on a seemingly ordinary businessman, Dae-su (the terrific Choi Min-sik), who, after being mysteriously imprisoned, goes on an exhausting rampage, seeking answers and all manner of bloody revenge. (Dargis)

'ONE MISSED CALL' (not rated, 100 minutes; in Japanese). Take the Japanese horror film ''Ringu,'' replace the deadly videotapes with killer cellphones, and add a baroque, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink climactic sequence involving ghosts, zombies, disembodied limbs and pickled fetuses. Are you sure you want to take this call? (Stevens)

'THE PACIFIER' (PG, 97 minutes). Despite the specter of boogeymen, this family flick remains chipper and occasionally clever, as it sends up the high-tech know-how required in 21st-century parenting. (Ned Martel)

'PALINDROMES' (not rated, 100 minutes). The same backward and forward: dud. (Scott)

'PERLASCA' (not rated, 104 minutes; in Italian). In Hungary in 1944, Giorgio Perlasca saved the lives of thousands of Jews, and his memory deserves better than this inept Italian television film. (Gates)

'THE RING TWO' (PG-13, 111 minutes). In ''The Ring,'' Rachel (Naomi Watts), a journalist and single mom, escaped the marauding ghost in the machine, and she now thinks she has entered a new chapter. No such luck; she is actually mucking about on a slag heap of recycled scares, dumb lines and predictable entanglements. (Dargis)

'RAGING DOVE' (not rated, 70 minutes). A bruising but illuminating documentary considers how nationalism flattened one young, sure-footed boxer, who was born in Nazareth to a Palestinian family. (Martel)

'ROBOTS' (PG, 89 minutes). This computer-animated film's setting, a world made entirely for and by clanky mechanical gizmos, is rendered with impressive skill and imagination. Otherwise, it's the usual junkyard assemblage of celebrity voices, lame pop-cultural allusions and heartwarming lessons. (Scott)

'SAHARA' (PG-13, 130 minutes). It may not be ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' but this screen adaptation of Clive Cussler's sprawling African adventure yarn is a movie that keeps half a brain in its head while adopting the amused, cocky smirk of the Indiana Jones romps. (Holden)

'SAVE THE GREEN PLANET' (not rated, 118 minutes; in Korean). A dog named Earth and aliens both domestic and imported rotate around one another in this self-consciously freaky, rambunctiously goofy genre hybrid from South Korea. Just don't ask what it all means. (Dargis)

* 'SCHIZO' (not rated, 86 minutes, in Russian). This modest neo-realist film from Kazhakstan is both tough and tender. As the movie follows the conventions of a crime-tinged coming-of-age story, it achieves a rough, convincing poetry. (Scott)

'SHORT CUT TO NIRVANA: KUMBH MELA' (not rated, 85 minutes, in Hindi). Seventy million pilgrims gather in India to seek enlightenment; this engaging documentary travelogue, as the title suggests, will save you the trip. (Scott)

'SIN CITY' (R, 126 minutes). Based on the comic book series of the same name by Frank Miller, this slavishly faithful screen adaptation tracks the ups and downs of tough guys and dolls. ''Sin City'' has been made with such scrupulous care and obvious love for its genre influences that it's a shame the movie is kind of a bore. (Dargis)

'STATE PROPERTY II' (R, 94 minutes). Better than the first one, which isn't saying much, but this brutal celebration of the spirit of capitalism has some moments of energy and wit. (Scott)

* 'TORREMOLINOS 73' (not rated, 91 minutes, in Spanish). This movie's gentle, humanist vision of pornographic filmmaking as a sexual and aesthetic act of emancipation is a far cry from the graphic social realism of recent films like ''A Hole in My Heart.'' (Stevens)

'THE UPSIDE OF ANGER' (R, 116 minutes). The upside of this deeply flawed attempt to marry midlife romantic comedy with domestic farce is that it provides a platform for Kevin Costner and Joan Allen to do some marvelous work. (Scott)

'WALK ON WATER' (not rated, 104 minutes). The director Eytan Fox takes on the controversial subject of Israeli nationalism in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Despite an implausible climax and a cloying conclusion, this movie's quiet intelligence sneaks up on you. (Stevens)

'THE WILD PARROTS OF TELEGRAPH HILL' (G, 83 minutes). The subject of this small, affectionate documentary is a pony-tailed, 50-ish San Franciscan who tends a flock of around four dozen wild parrots. (Holden)

'WINNING GIRLS THROUGH PSYCHIC MIND CONTROL' (not rated, 93 minutes). Sam (Ruben Santiago-Hudson) suddenly develops psychic powers in this likable but only sporadically funny comedy. (Gates)

'WINTER SOLSTICE' (R, 93 minutes). This is the kind of ambling, event-free family drama that will either draw audiences in with its understated power, or quietly bore them out of their skulls. (Stevens)

Film Series

'ASIAN CINEVISIONS' (tomorrow). Sandra Oh (''Sideways'') and the Chinese-Canadian director Mina Shum, who worked together in the 1994 romantic comedy ''Double Happiness,'' continue their collaboration in ''Long Life, Happiness and Prosperity.''

Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212)708-9400; $10, $8 for 65+, $6 for students. (Stevens)

The Neapolitan actor Massimo Troisi, who died of a heart attack at age 41 after achieving international renown in the title role of ''The Postman'' (1994), was well known in Italy as a writer and director of comic films. The Film Society of Lincoln Center is showing five of Troisi's own films. Walter Reade Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)875-5600; $10, $7 for students, $6 for members, $5 for children and 65+. (Stevens)

'SPEEDY' (today and tomorrow). Film Forum's exhaustive Harold Lloyd retrospective features Lloyd's last silent film, ''Speedy'' (1928), in which the bespectacled comic, playing a scatterbrained cabbie, gives the real-life Babe Ruth a lift to Yankee Stadium. 209 West Houston Street, South Village; (212)727-8110; $10; $5 for members and children under 12. (Stevens)

Opera

'UN BALLO IN MASCHERA' (Tuesday) Opera buffs have been rushing to the Met to see the ''new'' Deborah Voigt, who looks and sounds just terrific since undergoing gastric bypass surgery. But for the final ''Ballo'' of the season, Aprile Millo takes over the role of Amelia. And this impassioned soprano has her own coterie of devoted fans. 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000, $26 to $170. (Anthony Tommasini)

'BEFORE NIGHT FALLS' (Monday and Tuesday) Its first act, heard last year in a reading of American Opera Projects, was strikingly fine. Now Jorge Martin's complete opera based on Reinaldo Arenas's memoir is ready for its close-up -- as a reading, of excerpts -- in conjunction with the Cuban Arts Festival. 8 p.m., Clark Studio Theater, Rose Building, Lincoln Center, (718)398-4024, $15, $12 for students and 65+. (Anne Midgette)

'LA CLEMENZA DI TITO' (Tonight and Monday) James Levine is hardly alone in believing that Mozart's rush-job opera seria, completed just three months before he died, is a noble, stunning and underappreciated work. Starting tonight, he conducts the Metropolitan Opera's revival of Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's highly stylized yet dignified 1984 production, with a fine cast headed by Frank Lopardo, Anne Sofie von Otter and Sarah Connolly. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House (see above), $35 to $200 tonight, $26 to $170 on Monday. (Tommasini)

'FAUST' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) In a revelatory performance that cuts through the sentimentality and hokum of Gounod's ''Faust,'' James Levine captures the music's dignity and elegance. And the Met has assembled a top-rank cast, especially Rene Pape as Mephistopheles. Alas, the new production by Andrei Serban is a jumble, with no discernable concept and no consistent look. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Wednesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House (see above); sold out tomorrow, $95 to $170 remaining on Wednesday. (Tommasini)

'MARIO AND THE MAGICIAN' (Tonight and tomorrow). The veteran composer Francis Thorne has long been an essential figure in New York contemporary music circles. So it's good news that Mr. Thorne's new opera, based on the Thomas Mann story, with a libretto by J.D. McClatchy, will have its professional premiere by the Center for Contemporary Opera. 8 p.m., Kaye Playhouse at Hunter College, 68th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues, (212)772-4448, $30 to $50. (Tommasini)

'ORPHEE ET EURIDICE' (Monday) The contralto Ewa Podles has become a cult figure in the opera world, and the Oratorio Society of New York has snared her for a role she's already committed to record: Gluck's ''Orpheus,'' in the Berlioz version, with Jennifer Aylmer as her Euridice. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $17 to $75. (Midgette)

'TURANDOT' (Tomorrow, Thursday) Franco Zeffirelli's everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach to stage direction reaches its apotheosis with this opulent production, which the Met stocks with serviceable but hardly headlining voices. Tomorrow at 8:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House (see above); $40 to $215 tomorrow, $26 to $170 on Thursday. (Midgette)

Classical Music

BANG ON A CAN ALL-STARS WITH IVA BITTOVA (Tonight) She's been labeled everything from experimental to pop avant-garde: whatever you call her, the Czech singer and violinist Iva Bittova doesn't make many American appearances. This one coincides with an upcoming CD on Canteloupe Music and features music of Ms. Bittova, Glenn Branca and other Downtown icons. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $20 and $32.

'FROM PROUST TO BOULEZ' (Tonight and Sunday) Both Marcel Proust and Pierre Boulez were French. It's not clear what else links this pair of concerts except that they're the first ventures of a new chamber series with the ''Alliance Players.'' The Proust evening, tonight, offers Saint-Saens and Franck; Sunday's concert celebrates Mr. Boulez's 80th birthday. Tonight at 8, Sunday night at 7:30, French Institute/Alliance Francaise, 55 East 59th Street, (212)307-4100, $15 for each concert. (Midgette)

SOILE ISOKOSKI (Sunday) It is, simply, a lovely voice. This Finnish soprano takes a break from her run of ''Faust'' at the Met to offer a recital program that wends its way between the familiar (Mozart and Wolf songs, Wagner's ''Wesendonck Lieder'') and the less familiar: songs by Ture Rangstrom, a Swedish contemporary of Strauss, and Aulis Sallinen, a contemporary Finnish composer. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $28 and $38. (Midgette)

EVGENY KISSIN AND JAMES LEVINE (Sunday) This collaboration has worked fantastically with Mr. Levine on the podium and Mr. Kissin at the keyboard, but here they share a piano bench to play Schubert, while listeners take bets on whether their very different keyboard styles -- Mr. Kissin is a firebrand, Mr. Levine a rationalist -- can be made to gel. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall. (212)247-7800, $39 to $134. (Kozinn)

KREMERATA BALTICA SOLOISTS (Tuesday) ''Shostakovich and After,'' the Shostakovich including the Symphony No. 15, the After being a work by Alexander Wustin. And oh, yes, the star being the superb violinist Gidon Kremer. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $28 to $38. (Oestreich)

MANHATTAN SCHOOL OF MUSIC SYMPHONY (Tonight) The maestro Kurt Masur, formerly of the New York Philharmonic, is sure to give the students -- and the audience -- a grown-up experience. 8 p.m., Manhattan School of Music, Broadway at 122nd Street, Morningside Heights, (917)493-4428, free but tickets are required. (Oestreich)

BLAIR McMILLEN (Wednesday) This prodigiously talented and adventurous young pianist is known mostly for championing contemporary music. On this program he plays either original or arranged works from the Faenza manuscript of early Italian keyboard music. Not surprisingly, he also gives the premieres of works by Fabrizio De Rossi Re and Matthew Greenbaum based on the manuscript. 8 p.m., Casa Italiana at Columbia University, 1161 Amsterdam Avenue, between 116th and 118th Streets, Morningside Heights, (212)854-1623, $12, $5 for students and 65+. (Tommasini)

MUSIC BEFORE 1800 (Sunday) This fine early music series ends its season with a Spanish baroque program of vocal and instrumental works by Joseph de Torres and Joseph de Nebra, performed by the Al Ayre Espanol ensemble in its New York debut. 4 p.m., Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, (212)666-9266, $25 to $40; $20 to $35 for students and 62+. (Jeremy Eichler)

NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday) With Mstislav Rostropovich conducting and Martha Argerich as piano soloist this weekend, two big temperaments collide. Expect sparks, maybe lightning. Leonard Slatkin takes over on Thursday. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500, $25 to $90. (Oestreich)

ITZHAK PERLMAN (Wednesday) For such a household name, you don't find too many opportunities these days to hear Itzhak Perlman in a traditional full-length recital. Here he is playing music by Mozart, Beethoven, Smetana and Ellen Taaffe Zwilich with the pianist Rohan De Silva. 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500, $35 to $70. (Eichler)

PETER SERKIN (Sunday) Known for his adventurous programming, Mr. Serkin is really having fun with this piano recital, presented by the essential Free for All at Town Hall series. Besides works by Bach and Mozart and a recent work by the British composer Oliver Knussen, he will play keyboard pieces by Renaissance composers: Josquin, John Bull and John Dowland. 5 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, (212)707-8787, free; two tickets per person are available at the box office starting at noon. (Tommasini)

MARK STEINBERG AND MITSUKO UCHIDA (Tomorrow) Mozart's Violin Sonatas can sound uncharacteristically stolid, but if anyone can bring them to life it's Mark Steinberg, a brilliantly quirky violinist, and Mitsuko Uchida, one of today's most lyrical pianists. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $48 and $64. (Allan Kozinn)

CHRISTIAN TETZLAFF AND LEIF OVE ANDSNES (Wednesday) Mr. Tetzlaff, the violinist, and Mr. Andsnes, the pianist, get together for a conventional evening of sonatas, from Beethoven to Grieg. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $25 to $84. (Bernard Holland)

JERRY WILLARD (Thursday) This fine guitarist and lutenist presents a potted history of the guitar and its predecessors, from the Renaissance to modern times. 6:30 p.m., Dahesh Museum, 580 Madison Avenue, near 56th Street, (212)759-0606, free. (Kozinn)

Art

Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.

Museums

AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: 'TOTEMS TO TURQUOISE: NATIVE NORTH AMERICAN JEWELRY ARTS OF THE NORTHWEST AND SOUTHWEST,' through July 10. Jewelry dating to prehistoric times are used here to lend credence to contemporary works that are sometimes little more than glitzy knockoffs. Central Park West at 79th Street, (212)769-5100. (Grace Glueck)

* ASIA SOCIETY AND QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'EDGE OF DESIRE: RECENT ART IN INDIA,' through June 5. A highly selective, multigenerational survey of different kinds of contemporary art being made in India, embracing craft, folk and tribal traditions as well as popular culture and academic modernism. The smaller portion is at the Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue at 70th Street, (212)288-6400; the more expansive and varied section at the Queens Museum of Art, New York City Building, Flushing Meadows- Corona Park, (718)592-9700. Also at Queens: ''Fatal Love.'' (Holland Cotter)

BARD GRADUATE CENTER FOR STUDIES IN THE DECORATIVE ARTS, DESIGN AND CULTURE: 'CHERISHED POSSESSIONS: A NEW ENGLAND LEGACY,' through June 5. More than 100 choice objects from that vast attic of family relics, historic New England, from a box with two worm-eaten pieces of 17th-century bread to a grand Copley portrait. Thanks to bright captioning, this show conveys a sense of family connection with the objects. 18 West 86th Street, (212)501-3000. (Glueck)

BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'BASQUIAT,' through June 5. Jean-Michel Basquiat (1960-88) wrote, painted and drew his way to fame (usually on the same surface) with a loquacious style that mixed mediums and gave visual voice to the glories, history and pain of blackness. Despite a few glitches, this generous retrospective provides an exhilarating account of his short innovative career. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000. (Roberta Smith)

* BROOKLYN MUSEUM: LUCE VISIBLE STORAGE/STUDY CENTER Sleek vitrines house 1,500 objects from four departments and represents 15 centuries of art and design of the Americas. (See above.) (Smith)

COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES: DESIGNING FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely tech-y show of industrial fibers and fabrics; but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'etre is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck)

COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'HELLA JONGERIUS SELECTS: WORKS FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through Sept. 4. Shifting through the museum's outstanding holdings in embroidered samplers, the innovative Dutch designer has selected a wonderfully reverberant show and also based a series of new wall hangings on sampler motifs. Their combined display diagrams the fraught but essential symbiosis of old and new. (See above.) (Smith)

* EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'MEXICO, THE REVOLUTION AND BEYOND, PHOTOGRAPHS BY CASASOLA 1900-1940,' through July 31. This extraordinary show of work from a photo agency established by Agustin Victor Casasola in Mexico City has the span of a Greek epic and the nested themes and subplots of a picaresque novel, with Revolutionary heros and a vivid cast of everyday people. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212)831-7272. (Cotter)

* 'SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'HUGO BOSS PRIZE 2004: RIRKRIT TIRAVANIJA,' through May 11. For his solo show, Mr. Tiravanija built a low-power television station from inexpensive materials and papered the gallery's walls with instructions on how anyone and everyone can do the same, raising issues of government control and First Amendment rights. 1071 Fifth Avenue at 89th Street, (212)423-3500. (Cotter)

SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DANIEL BUREN: THE EYE OF THE STORM,' through June 8. Mr. Buren has devised a lumbering 81-foot-tall construction, mirrored floor to ceiling. Imagine a glass office tower slammed through the front of the building. The spiraling ramps and circular roof complete themselves in the mirrored reflections; there is not much to the work beyond that. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman)

INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'LARRY CLARK,' through June 5. The controversial creator of two influential photography books -- ''Tulsa'' (1971) and ''Teenage Lust'' (1983) -- and director of the brilliant movie ''Kids'' (1995) has his first retrospective. The provocative Mr. Clark specializes in the dark and seamy side of American youth culture and his best works are unnervingly intimate, morally disturbing and beautiful. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000. (Ken Johnson)

* JAPAN SOCIETY: 'LITTLE BOY: THE ARTS OF JAPAN'S EXPLODING SUBCULTURE,' through July 24. Masterminded by the artist-writer-entrepreneur Takashi Murakami, this eye-boggling show traces the unexamined legacy of World War II as played out in Japan's popular culture. With Godzilla and Hello Kitty presiding, it reveals how this culture was twisted and darkened by the otaku, or geek, subculture, which has in turn influenced younger artists. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Smith)

* METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'DIANE ARBUS REVELATIONS,' through May 30. Arbus could be cruel, but tenderness and melancholy were her finest modes of expression as she captured a moment, the anxious 1950's and 60's, and captured New York. Appropriately, she is given the royal treatment at the Met, including some absurdly theatrical galleries, where her work reveals that in the end we are all drawn together by our different flaws. Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Kimmelman)

METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE BISHOP JADES,' through January 2006. Jade has been treasured since ancient time, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. (See above.) (Cotter)

METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'DEFINING YONGLE: IMPERIAL ART IN EARLY 15TH-CENTURY CHINA,' through July 10. Sequestered in the exquisite Chinese decorative arts galleries, this show is both perfect and messy. Its porcelain, metalwork, embroidery and ivory highlight the astounding craftsmanship of the imperial workshops under the Ming emperor Yongle, and reflect the miscegenation of Asian cultures at a time when most roads led to China. (See above.) (Smith)

METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'MAX ERNST: A RETROSPECTIVE,' through July 10. Despite and because of Ernst's being one of modernism's mystery men, he remains of interest, and there are intriguing things in this survey: from early Surrealist paintings, to near-abstract images generated by chance techniques, to the collage-style books some consider his masterworks. But only when he responds to specific events, like war, does his art snap into focus. (See above.) (Cotter)

* MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'EL BARRIO: PUERTO RICAN NEW YORK,' through June 12. A snaphot of El Barrio -- East Harlem, or Spanish Harlem -- as seen through archival images and pictures by the contemporary photographer Hiram S. Maristany taken at a revolutionary political moment in the1960's and early 70's. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212)534-1672. (Cotter)

* MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'THOMAS DEMAND,' through May 30: A generally stellar midcareer survey of the 40-year-old German artist, who makes life-size reconstructions of scenes, often ones he has come across in photographs, taking his own cinematic works. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Kimmelman)

* MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: PERMANENT COLLECTION Despite a fairly inchoate assemblage of contemporary art on the second floor, the early story of modernism is now retold in an installation about as ravishing as any sequence of galleries in any new museum in recent memory. (See above.) (Kimmelman)

NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: 'SURREALISM USA,' through May 8. Surrealism shook American arts, and this high-spirited exhibition examines the fallout with a wide-angle lens. It presents 120 works by more than 60 artists, from Europeans in exile to Abstract Expressionists to the often forgotten. 1083 Fifth Avenue near 89th Street, (212)369-4880. (Smith)

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART: THE CHARLES AND VALERIE DIKER COLLECTION OF AMERICAN INDIAN ART,' through April 2006. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. (See above.) (Glueck)

NEUE GALERIE: 'PORTRAITS OF AN AGE: PHOTOGRAPHY IN GERMANY AND AUSTRIA, 1900-1938,' through June 6. More than 100 faces shot by 35 photographers. It's a savvy show that homes in on the changing ways people presented themselves in an era of rapidly turning social values. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200. (Glueck)

THE NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: 'BYRDCLIFFE: AN AMERICAN ARTS AND CRAFTS COLONY,' through May 15. In its heyday this colony for artists, musicians and writers in Woodstock, N.Y., produced rugged, elegantly designed Arts and Crafts furniture, plus pottery, painting, jewelry, metalwork and textiles. The colony's spirit pervades the show in photographs and other memorabilia. 170 Central Park West, at 76th Street, (212)873-3400, through May 15. (Glueck)

P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Kimmelman)

THE UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO: VISION AND CONTINUITY,' through Sept. 4. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of a community museum begun in 1976. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces that inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, (212)228-0110. (Glueck)

* WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'CY TWOMBLY: FIFTY YEARS OF WORKS ON PAPER,' through May 8. Despite the title, this is basically a show of paintings. It starts in the 1950's, with a personal anti-aesthetic in which scribbling was draftsmanship, and gouging and scratching were gestural painting. After a move to Italy, words appeared. Later the work turns lush, into a kind of horticultural expressionism that is appetizing and uningratiating. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800)944-8639. (Cotter)

* WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'TIM HAWKINSON,' through May 29. On the gee-whiz meter, Mr. Hawkinson skews high. His midcareer retrospective, like a mad scientists' fair of screwball contraptions, hopscotches from one dexterous tour de force to the next. (See above.) (Kimmelman)

WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART AT ALTRIA: 'SUE DE BEER: BLACK SUN,' through June 24. In a walk-in pink castle, ''Black Sun'' is a two-screen video about teenage girlhood, which alternates passages of lyrical visual beauty and emotional poignancy with periods of aimless tedium. 120 Park Avenue at 42nd Street, (917)663-24538639. (Johnson)

Galleries: Uptown

PETER HOWSON, 'CHRISTOS ANESTE' Working with a sharp pencil on small square panels in a profusely detailed, expressionistic and sometimes hallucinatory style that harks back to the Northern Renaissance, this British artist brings impressive skill and tragicomic verve to subjects like the trials of Jesus, the temptation of St. Anthony and the delusions of Don Quixote. Flowers, 1000 Madison Avenue at 77th Street, (212)439-1700, through May 7. (Johnson)

JULIAN SCHNABEL This excellent selection of 21 large and mostly early paintings includes some of the very works that made Mr. Schnabel the most hotly talked-about artist of the Neo-Expressionist era. C & M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212)861-0020, through June 4. (Johnson)

* WAYNE THIEBAUD 'SINCE 1962: A SURVEY' In the early 60's, Mr. Thiebaud arrived at the buttery thick still-life paintings of commercial food products that perfectly combined formalism, realism and Pop. This excellent small retrospective shows how he got there and some of the places he has been since. Allan Stone, 113 East 90th Street, (212)987-4997, through May 27. (Johnson)

Galleries: 57th Street

THOMAS STRUTH: 'AUDIENCE' Handsome new photographs and an alternately tedious, exhilarating video examine the aesthetic experience in terms of space and time from the point of view of the audience, ourselves actively included. Marian Goodman, 24 West 57th Street, (212)977-7160, through May 7. (Smith)

Galleries: SoHo

* '3 X ABSTRACTION: NEW METHODS OF DRAWING BY HILMA AF KLIMT, EMMA KUNZ AND AGNES MARTIN,' This fascinating and beautiful show presents mostly abstract, geometric drawings by three women thought to have been motivated largely by spiritual purposes. Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212)219-2166, through May 21. (Johnson)

Galleries: Chelsea

'JUTTA KOETHER' A small survey of a German-born New York painter whose graffiti-inspired brushwork, fluorescent palette, fragmented images and heavy-duty quotations define her medium as defiantly multipurpose. It provides pleasure, incites thought and questions assumptions about taste and technique. Thomas Erben, 516 West 20th Street, (212)645-8701, through May 7. (Smith)

SAM KUSACK: 'PHASE THREE: SUBSTRATES' Mr. Kusack's sleek industrial fountain of cut-out aluminum, metal tubing and a supposedly real meteorite is like a prop for a science fiction movie. Rare, 521 West 26th Street, (212)268-1520, through May 14. (Johnson)

JONAS MEKAS: 'FRAGMENTS OF PARADISE' This retrospective sampler of a revered member of the New York avant-garde film community presents short and long, typically low-production, diaristic films from the last five decades on video screens. Also, a cacophonous, 12-monitor installation shows 24 hours in the life of the artist and his family. Maya Stendhal, 545 West 20th Street, (212)366-1549, through May 14. (Johnson)

'NEOCON' This soberly handsome, eight-artist show bets you can be hip and conservative at the same time.

HEADLINE: Citing Cuts, M.T.A. Chief Sees Delay on Big Projects

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
The chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said yesterday that he thought major expansion projects like a Second Avenue subway would be built, though it might take years longer than first projected. 
 ''They're not canceled,'' the chairman, Peter S. Kalikow, said at a meeting where his board unanimously approved a scaled-back capital program for 2005 to 2009. ''They're just being stretched out.'' 
 Mr. Kalikow made his first public comments since the Legislature and Gov. George E. Pataki approved financing for a five-year capital program that provides $21.1 billion, though the authority requested $27.8 billion in September. 
 Mr. Kalikow said he was considering returning to Albany to seek more money if the authority concluded that the expansion projects could not make any progress at all. He also said passage of a November bond act, which would raise $1.45 billion of the $21.1 billion, was critical. 
 He insisted that the state had already provided enough money for his main objective: basic maintenance and upgrades to the existing subway, bus and rail network. The state authorized $16 billion of the $21.1 billion for such a ''core program,'' close to the $17.2 billion the authority sought.
 ''It's not a question of a glass half full or half empty,'' Mr. Kalikow said. ''The glass is 93 percent full.'' 
 This week transit advocates protested the decision to put off full-scale rehabilitation of 12 subway stations that are in varying states of decay. Mr. Kalikow expressed sympathy but said station rehabilitation, while highly visible, was ''cosmetic'' rather than fundamental. 
 ''Billions of dollars in the capital program will be devoted to what we call invisible infrastructure -- the things that make the system work,'' he said.
 Mr. Kalikow was less optimistic about the three major expansion projects that have been under discussion for decades: the Second Avenue subway, a connection between the Long Island Rail Road and Grand Central Terminal, and a direct rail link from Lower Manhattan to Kennedy International Airport.
 The authority received $2.5 billion for the three ''megaprojects,'' not the $7.9 billion it had requested. Officials said it would take weeks to determine how the $2.5 billion could be used best to keep the projects afloat.
 ''I'm disappointed on a personal level that we didn't get enough money to put the 'megas' in place, but we did get the core program,'' Mr. Kalikow said. He added later, ''They are important projects, important to the region, important to the economic growth of this area, but if the money is not there, it just is not there.''
 A spokeswoman for Mr. Pataki said he thought there was enough money to advance the Second Avenue and Grand Central projects, on which nearly $1 billion has been spent.
 ''It would be irresponsible not to proceed on these projects, because they are too critical to the future growth of New York City,'' said the spokeswoman, Lynn Rasic. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has committed $2 billion in city money for a fourth large project -- the extension of the No. 7 subway line west and south -- and $400 million for the rest of the capital plan. Delays in highly visible projects like subway station repairs, among other cuts in the capital program, could hurt the mayor in his re-election effort.
 ''The city will be scrutinizing the cuts as part of its responsibility,'' Susan L. Kupferman, who represents Mr. Bloomberg on the board, said during the meeting. Mr. Kalikow said later, ''We've asked the mayor, we've asked him on numerous occasions, and he has been generous, but we think we have all we can get from him.''
 The revised capital plan now goes to the Capital Program Review Board, a panel that includes representatives of Mr. Pataki, Mr. Bloomberg and the leaders of both houses of the Legislature. 
 The plan will then be presented to federal officials, who have expressed willingness to pay for roughly one-third of the Second Avenue and Grand Central projects provided that the state and local contributions are deemed adequate. 
 ''We have to wait and see how the M.T.A. plans to allocate the state funding that it has received,'' said Paul M. Griffo, a spokesman for the Federal Transit Administration. ''We're kind of in a holding pattern until then.''

HEADLINE: Josef Albers/Donald Judd

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:

'Structure and Color'
Brooke Alexander
59 Wooster Street, SoHo
Through May 21
 This vivacious, museum-quality exhibition is a call-and-response echo chamber of levitating squares and rectangles of color. Some inspirit the paintings and prints by Josef Albers (1888-1976). The others are embodied in the sculptures and prints of Donald Judd (1928-94), leader of the so-called Minimal Art movement.
 Despite the 40-year age difference, the two artists look strikingly simpatico. Both loved color, and decided that straightforward planes of it, whether in oil paint or Plexiglas, were the shortest path to complexity. Both approached their art with a pragmatism and a love of the physical that was almost mystical.
 A product and proponent of the Bauhaus, Albers turned from furniture design to painting after emigrating to the United States in 1933, translating his ideas about color into pulsating abstract paintings of concentric squares. These squares within squares were, for Judd, who segued from painting into sculpture, furniture design and architecture, ''one of the best ideas in the world.'' What was really great about them, though, was that they were off square; each was placed a little low in the larger one, creating a rhythmic, irregular recession.
 At Alexander, the majestic enfilade of grays and greens that is Albers's ''Study for Homage to the Square (Spring Starting)'' of 1962 shares a wall with six Judd woodblock prints that measure out three shades of cadmium yellow in positive and negative rectangles. Positive and negative merge in a translucent Judd floor box: two sheets of metal, plus three sheets of orange Plexiglas, plus five wires.
 In his embossed drawings in ink, Albers bent planes into geometric structures that resembled Judd's furniture, while Judd made parallel lines in a wall relief by inserting slabs of blue Plexiglas into a sheet of folded aluminum. Judd could blast away with cadmium red light and purple, as in an early stepped floor piece, or lower the volume to a gray-on-gray whisper in a wall box of Plexiglas and aluminum. Albers clinched black and deep red between two shades of blue, but also eked two colors from a single band of deep green by scraping half of it down until the canvas glowed through.
 Judd may have admired Albers's squares within squares, but he couldn't find a way to use more than two colors in his sculptures until his Lascaux series of the early 1980's. These aggregates of shallow open pans individually painted and screwed together added new and needed twists to his cardinal principles of real color, materials and space. It is not hard to see their syncopated honeycombs of rectangles beside, above and below rectangles as homages to Albers's homages to the square. ROBERTA SMITH

HEADLINE: After 99 Days, Testing Winds

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28 

 BODY:
With his presidency at best becalmed and at worst beset -- just 99 days into his second term, President Bush seized the prime-time power of an East Room news conference for only the fourth time in his tenure in an effort to show that he could still do what he has always done in the face of storms around him: make his own weather.
 But even after his hourlong encounter with reporters was over on Thursday night, the atmosphere remained unsettled. The changes he suggested to help keep Social Security solvent seemed unlikely to unfreeze the stalemate on Capitol Hill over revising the system. He acknowledged that he had no easy fix for high gasoline prices, nor any firm timetable for bringing American troops home from Iraq. 
 And his robust defense of John R. Bolton, his nominee to be ambassador to the United Nations, did not remove the questions about Mr. Bolton's handling of intelligence or his treatment of subordinates.
 Mr. Bush called the news conference because his centerpiece domestic proposal -- overhauling Social Security -- is stalled despite 60 days of his personal barnstorming around the country to sell his plan for personal investment accounts; his United Nations nominee is mired in controversy; his effort to force an up-or-down Senate vote on his judicial nominees seems uncertain to succeed; and his poll ratings equal the worst of his 51 months in office. But this president has never been one to dwell on the obstacles. 
 ''I'm not surprised that some are balking at doing hard work,'' Mr. Bush said in answer to the first question about whether he was frustrated at the slow progress of his agenda. ''But I have a duty as the president to define problems facing our nation and to call upon people to act.''
 So Mr. Bush did what he likes to do best: He took his case directly to the people. 
 Yet with gasoline prices and interest rates high and economic growth slowing; with some restive Republicans on Capitol Hill worried about their electoral fortunes, not his; with the whiff of reported ethical improprieties whirling around the House majority leader, Tom DeLay; and with lame-duck status stalking Mr. Bush with each passing month, the question now is whether he can prevail by simply persevering, or whether he will have to give to receive. 
 He pronounced himself to be ''moving the process along'' on Social Security by proposing that future benefits grow faster for people who are less affluent than for those who are better off (a delicate way of suggesting benefits cuts for the wealthy). But he gave no ground on his insistence that any overhaul must include private investment accounts -- which Democrats uniformly oppose -- declaring, ''I feel strongly that there needs to be voluntary personal savings accounts as a part of the Social Security system.''
 Mr. Bush spoke calmly, confidently, but was less exuberant than in his first news conference after his re-election. He fired a direct shot at some prominent figures in his party who have couched Democratic opposition to his conservative judicial nominees as a question of hostility to the religious faithful, declaring: ''I think people are opposing my nominees because they don't like the judicial philosophy of the people I've nominated.''
 That may well be because the president knows he could earn political points with his base even if Mr. Bolton, or his judicial nominees, should be defeated. It would be much harder, however, for Mr. Bush to claim victory on overhauling Social Security if he cannot win adoption of some kind of personal retirement savings accounts in the program. The prospects for that seem dimmer at the end of his campaign to build public support for the idea than they did at the beginning.
 ''In his defense, I would judge it much too early to determine whether it's dead or not,'' said Charles O. Jones, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''But it certainly in the short run looks bad. The one thing this guy has in his own mind, post-9/11, as part of his leadership, is persistence. Now, you can also characterize it as stubbornness, and it's very easy to go from there to arrogance.''
 The latest Washington Post-ABC News poll showed 2-to-1 disapproval for the president's handling of the Social Security issue and, for the first time in those organizations' polls, more people opposed to private accounts than supporting them.
 And just as Mr. Bush has been forced to acknowledge that his proposed personal accounts would do nothing to assure the future solvency of Social Security (at least in the short term), he has conceded that the energy bill that he wants Congress to pass would do nothing to lower high gas prices this summer. 
 ''This is a very critical time for the president,'' said former Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, the kind of middle-of-the-road figure who spent his career looking for compromises. 
 Mr. Bush said several times that he would listen to good ideas from either party, would seek solutions regardless of partisan advantage. But he also made it clear that his fundamental conviction about how he conducts his presidency has not changed, and he defended Mr. Bolton's reputation for bluntness by saying, ''Sometimes people say I'm a little too blunt.''
 It would be foolish to count out anyone so determined.
 ''Among the things the president has going for him is that he's still the president,'' said former Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska.
 The president's last prime-time news conference was just over a year ago, when violence in Iraq seemed to be spiraling out of control and some nervous voices in his own party were urging him to be more aggressive in the face of the coming Democratic challenge from Senator John Kerry. His performance drew decidedly mixed reviews, but he conceded no error and gave no ground.
 And in the election seven months later, he had the last laugh.

HEADLINE: Congress Passes Budget With Cuts In Medicaid Growth and in Taxes

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28 

 BODY:
The House and Senate broke a lengthy impasse over federal spending Thursday night, narrowly adopting a $2.56 trillion federal budget for 2006 that aims to trim the growth of Medicaid by $10 billion over five years, add $106 billion in tax cuts and clear the way for oil drilling in an Alaskan wildlife refuge. 
 The back-to-back votes -- 214 to 211 in the House and 52 to 47 in the Senate -- ran mostly along party lines. As the roll was called in the Senate, shortly before midnight, Vice President Dick Cheney sat in the chamber, ready to cast his vote to break a tie, if necessary. 
 The passage came just hours after House and Senate negotiators reached a budget deal, resolving differences that revolved largely around Medicaid, the government insurance program for the poor. The budget resolution instructs lawmakers to freeze spending in most domestic programs, but not for the military and for domestic security. 
 Congress has failed to adopt a budget for two of the last three years, and Republican leaders hailed the votes as a victory. With the federal deficit at a record level, President Bush and Congressional Republicans -- prodded by fiscal conservatives in their party -- have promised to rein in government spending. Adopting a budget was a test of their ability to make good on that vow.
 At his news conference Thursday night, moments after the House passed the budget but before the Senate voted, Mr. Bush cited the resolution as an example of his ability to get things done on Capitol Hill. 
 ''There's the budget agreement,'' the president said, ''and I'm grateful for that. It shows we are making progress.''
 Earlier in the evening, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority leader, called the spending plan '' the best since the historic Balanced Budget Act of 1997.'' 
 Shortly before the House began its vote, Mr. DeLay said, ''This is the budget the American people voted for when they returned a Republican House, a Republican Senate and a Republican president to the White House last November.''
 Democrats derided the budget as misguided, saying it would slash spending on programs for the most vulnerable members of society, give lavish tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans, force veterans to spend more on health care and deepen the deficit, instead of reducing it, as Republicans contend it will. 
 The House Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, called it ''a missed opportunity'' and ''an assault on our values.'' Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the senior Democrat on the Senate Budget committee, called it ''a mistake for the country.'' 
 Although the budget resolution is nonbinding, it is important because it provides an economic blueprint that lawmakers can use to pass specific tax and spending legislation later in the year. For instance, the resolution assumes $106 billion in tax cuts over the next five years, and explicitly directs Congress to enact legislation providing for $70 billion of those cuts. The intent, its authors say, is to extend Mr. Bush's tax cuts on capital gains and dividend income.
 The budget resolution also directs lawmakers to come up with $2.4 billion in energy revenues -- a provision that Congress can use to pass legislation opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. 
 ''It's high time,'' said one leading advocate of drilling, Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican and chairman of the Senate Energy Committee.
 Senator Lisa Murkowski, the Alaska Republican who has led the fight in Congress to open the refuge, gave the thumbs-up sign and said, ''Love it!''
 But in the House, the drilling provision drew objections from some Republicans who voted against the budget because they opposed opening the Arctic refuge to oil exploration, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert said. Mr. Hastert seemed unruffled when asked about the closeness of the vote. ''But we won,'' he said.
 In the Senate, three Republicans -- Senators George V. Voinovich and Mike DeWine of Ohio, and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island -- joined with 43 Democrats and one independent to oppose the plan. Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, was absent.
 This year is the first time since 1997 that Congress has used the budget to trim the explosive growth of so-called entitlement programs, particularly Medicaid. It directs lawmakers to reduce the growth of entitlements -- including farm subsidies and a federal pensions guarantee as well as Medicaid -- by a total of $35 billion over the next five years.
 Mr. Bush originally proposed a $51 billion reduction. The architects of the Congressional budget say the $35 million is significant nonetheless.
 ''This is a major step,'' Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said of the entitlement trims.
 Mr. Gregg and his House counterpart, Representative Jim Nussle of Iowa, say the budget will fulfill Mr. Bush's goal of cutting the federal deficit in half over five years, bringing the figure down to $210 billion in 2010.
 Democrats dismiss that contention as flawed, saying the budget ignores shortfalls in Medicare, the health insurance plan for the elderly, as well as the cost of the war in Iraq.
 ''We now face record budget deficits, and we face them for as far as the eye can see,'' Senator Conrad said, pointing to charts that resembled a flood of red ink.
 Democrats also said the budget would be devastating to poor people who depend on programs like Medicaid.
 ''We're attacking the most vulnerable in our society,'' Senator Jon Corzine, Democrat of New Jersey, said. 
 Some moderate Republicans, led by Senator Gordon H. Smith of Oregon, agreed, and the resulting dispute over Medicaid threatened to derail the entire budget process. When the budget passed the Senate last month, Mr. Smith led a successful effort to eliminate any spending reductions on Medicaid and instead create a bipartisan commission to study the future of the program.
 Mr. Smith's proposal passed the Senate on a bipartisan vote. But the House budget recommended steep cuts in the growth of Medicaid, setting off a dispute between the two chambers. That prompted weeks of intense negotiations On Thursday, Mr. Smith said that he had agreed to the demands of the Republican Senate leadership for $10 billion less in Medicaid spending growth and that White House officials had agreed to create a bipartisan commission that would probably finish its work in 18 months.''

HEADLINE: BUSH CITES PLAN THAT WOULD CUT SOCIAL SECURITY

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28 

 BODY:
President Bush called Thursday night for cutting Social Security benefits for future retirees to put the system on sound financial footing, and he proposed doing so in a way that would demand the most sacrifice from higher-income people while insulating low-income workers.
 Saying the retirement program is headed for ''bankruptcy,'' a term his opponents say is an exaggeration, Mr. Bush edged tentatively -- but for the first time explicitly -- into the most politically explosive aspect of the debate over how to assure Social Security's long-term health: the benefit cuts or tax increases needed to balance the system's books as the baby boom generation ages and life expectancy increases.
 ''Social Security's provided a safety net that has provided dignity and peace of mind for millions of Americans in their retirement,'' Mr. Bush said at the beginning of a news conference at the White House. ''Yet there's a hole in the safety net because Congresses have made promises it cannot keep for a younger generation.'' [Excerpts, Page A22.] 
 He also forcefully defended his nominee for United Nations ambassador, John R. Bolton, and rejected assertions by some members of his own party that Democrats who oppose his judicial nominees are not people of faith. He pledged to do everything possible to make gasoline more affordable, and declined to put a timetable on the withdrawal of troops from Iraq. 
 Mr. Bush held the news conference on the 99th day of his second term. It represented an effort to regain control of the national dialogue at a time when Mr. Bush is struggling to push his Social Security plan ahead on Capitol Hill, his approval ratings are falling, the economy is showing signs of slowing and Democrats have become more combative..
 Conducted in the ornate East Room, it was only the fourth prime-time news conference Mr. Bush has held. In the past, he has held them at moments of high drama -- days after the bombing of Afghanistan, weeks before the Americans marched into Baghdad, during last spring's renewed violence in Iraq.
 In this case, the White House had to overcome some hurdles to make full use of the presidential megaphone. After the broadcast television networks balked at pre-empting some of their most popular entertainment programming, including ''The Apprentice'' on NBC, the White House moved the starting time to 8 p.m. from 8:30. [Page A23.] 
 As he called for a final question near the end of the hourlong session, Mr. Bush alluded to the competition for the nation's attention, saying, ''I don't want to cut into some of these TV shows that are getting ready to air -- for the sake of the economy.''
 Mr. Bush worked hard to show optimism but with things not going his way on a number of fronts, he was often on the defensive. He said it was inevitable that both parties should be resisting his call for change, whether on Social Security or on his demand that the Senate join the House in passing energy legislation.
 ''We're asking people to do things they haven't been doing for 20 years,'' Mr. Bush said. ''They haven't addressed the Social Security problem since 1983. We haven't had an energy strategy in our country for decades. And so I'm not surprised that some are balking at doing hard work.'' 
 Mr. Bush used the news conference primarily to begin the next phase of his strategy for persuading Congress to act on Social Security, providing some political cover for lawmakers by tiptoeing into the topic of the painful steps necessary to reach his goal of making the retirement program permanently solvent.
 Mr. Bush cast the policy change he embraced as slowing the growth of future benefit increases. But its effect would be to reduce retirement benefits from the levels currently promised to workers.
 The reductions would be on top of the cuts in the guaranteed benefit portion of the program that would be imposed on workers who opted to participate in Mr. Bush's proposed investment accounts; anyone choosing to divert a portion of their payroll taxes into stocks and bonds would have their government-paid benefit pared back in step with the amount going into their account.
 ''I believe a reformed system should protect those who depend on Social Security the most,'' Mr. Bush said. ''So I propose a Social Security system in the future where benefits for low-income workers will grow faster than benefits for people who are better off.''
 Mr. Bush did not provide any details during his hourlong appearance, and he stopped well short of offering a full-fledged plan to deal with Social Security problems. According to Social Security's trustees, the system has enough money to pay full benefits until 2041 by drawing on trillions of dollars owed to it by the federal government. After 2041, the system would be capable of paying about three-quarters of promised benefits.
 But the outline for benefit cuts Mr. Bush provided Thursday night was based on a well-developed plan that he and other administration officials have been speaking of approvingly for several months.
 Under the proposal, first developed by Robert C. Pozen, an investment executive, benefit cuts would be imposed gradually on future retirees. The cuts would fall most heavily on people at upper income levels. The cuts would be less, but still substantial, for middle-income workers. Low- income people would suffer no benefit cut at all. Politically, the plan has the advantage, in the White House's view, of being attractive to moderate Democrats by making the system more progressive.
 The proposal would close most of Social Security's long-term financial gap, about 70 percent, according to Social Security's actuaries. Mr. Bush said there were a ''variety of options available to solve the rest of the problem,'' but he did not name any of them. 
 He said he would work with Congress on any proposal that did not raise the payroll tax rate or harm the economy, a formulation that seemed to suggest he would resist any type of tax increase. In the past, Mr. Bush has signaled a willingness to consider raising the cap on earnings subject to the payroll tax, currently $90,000, a step that many Republicans say would harm the economy by making it more expensive for businesses to add employees.
 Mr. Bush showed no inclination to give in to Democratic demands that he drop the centerpiece of his Social Security proposal, allowing workers to divert a portion of their payroll taxes into investment accounts.
 Nearing the end of his heavily promoted 60-day Social Security tour, Mr. Bush could claim that Americans are more concerned about Social Security than they were at the beginning of the year, a development the White House says will leave Congress little choice but to act. But a steady stream of polls has shown support for his solution to be dissipating and approval ratings for his general handling of the issue falling. 
 In beginning to talk specifically about the need to cut benefits -- a topic that politicians over the years have learned can be toxic to their careers -- Mr. Bush was making good on his promise to expend political capital in pursuit of big goals. But even before delving into benefit cuts, his claims of success in beginning to move public opinion were at odds with the legislative reality in the Senate, where the Republican chairman of the finance committee, Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, is struggling to write a bill that can command enough Republican support to pass the panel, much less win bipartisan support.
 Mr. Bush dismissed a question about his sagging poll numbers, saying paying attention to public opinion surveys is ''kind of like a dog chasing your tail.''
 Mr. Bush refused to set a timeframe for drawing down American troops in Iraq, saying his hope is to withdraw ''as soon as possible,'' but that it depends on the capacity of the Iraqi military to ''fight and do the job.'' He said he had a message for the new Iraqi prime minister, Ibrahim al-Jaafari, to maintain stability in his country. ''Don't disrupt the training that has gone on,'' Mr. Bush said he told him in a phone conversation Thursday. ''Don't politicize your military, in other words.''
 Mr. Bush portrayed his relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as on fine terms, even though the two had a tense standoff about Russian rollbacks on democracy in a meeting in Slovakia in February. The president said that he had received assurances from Moscow that Russia would not do anything to allow Syria or Iran to acquire nuclear weapons, and that Mr. Putin ''understands the dangers'' of an Iran with nuclear weapons.
 President Bush renewed his demand for the Senate to vote on his nominations for appellate court judges, implicitly supporting efforts by Senate Republicans to end the ability of Democrats to block a vote by filibustering. But the president distanced himself from the Senator Bill Frist, the Republican majority leader, who joined a religious broadcast last week to denounce the Democratic filibuster as an attack on ''people of faith.''
 ''I don't agree with it,'' Mr. Bush said of those who criticized the Democratic efforts on religious grounds. ''I think people are opposing my judicial nominees because they don't like the judicial philosophy of the people I've nominated.'' Asked what he could do to bring down record high gasoline prices, Mr. Bush said he would continue to press oil-producing nations to produce more crude oil, saying that expanded foreign oil production is ''the best way to affect the current price of gasoline.'' 
 Mr. Bush forcefully defended Mr. Bolton, his embattled nominee as United States ambassador to the United Nations, as ''a blunt guy'' who would shake up and reform an institution that Mr. Bush said was in dire need of an overhaul. Mr. Bolton's nomination has come under heavy fire from Democrats, and raised doubts among some Republicans, because of reports that he harassed and tried to suppress officials who disagreed with him about evidence of weapons of mass destruction.
 Mr. Bush vigorously defended the education law he pushed through Congress early in his first term that requires local school districts to meet standards for students' performance in order to receive federal financing.
 The program has provoked criticism in many states, including Republican bastions like Utah, where education officials say they are required to provide additional services without getting enough money to cover the additional costs.
 ''I know some people are trying to unwind No Child Left Behind, and I know some states don't like it,'' Mr. Bush said. ''But I'll tell you something. If you're teaching children to read and write, you ought to measure it.''

HEADLINE: 'What, Me Worry?'

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
One of America's most important entrepreneurs recently gave a remarkable speech at a summit meeting of our nation's governors. Bill Gates minced no words. ''American high schools are obsolete,'' he told the governors. ''By obsolete, I don't just mean that our high schools are broken, flawed and underfunded. By obsolete, I mean that our high schools -- even when they are working exactly as designed -- cannot teach our kids what they need to know today. 
 ''Training the work force of tomorrow with the high schools of today is like trying to teach kids about today's computers on a 50-year-old mainframe. Our high schools were designed 50 years ago to meet the needs of another age. Until we design them to meet the needs of the 21st century, we will keep limiting -- even ruining -- the lives of millions of Americans every year.'' 
 Let me translate Mr. Gates's words: ''If we don't fix American education, I will not be able to hire your kids.'' I consider that, well, kind of important. Alas, the media squeezed a few mentions of it between breaks in the Michael Jackson trial. But neither Tom DeLay nor Bill Frist called a late-night session of Congress -- or even a daytime one -- to discuss what Mr. Gates was saying. They were too busy pandering to those Americans who don't even believe in evolution. 
 And the president stayed fixated on privatizing Social Security. It's no wonder that the second Bush term is shaping up as ''The Great Waste of Time.''
 On foreign policy, President Bush has offered a big idea: the expansion of freedom, particularly in the Arab-Muslim world, where its absence was one of the forces propelling 9/11. That is a big, bold and compelling idea -- worthy of a presidency and America's long-term interests. 
 But on the home front, this team has no big idea -- certainly none that relates to the biggest challenge and opportunity facing us today: the flattening of the global economic playing field in a way that is allowing more people from more places to compete and collaborate with your kids and mine than ever before. 
 ''For the first time in our history, we are going to face competition from low-wage, high-human-capital communities, embedded within India, China and Asia,'' President Lawrence Summers of Harvard told me. In order to thrive, ''it will not be enough for us to just leave no child behind. We also have to make sure that many more young Americans can get as far ahead as their potential will take them. How we meet this challenge is what will define our nation's political economy for the next several decades.''
 Indeed, we can't rely on importing the talent we need anymore -- not in a flat world where people can now innovate without having to emigrate. In Silicon Valley today, ''B to B'' and ''B to C'' stand for ''back to Bangalore'' and ''back to China,'' which is where a lot of our foreign talent is moving. 
 Meeting this challenge requires a set of big ideas. If you want to grasp some of what is required, check out a smart new book by the strategists John Hagel III and John Seely Brown entitled ''The Only Sustainable Edge.'' They argue that comparative advantage today is moving faster than ever from structural factors, like natural resources, to how quickly a country builds its distinctive talents for innovation and entrepreneurship -- the only sustainable edge.
 Economics is not like war. It can always be win-win. ''But some win more than others,'' Mr. Hagel said, and today it will be those countries that are best and fastest at building, attracting and holding talent. 
 There is a real sense of urgency in India and China about ''catching up'' in talent-building. America, by contrast, has become rather complacent. ''People go to Shanghai or Bangalore and they look around and say, 'They're still way behind us,''' Mr. Hagel said. ''But it's not just about current capabilities. It's about the relative pace and trajectories of capability-building. 
 ''You have to look at where Shanghai was just three years ago, see where it is today and then extrapolate forward. Compare the pace and trajectory of talent-building within their population and businesses and the pace and trajectory here.'' 
 India and China know they can't just depend on low wages, so they are racing us to the top, not the bottom. Producing a comprehensive U.S. response -- encompassing immigration, intellectual property law and educational policy -- to focus on developing our talent in a flat world is a big idea worthy of a presidency. But it would also require Mr. Bush to do something he has never done: ask Americans to do something hard.

U.S. Economy Slowed Sharply in the First Quarter
The economy braked sharply in the first three months of the year, the government reported. The news sent stocks tumbling as it appeared likely that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates on inflation concerns.
 Activity slowed across most of the economy, including consumer spending and government consumption, but the sharpest retreat was in corporate investment. Final demand -- real purchases by companies, governments and individuals -- expanded just 1.9 percent. The rest of the expansion was a result of an $80 billion surge in the accumulation of inventories, from cars parked in dealer lots to clothing piling up on retailer shelves. BUSINESS DAY, PAGE C1

New Death Penalty Bid
Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts introduced a bill that would reinstate capital punishment in his state by creating a death penalty he called virtually foolproof. The bill includes provisions that have never been tried, including one to impose a death penalty only if a jury has ''no doubt'' of a defendant's guilt, a standard stricter than ''beyond a reasonable doubt.''

The ivory-billed woodpecker, whose 30-inch wingspan and stunning plumage once moved people to call it the Lord God bird (because that's what they said when they saw it), had long been given up for extinct. The last confirmed sighting was in 1944; the woodpecker's habitat, in the swampy tupelo and cypress forests of the Southeast, has been logged nearly out of existence. But in an announcement that electrified the birdwatching world, scientists reported that an ivory bill had been spotted at least seven times in the last 15 months in the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge in central Arkansas. Now federal efforts are under way to protect the bird. James Gorman reports from the refuge. PAGE A18

HEADLINE: Europe Isn't Working, but Investors Are Not as Worried as Politicians

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
CHICKEN LITTLE would feel at home listening to the political class in Europe as the French prepare to vote on the proposed European constitution.
 A no vote on May 29 would create a ''political cataclysm,'' said Jacques Delors, a former president of the European Commission. Romano Prodi, the commission's president when the constitution was written, made Mr. Delors sound sanguine, saying, ''The problem won't be just a catastrophe for France, but the fall of Europe.'' 
 But while the politicians fret, the financial markets go on about their business. Since March 18, when the first poll indicated a defeat was likely, European stock markets have done a little worse than those in the United States, but better than the Japanese market. The euro has lost a little ground, but remains high. In 2005, European shareholders have lost less than American or Japanese investors.
 Some point to widening interest rate spreads between Germany and Greece as a sign of growing alarm, but you need a magnifying glass to find the evidence. Germany, still viewed as the safest euro credit despite budget problems and chronic high unemployment, now has 10-year bonds yielding 26 basis points, or about a quarter of a percentage point, less than Greek bonds. That spread is up six basis points since the French poll results. If investors thought Mr. Prodi was right, the gap would be far larger.
 The reality is that Europe isn't working, at least not the way it was supposed to when politicians were campaigning for ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, which led to the adoption of the euro in much of the Continent. Some thought the euro would force economic reform, but the pace of change has been slow at best. 
 Instead, there are signs that the inability to adjust exchange rates within the euro zone is making some areas, notably Italy, less competitive relative to Germany, which itself is facing economic stagnation. The news within many a European country is of various groups and unions fighting to preserve and expand their benefits, with no regard for the country's overall competitive position, let alone that of the Continent. 
 In Greece, the newspaper Kathimerini counted eight demonstrations and job actions announced in advance last week. Shop employees were upset over planned changes in working hours. Music teachers wanted better working conditions. Judges and prosecutors staged a work stoppage to protest transfers of court officials. Accountants marched to demand bonuses for preparing balance sheets.
 During the same week, Greece's Parliament ratified the European constitution without consulting the voters.
 It is not that French voters are really upset about what is in the proposed constitution. It would establish a method for making decisions in the European Union that would please Rube Goldberg, even though it is said to simplify the process. Its defeat would leave things as they are, with a possible paralysis of decision making in Brussels. That prospect may alarm politicians more than voters.
 Instead, Western European voters seem united in opposition to whatever party is in office and in fear of new competition, whether it is from Chinese textiles or from workers from the Eastern European countries that joined the European Union a year ago. Jacques Chirac, the French president, does not appear to have won over undecided voters with his claim that the constitution would protect French workers from low-wage competition.
 The dream of the European Union was to make Europe a strong world player, able to compete with Japan and the United States, with its national governments not needing to do much to promote the process. Europe may do better if that dream is downsized, leaving each country with the responsibility to put its own house in order.

HEADLINE: Bush's Plan: Investing Part of the Nest Egg and Slowing the Growth of Benefits

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM and ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28 

 BODY:
The Social Security proposal President Bush seemed to embrace Thursday night to make the system solvent would have the effect of significantly limiting the rise in retirement benefits for most workers, analyses show.
 Under the existing law, monthly payments for all workers rise as average national wages rise. Mr. Bush apparently wants to tie the benefits of most workers to inflation in prices rather than increases in wages.
 He pledged that benefits in the future for most retirees would be comparable to what they are today. He seemed to be saying they would be the same in terms of what the money would buy. 
 But Mr. Bush promised to make the benefits of low-wage workers better than they are now -- evidently an attempt to attract Democrats to the table. 
 Democrats, though, were focused on Mr. Bush's insistence that individual investment accounts, the most controversial aspect of his proposal, had to be part of any Social Security legislation. The Democrats, who seem to have the votes in the Senate to block the Bush plan, also asserted that for all Mr. Bush's talk of ''progressivity,'' his proposal would really amount to major benefit cuts for middle-income retirees.
 ''Privatization and deep cuts is even worse than privatization,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, reacting to the speech.
 A fact sheet issued by the White House said the approach on Social Security benefits was based on a plan called ''progressive indexing'' developed by Robert C. Pozen, an investment company executive from Boston. It would allow the initial retirement benefits of the poorest workers to be calculated as they are now, on the basis of how national wages rose during their working years.
 But the retirement benefits of other workers would be calculated on the basis of price inflation, rather than rising wages. 
 Over time, wages tend to rise considerably faster than prices, so the benefits for young people today of modest means would be much lower than under the current law.
 Progressive indexing under Mr. Pozen's plan would solve about 70 percent of the Social Security solvency problem over the next 75 years.
 Mr. Bush did not mention Mr. Pozen by name or specifically endorse his plan, but he has spoken favorably of it in the past.
 The Pozen plan has clear political risks. Calculations by the actuary of the Social Security Administration show, for instance, that those who are now 17 years old and earn average wages all their working lives would receive Social Security benefits 20 percent lower than what they could expect under current law when they retire at 67 in 2055. The average annual wage this year is about $36,000.
 People who earn somewhat more than that in their working years -- the equivalent of $59,000 this year -- would see a 30 percent reduction. And people who earn the equivalent of $90,000 and more would have a reduction of almost 40 percent when they retire in 2055.
 On the other hand, workers with the lowest wages -- those who earn about $25,000 or less -- would not face a benefit cut.
 The calculations were made in February by Stephen C. Goss, the nonpartisan chief Social Security actuary.
 Only people with the lowest wages would be distinctly better off under the president's plan than they would be if Social Security reserves were allowed to run out, as is projected happen in about 2040 or 2050. When there are no reserves left, enough money from Social Security taxes will be raised each year to pay about 70 percent to 80 percent of scheduled benefits.
 Mr. Bush argues that people will still be much better off because the increased returns from the private retirement accounts he would create would more than offset the guaranteed benefit cuts.
 Even though it was sketchy in detail, the proposal Mr. Bush presented Thursday night was the most he had ever said about the steps needed to put Social Security on sound financial footing.
 In his 60-day cross-country campaign to win support for his Social Security proposals, the president has concentrated on the prospect that the retirement system will run out of reserves as the baby boom generation retires, and he has stressed his view that workers should be allowed to divert part of their Social Security taxes into individual investment accounts.
 The president has conceded that investment accounts would do nothing to improve the system's financing, but maintained again, Thursday night, that those accounts were key to his vision of an ''ownership society.'' 
 In testimony before the Senate Finance Committee this week, Mr. Pozen chided the president for putting private accounts ahead of making the system solvent.
 Mr. Bush and Congress, Mr. Pozen said, should ''come to grips with the growth in benefits,'' and only then ''figure out what sort of personal accounts would be complementary.''

HEADLINE: 'Social Security Worked Fine During the Last Century. But the Math Has Changed.'

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's news conference last night, as recorded by The New York Times. A full transcript is at nytimes.com/politics.

Opening Statement
 Tonight I will discuss two vital priorities for the American people. And then I'd be glad to answer some of your questions. 
 Millions of American families and small businesses are hurting because of higher gasoline prices. My administration is doing everything we can to make gasoline more affordable. 
 In the near term, we will continue to encourage oil-producing nations to maximize their production. Here at home, we'll protect consumers. There'll be no price gouging at gas pumps in America. We must address the root causes that are driving up gas prices. 
 Over the past decade America's energy consumption has been growing about 40 times faster than our energy production. That means we're relying more on energy produced abroad. To reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy, we must take four key steps. 
 First, we must better use technology to become better conservers of energy. 
 And secondly, we must find innovative and environmentally sensitive ways to make the most of our existing energy resources including oil, natural gas, coal and safe clean nuclear power. 
 Third, we must develop promising new sources of energy such as hydrogen, ethanol or biodiesel. 
 Fourth, we must help growing energy consumers overseas like China and India apply new technologies to use energy more efficiently and reduce global demand of fossil fuels.
 I applaud the House for passing a good energy bill. Now the Senate needs to act on this urgent priority. American consumers have waited long enough. To help reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy, Congress needs to get an energy bill to my desk by this summer so I can sign it into law. 
 Congress also needs to address the challenges facing Social Security. I've traveled the country to talk with the American people. They understand that Social Security is headed for serious financial trouble and they expect their leaders in Washington to address the problem. 
 Social Security worked fine during the last century. But the math has changed. A generation of baby boomers is getting ready to retire. I happen to be one of them. 
 Today there are about 40 million retirees receiving benefits. By the time all the baby boomers have retired, there will be more than 72 million retirees drawing Social Security benefits. 
 Baby boomers will be living longer and collecting benefits over longer retirements than previous generations. And Congress has ensured that their benefits will rise faster than the rate of inflation. 
 In other words, there's a lot of us getting ready to retire who will be living longer and receiving greater benefits than the previous generation. And to compound the problem, there are fewer people paying into the system. In 1950 there were 16 workers for every beneficiary. Today there are 3.3 workers for every beneficiary. Soon there'll be 2 workers for every beneficiary. 
 These changes have put Social Security on the path to bankruptcy. When the baby boomers start retiring in three years, Social Security will start heading toward the red. In 2017, the system will start paying out more in benefits than it collects in payroll taxes. Every year after that shortfall will get worse and by 2041 Social Security will be bankrupt. 
 Franklin Roosevelt did a wonderful thing when he created Social Security. The system has meant a lot for a lot of people. Social Security has provided a safety net that has provided dignity and peace of mind for millions of Americans in their retirement. 
 Yet there's a hole in the safety net because Congresses have made promises it cannot keep for a younger generation. As we fix Social Security, some things won't change. Seniors and people with disabilities will get their checks. All Americans born before 1950 will receive the full benefits. 
 Our duty to save Social Security begins with making the system permanently solvent. But our duty does not end there. 
 We also have a responsibility to improve Social Security by directing extra help to those most in need and by making it a better deal for younger workers. 
 And now as Congress begins work on legislation, we must be guided by three goals. 
 First, millions of Americans depend on Social Security checks as a primary source of retirement income, so we must keep this promise to future retirees as well. As a matter of fairness I propose that future generations receive benefits equal to or greater than the benefits today's seniors get. 
 Secondly, I believe a reformed system should protect those who depend on Social Security the most. So I propose a Social Security system in the future where benefits for low-income workers will grow faster than benefits for people who are better off. 
 By providing more generous benefits for low-income retirees, we'll make this commitment: If you work hard and pay into Social Security your entire life, you will not retire into poverty. 
 This reform would solve most of the funding challenges facing Social Security. A variety of options are available to solve the rest of the problem, and I will work with Congress on any good-faith proposal that does not raise the payroll tax rate or harm our economy. I know we can find a solution to the financial problems of Social Security that is sensible, permanent and fair.
 Third, any reform of Social Security must replace the empty promises being made to younger workers with real assets, real money. 
 I believe the best way to achieve this goal is to give younger workers the option -- the opportunity if they so choose -- of putting a portion of their payroll taxes into a voluntary personal retirement account. Because this money is saved and invested, younger workers would have the opportunity to receive a higher rate of return on their money than the current Social Security system can provide. 
 The money from a voluntary personal retirement account would supplement the check one receives from Social Security. 
 In a reformed Social Security system voluntary personal retirement accounts would offer workers a number of investment options that are simple and easy to understand. I know some Americans have reservations about investing in the stock market. So I propose that one investment option consist entirely of Treasury bonds, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. 
 Options like this will make voluntary personal retirement accounts a safer investment that will allow an American to build a nest egg that he or she can pass on to whomever he or she chooses. Americans who would choose not to save in a personal account would still be able to count on a Social Security check equal to or higher than the benefits of today's seniors. 
 In the coming days and weeks, I will work with both the House and the Senate as they take the next steps in the legislative process. I'm willing to listen to any good idea from either party. Too often, the temptation in Washington is to look at a major issue only in terms of whether it gives one political party an advantage over the other. Social Security is too important for politics as usual. 
 We have a shared responsibility to fix Social Security and make the system better. To keep seniors out of poverty and expand ownership for people of every background. And when we do, Republicans and Democrats will be able to stand together and take credit for doing what is right for our children and our grandchildren.

Social Security

Question. Mr. President, a majority of Americans disapprove of your handling of Social Security, rising gas prices and the economy. Are you frustrated by that and by the fact that you're having trouble getting traction on your agenda in a Republican-controlled Congress?

PRESIDENT BUSH. Look, we're asking people to do things that haven't been done for 20 years. We haven't addressed the Social Security problem since 1983. We haven't had an energy strategy in our country for decades. And so I'm not surprised that some are balking at doing hard work. But I have a duty as the president to define problems facing our nation and to call upon people to act. And we're just really getting started in the process.
 You asked about Social Security. For the past 60 days, I've traveled our country making it clear to people we have a problem. That's the first step of any legislative process is to explain to people the nature of the problem. And the American people understand we have a problem. I've also spent time assuring seniors they'll get their check. That's a very important part of making sure we end up with Social Security reform.

Iraq

Q. Your top military officer, Gen. Richard Myers, says the Iraqi insurgency is as strong now as it was a year ago. Why is that the case? And why haven't you been more successful in limiting the violence?

A. I think he went on to say we're winning, if I recall. But nevertheless, there are still some in Iraq who aren't happy with democracy. They, they want to go back to the old days of tyranny and darkness, torture chambers and mass graves. I believe we're making really good progress in Iraq, because the Iraqi people are beginning to see the benefits of a free society.
 They saw a government formed today. The Iraqi military is being trained by our military. And they're performing much better than the past. 
 The more secure Iraq becomes as a result of the hard work of Iraqi security forces, the more confident the people will have in the process. And the more isolated the terrorists will become. 
 But Iraq has got people there that are willing to kill. And they're hard-nosed killers. And we will work with the Iraqis to secure their future. A free Iraq in the midst of the Middle East is an important part of spreading peace. It's a region of the world where a lot of folks in the past never thought democracy could take hold. Democracy is taking hold. And as democracy takes hold, peace will more likely be the norm. 
 In order to defeat the terrorists, in order to defeat their ideology of hate, in the long run we must spread freedom and hope. Today, I talked to the prime minister of Iraq, had a great conversation with him. I told him I was proud of the fact that he was willing to stand up and lead.

Judicial Filibusters

Q. Mr. President, recently the head of the Family Research Council said that judicial filibusters are an attack against people of faith. And I wonder whether you believe that in fact that is what is nominating Democrats who oppose your judicial choices? And I wonder what you think generally about the role that faith is playing, how it's being used in our political debates right now.

A. Yeah, I think people are opposing my nominees because they don't like the judicial philosophy of the people I've nominated. Some would like to see judges legislate from the bench. That's not my view of the proper role of a judge. Speaking about judges, I certainly hope my nominees get an up-or-down vote on the floor of the Senate.
 They deserve an up-or-down vote. I think for the sake of fairness, these good people I've nominated should get a vote. And I'm hoping that will be the case as time goes on. 
 The role of religion in our society? I view religion as a personal matter. I think a person ought to be judged on how he or she lives his life or lives her life. And that's how I've tried to live my life, through example. Faith plays an important part of my life individually. But I don't ascribe a person's opposing my nominations to an issue of faith. 

Q. Do you think that's an inappropriate statement? And what I asked is -- --

A. I just don't agree with it.

Q. You don't agree with it.

A. No. I think people oppose my nominees because, because of judicial philosophy.

Q. Sir, I asked you about what you think of the ways faith is being used in our political debates, not just in society in general.

A. I know. Well, I can only speak to myself. And I am mindful that people in political office should not say to somebody you're not equally American if you don't happen to agree with my view of religion. As I said, I think faith is a personal issue. And I get great strength from my faith. But I don't condemn somebody in the political process because they may not agree with me on religion.

Energy Policy

Q. Several times, we've asked you or your aides what you could do about the high price of gasoline, and very often the answer has come back Congress needs to pass the energy bill. Can you explain for us how, if it were passed soon after it were introduced, the energy bill would have an effect on the current record price of oil that we're seeing out there?

A. Yeah. Actually, I said in my opening statement that the best way to affect the current price of gasoline is to encourage producing nations to put more crude oil on the market. That's the most effective way, Because the price of crude oil determines in large measure the price of gasoline. The feedstock for gasoline is crude oil, and when crude oil goes up, the price of gasoline goes up.
 There are other factors, by the way, that cause the price of gasoline to go up. But the main factor is the price of crude oil. And if we can get the nations that have got some excess capacity to put crude on the market, the increased supply, hopefully, will meet increased demand and therefore take the pressure off price. But listen, the energy bill is certainly no quick fix. 
 You can't wave a magic wand. I wish I could. It's like that soldier at Fort Hood that said, ''How come you're not lowering the price of gasoline?'' I was having lunch with the fellow, and he said, ''Go lower the price of gasoline, President.'' I said I wish I could. It just doesn't work that way. 
 This is a problem that's been a long time in coming. We haven't had an energy policy in this country. And it's going to take us a while to become less dependent on foreign sources of energy. 
 What I've laid out for the Congress to consider is a comprehensive energy strategy that recognizes we need to be better conservers of energy, that recognizes that we can find more energy at home in environmentally friendly ways. 
 You know, obviously a contentious issue in front of the Congress is the issue over the ANWR, which is a part of Alaska. ANWR [Arctic National Wildlife Refuge] is 19 million acres of land. Technology now enables us to use just 2,000 of that 19 million to be able to explore for oil and gas, so we can have oil and gas produced here.

U.N. Nomination

Q. Have you asked your ambassador to the U.N., Ambassador John Bolton about allegations that he acted improperly to subordinates? Do you feel that these allegations warrant your personal intervention? And if they're true, do you feel that they should disqualify him from holding the post, sir?

A. Well, John Bolton has been asked questions about, about how he handles his business by members of the United States Senate. He's been asked a lot of questions. And he's given very good answers.
 John Bolton is a seasoned diplomat. He's been serving our country for I think 20 years. He has been confirmed by the United States Senate four times. 
 John Bolton is a blunt guy. Sometimes people say I'm a little too blunt. John Bolton can get the job done at the United Nations. Seem like to me it made sense to put somebody who's capable, smart, served our country for 20 years, been confirmed by the United States Senate four times. And who isn't afraid to speak his mind in the post of the ambassador to the U.N.
 See, the U.N. needs reform. If you're interested in reforming the U.N. like I'm interested in reforming the U.N., it makes sense to put somebody who's skilled and who's not afraid to speak his mind at the United Nations. 
 Now I asked John during the interview process in the Oval Office, I said: ''Before I send you up there to the Senate, let me ask you something. Do you think the United Nations is important?'' See, I didn't want to send somebody up there who said: ''Well, that's not worth a darn. I don't think I need to go.'' He said: ''No, it's important. But it needs to be reformed.''

HEADLINE: New York Begins Inquiry Into Possible Mortgage Bias

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
A new preliminary inquiry by Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, is seeking credit data and other information from mortgage lenders that should offer regulators a clearer picture of whether discrimination is responsible for the higher interest rates that minority borrowers often pay. 
 The civil rights division of the attorney general's office has requested mortgage data, measures of creditworthiness and other risk-based pricing information in letters to eight lenders with substantial operations in New York, according to a person briefed on the inquiry. Citigroup, HSBC, Washington Mutual and Wells Fargo acknowledged the request yesterday and said in separate statements that they were cooperating. 
 The data is essential in determining whether minority borrowers pay higher interest rates than white borrowers with similar credit histories and loan amounts. 
 State regulators ''are just trying to determine if they are being applied equally across the board,'' this person said. Though the inquiry is in its early stages, this person added, the information they are seeking ''is very comprehensive.'' 
 For years, financial institutions have fiercely guarded this creditworthiness data, known as credit scores, citing cost and privacy concerns; historically, they have only made it available to federal banking regulators upon request. As a result, it has been difficult for anyone else to determine why minority borrowers are more likely than white ones to borrow at substantially higher interest rates. 
 But if Mr. Spitzer is able to obtain that information, he will be able to combine it with the data on loans to people with poor credit that financial institutions are required to provide under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. That should allow him to make a better, though by no means perfect, assessment of whether lending practices are discriminatory.
 Nonetheless, at least four lenders have only acknowledged that they have been contacted, and none of them said that they furnished the credit scores and other pricing information that the letters from state regulators are said to request. 
 ''We have received a letter from the New York State attorney general's office and are complying,'' said Tom Nicholson, an HSBC spokesman. ''This is really nothing more than a request for our H.M.D.A. data.'' Citigroup said it ''briefed the attorney general's office on our data last month as a courtesy, and we are working with the staff to provide follow-up information.'' 
 Washington Mutual and Wells Fargo also confirmed that they had received letters from the attorney general's office. Countrywide and J.P. Morgan Chase, two large lenders in the so-called subprime market, declined to comment about communications with regulators but said their corporate policies were to cooperate. 
 The attorney general's office began the preliminary inquiry at the end of last month after reviewing national subprime mortgage data and requested information specific to New York State, according to the person briefed on the inquiry. But only in the last two weeks have state regulators received responses to the requests. The investigation is continuing and could involve other banks, this person added, and the establishment of a code of ''best practices'' could be part of any resolution. The inquiry was reported yesterday in The Wall Street Journal. 
 While Mr. Spitzer has led highly publicized investigations into the investment banking, mutual fund and insurance industries, the inquiry into abusive lending comes after a $1.65 million settlement with the Delta Financial Corporation of Woodbury, N.Y., a home equity company once described as the symbol of predatory loans. It also comes as Citigroup agreed last year to pay $70 million to the Federal Reserve Board to resolve abusive loan allegations in its consumer lending businesses. 
 But Mr. Spitzer's inquiry may put him in competition with national regulators. Oversight of the mortgage industry has typically fallen under four separate federal agencies, which have seen their role as preventing systemic collapse rather than protecting consumers. 
 And in January 2004, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in the Treasury Department issued new regulations that effectively give only the federal government the authority to regulate national banks.
 ''Attorney General Spitzer has been very active in opposing this new initiative,'' said Jon Sheldon, a staff lawyer for the National Consumer Law Center, a nonprofit organization that represents the interests of low-income consumers. ''That's the main problem he'll be facing.''
 Mr. Spitzer could also find it difficult to determine racial bias. Each lender, for example, uses slightly different criteria to predict a consumer's default risk. ''The mere fact that African-Americans are more likely to have subprime loans isn't necessarily troubling, and studies have shown that subprime lending has real value,'' said Mark A. Cohen, an economist at Vanderbilt University who analyzed car loan data in lawsuits against major automobile lenders for signs of abuse. ''The question is whether they are getting written subprime loans when they could actually qualify for prime rates.''
 Meanwhile, lending industry groups called the inquiry premature. ''It's way ahead of the game,'' said Doug Duncan, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association. ''If the issue is discrimination, it has been well known for over a decade that you can't determine discrimination because it doesn't have the credit score information you need.'' 
 And if Mr. Spitzer has credit score information, Mr. Duncan added, ''even that wouldn't be enough.''

PERSON: David T. Bazelon

HEADLINE: David Bazelon, 82, Writer, Teacher, Social Critic

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
David T. Bazelon, a writer, social critic and teacher of political science, died on Monday in Madison, Wis. A former resident of Buffalo and Manhattan, he was 82 and had lived at a retirement residence in Madison since 1998.
 His son, Coleman D. Bazelon of Glenelg, Md., announced the death. 
 Mr. Bazelon (pronounced BAZZ-lahn) was a corporate lawyer practicing in Manhattan before he made the switch to writing and teaching. At his retirement in 1985 he was a professor of policy sciences and English at the State University of New York at Buffalo. 
 His books include ''The Paper Economy'' (Random House, 1963), ''Power in America: The Politics of the New Class'' (American Library, 1967), and ''Nothing But a Fine Tooth Comb: Essays in Social Criticism'' (Simon & Schuster, 1970). He was a writer and consultant for the movie ''Point of Order!'' (1964), a documentary drawn from the television coverage of the Senate's Army-McCarthy hearings of 1954.
 David Thomas Bazelon was born in Shreveport, La., on March 2, 1923. He studied at the University of Virginia, the University of Illinois and the University of Chicago before graduating from Columbia University in 1949. After receiving a degree from Yale Law School in 1953 he practiced corporate law at two large Manhattan firms until he quit in 1958.
 As a freelancer, starting in the 1940's, he wrote hundreds of articles, reviews and essays for national periodicals like Partisan Review, Dissent, Commentary, The Reporter and The New York Review of Books. In the 1960's he was a visiting fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, a visiting professor at the Rutgers University School of Law and a Guggenheim scholar. He joined the SUNY Buffalo faculty in 1969.
 His papers, including correspondence with his uncle, the late David L. Bazelon, a federal appeals judge who encouraged him in his professional undertakings, are in the Special Collections of the University of Maryland Library. 
 In addition to his son, Mr. Bazelon is survived by his companion of 21 years, Luella Allen of Madison, and two grandsons.

HEADLINE: Buffalo Mayor Won't Seek A Fourth Term in the Fall

BYLINE: By DAVID STABA

DATELINE: BUFFALO, April 29 

 BODY:
For only the third time in nearly three decades, New York's largest upstate city will get a new chief executive.
 Mayor Anthony M. Masiello of Buffalo, who took office in 1994 after the 16-year reign of James D. Griffin, announced today that he would not seek a fourth four-year term in the fall.
 ''I've come to the conclusion that it's time for me to turn the page,'' said Mr. Masiello, who faced sagging poll numbers and a steadily growing field of challengers. ''The people of this wonderful city need a new face. They need new energy, they need a new leader.'' 
 Four candidates have already announced their desire to succeed Mr. Masiello: State Senator Byron W. Brown; Kevin Gaughan, a proponent of regionalism who announced his candidacy on Wednesday; Judith Einach, a neighborhood advocate; and Louis P. Corrigan, secretary of the Independence Party of Erie County, which includes Buffalo. They are expected to be joined by several other current and former officeholders. 
 After announcing his decision not to run, Mr. Masiello unveiled a 2005-06 budget that calls for $13 million in spending cuts and, thanks in part to an increase of $13 million in state aid, a 3 percent decrease in property tax rates -- the city's first tax cut since 1997.
 Mr. Masiello said there was no question in his mind ''that we're better off today than we were 12 years ago.''
 ''Our government is more accountable, more open, more responsible and more responsive,'' he said.
 During Mr. Masiello's mayoralty, Buffalo's population decreased steadily, as did the region's industrial base. Growing deficits led the state to impose a financial oversight board in 2003, which limited the mayor's control over spending.
 While critics pointed to the board as an indictment of Mr. Masiello's leadership, he publicly welcomed its inception, as well as the increased borrowing ability that came with it.
 ''The control board has helped us when necessary, and we appreciate their efforts,'' he said on Friday.
 The city's development record under Mr. Masiello has been mixed. One major effort -- a plan to build an office and retail complex anchored by Adelphia Communications on the city's waterfront -- collapsed when Adelphia officials, including the company's founder, John Rigas, and his sons were indicted on conspiracy and fraud charges in 2002.
 Some government financing set aside for the Adelphia project was diverted into a bid to land a Bass Pro Shops outlet in the city. Last November, the outdoor-goods retailer announced plans for a complex to include a 250,000-square-foot store, a hotel, museum and restaurant in Memorial Auditorium, a cavernous downtown sports arena that had been vacant since 1996.
 While winning handily in each of his three mayoral bids, Mr. Masiello, a former Buffalo councilman and state senator, proved something of a political chameleon, running on the Democratic line in 1993 and with the endorsement of both major parties in 1997. He broke with local Democratic Party leaders after his endorsement of Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, in 1998 and again in 2002. In between, he was elected to a third term in 2001, while running on both major party lines.
 Mr. Masiello's relationship with the Erie County executive, Joel A. Giambra, another Democrat-turned-Republican, was more contentious. As Buffalo's deficits dwindled -- Mr. Masiello's proposed budget for 2005-06 requires no borrowing to cover anticipated shortfalls -- the county endured a budget meltdown in February, after legislators refused Mr. Giambra's request for a sales-tax increase. The resulting cuts to close a $129 million gap led to the elimination of about 1,500 jobs, the closing of county parks and the loss of other services.
 Mr. Masiello, who turned 58 on Thursday, said that he was not certain about what he would do after leaving office, but that he had no plans to retire. 
 ''I've got two little girls I've got to support,'' he told a Buffalo television station. ''I don't golf very well and I don't lay on the beach very well.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Consumers Lift Spending; Confidence Off

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Americans earned and spent more than expected in March, overcoming concerns about rising gasoline costs that eroded their confidence, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. 
 The 0.6 percent increase in consumer spending came after a 0.7 percent gain in February that was larger than previously estimated. 
 Incomes rose 0.5 percent in March, the most in three months. Both figures exceeded the median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg News survey.
 Consumer confidence fell in April, the fourth consecutive drop, as rising energy prices contributed to inflation and a slowdown in the economy, a University of Michigan report showed yesterday.
 Economists said the reports underscored a discrepancy between what Americans do in stores and say on surveys, and suggested shoppers would keep supporting growth.
 ''Consumers are continuing to spend their dollars and behave as if their confidence were high,'' said Michael Englund, chief economist at Action Economics in Boulder, Colo., who correctly forecast the gain in spending. ''Low interest rates and an incredible accumulation of wealth from home price gains are leaving them in a position to spend their incomes.''
 The University of Michigan's final sentiment index for April dropped to 87.7, the lowest since September 2003, from 92.6 in March. A preliminary reading on April 15 was 88.7.
 An index of Chicago-area business declined less than forecast in April after surging to the highest level in more than 16 years in March, a survey of executives in the manufacturing region found.
 The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago said its business barometer declined this month to 65.6 from 69.2 in March, the highest since July 1988. Readings above 50 indicate expansion.

HEADLINE: 2 Aides Quit Ferrer's Team, Citing Strategy

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL and JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
Two senior officials abruptly quit the mayoral campaign of Fernando Ferrer yesterday over ''strategic differences,'' a spokeswoman said, a sign that recent problems consuming his candidacy are causing serious discord among his close advisers.
 In a terse statement issued late in the afternoon, the campaign said that David Axelrod, a senior media adviser, and Chad Clanton, the director of communications, would leave the campaign ''effective immediately due to strategic differences.''
 The resignations come as Mr. Ferrer, a Democrat, has struggled to regain his footing since remarking last month before a police union gathering that the 1999 police shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, was not a crime. And this week, a poll showed Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg leading him for the first time and another Democrat, C. Virginia Fields, closing in on him. 
 Campaign officials would not elaborate on the departures of the two men, who have had prominent roles in national political campaigns. 
 A statement by Jen Bluestein, a spokeswoman for the Ferrer campaign, said, ''David Axelrod, with his long association with Fernando Ferrer, and Chad Clanton, communications consultant, share Fernando Ferrer's values and vision for New York City, and we wish them luck.''
 Both Mr. Clanton and Mr. Axelrod told associates that they quit of their own volition, apparently after growing frustration that their advice was being ignored. 
 Some inside the campaign offered a different interpretation, saying the changes resulted from Mr. Ferrer's frustration with the course of the campaign and his belief that he can more successfully convey his vision to voters.
 But Democrats both inside and outside of the campaign declined to comment on speculation that the main ''strategic difference'' had been over whether Mr. Ferrer should have apologized for his remarks about Mr. Diallo. They also cautioned against focusing too much on the Diallo controversy, saying the resignations came after a number of instances of differences over strategic advice.
 Particularly in the case of Mr. Axelrod, a consultant who had worked on Mr. Ferrer's 2001 mayoral campaign, the news, and the way it was made public, signaled that the campaign has been deeply divided as it has struggled to find its footing.
 For the past week, even as his rivals sent out schedules announcing public appearances, the campaign of Mr. Ferrer has been largely silent.
 Ever since his Diallo remarks, Mr. Ferrer has been buffeted by criticism, especially from black leaders and voters, that his explanations did little to quiet. Ms. Fields called upon him to apologize. He was also attacked for his proposal to revive a stock transfer tax to help pay for education, a proposal that opponents characterized as anti-business.
 In 2001, Mr. Axelrod played a major role in devising Mr. Ferrer's campaign message that there were ''two New Yorks'' separated by an economic divide -- a message that, although it was labeled divisive by Mr. Ferrer's opponents, helped him into a runoff against Mark Green, which he then lost. Mr. Axelrod also played roles in the presidential campaign of Senator John Edwards and the victorious senatorial run of Barack Obama of Illinois.
 Mr. Clanton, a Texan, had worked in the consulting firm of the Democratic strategist James Carville before becoming a senior communications adviser for Senator John Kerry's presidential campaign last year.
 Mr. Axelrod and Mr. Clanton were on a team that aimed to position Mr. Ferrer as a candidate with national appeal, part of a strategy to bring in money and volunteers nationwide. But their departures apparently stem from problems closer to home.
 Many Democrats had questioned Mr. Clanton's hiring, predicting that he would find tough going in New York, where the political press corps is considered unrivaled in its ferocity and where the web of relationships, rivalries and grudges can be hard for newcomers to navigate. Mr. Clanton failed, for instance, to immediately grasp the full significance of Mr. Ferrer's comments about Amadou Diallo, campaign aides said at the time.
 One person close to the campaign also said Mr. Ferrer and Mr. Clanton had never quite gelled, but then added that it was early enough in the campaign season for the two to build a close relationship.
 Mr. Ferrer would not be the first candidate to engage in an early course correction. Staff turnovers have been met with mixed results -- at times resulting in stronger teams, at other times leaving a lasting impression that a campaign is not being well run.
 ''The only way the guy is to fix the ship is, he's got to change the discussion,'' said Hank Sheinkopf, who worked for Mr. Ferrer's 1997 campaign before leaving after a falling-out. ''He's got to get it onto education, fast.''

HEADLINE: Voices Warped by the Business Blues

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN 

 BODY:
It is near the end of the 20th century in the United States, a time when a man's thoughts turn to money and how to make it multiply. Conversations swell with dollar signs and percentage points, and the brisk, brittle jargon of entrepreneurs running after deals. Even delivered with enthusiasm, it sounds sterile, which means it is not the kind of talk you expect from a play by August Wilson.
 The surprising, antiseptic sting of much of the dialogue in ''Radio Golf,'' the shaky, still inchoate new play by Mr. Wilson that opened Thursday at the Yale Repertory Theater, is deliberate. In the final work of his great 10-drama cycle about African-Americans in the 20th century, Mr. Wilson intends that at least three of his characters sound as out of place as they do.
 They may be transacting business in that section of Pittsburgh known as the Hill, where most of Mr. Wilson's plays have been set. But they have forgotten its language, an organic poetry shaped by decades of hard living. They are people who have lost their natural voices. In Mr. Wilson's world, that's the same thing as losing their souls. 
 In his masterpiece, ''Joe Turner's Come and Gone'' (seen on Broadway in 1988), Mr. Wilson wrote of the black man who forgets the song that tells him ''how he's supposed to mark down life,'' an individual melody forged from a vast chorus of history. The search for that lost song informs all of the plays in the cycle, each set in a different decade.
 Mr. Wilson's characters have never seemed more in danger of being songless than they do in ''Radio Golf,'' directed by Timothy Douglas, which runs at the Yale Repertory Theater through May 15. The doors to a bright white world of economic and political success have finally opened to blacks willing to play by the rules. In the final chapter of his theatrical epic about race and memory, Mr. Wilson boldly suggests that to step unheedingly through those doors is, in moral terms, simply to disappear.
 Its status as the concluding work in one of the most ambitious dramatic projects ever undertaken automatically makes ''Radio Golf'' an important play. And there is appropriate sentimental symmetry in its being staged at the Yale Repertory, where four other plays in the cycle were originally produced.
 As for what Mr. Wilson has to say here, it is both of a piece with all he has written before and daringly contentious in its warnings against ethnic assimilation. (David Gallo's set wittily includes a poster of Tiger Woods, who here implicitly is a cautionary rather than an inspirational figure.) Those who saw Mr. Wilson's ''Gem of the Ocean'' on Broadway earlier this season should enjoy spotting the symbolic and literal correspondences that connect ''Golf'' with ''Gem,'' which was set in 1904.
 Yet as it stands, ''Radio Golf'' is also Mr. Wilson's weakest play. In charting the financial schemes and political dreams of Harmond Wilks (Richard Brooks), an urban redeveloper poised to announce his candidacy for mayor, ''Radio Golf'' itself falls prey to an addling preoccupation with the mechanics of business. This gives it the strange distinction of being Mr. Wilson's first work that might appeal to someone whose sole reading matter is Barron's or The Wall Street Journal.
 Set in a gleaming new storefront office amid the shabbiness of the Hill in the 1990's, ''Radio Golf'' presents Harmond as a Faust torn between the forces of the past that shaped him and a perilously seductive future. That future is embodied by Harmond's wife, Mame (Michele Shay), and his golf-loving business partner, Roosevelt Hicks (James A. Williams), who in addition to helping Harmond oversee the redevelopment of the Hill district has plans for them to purchase a radio station.
 But as is always true with Mr. Wilson, the past is moving quickly to overtake the present. Facilitating this process are an ex-convict named Sterling Johnson (John Earl Jelks), who first showed up in Mr. Wilson's ''Two Trains Running'' (1992), and Elder Joseph Barlow (Anthony Chisholm), who is descended from characters in ''Gem of the Ocean.'' So, it turns out, is Harmond, and the connections between the two men weave a net that is both Harmond's ruin and his redemption.
 Johnson and Barlow share the burden of being oracular Jiminy Cricket types. But they have the advantage of speaking in that stylized vernacular of near-Shakespearean richness that Mr. Wilson has devised for the residents of the Hill. In the first act, in particular, Johnson and Barlow brim with the wayward anecdotal vigor that is Mr. Wilson's blissful specialty. (A story about why Barlow was once arrested for walking a dog is particularly choice.)
 The enjoyably raspy Mr. Chisholm is an old hand at playing a now classic Wilson archetype, the crazy-like-a-soothsayer street person. (He portrayed a similar character in ''Gem.'') But even he seems a bit wearied by the long metaphoric speeches, involving ships and slot machines and storms, about American corruption.
 Mr. Jelks (who, take a deep breath, in ''Gem'' played the man identified as the father of Mr. Chisholm's character in ''Radio Golf'') is excellent in what is now the play's most fully conceived role, a character who slyly turns conventional morality on its head. As Harmond's personal Mephistopheles, Mr. Williams is convincing as he manfully works through scads of financially detailed exposition.
 Ms. Shay, a memorable part of Mr. Wilson's ''Seven Guitars'' (1996), does her best with a seriously underwritten character who is little more than the sum of her materialistic desires. And though Mr. Brooks is a quiet and commanding central presence as Harmond, the character is so passive as to be almost invisible sometimes.
 Most of what we learn about Harmond comes from what other people say, including shorthand references to his being haunted by a brother who died in Vietnam. Since it is Harmond's moral progress that shapes the play, we need to be allowed to know him more from within -- to hear, to use Mr. Wilson's conceit, the specific as well as the historic song that defines him.
 The outlines and the ideas are all in place for a play that could well be Mr. Wilson's most provocative. But he still needs to filter those ideas through characters who exist on their own. As he is famous for endlessly reworking his plays in their various productions (the next stop for this one is the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles), it is to be hoped that ''Radio Golf'' will have found its own transporting song by the time it reaches New York.

HEADLINE: Oil-Rich Norwegians Take World's Highest Gasoline Prices in Stride

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: OSLO, April 23 

 BODY:
Car owners in the United States may grumble as the price of gasoline hovers around $2.25 a gallon. Here in Norway, home to perhaps the world's most expensive gasoline, drivers greeted higher pump prices of $6.66 a gallon with little more than a shrug. 
 Yes, there was a protest from the Norwegian Automobile Association, which said, ''Enough is enough. ''
 And a right-wing party in Parliament, the Progress Party, once again called for a cut in gasoline taxes, which account for about 67 percent of the price. 
 But ''those critics are but voices in the wilderness,'' said Torgald Sorli, a radio announcer with the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation who often discusses transportation issues. ''We Norwegians are resigned to expensive gasoline. There is no political will to change the system.'' 
 Norway, the world's third-largest oil exporter, behind Saudi Arabia and Russia, has been made wealthy by oil. Last year alone, oil export revenue surged 19 percent, to $38 billion. 
 But no other major oil exporter has tried to reel in its own fuel consumption with as much zeal as Norway. These policies have resulted in Norwegians consuming much less oil per capita than Americans -- 1.9 gallons a day versus almost 3 gallons a day in the United States-- and low car ownership rates. On city streets and rural roads, fuel-efficient Volkswagens and Peugeots far outnumber big sport utility vehicles.
 [Norway's gasoline policies stand in contrast to those in the United States, where President Bush made cheaper gasoline a priority during his discussion of energy policy at his news conference on Thursday.]
 Gasoline, of course, is not the only expensive commodity in Norway, a traditionally frugal and highly taxed nation. At a pub in Oslo, for instance, a pint of beer might cost the equivalent of $12 and an individual frozen pizza $16. But expensive gasoline is rare among large oil-producing countries that often subsidize fuel for their citizens. Gasoline prices in Norway -- with a currency, the krone, strong in comparison with the dollar -- have climbed 30 percent since 1998, outpacing a 15 percent increase in the consumer price index in that period, the national statistics bureau said.
 Having the world's highest gasoline prices is just one strategy to combat greenhouse gases in this redoubt of welfare capitalism and strict environmental laws. Overall energy consumption, especially of electricity, is quite high, however, with Norway blessed with not just oil but ample hydropower resources. 
 Norway not only taxes its gasoline. Norwegians also pay automobile taxes as high as $395 a year for each vehicle, and in Oslo there is even a ''studded-tire'' fee of about $160 for vehicles with all-terrain tires that tear up asphalt more quickly in the winter. 
 Then there are the taxes on new passenger vehicles that can increase the price of imported automobiles. Norway has no auto manufacturing industry aside from an experiment to produce electric cars, and economists have suggested that that has made it easier to limit automobile use in Norway because there is no domestic industry to lobby against such decisions as in neighboring Sweden, home of Saab and Volvo. 
 Norway designed the duties to make large-engine sport utility vehicles much costlier than compact cars. For instance, a high-end Toyota Land Cruiser that costs $60,000 in the United States might run as much as $100,000 in Norway. 
 Economists argue that gasoline prices and other auto taxes in Norway are not so expensive when measured against the annual incomes of Norwegians, among the world's highest at about $51,700 a person, or the shorter workweek of about 37.5 hours that is the norm here. (Norwegians also get five weeks of vacation a year.) The government frequently makes such arguments when responding to criticism over high fuel prices.
 ''We do not want such a system,'' Per-Kristian Foss, the finance minister, said in a curt response to the calls for lower gasoline taxes this month in Parliament. 
 Other European countries have also placed high taxes on gasoline, and some like Britain and the Netherlands have gasoline prices that rival or at times surpass Norway's. In Oslo, as in other European capitals, there is ample public transportation, including an express airport train that whisks travelers to the international airport from downtown in 20 minutes. Yet Norway, with a population of just 4.6 million, differs from much of Europe in its breadth, with an extensive network of roads, tunnels and bridges spread over an area slightly larger than New Mexico. 
 ''Rural areas without good public transportation alternatives are hit a little harder,'' said Knut Sandberg Eriksen, a senior research economist at the Institute of Transport Economics here who estimates the government collects about $2.4 billion in fuel taxes alone each year, or about $519 for every Norwegian. Some of the revenue supports Norway's social benefits.
 ''Our government has been grateful to use the automobile as a supreme tax object,'' Mr. Eriksen said. ''The car is its milking cow.''
 Perhaps as a result of such policies, Norway has lower levels of car ownership than other European countries, with 427 cars per 1,000 people in 2003 compared with more than 500 cars per 1,000 people in both France and Germany, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit. The United States has more than 700 cars per 1,000 people.
 The average age of a passenger car in Norway is 18 years when it is scrapped, though this might be changing in a strong economy with the lowest interest rates in 50 years. Registrations of new passenger cars last year climbed 29 percent from 2003. But the frugality of some Norwegians, even in rural areas, suggests older cars will remain at many households.
 ''Personally I have no need for a new vehicle; I'm proud to hold on to my own for as long as I can,'' said Johannes Rode, 69, a retired art and music teacher and owner of a 29-year-old red Volkswagen Beetle in Ramberg, a coastal town in northern Norway. ''To do otherwise would be wasteful and play into the oil industry's hands.''
 Caution about oil's risks is common in Norway. The government created the Petroleum Fund more than a decade ago as a repository for most of the royalties it receives from oil production. The $165 billion fund, overseen by the central bank, is intended for the day when oil resources in the North Sea start to dry up.
 Meanwhile, unlike other large oil producers like Saudi Arabia, Iran or Venezuela, Norway has done little to encourage domestic petroleum consumption. In part because high gasoline prices deter such a luxury, Norway consumes little more than 200,000 barrels a day of oil while exporting nearly its entire production of 3.3 million barrels a day. This confounds some Norwegians.
 ''Norway is a rich, oil-producing country with no foreign debt,'' said Egil Otter, a spokesman for the Norwegian Automobile Association, a sister organization to AAA. ''We think that Norway, with its enormous and complicated geography and distances, deserves pump prices at an average European level. Motorists find it very difficult to be taxed into these extremes.'' 
 Such opinions contrast with the quick defense of high gasoline prices often voiced around Norway, which is celebrating its 100th year of independence from neighboring Sweden and so far has opted out of joining the European Union.
 Sverre Lodgaard, director of the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs, said Norway had a responsibility to manage its oil resources soberly because of its support of worldwide limitations on greenhouse-gas emissions. 
 ''We are engaged on this front,'' Mr. Lodgaard said. ''It is difficult for us to view the example of the United States, which is overconsuming to an incredible extent.'' 
 The United States, which uses about a quarter of the world's daily oil consumption, had the cheapest gasoline prices of the 27 industrial countries measured by the International Energy Agency in its most recent analysis of fuel prices. Taxes accounted on average for just 20 percent of the price of gasoline in the United States, the agency said. 
 Even amid Norway's bluster on gasoline prices, however, environmentalists suggest the nation could do more to achieve greater energy efficiency. One sore point is the consumption of electricity, traditionally generated by hydropower but soon to depend more on a fossil fuel, natural gas. 
 Producing oil for export in Norway requires large amounts of electricity, and homes in the country, with much of its territory above the Arctic Circle, use electricity for heating, creating much higher electricity consumption levels than elsewhere in Europe. It is not uncommon to drive on well-lighted roads even in remote areas. 
 ''There are areas in which we have done O.K.,'' said Dag Nagoda, a coordinator in the Oslo office of the WWF, formerly known as the World Wildlife Fund. ''And there are areas in which we can do better.''

HEADLINE: Week Ends With a Rally as Oil Falls Below $50 a Barrel

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street ended a volatile week with a rally yesterday as oil prices tumbled below $50 a barrel and jittery investors took solace in a pair of economic reports that eased their inflation concerns. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 122 points for the session, but the major indexes finished the week mixed.
 A late sell-off in crude futures helped Wall Street solidify its gains in an otherwise uncertain session. A barrel of light crude settled at $49.72, down $2.05, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, its lowest level since Feb. 18. Oil prices began the week above $55 a barrel. 
 The buying was further buoyed by economic data that showed prices and labor costs remained in check. The Commerce Department reported a 0.5 percent increase in income and a 0.6 percent jump in spending for March, and the Labor Department said labor costs for businesses were falling. Both are crucial inflation readings that bode well for interest rates and the economy.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 122.14 points, or 1.2 percent, to 10,192.51. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index jumped 13.63 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,156.85, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 17.47 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,921.65.
 Despite the gains, the market finished the week mixed, with the Dow up 0.3 percent, the S.&P. gaining 0.4 percent and the Nasdaq losing 0.5 percent.
 Analysts attributed the market's volatile day-to-day swings to nervousness over Tuesday's Federal Reserve meeting. The Fed is expected to raise the benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point, to 3 percent, but Wall Street is more interested in the Fed's assessment of the economy.
 Investors hope that a bullish report could lift the market out of its April slump. For the month, the Dow fell 3 percent, the S.&P. lost 2 percent and the Nasdaq tumbled 3.9 percent.
 Microsoft gained 85 cents, to $25.30, as the company doubled its quarterly net income from a year ago, though revenue fell short of Wall Street's expectations. The company gave a stronger-than-expected profit outlook as well.
 Retailers sold off after the University of Michigan's consumer confidence report showed a larger-than-expected drop in consumers' optimism about the economy. 
 Online retailers led the declines, as Amazon.com shed 16 cents, to $32.36; Shopping.com dropped 23 cents, to $13.15; and the online delivery service Provide Commerce tumbled 31.3 percent, or $8.03, to $17.65, after a particularly disappointing earnings report. 
 The weakness spread to bricks-and-mortar retailers. Wal-Mart Stores fell to a 52-week low during the session, but managed to close 9 cents higher at $47.14.
 Sun Microsystems climbed 18 cents, to $3.62, after a published report said the company was discussing a leveraged buyout with the private equity firm Silver Lake Partners.
 ChevronTexaco reported modest profits that failed to meet Wall Street's expectations. The shares nonetheless rose 85 cents, to $52.
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note declined 13/32, to a price of 98 13/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.20 percent from 4.15 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Bush As Robin Hood

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY. 
E-mail: tierney@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Democrats have good reason to be aghast at President Bush's new proposal for Social Security. Someone has finally called their bluff. 
 They tried yesterday to portray him as just another cruel, rich Republican for suggesting any cuts in future benefits, but that's not what the prime-time audience saw on Thursday night. By proposing to shore up the system while protecting low-income workers, Mr. Bush raised a supremely awkward question for Democrats: which party really cares about the poor? 
 For decades Democrats have pointed to Social Security as a triumph of communal generosity, proof that Americans (or at least non-Republican Americans) will work together to make sure sure that no widow is reduced to eating cat food. The program has been wonderful for liberals' self-esteem. What it has actually done for the poor is another matter.
 It's true, as Democrats love to point out, that the poverty rate among the elderly has declined from 35 percent a half-century ago to 10 percent today. But when you consider how much money is being taken out of Americans' paychecks -- most workers now pay more to Social Security than to the I.R.S. -- you're entitled to wonder why there are any poor widows remaining. 
 As a poverty-fighting program, Social Security is woefully inefficient because most of the money goes to people who aren't poor. It would take just 20 percent of what Social Security dispenses to move every elderly American out of poverty, according to June O'Neill, the former director of the Congressional Budget Office. 
 Social Security has an image as a progressive program because low-income workers get back bigger monthly checks, relative to their salaries, than high-income workers do. They're also more likely to get disability benefits. 
 But they lose out in other ways. They tend to start working and paying taxes at a relatively young age because they don't go to college, but then end up collecting benefits for fewer years because their life expectancy is shorter. They're more likely to be unmarried, making them ineligible for benefits earned by a spouse. 
 ''The amount of income-related redistribution in Social Security is a lot less than people think,'' said Jeffrey Liebman, a Harvard economist and a former official in the Clinton administration. ''If you get the details right, you can design a personal-account retirement system in which groups with high risks of poverty in old age come out at least as well as with the current system.''
 So why are his fellow Democrats so dead set against it? Their usual answer has been that any move to privatization would doom the poor along with the whole Social Security program. If you let the middle and upper classes opt out and finance their own retirement, the argument has gone, there will be no political support for even the modest subsidies that Social Security now provides to low-income workers -- just look at what Republicans did to welfare and public housing programs.
 But the elderly poor are different from the younger poor. For one thing, they're more likely to vote, a fact not lost on even the most hardhearted Republican. They also arouse much more public sympathy. Kicking 25-year-olds off welfare was popular because it was thought to be good for them. Nobody claims that forcing that widow to eat cat food will build character.
 That's why even the most ardent free-marketeers are not trying to eliminate the safety net for the elderly. The libertarians at the Cato Institute are trying to strengthen it with a proposal that has been introduced by Republicans in Congress. If your individual account left you with a paltry pension, their plan would guarantee you a subsidy to lift you above the poverty line -- and well above what many retirees are now getting from Social Security.
 Democrats like to portray Mr. Bush as King George or Marie Antoinette. But on Thursday night, when he promised to improve benefits for the poor while limiting them for everyone else, he sounded more like Robin Hood, especially when he rhapsodized about poor people getting a chance to build up assets that they could pass along to their children. 
 It was the kind of talk you might expect to hear from a Democrat, except that Democrats don't talk about much these days except the glories of the New Deal. They know that Social Security doesn't even have the money to sustain a program that leaves millions of elderly people in poverty. But it's their system, and they're sticking to it.

HEADLINE: A Currency Afloat (for All Of 20 Minutes)

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, April 29 

 BODY:
The Bush administration has been pressing the Chinese government for years to allow its currency, which is pegged to the dollar, to trade more freely. It got its wish on Friday -- but only for 20 minutes. 
 A freely trading Chinese yuan would probably rise in value against the dollar, making Chinese exports to the United States more costly. That, in turn, would give relief to American manufacturers battered by low-priced Chinese goods as the American trade deficit has been growing faster with China than with any other country. It would also be a political victory for the Bush administration. 
 Until this afternoon, China had ignored the demands. But as traders drifted back to their desks from lunch in Asian financial capitals on Friday, the yuan suddenly broke out of its prescribed trading range. No one knows for sure if the move was deliberate or a result of a technical glitch. 
 But regardless of whether it was a Chinese test of their ability to manage a rising yuan or simply a case of the Chinese central bank briefly failing to buy enough dollars to keep supporting the American currency, traders noticed it and the prices for many other currencies began to shift in response. 
 The yuan climbed until it took 8.270 of them to buy a dollar instead of the usual 8.276. That difference, of only six thousandths of a yuan, might not seem like much of a change. 
 But it came on the eve of a weeklong holiday in China and at a time of intense speculation that a Chinese revaluation of the currency, which has been fixed by Beijing against the dollar for years, might be imminent. The brief appreciation, a hint of further rises if the yuan were to float, was enough to roil currency markets around the world.
 The dollar fell and the euro, yen and gold rose as investors placed bets that if China let the yuan rise against the dollar, other countries would also permit their currencies to appreciate against the dollar because their exporters would no longer be so fearful of being undercut by Chinese rivals. 
 Economists said it was almost impossible to discern from the swirl of rumors on Friday whether China was on the verge of finally allowing the tidal wave of investment flowing into the country to push up the value of the yuan. 
 ''I wouldn't be surprised if we woke up to an announcement this weekend; I wouldn't be surprised if they waited until this summer,'' said Jonathan Anderson, an economist at UBS.
 Traders used to seeing a flat line on their screens day after day for the value of the yuan were especially transfixed by the brief surge because it came the same day that a state-run newspaper, The China Securities Journal, ran an article on its front page that seemed to depart from previous government statements ruling out any shift in currency policy soon. 
 The article asserted that China's financial system and currency regime were finally ready for the yuan to rise, provided that the rise was only a few percentage points.
 The People's Bank of China, the central bank, issued a public denial by midafternoon that it had received any formal instructions from the country's political authorities to push the yuan to a new level. But the brief movement of the yuan prompted some economists to say that China may have been testing its ability to manage a small fluctuation in the value of its currency, as a possible preparation for managing an eventual change in the yuan's value.
 Some currency traders said a more likely explanation was that a mistake was made by a Chinese employee, who may have typed a wrong number onto the government's official currency posting. ''We interpret it as a technical glitch, rather than an imminent revaluation,'' said Steven Englander, a currency strategist at Barclays Capital in New York. 
 Frank Gong, an economist at J.P. Morgan, said that the central bank had tolerated tiny spurts in the yuan's value to 8.275 for a few minutes over the last decade. But he said it was highly unlikely that Chinese authorities accidentally let such a large spike in value occur on Friday, especially at a time of intense speculation about the future value of the yuan.
 ''They chose that timing to test the market,'' he said, adding that he thought China might revalue during the coming holiday week. 
 Beijing authorities pegged the currency at 8.3 to the dollar toward the end of the Asian financial crisis in 1998 and have since kept it in a tight trading range around that level. China's foreign exchange reserves soared by $200 billion last year alone as the People's Bank of China intervened heavily in currency markets, issuing yuan and buying dollars to keep the yuan from breaching the top of the narrow trading range, 8.276 to the dollar.
 The Bush administration has been calling with increasing outspokenness in recent weeks for China to let the currency rise, which would make imports cheaper in China as well as make China's exports less competitive in the United States and other overseas markets. European and Japanese officials have supported Washington's position but have been less vocal.
 Many economists within China, including some government economists, have been warning that the country risks serious inflation if it continues printing ever more yuan and exchanging them for dollars in an effort to hold down the value of the yuan in currency markets. 
 The Chinese government has tried a variety of measures, with mixed success, to buy back the yuan that it is issuing in its currency market interventions, most notably by selling bonds to the public and by reducing credit to the banking sector.
 But political leaders in China have been leery of moving too quickly to permit an appreciation of the currency, known either as the yuan or the renminbi. They fear that a swift rise might lead to layoffs at export-oriented factories and job losses in the countryside as cheap food from the United States and elsewhere would flood in.
 In interviews at the Canton Trade Fair in Guangzhou on Thursday, executives from companies across China said that a higher yuan would cut into their profit margins. But they differed, depending on their industry, as to whether a stronger yuan would prompt overseas buyers to shift their purchases to other countries.
 Ma Jilin, the general manager of the Zibo Shuangfeng Ceramics Company in Shandong Province in northeastern China, said that a 10 percent rise in the value of the yuan -- larger than most economists expect -- would cause many restaurants and other customers to stop buying brightly colored ceramic plates and mugs from his factory and take their business to Malaysia or South Korea.
 Wages for factory workers have risen 15 percent in the last year because of labor shortages, electricity prices are rising, shipping costs are climbing and high-quality clay is in short supply, he added.
 ''If the renminbi rises, that will make it very difficult for a lot of factories,'' Mr. Ma said.
 But Yan Jun, the general manager of the Jinxiang Bristles Industrial Company in Hunan Province in southern China, said that a rising yuan might not have that much effect on overseas demand for his company's pig bristles, used for paint brushes. In a country where pork is practically a staple, pig bristles are so plentiful and inexpensive that any threat comes not from other countries' pig bristles but from synthetic bristles.
 The synthetic bristles cost one-eighth as much as even the Chinese bristles, and the main issue in the industry is whether buyers will decide to accept the inferior quality of the synthetic materials, in which case the value of the yuan will be irrelevant, Mr. Yan said.
 Even before Friday's brief rise in the yuan, The China Securities Journal report prompted a rise in the value of the euro and especially the yen, with the yen climbing 1.16 percent, to 104.83 to the dollar in New York trading.
 The State Administration of Foreign Exchange, which manages the country's currency reserves, issued a statement on Friday, outlining some administrative changes in the handling of foreign currency transactions within China and saying that it wanted to ''provide better conditions in the foreign exchange market.'' The statement gave no specific clues about the value of the yuan.

HEADLINE: China Heads List of Problems for New Trade Official

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29 

 BODY:
Representative Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, was sworn in as the new United States trade representative Friday after the Senate approved his nomination in the morning.
 Popular with Democrats as well as Republicans, Mr. Portman's nomination was held captive for several days by Senator Evan Bayh, Democrat of Indiana, who was demonstrating his irritation over what he and other lawmakers consider the administration's ineffective trade relations with China.
 With record trade deficits and mounting concern in Congress over China's handling of its currency as well as its violation of international trade laws, Mr. Portman promised lawmakers during his confirmation hearing last week that he would get tough with the Chinese and do a better job of enforcing trade laws. 
 The administration responded to some of that criticism Friday by releasing a report detailing what it said was China's continuing violation of intellectual property rights despite repeated public promises to rein in rampant pirating and counterfeiting.
 But while the office of the United States trade representative said China's performance would land it on a special watch list, the administration stopped short of bringing a case against China to the World Trade Organization's dispute settlement panel.
 In a rare sign of political agreement, Democrats and labor unions, some Republicans and many business organizations have demanded that the administration file suit before the global body as the only way to demonstrate to China that the United States is serious about these issues. The United States Chamber of Commerce says China's illegal trade practices cost American industry more than $200 billion a year.
 The Senate Finance Committee wrote to President Bush on Friday afternoon urging him to take China to the W.T.O. if it is the only way to force Beijing to respect intellectual property rights. The lawmakers were especially scathing about China's decision to guarantee these rights at a level ''appropriate for its own national situation.''
 Representative Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, who is the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means trade subcommittee, said in an interview that he was disappointed in the administration's decision.
 ''Putting China on a watch list means nothing,'' Mr. Cardin said. ''The administration has to understand that Congress is serious and wants action on China.''
 Mr. Portman was sworn in at the White House at noon. He succeeds Robert B. Zoellick, who left the post a month ago to become deputy secretary of state.
 ''I look forward to taking on the challenge of opening markets for U.S. products and services, ensuring trade is fair by enforcing our trade laws and international rules, and promoting freedom and democracy through expanded trade,'' Mr. Portman said.
 He immediately won praise from lawmakers and foreign trade officials who have been anxious to begin working with him. Peter Mandelson, the European Union's senior trade official, welcomed his confirmation and said, ''We have a huge amount to work on together.''
 Mr. Portman will meet Mr. Mandelson next week in Paris, where they will discuss negotiations for a new global trade treaty that could require a reduction in farm subsidies in the United States and Europe.
 A former international trade lawyer and a close friend of the president, Mr. Portman will need the full support of the White House to tackle the growing list of trade problems.
 China is at the top of the list. Congress is in near revolt over China's refusal to alter its currency exchange rates, which lawmakers contend allow the Chinese to sell their exports cheaply, undercutting American goods and feeding the trade deficit.
 The administration is also being pressed to stem the flow of cheap Chinese textiles that have flooded the United States market since Jan. 1 when a 30-year-old textile quota system, the Multi-Fiber Agreement, was removed. That pact had taken the place of others.
