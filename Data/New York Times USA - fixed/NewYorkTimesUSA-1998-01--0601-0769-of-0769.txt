HEADLINE: Mussolini Medallions Turn Up at Ranch

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

DATELINE: SHELDON, Mo.

 BODY:
A collection of large copper medallions created for one of Mussolini's principal Fascist shrines in Rome and missing since American troops occupied the Italian capital in World War II has come to light at a cattle ranch here in southwestern Missouri.
Jay H. Anderson, who operates the 800-acre ranch near the Kansas border, said his father, a major in the United States Army who died in 1976, said that he had removed nine medallions from a marble map on the side of a building when his unit, part of the 45th Infantry Division, became one of the first to occupy Rome in June 1944. Maj. James H. Anderson then mailed the medallions to his home in Kansas City, his son said. 
 After his father's death, Mr. Anderson explained, he divided the medallions with his sister, Nancy Ekern, who lives in Mexico, Mo., and he and his sister have been using them, unaware of their significance, to decorate their homes.
Mr. Anderson said that his father had told him that he had asked his commanding officer if he could have the medallions, and the officer had said: "Yeah, if you want them, get them!"
"My dad then got an extension ladder and pulled them off the wall," Mr. Anderson said. "He told me he just tied them up with cord, and didn't even wrap them in anything. He put his address on them and mailed them home. And when he got back from the service, they were on our porch in Kansas City just the way he had tied them up."
Mr. Anderson said that he and his sister have yet to decide what to do with the medallions now that their historical significance is known.
It is possible, although unlikely because of their limited monetary value, that the Italian Government will try to recover the medallions by filing a civil suit against the Andersons in Missouri.
The Andersons could be prosecuted under the National Stolen Property Act, which makes it a crime to knowingly possess stolen property. That is unlikely because the Andersons, until recently, were unaware of the importance of the medallions. The Andersons were contacted by a New York Times reporter who had learned of the existence of the medallions through a letter from a third party.
Scholars say that although the medallions are the work of Antonio Munoz (1884-1960), a prominent Italian artist of his time, and have artistic merit, their chief value is as historical artifacts that reveal Mussolini's carefully cloaked lust for empire.
"They're very important documents," said Denis Mack Smith, an emeritus professor of modern Italian history at Oxford University's All Souls College and the author of a biography and other works on the Italian dictator. "Mussolini talked about imperialism in deliberately confusing and contradictory terms, but here you have exact illustrations of what he was thinking."
The medallions, made of finely hammered sheets of copper, measure about 3 feet by 4 feet. They depict industrial, agricultural and maritime scenes, and were highlights on a wall-sized marble map of Mussolini's Fascist empire in 1936, when it dominated the Mediterranean and extended into North Africa through Libya, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia.
The medallions included place names, like Cairo and Suez, leaving no doubt that Mussolini intended to wrest Egypt and the Suez Canal from the control of Britain, an objective he would not acknowledge until at war with Britain in 1940.
The marble map on which the medallions were fastened was one of a series of five marble wall carvings facing the broad avenue Via dei Fori Imperiali between the Colosseum and the Palazzo Venezia where Mussolini used to address huge rallies.
The first four maps were constructed by Munoz on the wall of the Basilica Constantine in 1934 as Mussolini was preparing to conquer Ethiopia. They depict four stages in the growth of ancient Rome, from its supposed founding in 754 B.C. to the reign of Emperor Trajan (A.D. 96-117) when the Roman Empire reached its zenith, encircling the Mediterranean and reaching as far north as Scotland, the Rhine, the Danube and the Black Sea.
"The message was that modern Italy could do this, too, but Mussolini wouldn't come out and say it," Professor Smith said.
Shepard Stone, a European specialist for The New York Times in 1935, reported that year that copies of the marble maps in Rome were appearing "throughout Italy."
They were a powerful propaganda tool, Mr. Stone reported, used by Mussolini to excite his followers to near hysteria with the belief that fate had chosen them to restore the glory that was Rome.
Many European statesmen scoffed at Mussolini's posturing because Italy lacked the industrial, economic and human resources necessary to sustain a great power like Britain or France, not to mention a colossus like ancient Rome. But Mussolini's supporters shrugged off the criticism and took delight in chanting their leader's singsong slogan "Roma doma," Rome dominates.
In the 1930's and early 1940's, the maps and medallions were a backdrop for military spectacles, and the site became revered by Italian Fascists much as the Nuremberg stadium in Germany was cherished by the Nazis.
Mario Bondioli Osio, chief of the Italian Government agency concerned with the recovery of cultural objects lost in World War II, said that after Mussolini's downfall and the collapse of his empire in 1943, the fifth map showing North Africa in the grip of Fascist Italy was destroyed. It has long been thought that the gleaming copper medallions were destroyed as well.
The four maps of ancient Rome still adorn the basilica of Constantine, where they are seen by throngs of tourists every year.
Mr. Osio said the discovery of the medallions had created "great excitement" among local art historians, and that if the objects are returned to Italy they would be placed in the Museo di Roma.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Giving Credit Where Blame Might Be Due

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
HOW can the world be saved from financial disaster without helping the very people who caused that disaster? The world's financial doctors think it can't be done.
The currency collapses in Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea differ in some ways, but the similarities are significant. "The Asian crisis," said Paul Krugman, a professor of international economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, "was mainly about bad banking and its consequences." 
 He'd get little argument from Robert E. Rubin, the Treasury Secretary and longtime investment banker who headed Goldman, Sachs & Company before joining the Clinton Administration. In all the Asian countries in trouble, Mr. Rubin said in a speech last week at Georgetown University, "close links between governments, banks and corporations led to fundamentally unsound lending by banks." Foreign investors, he added, "injected an extraordinary amount of capital into these flawed systems, without due regard for the risks."
In Korea, said You Jong-Keun, an economic adviser to President-elect Kim Dae Jung, banks made loans based on politics, family relations and even bribery. That, he said, has to change.
And yet it appears that the foreign (primarily American) banks that lent large sums to Korean banks will escape relatively unscathed. While several large foreign banks said last week that Asian problems had caused earnings problems, they have not yet had to write off significant amounts of bad loans, and may never have to do so.
Stock market investors, including those who invest in mutual funds that specialize in emerging markets, have taken huge losses, but the lenders whose easy credit let the problem get out of hand may avoid real red ink, simply because international bailouts will also save them. Bankers negotiating with South Korea have already won a tentative agreement that calls for the Korean Government to take over the bad loans made to Korean commercial banks. A lot of details remain to be negotiated, but it appears that the foreign banks, because their cooperation is needed to avert a collapse, are in a good negotiating position.
That is not a situation that anyone professes to like. "We would not give one nickel to help any creditor or investor," Mr. Rubin said in his speech. But, he added: "Any action that would force investors and creditors involuntarily to take losses, however appropriate that might seem, would risk serious adverse consequences. It could cause banks to pull money out of the countries involved. It could reduce the ability of these countries to access new sources of private capital. And perhaps most tellingly, it could cause banks to pull back from other emerging markets."
 
Paging Dr. Pangloss
One can argue that such a pullback might not be a bad idea, assuming it was gradual. Mr. Krugman, reaching back to Voltaire's "Candide," said the history of bailouts might have encouraged banks to lend on the basis of "Pangloss values." Normally, the thinking goes, an investment might make a huge profit, but there is always a risk of a big loss if things go wrong. Under normal circumstances, such an investment might be avoided. But in the best of all possible worlds, investors believe a bailout will rescue them, and they may invest as if that best outcome were a sure thing. But Mr. Krugman agrees that the risk of not mounting bailouts right now is too great.
Mr. Rubin said in his speech that it was "critically important that we work toward changing the global financial architecture so that creditors and investors bear the full consequences of their decisions to the greatest extent possible." But he doesn't appear to have a real grasp of just how to rebuild that global system.
In fact, there are some easy answers in theory, albeit tough to impose in practice. Since most of the bad Asian loans were made to companies and banks, and not to Governments, the companies and banks could be judged on a case-by-case basis. Some would be allowed to fail, leaving the creditors with big losses. Others might be salvaged, making the creditors whole. And those in the middle might survive with the aid of debt-for-equity swaps, in which the foreign banks give up some or all of their loans in return for companies' stock.
"If they were really playing hardball," said Hugh Patrick, a professor of international business at the Columbia University Graduate School of Business, the International Monetary Fund and the United States Government could tell the banks that they would only bail out the Koreans if the banks agreed to make some substantial sacrifices. But the banks are in a strong negotiating position, he added, and "it is more important to maintain the system even if we bail out the banks."
Another suggestion came from James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, who noted that one reason Asian countries are in such trouble is that they borrowed dollars (getting lower interest rates) rather than their own currencies, which have since collapsed. Perhaps, Mr. Grant said, banks could only be allowed to collect the original local currency value of their loans. So an Indonesian company that borrowed $1 million six months ago when that sum was worth 2.6 billion rupiahs, for example, would now have to pay back 2.6 billion rupiahs, or, in dollars, about $168,000.
There is precedent for that idea, Mr. Grant noted. During the Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt devalued the dollar against gold. Nearly every corporate bond outstanding then specified that if such a thing happened, the company would have to repay more dollars to match the original gold value. That would have caused even more companies to go broke than were already failing, so Congress passed a law saying that those bond contracts were unenforceable and that companies could meet their obligations in devalued dollars. The law was upheld by the Supreme Court in a 5-to-4 vote.
 
A Rosy Future
That won't happen this time around, because the banks seem to be in far too strong a negotiating position.
Instead, the Asian countries will most likely get stuck with many of the bad loans run up by their companies. That won't do the foreign banks any immediate good, because the countries are in no position to pay them back. But if the loans are stretched out for years, eventually the countries will probably be able to pay them. The banks will end up with long-term loans that work out acceptably in the end; they might even be able to negotiate high interest rates while they wait.
And the countries? Their economies will face what amounts to a tax to repay the bankers, since it will be tax revenues that in the end make the banks whole. That won't seem fair to a lot of people in the affected countries, but it looks like the most probable outcome.

HEADLINE: United Ways Report Rise In Donations

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Donations to many United Ways rose significantly last year, reversing a trend in which donations fell from 1991 to 1996, preliminary figures obtained from large United Ways show.
But the United Ways in Los Angeles and Chicago may bring in less money than they did in 1996, which may mean further cuts in financing for social service charities in those cities. 
 At 11 of the 13 largest United Ways, each of which raises more than $50 million annually, pledges for 1997 rose an average of 3 percent over 1996. Those figures, like all those in this article, are adjusted for inflation. Nationwide, about 95 percent of pledges typically materialize as cash.
Detailed national figures will not be available until August.
The biggest increase was at United Way of King County in Seattle, where pledges rose 14.2 percent to $60 million.
Midsize United Ways have reported strong gains as well. At United Way of Central Carolinas in Charlotte, N.C., which is in the second tier of large United Ways, pledges rose more than 19 percent to $26.5 million.
"In Charlotte we expected 10 percent because the economy is booming," said Betty Beene, president of United Way of America, "but we had no right to expect double that growth." She said that "for the first time in a very long time we are seeing double-digit growth in communities across the country."
Though United Ways historically depended on workers who authorize modest deductions from their paychecks for most of their revenue, the growth in pledges comes almost entirely from business owners and executives making pledges of $1,000 or more, say officials of United Ways across the country.
United Way of New York City said that pledges so far to its local campaign, which provides nearly a quarter of its finances, are up more than 10 percent, to $19 million for 1997 from $17.1 million in 1996.
But the Los Angeles United Way, where donations fell 43 percent from 1991 to 1996, is encountering resistance from donors. Its advertising campaign, which says city residents have plenty of money for breast implants, cafe lattes and "other necessities of life" but are stingy givers, is the subject of widespread debate.
Joseph Haggerty, president of the Greater Los Angeles United Way, said the group might fall "a tad short" of its $59 million goal, which would be a slight decline from 1996.
The Chicago United Way/Crusade of Mercy has extended its campaign, which was to have ended on Dec. 31, to April 1, said its spokeswoman, Carolyn Placko. The organization has not released its figures.
Tri-State United Way, which raises money at 137 large New York area corporations on behalf of 31 local United Ways in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, said it expected to report in April that total pledges rose more than 5 percent over 1996. (The United Way of New York City gets about 40 percent of its money from Tri-State.)
All 1,300 local United Ways reported raising $3.25 billion in 1996, which was 11 percent less than in 1991, the last year before a disclosure that William Aramony, who was then the president of United Way of America, had stolen charity funds. Mr. Aramony, convicted on fraud charges, is in prison.
United Way donations have also been declining because widespread layoffs reduced its primary base of support -- workers in large factories and offices -- by 20 percent. The drive was also hurt by stagnant wages and a shift in giving away from social service charities and toward higher education, religion and the arts.
United Way's growing reliance on wealthy donors, rather than modest deductions from paychecks, was evident in Minneapolis, where donations rose more than $3 million, or 6 percent, to $54 million. Pledges of $5,000 or more accounted for 30 percent of the increase, said Jim Boyle, the Minneapolis United Way spokesman.
Not all of the growth in donations will benefit social service charities like Boys and Girls Clubs, Y.M.C.A.'s and Family Service Associations that belong to United Way. That is because some United Ways allow donors to designate that their gifts, after United Way deducts an overhead charge that is typically about 10 percent, be passed on to charities that are not part of United Way. Some United Ways have started to encourage major donors to funnel all their charitable gifts through United Way.

BIG GAME, PART 1
Play Along at Home
Yes, it's that Sunday again. Ads, ads, ads, ads, football, ads. As a public service to the soon-to-be-numb, here is a fun way to take part in the annual marketing Bacchanal called the Super Bowl without leaving your Barcalounger. Get yourself a shoe box and, starting with this sentence, toss a thousand-dollar bill into it for each word you read. (That's $21,000 so far.) Why? You'll see shortly. ($29,000.) Meanwhile, regardless of their personal loyalties, superstitious Wall Streeters all take delight in this year's point spread: As everyone knows, a win today by the heavily favored Green Bay Packers, the N.F.C. champions, would predict a rising Dow for the rest of the year, not to mention six more weeks of winter. 

ASIAN TURMOIL
Getting On With It
The Continent That Ate Your Newspaper may soon be relaxing its stranglehold on the headlines. Though it pains their governments visibly, Indonesia and South Korea are beginning to fall into line with the I.M.F.'s recovery prescriptions. In Jakarta, a bunch of teetering banks are to merge into one institution that might just survive; in Seoul, the biggest of the chaebol conglomerates announced (somewhat sketchy) plans to pare down their higgledy-piggledy empires. The Japanese Government's efforts at crisis management have persuaded investors to bid Tokyo stock prices up sharply from the depths of two weeks ago. No such luck in Indonesia, though, where investors don't like President Suharto's choice of a running mate (and possible successor) or the corporate sector's chances of coping with immense debts; stocks and the currency both plunged.
 
DEALS
Fever Unabated
Last year, the total value of mergers and acquisitions involving American companies topped $1 trillion for the first time, and 1998 looks to be continuing the trend. Two drug giants, American Home Products and SmithKline Beecham, are talking about what would be the biggest merger ever, though they have not yet struck a deal; product liability problems with two American Home diet drugs are one obstacle. A couple of takeover firms -- Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts -- agreed to combine the movie-theater chains they already own with another, Regal Cinemas, that they will buy, forming the nation's largest chain. Ciba Specialty Chemicals won a weeklong bidding war with Hercules to take over Allied Colloids, a British specialty chemical maker, for $2.3 billion.
 
MICROSOFT
Busy, Busy, Busy
What didn't Microsoft do last week? On successive days, the company announced (along with its consortium partners, Intel, Compaq and the Baby Bells) a new standard for ultra-high-speed Internet connections over ordinary phone wires. (Article, page 4.) Then it reported strong quarterly earnings, hinted at sweeping layoffs in one of its struggling on-line content businesses and settled a contempt-of-court complaint with the Government over the intertwining of its Windows 95 operating system and Internet browser software. Microsoft agreed to comply with a Dec. 11 court order by allowing computer makers to ship machines with Windows 95 intact but without a visible way of using Microsoft's browser, while the Government's antitrust action and Microsoft's appeal of the court order move forward. The stock rose $4 on the week, enough to make Bill Gates $1.08 billion richer.
 
JETLINERS
Braced for Turbulence
America's other Washington State-based near-monopoly is in a rough patch caused by its own success. Boeing said it expected to report its first annual loss since 1947 next week, courtesy of $4 billion in charges. Absorbing its last domestic rival, McDonnell Douglas, will cost Boeing a bigger-than-expected $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, on top of $2.6 billion in previously announced charges born of nasty production snags that developed when Boeing's order book got fatter than its factories could handle. Softening the blows of recent cancellations from Asian carriers was a new $2.5 billion plane order from thriving Southwest Airlines. (If you've lost count, that brings the shoe box to $630,000 so far.)
 
OIL
A Refiner's Market
North America is awash in cheap crude. The Energy Department reported surprising jumps in crude oil and refined product stocks, sending already slumping spot and forward markets to new four-year depths below $16 a barrel. Low crude prices have proved more boon than bane for a few of the big integrated oil companies: Exxon, Chevron and Texaco rode fat refining margins to big profit increases in the fourth quarter, and Amerada Hess trimmed its loss. But the price trend cut the other way for Amoco and for oil-service companies like Schlum-berger and Diamond Offshore, whose fortunes depend on crude prices high enough to make drilling new wells economical. Article, page 5.
 
HIGH FINANCE
Typhoon Season
Foul financial weather in Asia did not soak all American financial institutions equally in the fourth quarter. J. P. Morgan, which depends much more than the other money-center banks on trading and derivatives business, saw profits fall by more than a third and set aside $587 million to cover potential losses on currency swaps. Good results at home kept Citicorp, Chase Manhattan and BankAmerica in the growth column over all, but each said it took a battering abroad. In contrast, the big brokerage houses bobbed along nicely in the fourth quarter in spite of the market turmoil, with Merrill Lynch; Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, and Paine Webber all reporting solid profit growth. And Republic New York made big money in foreign exchange and commodity trading in the quarter.
 
ECONOMY
Funny Bounce
The statistic hawks in Washington and on Wall Street, straining their eyes looking for signs that Asian turmoil is affecting the American economy, were blinking in disbelief when the Commerce Department reported last week that the United States trade deficit shrank in November. All hands continue to expect the deficit to balloon one of these months on cheap Asian imports and soft demand in Asia for Yankee exports. The Federal Reserve's "beige book" report on regional economic conditions found the beginnings of an Asian slowdown effect across the country.
 
BIG GAME, PART 2
Ad Infinitum
Back to our experiment. By the end of this sentence you should be up to 1,047 thousand-dollar bills spilling out of the shoe box and mingling with the pretzel crumbs and cat hair on the family-room carpet -- but it's still not enough to buy a single 30-second commercial during today's Super Bowl. Advertisers are paying an average of $1.3 million a pop to reach what is usually the biggest, and always the malest, mass television audience of the year, pitching beer, cars, gadgets, beer, movies, snacks, beer, chili, hot sauce and beer. Joining the perennial Bud Bowl will be a multiple-ad stunt from Intel encouraging viewers to log on to the company's Web site during the game to "vote" for one of two suspects in a make-believe mystery involving its mylar-suited "Bunny People." Safest Super Bowl bet: Next year, ad time will cost even more.

Foes of Brooklyn Junction Are Repeating Earlier Error

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The opponents of Brooklyn Junction -- people like Marie Cantoni, Carmel Lopez and Peter Morisi -- are the same people who thought the sky was falling when Pathmark was being built ("The Biggest Little Stories of 1997: The Showdown at Brooklyn Junction," Dec. 28). Pathmark is here, and the world didn't come to an end. But it did bring a better day for those elderly who found reasonably priced quality goods within walking distance. It opened up jobs for many others who formerly spent their day at the unemployment office. 
 The proposed site for the Brooklyn Junction shopping center is now a deep, weedy canyon where the thundering metal of a railroad echoes on the streets above. The people above are in fact separated from neighbors much like the Berlin Wall in years past. By building this shopping center over the railroad we will unify the community physically as well as strengthen our economic tax base.

Arab Woman's Story Helped Humanize a Group

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Thank you for the article "Trouble in the House" (Jan. 4), about the Palestinian-American woman and the difficulty she is experiencing with her American-born and -raised children. 
 Her struggles echo my parents' struggle when we came here from Egypt in 1970, Christian Egyptians who left to evade religious persecution and pursue a better economic life in the United States; I am one of four daughters and two sons, ranging in age from 18 to 6 years old when we arrived. (I was the youngest daughter, age 7.)
The most delightful thing about the article is the absence of Israeli issues -- that is while the woman was born and raised in Palestine/Israel, her reality was one of academic excellence and being a "good daughter." There is no mention of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The only slight reference is the pendant in the shape of Palestine that she wears along with the Koranic verse against the evil eye.
This article will humanize Arabs and show that we are not all busy concocting bombs and terrorist plots against "the Americans." We are Americans and we have chosen to make our lives here.

HEADLINE: SUPER BOWL XXXII: THE FANS;
A Slice of Life: Cheeseheads Are More Than Cute

BYLINE: By BILL PENNINGTON

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Jan. 24

 BODY:
It is a piece of foam weighing three quarters of a pound, but don't think for a Super Bowl second that the Cheesehead is just something silly to wear.
The Packers fans beneath those yellow wedge-shaped emblems have become the very embodiment of the team itself. Green Bay's players relate to the Cheeseheads, not the other way around. 
 "I don't play for the Cheeseheads," said Packers safety Eugene Robinson. "I feel like we all play the game together. I run into those people in the grocery store during the week and it's like running into somebody else on the team. Those people are with us. They're up when we're up, down when we're down, nervous about a game when we're nervous about a game. I'm proud of those people.
"A big part of playing for the Packers is accepting the Cheeseheads and being accepted by them."
Said Packers Coach Mike Holmgren: "Other areas are maybe too big or too diverse to have a situation and a fan base like ours. The team is the bond of the community, and somehow, as players and coaches for the Packers, you come to feel a part of that community and feel a responsibility to it.
"Our players feel our fans' loyalty, and it makes them loyal to the fans."
Like the Cheeseheads, the Packers like to think of themselves as throwbacks, as homespun, as a team true to its roots.
"In a small town, people care about each other -- they have to or the town doesn't survive," said Packers quarterback Brett Favre, who grew up in Kiln, Miss. "And that's the way it is in Green Bay: a small city where people care about each other. We live there, and you know, we become a team like them, watching out for each other.
"We've got a team that doesn't really operate on a star system. I get a lot of the attention because I'm the quarterback, but what makes us win? We pick each other up. Our starting running back, Edgar Bennett, gets hurt in the preseason and Dorsey Levens steps in and has a great year.
"That's the kind of team we are."
The Packers see themselves as a dedicated bunch of hard-working traditionalists, which may just be a byproduct of living and working in Wisconsin. It is a state that aggressively took on welfare reform even though the state unemployment rate is just 3.4 percent.
The Cheeseheads like to cast themselves as simple, unsophisticated folk, but Wisconsin's state university system is considered among the best in the nation. The median household income in Green Bay is $31,437, significantly higher than the median household income in Denver, which is $27,453.
The Packers are publicly owned, though not run and operated by as many small investors as team mythology would have you believe. The Packers are big business now. Last year, they passed the Dallas Cowboys as the top seller of official team merchandise in the National Football League. The Cowboys had held that spot since 1992, but it hardly seems fair to call Dallas America's Team anymore.
As portrayed in a television commercial, the departure from the community of Packers season-ticket holders is big news. But it does not cause fans to queue up outside the ultimate Packers shrine, Lambeau Field, because the Packers' season-ticket waiting list is about 40,000 names long. The team estimates that on average five to seven season tickets become available each off season.
Do the math: at that rate, some people will not be getting their season tickets until the year 8000.
But if Packers fans cannot get tickets, they can pick up a Cheesehead for about $15 almost anywhere in the state. Formation, Inc., the Wisconsin company that makes these ungainly signs of Packers fans' devotion, has a staff of 25 producing the head coverings year-round.
"Sure I have one," Favre said of the Cheeseheads. "I must have 20 of them."
Said Eugene Robinson, "Of course I have one."
Added tight end Mark Chmura: "We all have one. We are one."

HEADLINE: The State of the Presidency

 BODY:
This normally festive and frivolous Super Bowl Sunday is a somber time for America. This newspaper reported yesterday that Monica Lewinsky has offered in immunity bargaining to testify that she had sex with the President. By other accounts, physical evidence of intimate contact may exist. When the Cabinet and top White House aides try to defend Mr. Clinton, they speak of what they hope and believe, not what they know. Those hopes have been strengthened by lawyers' assertions that Ms. Lewinsky is so far refusing to testify that Mr. Clinton and his friend Vernon Jordan urged her to lie. The White House has also hinted that Mr. Clinton may eventually produce a mitigating explanation for any contact he may have had with Ms. Lewinsky.
For all that, it is, at best, a mess. Moreover the mess goes beyond Mr. Clinton's habitual failure to manage his personal life so as to produce admiration rather than dismay. Two days from now, the holder of the world's most important elective office will step into the House chamber to deliver the State of the Union address. Traditionally, this is the moment when Presidents summon the nation to new goals. But in the second year of this term, the nation's immediate concern must be the state of the Presidency. 
 The optimistic citizen can pray for Mr. Clinton to break free of the entangling advice of his lawyers and embrace the central Presidential task of shaping the nation's political climate. If the allegations of low and possibly illegal behavior prove to be unsupported by solid evidence, comparisons with Watergate will quickly dissipate. But in these initial days of turmoil in Washington, there is a need to understand the difficulties and dangers of crisis-bound governance. The great danger is that domestic policy can be paralyzed or, more dangerously, crucial foreign policy actions distorted by a President's need to show control or by the anxieties of allies or adversaries.
At this moment, for example, the era of budget deficits is giving way to a new debate about how to distribute surplus revenues. The Republicans will be pushing a variety of tax cuts, many regressive and unsound. Without a powerful stand from a Democratic White House, it is hard to imagine another agenda gaining ground that would stress investment in education and infrastructure. Almost by reflex, Americans worry that embattled Presidents may be tempted into foreign adventures. There is also a danger that reckless nations will test American resolve, convinced that Mr. Clinton is weakened and distracted.
Despite the turbulence in Washington last week, Mr. Clinton managed to nudge the Middle East peace effort forward. But if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, come to doubt Mr. Clinton's political endurance, they are unlikely to close a deal that depends on American brokering.
Iraq, of course, is the most urgent issue, and the one that could be most easily misplayed. Saddam Hussein has now rebuffed a United Nations Security Council demand for unfettered inspection of sites that may contain chemical or biological weapons. He demands a freeze on inspections, followed in the spring by the lifting of economic sanctions.
That position is unacceptable and should be rejected by the Security Council. If defiance then continues, deciding on an American response is an exercise that must be insulated from the pressures now bearing down on Mr. Clinton. That requires Mr. Clinton to calm this political hurricane by explaining his assertions that nothing happened in regard to a sexual liaison or subornation of perjury.
The American system of government is a wonder of carefully balanced, complementary parts, but there is no substitute for the stabilizing weight of effective Presidential leadership. Without it, Washington wobbles and international relations become tentative. A worried nation is waiting to see what steps President Clinton takes toward a steadier balance.

HEADLINE: A West African Border With Back-to-Back Wars

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: BO WATERSIDE, Liberia

 BODY:
Just visible at the far side of the bridge that links this Liberian town with Sierra Leone, the region's newest militia can be seen patrolling recently conquered territory.
The Nigerian soldiers who guard this sleepy border town are ostensibly peacekeepers in a regional effort to end years of fighting in Liberia. But under cover of nightfall they have reportedly undertaken another mission, arming and training the fighters across the bridge for what is shaping up as this devastated corner of Africa's latest civil war. 
 The militia members, traditional hunters of the Mende ethnic group known as the Kamajors, say they are fighting to restore Sierra Leone's only democratically elected President, Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, who was overthrown in a military coup in May and who monitors events in his country from exile in nearby Guinea.
Since the coup that forced Mr. Kabbah from Sierra Leone, Nigeria has tried one thing after another to return him to power: a naval blockade; aerial bombardments of military bases, and enforcement of an international isolation so complete that not even foreign mail arrives in the country anymore.
But the military leaders in Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown, shrugged off even pressures like these. So, diplomats say, Nigeria seems to have decided the only course is to back ethnic allies of the deposed President in a military campaign.
In less than 10 years, wave after wave of just this type of militia warfare has taken Liberia and Sierra Leone from the relative comfort of concrete houses and electricity back to straw huts and storm lanterns.
In both countries' capitals, even the downtown streets go unlit at night, so badly have basic utilities like power grids been damaged by the years of war. And through the countryside, the roads that remain passable cut through an endless succession of abandoned, bullet-strafed villages.
The instability that has made this one of Africa's most strife-ridden regions is fed by a complex shadow play of intrigue. Foreign diplomats, Sierra Leoneans and Liberians say that countries both near and far are competing for influence here, and for a rich slice of the region's readily exploitable natural resources.
Over the years, the jumble of players here has included Western powers like the United States and France, as well as Libya, Taiwan, South Africa, ragtag national armies and a multitude of warring militias.
But at the center of the action, almost from the start, has stood the region's one true power, Nigeria. Depending upon who is speaking, that nation is viewed as either the only serious force for stability or a mischievous and determined plunderer of weaker states.
For many experts, the key to the recent history of Sierra Leone and Liberia lies in Nigeria's push to extend its political and economic influence along the West African coast. At virtually every step of the way, these analysts say, France has maneuvered to keep the Nigerian giant in check. The French motivation: eagerness to retain a hold on heavily dependent former colonies.
"It is a West African version of the Great Game," said one African diplomat, referring to the secret 19th century British-Russian struggle for mastery of Central Asia. "They have almost never gone at it directly," added the diplomat, who has spent his career watching Nigeria and France compete for influence in the region. "So it goes unnoticed most of the time. But both countries see the stakes as very high."
International rivalries have existed in the area since colonial times. But they accelerated sharply in 1989, when Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso, reportedly with French encouragement, helped Charles G. Taylor launch an invasion of Liberia to topple the United States-backed Government of Samuel K. Doe.
With the United States evacuating its citizens from Liberia because of the intensifying violence, Nigeria, whose military Government had strong business ties with Mr. Doe, rallied several other West African nations behind a regional military intervention. The action relied heavily at first on Nigerian jets and gunboats to stop Mr. Taylor's advance.
Mr. Taylor, furious to see his offensive foiled, then began arming a guerrilla movement, the Revolutionary United Front, to punish Sierra Leone for joining the Nigerian drive against him.
Sierra Leone's Government initially relied on Nigerian help for its defense, ceding control of several diamond-rich mining zones to the Nigerians in return. But the rebels steadily gained ground, so Sierra Leone turned to South African mercenaries for help. This left Nigeria doing little more than guarding the airport in Freetown.
For years the situation festered, with the Liberian stalemate producing some of the bloodiest warfare in Africa and the Revolutionary United Front waging a campaign of terror in Sierra Leone.
Nigeria and Mr. Taylor appeared to reach a tenuous reconciliation shortly after his third disastrous attempt to storm the Liberian capital, Monrovia, in April 1996. They continued to work well enough together for Liberia to pull off surprisingly free national elections last July, which Mr. Taylor won in a landslide.
But Mr. Taylor wasted little time in seeking the departure of the Nigerian-led peacekeepers who had frustrated his war efforts. He has also been criticizing Nigerian-led efforts -- a combination of sanctions and force -- to bring down the Sierra Leonean junta.
"It was never clear how the marriage between Nigeria and Taylor could continue to work," said one international relief official who has spent most of the decade in Liberia. "Nigeria clearly wants to dominate this region, starting with Liberia. And Taylor wants as much power for himself in this region as he can get."
Diplomats in Liberia say Mr. Taylor may be betting that by opposing Nigeria's efforts to restore the elected Government in Sierra Leone he can extend his influence there. The Sierra Leonean military junta has now joined forces with the Revolutionary United Front's rebellion, the one that Mr. Taylor once helped arm.
"A lot of people think that Taylor is in league with the Revolutionary United Front, and perhaps in bed with Libya," a Western diplomat said. "What appears clear is that he is rocking the boat already and wants to make any Sierra Leone peace deal fall through and keep the R.U.F. in power."
The payoff is potentially great for Mr. Taylor, who continues to enjoy the diplomatic support of France's closest allies in the region. But many say the price of failure could be equally high for Liberia, which is just emerging from its prolonged war.
When Nigerian troops begin leaving Liberia in the thousands, as expected next month, it will be left without a properly trained national army. Mr. Taylor's enemies -- or for that matter Nigeria, in its struggle to consolidate a foothold in Sierra Leone -- could easily use neighboring territory to attack Liberia.
"One doesn't see any easy way out of this cycle of building up external alliances and using them to undermine your neighbor," a West African diplomat said. "Perhaps when all of your fingers have been burned you learn to stop playing with fire."

HEADLINE: A South Korean's Rise to Free Market Evangelist

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea

 BODY:
It was a long journey for You Jong Keun from the dirt-floor hut where he grew up in a Korean mountain village to his office as an economics professor at Rutgers University.
But Mr. You's return voyage, since he gave up his American citizenship and went back to South Korea in 1994, has perhaps spanned an even greater distance. He has gone from teaching in a classroom to trying to rescue the South Korean economy. 
 Mr. You, 53, is chief economic adviser to Kim Dae Jung, South Korea's President-elect, and his presence in Mr. Kim's inner circle has been enormously reassuring to foreign bankers and Western officials. A fervent evangelist for free markets and foreign investment, Mr. You insists that South Korea must open itself up to the world not just because the International Monetary Fund says so, but because that is the only way for the nation to thrive.
"Toward the end of the 19th century, our ancestors tried to isolate ourselves, and the consequences were ruinous," he said, referring to Korea's refusal to open up, enabling a modernizing Japan to force itself on Korea and colonize it.
When Mr. Kim was elected in December, the stock market plunged on concern that he was a populist who would pander to labor unions. Some experts worried that Mr. Kim would tackle South Korea's economic crisis with first-rate loyalists and third-rate economists.
But Mr. Kim has in fact surrounded himself with a core of advisers who, like Mr. You, are widely respected and in many cases trained in America. Since the election, following the advice of Mr. You and the others, Mr. Kim has repeatedly emphasized the need for mass layoffs and other painful steps, and the stock market is rising again.
"I think people should rest assured that Kim Dae Jung is totally committed to a free market economy," Mr. You said. During the campaign, Mr. Kim got some "bad advice," Mr. You said, and Mr. You is credited with helping to persuade Mr. Kim to make tough pronouncements about the need for far-reaching restructuring.
Mr. You's own credentials as a fan of markets are clear, for he is also the elected Governor of North Cholla Province, one of the poorest and most backward regions of the country. If his efforts there are any indication of how South Korea may develop in the coming years, the nation is in for a tumultuous shake-up and an ardent welcome to foreign investment.
"At the time of his inauguration, everyone thought that he had almost no chance of fulfilling his dream of getting foreign investment," said Cho Sang Jin, a newspaper editor in North Cholla. "But now, because of his wide contacts through his years in the U.S.A., he is accomplishing a lot of his objectives."
North Cholla's exports are increasing faster by far than those of any other province in the country, and foreign tourism has tripled since Mr. You took office. One of those foreign visitors was Michael Jackson, the singer, whom Mr. You is wooing to invest in a resort and entertainment park in North Cholla.
In 25 years in the United States, Mr. You picked up not just contacts, but also a direct style that has antagonized some Koreans. And leftists criticize him as a traitor for his calls for layoffs and foreign investment.
Koh Sung Jae, president of the student council at Chonbuk University in North Cholla, accused Mr. You of giving away too many concessions to lure foreign investors.
"We don't approve of restructuring Korean businesses to the point where we have to cut out our livers and hand them over to foreign businesses," Mr. Koh said.
Mr. You's policies are striking because South Korea remains wary of foreign investment. A poll last year indicated that only 4 percent of Koreans thought that foreigners should definitely be allowed to own small shops or restaurants, and even fewer approved of allowing foreigners to own land or large factories.
"Two of the messages I have been trying to tell people are that layoffs are essential and that there is no nationality of capital," said Mr. You, who acknowledged that he still sees himself as an educator, just with a larger classroom. "When I took office as Governor, I tried my best to make myself available for special lectures, telling people that we have to open up our markets, we have to open up to foreign investment."
Mr. You's odyssey began in a tiny mountain village where his father farmed in North Cholla. The village, of thatched-roof shacks with dirt floors, has since been abandoned because it is far from any road.
His father, who attended school up to the sixth grade, had the passionate belief in education that is common in South Korea, and he saw to it that Mr. You worked hard in school and eventually made it to university in Seoul. From there Mr. You went off to the State University of New York in Binghamton in 1970, to earn his doctorate in economics.
Mr. You taught at Rutgers and worked for a decade as an economist in the New Jersey Governor's office, writing a book about the regional economy. He married and raised a family and might have stayed in America if he had not gotten a phone call from his mother in 1978. She told him that his younger brother, a democracy campaigner, had been arrested by the dictatorship.
That led Mr. You to become active in the Korean democracy movement, and he became still more involved when Mr. Kim -- who is from South Cholla -- was sentenced to death by the Korean Government in 1980. In what turned out to be an excellent career move, Mr. You formed a "Save Kim Dae Jung" campaign in New Jersey.
Ultimately, Mr. Kim was spared and exiled to America in 1982, and the two men met and became close. After democracy returned to South Korea beginning in 1987, Mr. You became increasingly restless to return.
He made longer and longer visits to his homeland, and by his own account he neglected his family. His American wife was horrified by the idea of moving to Korea, and they divorced in 1992.
"I was not a very good husband -- not a very good father," Mr. You recalled. "I feel very badly about that."
Remarried to a Korean woman, Mr. You renounced his American citizenship and returned to South Korea in 1994. A year later, he ran for Governor of North Cholla.
In the end, helped by his relationship with Mr. Kim, Mr. You won by a whisker. To bring in fresh blood, Mr. You put help-wanted ads in Korean-language newspapers in the United States and recruited young scholars with fresh American Ph.D's.
Mr. You and his team have begun a dazzling series of economic projects in the province, often locking horns with the central Government in Seoul -- which responded last year by starting a corruption investigation into Mr. You's affairs. But there was never any evidence of wrongdoing, and Mr. You has become so popular in North Cholla that there were howls of protest that forced Seoul to back off.
"Governor You is a unique person," said Song Yong Nam, an economics professor in North Cholla. "He is full of ideas that no one else had thought of."

HEADLINE: BASKETBALL: NOTEBOOK;
Westphal, Coach Out of Style

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE

 BODY:
When Paul Westphal was interviewed for the Dallas Mavericks' head coaching job two seasons ago, he made sure he told the new owner, Ross Perot Jr., about a skeleton in his closet. He said he was friends with Rush Limbaugh, the political commentator who goes harder to his right than Michael Jordan and often had fun at Ross Perot Sr.'s expense.
"Rush called his dad a hand grenade with a bad haircut," Westphal said, laughing. "He thought it was funny. I started to wonder if my friendship has hurt me, but that's ridiculous. I'm no political activist. Really, I don't know what the rap on me is." 
 In the emerging era of the National Basketball Association disciplinarian, the greatest rap on the 47-year-old Westphal may be simply that he treats his players like people. For reasons far beyond his politics, Westphal did not get the Dallas job. He has been in the running for other jobs, but he has yet to reappear in the league more than two years after he was relieved of his coaching duties with the Phoenix Suns.
As impressionable owners keep getting wooed by high-strung coaches who promise to turn their franchises around in less than two seasons, some of the best offensive minds in the business -- not to mention some of the best people in the business -- continue to wait for a phone call.
Westphal, K. C. Jones, who is coaching an American Basketball League team. Rick Adelman, fired last season by the Golden State Warriors and replaced by P. J. Carlesimo.
"A lot of jobs, I didn't want to get my brains beat out," Westphal said, adding that he has not been interested in every opening. "They were pretty much doomed not to be good jobs for a long time. I wanted to be in a position where I at least have a chance. My feeling is, if you're asked to build, you better be able to hang around and see the end of the construction."
Employing a wide-open scheme that relied on spacing and ball movement, Westphal led the Suns to a 62-20 record in the 1992-93 season, which culminated with a six-game loss to the Chicago Bulls in the finals. The next two seasons Phoenix went 56-26 and 59-23. The Suns, who endured 26 lineup changes and had players miss a combined 296 games to injury or illness the following season, were 14-19 when Westphal was replaced by Cotton Fitzsimmons in January 1996. His record: 191-88, a .685 winning percentage.
"Whatever it is, maybe somebody will look at the numbers and see we lost to the champions and two seven-game series to Houston the next two seasons," Westphal said. "Maybe somebody will look at the record, and say, 'He didn't mess them up too bad.' "
Like most unemployed coaches, Westphal has had time to spend with his family. He coached his son's high school team last year in Phoenix and has been able to travel abroad and visit old friends. Like a lot of unemployed coaches, he would also like to return to the N.B.A.
"Maybe we're just caught in a cycle where everyone wants that one consistent voice that has authority," he said. "I think Larry Bird is proving you can be reasonable and successful. You don't have to be some out-of-control, angry guy. But those kind of things go in cycles."
Westphal recalls the night in 1996 that he and Don Nelson, then the Knicks' coach, had dinner with Limbaugh in New York. Less than two months later, both he and Nelson lost their jobs. Nelson eventually wound up as the general manager in Dallas, with the blessing of Ross Perot Jr., and replaced Jim Cleamons as coach this season.
Said Westphal, "I told Rush he ought to invite some more of these visiting coaches in and open up some jobs in the N.B.A."
 
A Finely Focused Defense
 P. J. Carlesimo's coaching tactics may eventually come under scrutiny, but it appears the N.B.A. Players Association plans to take the high road in its defense of Latrell Sprewell this week in Portland, Ore. At issue are Sprewell's one-year suspension by the league and the termination of his contract by the Warriors.
Rather than trot out a plethora of Carlesimo's former and current players at the hearing solely to attack the coach's methods, the defense may focus on issues of due process and constitutionality under the collective bargaining agreement between the players and owners.
Johnnie Cochran sat at the same table as Sprewell during his December news conference after he was suspended by the league and his contract was terminated for choking and punching Carlesimo in a practice. But the prominent defense attorney will not be a part of Sprewell's defense team when the hearing begins on Tuesday.
The Players Association and the league are expected to hold a three-way conference call over the weekend with John D. Feerick, the Dean of Fordham University School of Law who will serve as the arbitrator. In keeping with most arbitration procedures, Feerick is expected to close the hearing to all news media.
 
Losing and Losing and . . .
 On their way to N.B.A. infamy, the Denver Nuggets had a chance to tie the longest losing streak in league history -- 24 games -- against the Los Angeles Clippers last night at the L.A. Sports Arena.
Whether the Nuggets break that record may be immaterial. As it stands, they have a better chance to finish with the league's worst record ever -- the 1972-73 Philadelphia 76ers finished 9-73 -- than any team over the last 25 years.
 
Shimmying and Head-Shaking
 Larry Bird might have been one of the league's more intimidating trash talkers during his heyday, often whispering to his defender how and when he would score on him. But as a coach, he has a hard time understanding why Mark Jackson has to shimmy and shake his body for all the world to see after a big play. And why Reggie Miller must talk to the opposing bench and point fingers.
Realizing his stars need to express themselves, however, Bird is coping.
"He says he loves that as much as anybody, he can appreciate it, that he has a little kid in him that wants to do the dance also," Jackson said. "But at the same time, it's going to spark somebody, it's going to get people angry and give them a reason to want to come at us even harder the next time we face him.
"We understand his point. But that's part of me and Reggie. And if you take that away, I don't know if I'm the same player and I know that we're not the same team."
Bird said: "I don't like it, but I really do feel it can wake teams up. I just wish they'd wait till the game was over to celebrate."

HEADLINE: U.S. LISTS OPTIONS ON USE OF FORCE IN IRAQ STANDOFF

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24

 BODY:
President Clinton's top foreign policy advisers met today to weigh military and political strategies against Iraq, among them a sustained attack on suspected biological and chemical weapons sites that Saddam Hussein has hidden from United Nations inspectors, White House officials said.
"There'll be one final round of diplomacy, and then an ultimatum, and then we act," a National Security Council official said. 
 White House officials said a countdown to a military strike could begin as soon as Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of fasting, ends on Friday. A senior Administration official said of the prospect of military action, "We're focused more on weeks than months or days."
Members of Mr. Clinton's national security team briefed the President later today on their discussion.
The participants in the meeting included Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright; Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen; the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger; the Director of Central Intelligence, George Tenet, and the chief delegate to the United Nations, Bill Richardson. They left the White House without deciding on their ultimate course, an Administration spokesman said.
The White House meeting came as a consensus emerged in the President's national security staff that Iraq would never comply with the United Nations inspectors, and that smart bombs and cruise missiles may be needed to destroy President Hussein's hidden potential to build crude weapons of mass destruction.
With the White House enveloped in a miasma of sexual and legal scandals, Administration officials said they were painfully aware that they might be accused of using an attack on Iraq as a diversion to sustain political and popular support for an embattled President. But they took pains to point out that the military plans they are weighing were drawn up two months ago, in November, during the last standoff with Iraq over the United Nations inspections.
The Administration plans to devote next week to convincing skeptical American allies and members of Congress that military action is the only way to stop Iraq from building a biological and chemical arsenal.
"We have never put the question directly: 'We're going in. Are you with us or not?' " the National Security Council official said.
So far, only Britain is clearly supporting a hard line. Seven years after it came together to drive the Iraqi Army out of Kuwait, the international coalition that fought the Persian Gulf war under the United Nations banner has splintered.
Two United States battle groups in the gulf -- including warships, fighter jets, hundreds of cruise missiles and precision-guided bombs -- will soon be joined by a British battle group. Together they will form the largest military deployment in the region since the gulf war.
But no other allies are likely to join. Washington is in a poor position to rebuild the worldwide coalition that it assembled to fight Iraq in 1991. The United States has been politically weakened at the United Nations by its failure to pay its dues, and Russia, France, China and some Arab allies are unlikely to openly support a military attack on Iraq.
Nonetheless, the momentum propelling the United States toward bombing Iraq appears inexorable.
Iraq continues to defy the United Nations inspectors who are charged with identifying and helping to eliminate Baghdad's ability to build nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. A senior United Nations official, Richard Spertzel, said on Friday that there was "tantalizing information" that Iraq is operating a secret biological weapons plant despite United Nations inspections and in defiance of an international ban.
The chief of the inspection team, Richard Butler, told the Security Council on Friday that Iraq was continuing to mislead the inspectors.
Diplomacy, jawboning and continuing economic sanctions have not moved President Hussein.
Mr. Clinton warned on Wednesday that diplomacy might be approaching a dead end. "Something is going to have to give here," he said. Administration officials strongly suggested that after going an extra mile down this diplomatic route in the coming week, military action might lie at the end of the road.
The military plans drawn up in November were originally aimed at compelling Baghdad to comply with United Nations' attempts to rid Iraq of its ability to build weapons of mass destruction. But diplomacy and threats have failed to persuade President Hussein to cooperate.
Now a crucial question for the United States is whether Washington can or should destroy his suspected weapons plants with bombs and missiles -- and whether force will change his behavior, a strategy that has not worked well in the past.
The commander of United States forces in the Persian Gulf, Gen. Anthony Zinni of the Marines, said two months ago that if called to battle, he would attack "the things that mean most to Saddam."
The general defined those targets as the forces that "enable him to inflict the kind of pain he does on his own people and on others in the region." He said those forces include the "Republican Guard units that keep him in power, his own infrastructure and command and control systems," and his ability to build and use biological and chemical weapons. That ability is thought to be concealed in dozens of sites, including presidential palaces.
"The intent is to deny him the capability to continue to threaten his neighbors and his own people and to threaten the world with his capability," General Zinni said.
Three new teams of United Nations technical experts are scheduled to begin a series of meetings in Baghdad on Feb. 1 to weigh Iraq's compliance on missile warhead, germ warfare and chemical weapons issues. The meetings are expected to continue throughout February; it is unclear whether the United States can attack while the teams meet in the Iraqi capital.
A United States attack on Iraq, Administration officials said, will create more questions: whether to forbid Iraq from flying any planes within its borders and whether to force Iraq to open the suspected weapons sites -- assuming such sites are still standing after what may become the biggest bombing campaign against Iraq since the war.

HEADLINE: When the Credit Bubble Bursts

BYLINE: By BILL KENT

 BODY:
FOR eight Federal court judges, 150 staff members and 700 bankruptcy lawyers, February used to be the calm before the storm of New Jersey bankruptcy filings.
"We had grown accustomed to a little breathing space during the winter," said William Gindin, chief judge of the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Trenton. 
 That's no longer the way it is. Around New Jersey, asaround the country, more people are going broke, and they are doing it year round, not just in March, April and May, traditionally the busiest time for bankruptcy activity. About four years ago, Judge Gindin noticed a change in the number of cases on his docket. "They started to pick up," he said. "And up. And up. There are no more seasonal lulls. There are no more breathing spaces. It's become rather frightening."
What's to blame? Various fingers have been pointed at too easily available credit, legal loopholes, profligate spending, corporate downsizing, expensive divorces, inadequate insurance coverage, New Jersey's gambling industry and a desire to avoid responsibility.
In any case, bankruptcy, while it may run counter to old-fashioned middle-class values, remains a cherished, constitutionally protected right. America's Founding Fathers, in an effort to do away with the debtors' prisons that doomed so many British citizens, provided protection for debtors in the form of Federal bankruptcy laws. The laws were designed to guard the debtor's liberty and a few essential assets, as well as to provide a manner in which debts could be scheduled for repayment, reduction or elimination.
By all available evidence, debtors are not shy about seeking the laws' protection. New Jersey's bankruptcy courts are averaging 800 filings each week, with a total of 50,000 anticipated in 1998. Of the 1.4 million bankruptcies in the United States last year (an increase of 23 percent from 1996), 42,672 were filed in New Jersey. The state currently ranks 20th in the nation for bankruptcies. (Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama and Nevada rank No. 1, 2, 3 and 4.)
"It's become a growth industry for lawyers, though not an especially lucrative one," said Judge Gindin, who sets the fees that New Jersey bankruptcy lawyers charge for their services. "The money is in the Chapter 11's, the business bankruptcies, which have decreased considerably since 1992. There isn't as much to be made in the consumer bankruptcies, the Chapter 7's and 13's, but the filings have increased to an alarming extent."
So alarming have these increases been that the banking industry is using them to urge the passage of two bills in Congress, HR-2500 in the House of Representatives, and S-1301 in the Senate, designed to make it more difficult for bankruptcy filers to eliminate debt.
"I think those bills, if passed, will turn the tide," said Kenneth Crone, an executive with VISA USA, America's largest credit card company. "The bank card industry lost $15 billion because of bankruptcies in 1997. The laws are flawed."
Mr. Crone attributed his industry's losses to a 1979 revision in the Federal bankruptcy law that permits bankrupt individuals and married couples to eliminate most, if not all, unsecured debt. That means they can write off money owed to credit card companies, gambling casinos, hospitals, retailers and contractors, as well as debts resulting from court judgments, while retaining as much as $30,000 in home equity, an automobile and retirement savings plans. Payments for secured loans, such as mortgages, home equity loans, automobile loans and, since 1994, student loans, can be revised to lower a debtor's monthly burden.
Judge Gindin disagrees. "My view has always been that bankruptcy is driven by the availability of credit. In the case of consumer bankruptcy, the relationship is direct. Expansions in the availability of credit are reflected 18 months after those bankruptcies."
Traditionally, those who filed for bankruptcy protection could not obtain credit for as long as 10 years from banks and other lending institutions. Not any more, said James Waldron, clerk of the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Newark.
Beginning in 1993, at the end of the national recession when bankruptcies went down in the state by 5 percent, Mr. Waldron's office was increasingly pestered by finance companies for lists of recent bankruptcy filers -- not because they wanted to avoid them as potential customers but because they wanted to solicit their business.
"There are more of them calling now than we've ever had," Mr. Waldron said. "They want the names and addresses so they can hit these people up for new loans."
 
Where Problems Start
A report released last November by S.M.R. Corporation of Hackettstown linked an aspect the state's bankruptcy boom to its gambling industry. Atlantic County, where casinos thrive, had "a 1996 filing rate 18 percent higher than filings in counties with no gambling," the report said.
Nona Ostrove, an Atlantic City bankruptcy lawyer whose office is one block from the Sands Casino (which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier this month), disputed this finding.
"I see some people come through that have gambling problems," Ms. Ostrove said, "but is it the main reason? No. The main reason is still credit cards, followed by a lost job, medical bills or a divorce."
Indeed, the numbers of bankruptcies filed in 1997 show Atlantic County, with 2,209, about average in the state. Neighboring Camden County, with its Garden State Race Track, had the most filings, at 4,021. Salem County, whose residents are closer to slot machine gambling at Delaware's Dover Downs Race Track than they are to Atlantic City's casinos, had 426 filings, the lowest in the state.
Still, the availability of gambling of any kind -- lotteries, simulcasting, casinos, even bingo, can be devastating for the growing number of people with compulsive disorders and problems with substance abuse.
"People who have had a history of drug or alcohol abuse have a tendency to become compulsive gamblers," said Roberta Crotts, an alcohol and drug counselor with the Raritan Bay Medical Center in Perth Amboy. "It can lead to bankruptcy because these people have great difficulty managing their money. It's not a matter of knowing when to quit -- they simply can't quit until it's too late."
Samuel J. Gerdano, executive director of the American Bankuptcy Institute, a Virginia-based national bankruptcy-industry tracking organization, said gambling is probably a factor contributing to the increase in bankruptcy. "But gambling hasn't shown up in the survey data," he said. "As a rule, gaming institutions don't show up as creditors."
Mr. Gerdano doesn't think the new bills before Congress "will make even a small dent in the number of filers, because the underlying cause is still an economic one. People declare bankruptcy because of debt. How they accumulated that debt is different for every situation, every household. Even though the bank card industry sent out 2.5 billion credit card solicitations in 1997, there are still cases in which credit card debt is not a factor. There is certainly some fraud going on; some people are exploiting the law to run away from their creditors. But a change of the law would not affect individual balance sheets. You could make bankruptcy less available to people, but it doesn't mean that creditors would be paid more. The fact is that the majority of people and businesses that file for bankruptcy are doing this as a last resort."
According to Robert Wood, a Manasquan lawyer who, as a bankruptcy trustee, supervises debt payment for Chapter 13 filers, paints this picture of those who file for bankruptcy:
"It's everybody and anybody. Most of them tend to be middle class, with at least one spouse employed, with a house with $100,000 in equity, a car loan or two, and a pile of bills they just can't pay. Some may be temporarily relieved that filing stops their creditors from harassing them, but they are well aware, by the time I see them as a trustee, that the process is designed to get the debts paid, to the penny, if possible. Bankruptcy is not a free ride. Nobody who is bankrupt is having any fun."
The major difficulty with the current Federal bankruptcy laws, Mr. Wood said, is that people need money to go bankrupt. "I don't see many of the poorer people because you need a few hundred dollars for the bankruptcy filing fees and they don't even have that," he said. "Even with more lawyers doing pro bono work in the bankruptcy field, the law doesn't reach many of those it's supposed to help."
Equally troubling, Mr. Wood said, is the fact that debtors who might otherwise be able to avoid bankruptcy fall prey to unscrupulous finance companies that consolidate debts into high-interest home equity loans that end up depleting what little savings the debtors have. Some debtors also become entangled with so-called bankruptcy mills that entice them to file for bankruptcy by making misleading claims about what the law provides.
 
An Alternative to Court
The burden of educating debtors about bankruptcy -- before they file -- has fallen on a handful of consumer credit counseling services operating within the state.
John Scott, a spokesman for the Maryland-based National Foundation for Consumer Credit, which represents the majority of the 1,400 nonprofit credit counseling services currently operating in the United States, estimated that two million Americans sought some kind of credit counseling in 1997. More than half of them managed to stay out of bankruptcy.
"Of course," Mr. Scott added, "We only hear about our successes. The failures don't come back."
Among the successes is Tracy Rosenthal of Neptune who in 1994 was referred to the consumer credit counseling division of Family and Children's Services of Oakhurst in 1994. Burdened with "enough debt to put a healthy down payment on a house" accumulated from the use of 10 credit cards, Ms. Rosenthal said she didn't want to declare bankruptcy "because I didn't think it was right. I didn't believe in it then and I don't now."
Ms. Rosenthal did consider bankruptcy, however, as an alternative to the calls and letters she was getting from credit card collection agencies. Under Federal law, collection agencies and other creditor representatives must cease such tactics once an individual or household files for bankruptcy protection.
"It got to the point where I just wanted some peace," she said. "One afternoon I got 15 calls in 15 minutes. They just keep at you and they threaten you with taking your house, your clothes, anything. If you get an answering machine, they just tie it up. I told them I wanted to pay my bills, but they would not let up, even after I sent them some money."
As soon as Ms. Rosenthal enrolled in a credit counseling program at Family and Children's Services, her credit counselor contacted her creditors and the harassment stopped. "The collection agencies would not believe me when I said I wanted to pay them what they were owed, but they believed the counselor," she said.
The reason that most, though not all, collection agencies give credence to credit counseling services is that the creditors support them. From 7 to 13 cents of every dollar of debt paid through a credit counseling service goes back to the service. Services also charge their clients monthly fees, ranging from $3 to $50, though these can be waived at the counselor's discretion.
"Creditors know that, with our clients, there is a higher likelihood that they'll get paid," said Carolyn Tarrant, one of four credit counselors employed at Family and Children's Services.
In addition to putting clients on a debt payment schedule, Ms. Tarrant enrolls clients in credit education classes.
"We don't tell them what to do, but we lay out the various choices available to them," she said. "With some creditors, we're successful in reducing the amount of interest our clients owe, so our clients can pay their debts faster."
Some counseling agencies, such as Consumer Credit Counseling Services of New Jersey in Cedar Knolls, can handle problems with secured loans, like mortgages, though most cannot. Nonprofit counseling services cannot halt legal proceedings against their clients, offer legal advice or offer their clients additional loans.
"We don't fix credit," said Sylvine Marabott, counseling director at Consumer Credit Counseling Services of New Jersey. "We give creditors a way to get paid and people a way to stay out of bankruptcy. We also educate our clients about credit and spending so they can understand where their problems came from and how they can stay out of debt in the future."
For Ms. Rosenthal, who expects to be debt free in June, credit counseling "was my salvation. Without these people, I probably would have had to go bankrupt."
She added that she only has one credit card now, "for emergencies." "Anything else," she said. "I pay cash."
Such services "seem to be helping people," said Chief Judge Gindin of the bankruptcy court in Trenton. "If they have, in fact, kept a million people out of bankruptcy, then they must be doing a terrific job. But with the number of filers going up every month, I'm still disturbed, as a judge and a human being, that no one has, to my knowledge, taken a really close, comprehensive look at the social problems that are driving bankruptcy. Until that happens, I'm afraid, the situation will only get worse."
 
Bankruptcy Law: A Debtor's Options
 There are a lot of ways to go bankrupt. Here is how cases fit into the Federal Bankruptcy Code.
 
 CHAPTER 7 -- A debtor's non-exempt assets, if any, are liquidated and proceeds are distributed to creditors. Individual debtors may receive a discharge of their debts. A majority of Chapter 7 cases are "no asset" cases in which there are no assets available for liquidation.
 
CHAPTER 11 -- A business or individual debtor petitions for reorganization. The debtor generally is permitted to continue its operations under court supervision until an initial plan of reorganization is approved by the court. If a plan is not approved, the case is either converted to a Chapter 7 or dismissed.
 
CHAPTER 12 -- Special debt repayment relief is provided for a family farmer whose annual income is sufficiently stable and regular to enable the farmer to make payments to creditors under an approved plan.
 
CHAPTER 13 -- An individual debtor with regular income proposes a plan to pay all or part of his debts over a period of time.

HEADLINE: Whatever Happened to Politics?;
United Shareholders Of America

BYLINE: By Jacob Weisberg; Jacob Weisberg is the chief political correspondent for the on-line magazine Slate.

 BODY:
A political milestone passed without comment last fall when President Clinton was trying unsuccessfully to persuade Congress to renew his fast-track trade-negotiating authority. "If it passes," the President told reporters, "I think it will have a very positive impact on the stock market here and around the world."
No one present thought this comment especially significant. The Times didn't even quote it the next morning. Yet it speaks to an astonishing transformation. What President has ever made such a blatant appeal to stock owners? Even a Republican like Ronald Reagan would have seen the need to spin advantages for the investing class as conducive to a prosperity that would trickle down to the wage-earning middle class. Much has changed. What Bill Clinton, who is blessed with the political equivalent of sonar, may have sensed is that we have quietly become a society of shareholders. The investing class now includes the middle class. 
 According to an October NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 51 percent of adults say they own stock shares or mutual funds. Among registered voters, shareholders outnumber those not in the market 53 percent to 43 percent. These statistics help to explain not only Clinton's comment but Washington's increasing obsequiousness toward Wall Street in general. For the voting public, the level of the Dow has become a pocketbook issue.
This may be the least appreciated economic, cultural and political development of recent years. Over the last decade and a half, as the Dow has ascended from 800 to 8,000, luring tens of millions of middle-class Americans into the market, we have developed a mass culture of investing, the first to exist anywhere in the world. American democratic capitalism has brought about the democratization of capitalism.
In many obvious ways, this is a positive development. The stock-market boom expresses the health of our economy. For millions of people, the rising Dow means an unanticipated degree of prosperity and bodes well for an earlier and more secure retirement. The mania for investing is also likely to ameliorate the country's chronic shortfall in private savings.
That said, it is nonetheless worth pausing to fret over the distortions that the rising market brings to our political and cultural life. A soaring Dow does not necessarily mean a healthy society. Even as a rising market makes many of us richer, it exacerbates inequality. By setting up speculative riches as an aspiration, it belittles the traditional virtues of industry and thrift. As a nation increasingly obsessed with stock prices, we are on the verge of becoming a society of Silas Marners, one in which too many of us spend too much time in the lonely and unrewarding pursuit of counting our money.
There's a simple explanation for the billions that continue to pour into the market despite the widespread opinion that shares are overvalued. For the American middle class, there is no real alternative to investing in stocks. With inflation running around 2 percent and the yield on money-market accounts and CD's in the range of 5 percent, truly safe investments produce a real yield of only about 3 percent a year. The stock market, meanwhile, offers a long-term historical return in the vicinity of 8 percent and has been generating returns averaging out to 19 percent a year since 1982. The math seems that simple.
But the market is not a simple way to save. To choose among thousands of stocks and mutual funds, you must assess your goals, determine an appropriate level of risk, know something about fund companies and fund managers and comparison-shop for the lowest fees. The problem is not that small investors are unable to handle complications or make prudent decisions. The problem is resource allocation. If you want to avoid getting nest egg on your face, you must spend a great deal of time superintending your investments. What begins as a healthy curiosity and natural self-interest can easily turn into a chore and a preoccupation. Thanks to cable TV and the Internet, it's possible to spend an inordinate amount of time in the mesmerizing but pointless activity of watching your balance ebb and flow.
To make sense of the oscillations, there is the chatter on CNBC, CNN's "Moneyline" and "The Nightly Business Report" on PBS. These programs are ostensibly news, but they report on a strange, alternate reality. In this world, Alan Greenspan runs the country, with occasional meddling from the President and the tax committees of Congress. Cigarette companies are good for you. The Chinese takeover of Hong Kong threatens investor confidence, not free expression. Rising values are always good news.
The din of business noise contributes to a paradox for individual investors. The goal of buying stocks is freedom, as the brokerage ads portraying lone, rugged baby boomers on scenic mountaintops remind us. Investing wisely means comfort, ease and a lack of worry about putting the kids through college. Yet in reality, investing in stocks means constant anxiety. Instead of liberation, rising values mean more money to manage. Time spent watching one's investments is not only time away from slower-paced and more rewarding forms of leisure; it also spoils you for them by doing violence to your attention span.
And once in, it is psychologically almost impossible to get out. Why abandon an investment that has outperformed the market, especially if doing so means paying taxes? An investment that has lagged or fallen may be just about to recoup. One often sells stocks with relief but seldom without a tinge of regret.
This anxiety among Americans about stocks is nothing new. Touring America in the 1880's, the British diplomat and historian James Bryce was struck by the popular passion for stocks and also the "high nervous tension" among stockholders. What is new is that stock angst has become a mass condition.
Business books, which a few years ago dwelled heavily on personal motivation and self-fulfillment, have given way to works promising personal enrichment through enrichment. "The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People" and "What Color Is Your Parachute?" are still selling, but the big business books at the moment are "Don't Worry, Make Money" (message: don't stress -- invest), "The Millionaire Next Door" (message: spend less, invest more) and "Buffettology" (message: Warren Buffett did, you can too). There are dozens more. The successor to the book club as urban cultural phenomenon is the women's investment club, modeled on the Beardstown Ladies of Beardstown, Ill., who published a book about their successful approach to stock picking (message: invest where the parking lots are full).
Among men, casual conversation is now more likely to be about the market and less likely to be about sports. The transition from one topic to the other is seamless. Stock watching offers the statistical pleasures of baseball and football -- the ability to parse information countless clever ways -- along with a competitive element. But instead of being a democratic leveler, investment talk is a solipsistic divider. CNBC now plays instead of ESPN in the locker room of my gym. But the cheering is silent -- there is no community of investors, the way there is of Yankee fans. Market talk is largely a celebration of private success and by implication a boast about one's financial prowess. For this reason, one is always a bit incredulous about the success of others. Lying about how well your investments have done has replaced exaggerating about the size of the fish you caught.
In his 1994 book, "A Piece of the Action," Joseph Nocera compares the way people began talking openly about money in the 1980's to the way sex became a topic in the 1970's. Overnight, the unmentionable became acceptable. But prudery about money has a sounder moral basis than prudery about sex. It grows out of the American ethos of equality, which says that personal worth and net worth aren't related. We judge people by the content of their character, not the size of their Schwab account.
The breakdown of a taboo points to an erosion in the underlying belief. We have lost the preference for money saved or earned over money inherited or won through speculation. The American dream is no longer a middle-class standard of living for all; it's retirement in early middle age for the fortunate.
In pursuit of easy wealth, a certain number of people find themselves playing the market compulsively. As a society, we have always treated dabbling in financial instruments as different from betting on horses. That's because investing serves the useful economic goal of making capital available. But the fact that an unprecedented number of people are now engaged in a socially sanctioned form of gambling may be contributing to the loosening of strictures against the forms that used to be deemed antisocial and immoral.
It is perhaps not coincidental that as the stock market has exploded in recent years, lotteries and legal casinos have proliferated around the country. Like everything else, betting is socially stratified. Shares are for the prosperous, lotteries for the poor and casinos for those in the middle. The more you have to gamble, the better your odds. In a stock market, the dealer's cut is only a small commission or a management fee. With state lotteries, the operators skim as much as 40 precent.
There is enough puritan spirit left in politics that you occasionally still hear a Congressman railing against the vice of gambling. In the case of the market, however, the old prejudices have been not just banished but reversed. Political leaders now tend to defer to the market, behaving as if its continued exponential rise and the health of the country were synonymous.
This seems especially odd when you consider all the aspects of social and political health that the market reads as sickness and vice versa. The Dow typically responds badly to lower unemployment because of the threat of incrementally higher inflation. It frowns at increases in wages because they may squeeze corporate profits. (Rising inequality, on the other hand, does not trouble investors.) In foreign policy, the market prefers avoiding conflict to what may be necessary confrontation; this was reportedly a consideration in the President's recent deliberations over what to do about Iraq.
Inflated stock prices also create their own, gratuitous threats to the economy. Exaggerated valuations create a risk of a sudden collapse, possibly leading to recession. It is just more than a year since Alan Greenspan tried to inject caution into the market with his comment about "irrational exuberance." In the seven months that followed, the Dow rose almost 2,000 points. Before the 554-point "correction" in October, there was some concern about how new investors would react to a substantial drop. By and large, they did not engage in panic selling, having absorbed the wisdom that every dip is merely a buying opportunity in disguise. The market erased the loss in a matter of weeks. At this point, the risk may be less that investors will flee the market at the first sign of trouble than that they won't respond to any signal.
An economy growing at 3 percent a year cannot sustain stock-market gains of 20 percent and 30 percent a year forever. But instead of dampening speculative fervor and unreasonable expectations, Congress is preoccupied with measures to spur stocks further upward. The tax code, which best promotes economic efficiency when it does not favor one type of earnings over another, now strongly tilts toward investors over wage earners. As a result of the 1997 budget bill, stock-market profits are treated far more leniently than income. The basic rate on capital gains is 20 percent versus a top rate of nearly 40 percent on earned income. This creates an incentive to set up tax shelters and engage in other kinds of economically unproductive fiddling. But more troubling than the economic wrongheadedness is the ethical signal that such a differential sends: a dollar gained beats a dollar earned.
Other big favors to the market (seldom cast as such) are in the offing. One consequence, whether intended or otherwise, of most of the ideas about reforming Social Security would be to sustain otherwise unsustainable flows into equities. Under various plans being discussed, the money that must be put aside for the baby boomers' retirement would find its way into the stock market. The pressure to do this comes partly from the securities industry itself and partly from its satisfied customers; the more habituated people become to double-digit returns, the worse a bargain Social Security seems.
One suggestion is that the Government could itself put all or part of the surpluses accumulating in the Social Security trust fund into the stock market. No one has figured out how this would work. The magnitude of the sums invested would mean Government ownership of industry -- socialism through the back door. It's also hard to comprehend how Washington might begin withdrawing those funds in 2013, as it will have to do to support retiring boomers, without sponsoring a crash.
Any form of full or partial privatization would cut against Social Security's mildly redistributive factor, moving it away from a modified safety net and toward a 401(K)-style defined-contribution program. The problem is, once again, inequality. Even as average income has risen in recent years, the difference between those at the top and those at the bottom has grown more pronounced. With half the country in the market, the gap is no longer just between those with incomes going up and those with stagnant incomes. It's between those with a steadily escalating net worth multiplying in the market and those who have little prospect of building any net worth. It makes the separation between haves and have-nots seem more like a division between will-always-haves and won't-ever-haves.
The market creates a powerful argument for ignoring inequality. It does so not just by highlighting the self-interest of the investing majority but also by fostering political values based on the market. At a basic level, Wall Street is drawing the majority of Americans into a very different idea of citizenship and a very different experience of democracy than the one the country has long been familiar with.
There are superficial similarities between political democracy and shareholder democracy. Shareholders elect management to run a company in their interest. If management fails, the majority of owners can vote them out. But a publicly held company is a democracy without any care for equality. Shareholders have voting rights, but they do not all have the same rights. Voting power is proportionate to one's ownership stake. In a corporation, the majority owners owe no special obligation to the minority. To expend resources on the interests of nonshareholders -- by analogy the nation or society as a whole -- would be a breach of fiduciary responsibility.
As Alexander Hamilton noted, economic institutions do teach civic lessons, and the experience of voting one's shares as opposed to voting one's conscience has affected the mind-set and the rhetoric of American politics. Ronald Reagan was the first to pose a challenge to an incumbent President in terms of narrow, personal self-interest. "Are you better off now than you were four years ago?" he asked in 1980, implying that voters should assess management's performance in quantitative terms. The citizen's position in relation to the country is increasingly referred to as an ownership stake -- the view taken by the C.E.O. candidate Ross Perot in 1992. Results overwhelm questions of democratic legitimacy.
There is no longer any real reluctance to accept the need for a professional manager -- the chairman of the Federal Reserve -- to run the economy with only the most attenuated form of accountability, at least when his performance is as good as Greenspan's.
The shareholder-citizen in whose image politics is being remade is not a new player on the American stage. In fact, he is the reincarnation of an old character. The new ideal of the financially autonomous individual, who manages his own investments so as not to be dependent on government, the community or institutions, embodies the eternal American aspiration to individualism and self-sufficiency. Investing man is a successor to the Jeffersonian ideal of the yeoman farmer, whose ability to satisfy his own modest needs was taken as an underpinning of democratic health.
But the contemporary shareholder-citizen is at the same time an impoverished embodiment of that ideal, concentrating on material aspects of independence while largely excluding the experience of community and cultivation of civic virtue. An idea of material sufficiency that might have seemed appropriate just a few years ago has been supplanted by an ever-rising standard of how much is necessary for true happiness. Rather than fostering the kind of democratic citizen who can be trusted to govern, as Jefferson's ideal did, the market ideal of citizenship is about developing the means to withdraw from unsatisfactory common institutions --public schools, the Social Security system, even the need to work. The explicit version of this ideology, libertarianism, has been gaining adherents and credibility in recent years. It is the political philosophy fostered by the stock market.
The citizen-investor serves his fellow citizens badly by his inclination to withdraw from the community. He tends to serve himself badly as well. He does so by focusing his pursuit of happiness on something that very seldom makes people happy in the way they expect it to.
A hundred years ago, during another popular spasm of enthusiasm for investment, a President was more likely to remind the country of this human truth than to indulge its fascination with the market. In his 1893 Fourth of July proclamation, President Grover Cleveland warned the nation to "guard against the sordid struggle for unearned wealth" and to "hold fast to the American idea that work is honorable and economy a virtue." He viewed getting rich in the stock market as a dismal aspiration, not just for America but for Americans.

HEADLINE: Recovery Is Built to Last

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Albany Is Faulted for Not Preparing to Meet Recession" (front page, Jan. 19) overlooks how Gov. George E. Pataki's fiscal policy is designed to strengthen New York's economy in good times or bad, and paints a far darker picture of its recovery than is warranted by the facts. 
 The Governor recognizes that reducing taxes and other costs on business improves New York's competitive position, leads to business investment and increases job opportunities. He has cut taxes by $6 billion a year. By 2001, the tax cuts are scheduled to grow to $11 billion. These reductions have sparked the New York turnaround, with 252,000 new private-sector jobs since the end of 1994 and many more to come.
Income growth on Wall Street has been a major element of the recovery and a fixation in the news media. But the return to prosperity goes beyond Wall Street. According to a recent analysis by Chase Manhattan Bank, wage growth in New York exceeded national growth in 1996 after excluding Manhattan and its high-income industries.

HEADLINE: The Singapore Model

 BODY:

To the Editor:
William Safire (column, Jan. 19) attributes the economic problems in Asia to the "Singapore model." How does he explain the Latin American debt crisis in the 1980's, the collapse of savings and loans in the United States, the bubble economy in Japan or even the Great Crash of 1929? Manias, panics and crashes are an intrinsic part of capitalism. 
 Singapore has so far been spared the serious problems that have afflicted the region. It has healthy foreign reserves and runs a balanced budget. Its banks are sound, the Singapore dollar is stable against a trade-weighted basket of currencies, and confidence has been maintained.
Mr. Safire advises Russia and China not to follow the "Singapore model." These countries will find their own way forward. They are unlikely to be influenced by what Singapore does, or Mr. Safire writes.

Where Are the Elixirs of Yesteryear When We Hurt?

BYLINE: By Greil Marcus 

 BODY:
"Americanitis," trumpeted the advertisement for a 1903 patent medicine made by the Rexall company. Was Americanitis the disease or the cure? There was no way to tell from a first glance at the brightly colored sign, a complex tableau of landscape, people and magic symbols; there was no way to tell after 10 minutes of staring.
It was the most amazing piece of promotion I'd ever seen, not that it was obvious what was really being sold. The ad was gorgeous, ambitious, a labyrinth of seductions and catch phrases, a symphony of pushed buttons, all for a brown bottle promising an unspoiled land, a loving community and eternal life. It was the proclamation of a would-be national icon, something that as a product the nation has long since forgotten, but that as an idea the nation has never left behind. 
 The thing was off in a relatively dim corner in the sort of nostalgia shop one might find in any quaint American tourist town. In this case it was Gail's Oldies and Goodies, an Old-Fashioned Cafe and Ice Cream Parlour, on Main Street in St. Helena, Calif., in the heart of the Napa Valley wine country.
The place was filled with a wonderful collection of metal soft-drink signs from the 1930's and 40's: in thrilling reds and blues, the room glowed with smiles for Hires Root Beer, Donald Duck Orange Juice and, everywhere, for Coca-Cola. From wall to wall, Coke Santa Clauses roared with laughter. One after another, Coke bathing beauties held up the perfect green bottle while languidly stretching their impossibly long legs, legs that on the all-purpose American beach of the ads seemed to reach from Minnesota to New Orleans.
"Don't Grow Old," the Americanitis ad commanded in thick black letters. "We Guarantee Rexall Americanitis Elixir Will Make You Feel Younger."
"This has got to be a joke," I said to the person next to me. "Some snotty modern parody of all the dumb stuff people used to believe."
"It's not a joke," said a woman eating lunch under the sign. "I have a bottle of it at home. A friend who collects antiques gave it to me."
"Does it work?" I asked.
It's hard to know where to begin with the America depicted in the big, broad Americanitis poster. At the top, in the background, there's a spectacular mountain range, the Rockies crowned with a steeplelike peak and covered with snow down to their lowest foothills, which suddenly turn green and smooth, a sylvan glade. Emerging from a line of great oaks at the base of the hills is a long parade of men, women, boys and girls, all crossing a huge meadow and gathering at "The Fountain of Perpetual Youth."
The fountain is made by an enormous bottle of Americanitis Elixir: "One of the Famous Rexall Remedies of Which There Is One for Each Ailment," "Especially Recommended for Nervous Disorders, Exhaustion, and All Troubles Arising from Americanitis." Emitting a white spray that forms a canopy of medicine and fills the fountain's pool, the bottle is as ugly as it is imposing; three winged fairies drape themselves around its side. On the ground, led by a boy or a midget dressed as a bellboy, throngs of excited children and calm, satisfied adults raise cups high, less to drink than to toast.
The picture all but screams with self-confidence, optimism and joy, with a celebration of the American small-town utopia generalized into its natural setting. Here people gather to be cured of some vague malaise, some not-quite-diagnosable condition, but it's plain that the setting is itself a cure. In fact, as you look, the setting, the cure, is so blessed -- with its perfect marriage of benign nature and kindred spirits -- that the disease it purports to cure is itself a kind of blessing. Without the disease, you couldn't have the cure, and the cure, patently, is what life is all about.
Still, any picture so full of detail as this one turns up oddities. The bellboy doesn't seem human. It's a small-town utopia but there's no town. On one side of the fountain, where there are no adults, the children mingle, pressing their bodies together; on the other side everyone, old and young, stands apart.
They don't look at one another; they don't seem to know one another. They seem peculiarly lifeless, residents not of Anytown, U.S.A., but of a sanitarium. Winding down from the beautiful mountains, a line of solitaries has come from all over to discover . . . Americanitis? Or America? As if it weren't there already? As if they just heard about it? America or Americanitis? What is the cure, and what is the disease?
There's a queer, powerful displacement in the image. It takes you into the distant past as you stand in the present, as you stand in the unimaginable future of the advertisement, unless, in truth, nothing has really changed. We have forgotten Americanitis Elixir, and its weird question of whether it named the remedy or the affliction, but we still drink Coca-Cola. Coke, too, like Hires or Dr Pepper, began its life as a 19th-century patent medicine: a "nerve tonic" you took to banish fatigue and depression. At the beginning of the century, fatigue and depression seemed to be everyone's fate, at least if you read the ads, and they were everywhere.
In his breezily definitive 1993 book "For God, Country and Coca-Cola," the business writer Mark Pendergrast recalls a New York Tribune reporter describing, in 1886, an "undulating country, breathing spring from every meadow and grove and orchard," not that one could "see a single furlong of it, without the suggestion of disease." The reporter found advertisements for cures painted everywhere, on rocks and barns.
"Americanitis" may have been a trademark, but the condition would have been recognized by everyone. As far back as 1881, Mr. Pendergrast notes, the writer George Beard, in his book "American Nervousness," traced its causes to industrialization, an unstable economy, "too much freedom of thought," "repression of turbulent emotions," overspecialization and, above all, the pressure of time.
Americanitis Elixir went on the market at a time when, to many, America itself was becoming unrecognizable. Between 1880 and 1910 the population of the country almost doubled, mostly because of immigration. Everywhere you went, there were people who didn't look like you, who didn't speak the same language: people who thought that they, too, were Americans. Before too long, assimilation had its effect, and the problem got worse. Just as you couldn't tell the disease from the cure, you couldn't always distinguish those who belonged here from those who didn't.
You might argue that such a disease has always made the country what it is, but that would mean giving up a lot. It would mean that, despite the irreducible pull of all that makes the Americanitis sign what it is, there is no cure.

HEADLINE: Unlike Microsoft, Intel Opts to Speak Softly on Antitrust Issues

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
It enjoys a near-monopoly on an essential technology of personal computing, bringing the company and its shareholders immense wealth. It is led by a brilliant, famous and notoriously competitive chief executive, and it is now being pursued by Washington's antitrust police.
The company is the Intel Corporation, and its commanding position in the personal computer industry mirrors that of the Microsoft Corporation. Intel controls 85 percent of the market for the microprocessor chips, often called the "electronic brains" of PC's. With its Windows program, Microsoft has a similar share of the market for operating system software, a PC's central control program, or "nervous system." 
 Both companies have been under investigation by antitrust authorities -- the Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department -- for most of the 1990's.
But Intel has been far more successful than Microsoft in keeping the antitrust challenges to its market power out of Federal court, Congress and the headlines.
Antitrust experts and industry executives say there are a number of reasons that help explain why Microsoft has taken so much more fire on the antitrust issue than Intel. They range from Microsoft's ambitious efforts to expand its domain beyond computing to the celebrity of William H. Gates, its chairman and the nation's richest person.
Yet antitrust experts also point to a straightforward explanation for Intel's ability to avoid the tougher treatment and criticism: in its public statements and in its internal procedures, Intel has for years taken a more cautious and painstaking approach to the antitrust issue than is evident at Microsoft.
Intel executives will not comment on the current Microsoft case -- which took another unusual turn last week when, after resisting for weeks, Microsoft relented and said that to comply with a Federal judge's order it would give PC makers the option of erasing the icon for its Internet Explorer browser from its Windows operating system.
But one person close to Intel said the company's senior executives, including Andrew S. Grove, Intel's chairman, are concerned by Microsoft's handling of the case and the "potential political spillover" -- as the other partner in the so-called "Wintel duopoly," Intel could share in the criticism leveled at Microsoft.
"Intel would prefer that Microsoft were doing this in a lower-profile, less combative way," the person said.
In July 1993, after more than two years of investigation, the F.T.C. closed its inquiry into Intel without any charges. Last September, the commission began a new investigation, seeking documents from Intel, other chip producers and PC makers.
F. Thomas Dunlop Jr., Intel's general counsel who has been with the company for 23 years, compares the Government's antitrust investigations to going to the dentist -- not pleasant perhaps, but something that has to be done.
"Given our size and visibility, we know we're going to get scrutiny," he said.
If Intel views a Government antitrust investigation as a trip to the dentist, Microsoft appears to regard it as an act of war, judging from its comments and some of its court filings.
Last year, Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's executive vice president, was quoted as saying "to heck with Janet Reno," the Attorney General.
In one court filing, Microsoft stated that one of the Justice Department's positions was proof that "poorly informed lawyers have no vocation for software design."
Microsoft officials have also repeatedly characterized the Justice Department's antitrust division -- a staff loaded with graduates from the economics departments and law schools of the nation's elite universities -- as little more than the unwitting dupes of Microsoft's rivals.
"Microsoft has gratuitously made high-octane statements that may make their people feel good at the time," said Kevin Arquit, a partner at the law firm of Rogers & Wells in New York. "But in the end, those kind of tactics work against Microsoft."
Intel, Mr. Arquit notes, is taking a very different tack. "Intel is keeping its head much closer to the water and being more careful," said Mr. Arquit, a former director of the F.T.C.'s Bureau of Competition, from 1982 to 1992, when both Intel and Microsoft were under investigation by the commission.
In legal circles, the Intel antitrust compliance effort is regarded as a model program. The company had antitrust training before, but the current program had its origins in 1987 when Mr. Grove summoned Mr. Dunlop, the general counsel, into his office.
Mr. Dunlop said Mr. Grove viewed the company's rising market share and fast-growing work force as greatly increasing the risk of antitrust problems for Intel. Increased market power would attract closer scrutiny from Washington and more employees increased the chances that someone would violate antitrust laws, even if unintentionally.
"Andy said he wanted to turn the antitrust program into a world-class effort just as we have with microprocessor design training," Mr. Dunlop said.
Today, every new hire at Intel hears a lecture about how the company takes antitrust law seriously. Every manager and every member of the sales force attends antitrust training seminars at least once a year. The marketing staff typically goes to briefings more often, about four times a year.
Every annual performance evaluation for managers, including for Intel's 20-member executive staff, includes the person's work on the antitrust compliance program. Every Intel document that touches on company policy, from sales presentations to internal E-mail, is reviewed by a member of the legal staff for antitrust implications. "I don't care whether it's a public document or not," Mr. Dunlop emphasized.
None of the compliance efforts, to be sure, will help Intel if the F.T.C. finds that the company, for example, was tying the purchase of one product to another in licensing deals or giving price discounts for buying only Intel chips -- both things the commission is looking at.
For its part, Microsoft insists that its legal staff advises its managers in every division on antitrust matters. "But remember, we're not in the position we are today because of compliance or anything else, but because of a fundamental disagreement with the Justice Department over what the 1995 consent decree means," said Mark Murray, a Microsoft spokesman.
That disagreement became a very public dispute starting in October when the Justice Department sued Microsoft, contending that the company was violating its 1995 consent decree with the Government by forcing PC makers to take its Internet Explorer browser as a condition of licensing Windows. The consent degree prohibits Microsoft from tying the purchase of one product to another, but it does allow the company to develop "integrated" products.
Microsoft contends that Explorer and Windows are not separate products but a single integrated product, and thus can be licensed as one product under the consent decree. In December, a Federal judge temporarily ordered Microsoft to give PC makers the option of taking Windows without Explorer.
Last week, Microsoft agreed to comply with the judge's order by allowing PC makers to remove the Explorer icon. A ruling in the overall consent-decree case is not expected before June.
Unless their fortunes slide unexpectedly, Microsoft and Intel can expect to be under the watchful eye of Washington for some time.
"Microsoft and Intel are both 800-pound gorillas, both so critical to the economy, that it should not surprise either of these companies that they are under antitrust scrutiny," said Robert Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, and a former chief economist in the Justice Department's antitrust division.

HEADLINE: Booming Stock Market Changes Rankings in Philanthropy

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

 BODY:
A booming stock market is changing the face of American philanthropy, knocking the Ford Foundation out of the position it has held for more than 30 years as the nation's largest private foundation.
According to the Chronicle of Philanthropy, a leading trade publication, Ford has now been supplanted in terms of assets by the Lilly Endowment in Indianapolis, whose assets consist almost entirely of stock from the drug company which founded it, Eli Lilly & Company. The pharmaceutical company's stock has been riding high based on strong sales of its products, among them, the antidepressant Prozac. As a result, the Lilly Endowment has grown by 140 percent in the last two years and is now worth $12.7 billion, overshadowing Ford, whose assets at the end of last year totaled $9.4 billion, the Chronicle reports in an issue to be published on Thursday. 
 Several years of strong economic growth and soaring financial markets have also brought the David and Lucile Packard Foundation from ninth to third place in philanthropy's ranks. Packard's assets are expected to rise from $2.4 billion to $9 billion in March when it officially receives a bequest of roughly $5 billion worth of stock in Hewlett Packard, the multibillion dollar high- technology company, from the estate of David Packard, a co-founder who died in 1996.
"The new rankings show the advantages -- as well as the potential disadvantages -- of assets that are heavily concentrated in stock," said Stacey Palmer, the Chronicle's managing editor.
In 1992, for instance, when Lilly Company stock fared poorly, the endowment's assets plunged a billion dollars from $3.9 to $2.9 billion. As a result, so did the foundation's annual giving, from $110.3 to $47.6 million.
"It's true that because we're so heavily invested in company stock we're more vulnerable to the ups and downs of stock prices," said Gretchen Wolfram, the Lilly Endowment's communications director. "But Eli Lilly stock has served us well ever since our founding in 1937. So we're very pleased with the results."
But Susan V. Berresford, the president of the Ford Foundation, said that she and her board felt more comfortable knowing that the foundation's assets were highly diversified, and therefore, less vulnerable to market vagaries. "Above all," she said, "we've wanted a predictable income stream, which has sustained a steady commitment in grants from us over a number of years. It feels no different being the nation's first or second largest foundation."
Since Federal law requires foundations to distribute at least 5 percent of their investment assets each year, the stock market boom and concomitant increase in foundation assets means that most of them will have to give away substantially more money this year or face tax penalties for failing to do so.
In some cases, such as the Lilly Endowment, increased assets are not leading to radical changes in giving patterns. For example, Ms. Wolfram said that while Lilly's annual grants would increase to $413 million in 1998 from $252 million last year, the foundation would continue favoring grants to Indiana-based institutions, as well as to groups that foster community development, minority education, and religion throughout the nation.
The Lilly Endowment is known especially for helping foster networks of community-based foundations. Since 1990, some $200 million worth of grants in this area have increased the number of Indiana-based community foundations with assets of more than $500 million to 80 from 9, the foundation spokesman said.
But the growth of some investment portfolios is so large that it requires foundations to expand rapidly and possibly to re-evaluate their giving priorities. Because Hewlett-Packard stock increased by 21 percent last year and the foundation assets can be expected to increase by more than $5 billion in spring, the Packard foundation has conducted a major review of its giving.
As a result, it is not only expanding its staff to 90 from 65 in 1996, but also its giving by more than 120 percent over the next two years. "We will continue emphasizing conservation, family planning and population programs, children, family and community programs and science," said Cole Wilbur, the foundation's executive director and its sole professional staff person in 1976.

HEADLINE: Gallons and Dollars Match, So Gas Sells Fast

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: FORT LEE, N.J., Jan. 25

 BODY:
Watching the digits on a gas pump race, any driver will admit, can be vaguely hypnotic, if rather unsatisfying: total gallons are usually no match for total dollars.
But at scattered filling stations all over New Jersey, the underdog is having his day, as prices have dropped to under a dollar a gallon at some gas stations in the region for the first time in years. And customers are entranced. 
 "They match!" Alex Magocsi, an engineer at WNYC-TV in Manhattan, said after topping off on the way home from work, his face spread into the grin of a man who had gotten something for next to nothing.
To the left and right of him, cars along a curved stretch of Route 46 near the George Washington Bridge kept braking suddenly and veering off the road. The attraction? Gas for 99 cents a gallon.
Robert A. Kaplan, on the way to a Super Bowl party from Manhattan, serenely paid $13.25 for 13.26 gallons. "I haven't seen that in a long time," he said.
Station owners say it has been two to four years since retail prices were this low. Statewide, the average price per gallon this month is $1.09, down from $1.21 a year ago, according to the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities.
The falling prices have benefited buyers of other petroleum products as well, experts say, as a slack demand for heating fuel because of the mild winter weather, plentiful worldwide oil supplies, and the economic slowdown in Asia have combined to bring crude oil prices below $16 a barrel for the first time in almost four years.
But in Fort Lee, and in Newark, and in Ledgewood, and out past Parsippany, retailers are adding competition to the mix, taking advantage of low wholesale prices to woo new customers.
Here on Route 46, a Merit and a Gulf station, each charging 99 cents, looked like parking lots. An Exxon nearby, where a gallon of regular cost $1.07, looked closed.
Robert Miller, a salesman for a moving and storage company, said that falling prices would increase his net income.
"I drive 40,000 miles a year," he said. "If it drops down like this all year, it could make a difference of $300 or $400."
His wife, Elizabeth, at the wheel, voiced a note of caution.
"The one thing is that we might all drive so much in this nice weather that by summer, the price will be back up again," she said. "I hope we don't shoot ourselves in the foot."
Not everyone is enjoying low prices just yet, although the phenomenon does seem to be spreading.
Barbara Nichols, moving from an apartment in Fort Lee to a new home in Bloomfield, said she waited to fill up her tank until getting back to the old neighborhood.
"We saw the sign, and I said, 'I can make it up there,' " she said, handing over 10 dollars for a full tank. "It hasn't gotten this low in Bloomfield yet. It's still $1.15 or $1.17 a gallon."
Bruno A. Basile, a salesman from Bridgeton in southern New Jersey, was on his way to New Hampshire for a three-day business trip when he stopped in Fort Lee today to refuel. He said that some stations in South Jersey were charging as little as 92 cents a gallon. He bought 16 1/2 gallons.
"You don't want to gas up in Connecticut," he said. "This'll take me at least up to Worcester, Mass."
Syed Hussain, a manager at the Gulf station here, said some drivers have tipped him with their extra savings. Others reacted differently.
At the Merit station across the highway, Jonathan C. Penner, of Larchmont, N.Y., appeared dumbfounded by the low prices.
Descending from his giant Ford Expedition, its thirst slaked by 26 gallons of 87 octane, to pay the attendant, he accused the man of overcharging him.
"How could it be $26.32 for 26 gallons if it's 99 cents a gallon?" Mr. Penner asked the attendant, who spoke little English but was clearly competent at math.
But Mr. Penner quickly retreated to the driver's seat when he was told that he had mistaken the volume for the price. "Never mind," he said, racing off on his way to the bridge.

HEADLINE: The Pope's Message to Washington

 BODY:
Those who oppose America's obsolete trade embargo on Cuba found an eloquent ally in Pope John Paul II as he visited the island in recent days. It was not just John Paul's criticism of embargoes, which he had made before, but the attention he drew to humanitarian needs in Cuba that Washington has stubbornly ignored.
The embargo is an embarrassing anachronism. It was imposed by Dwight Eisenhower, when Nikita Khrushchev led the Soviet Union and Cuba was seen as a Soviet base. The embargo was strengthened with the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 and the Helms-Burton law of 1996. Its longevity is mainly due to the clout of the Cuban exile community. 
 The embargo has failed to strangle the Castro regime or force it to change. The Pope's request for the release of political prisoners highlights the fact that some 600 Cubans are in jail for peaceful expression of their views, many in appalling conditions. The security forces harass anyone who expresses disagreement. Fidel Castro's political control is as airtight as ever.
If anything, the embargo has helped Mr. Castro retain power by giving him a rallying point to unite Cubans, and something to blame for their privations. It has also lessened outside pressure on Mr. Castro. European and Latin American governments have softened their criticism, lest they be seen as endorsing Washington's heavy-handedness.
The Pope's concerns focus on the impact of the embargo on Cuba's poor. Since American companies hold the patents on many drugs and medical devices, the 1992 law that barred virtually all medical sales by their foreign subsidiaries has been particularly damaging. Now that the United States has sought to get more food to Iraq and North Korea, there is no justification for impeding the sale of food and medicine to Cubans.
If the White House cannot muster the political courage to press for the embargo's repeal, it should at least continue to delay implementing provisions in the Helms-Burton law that seek to keep foreign companies from doing business in Cuba. The Administration should also work for passage of Congressional bills introduced last year that would allow the sale of food and medicine. They enjoy bipartisan support and even the approval of some emigre groups. No one has stronger anti-Communist credentials than John Paul. If he can extend a hand to Cubans, so can the United States.

HEADLINE: THE POPE IN CUBA: THE OVERVIEW;
POPE ASKS CUBANS TO SEEK NEW PATH TOWARD FREEDOM

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: HAVANA, Jan. 25

 BODY:
With the images of both Jesus and Che Guevara looking down on him and a visibly moved throng, Pope John Paul II today stepped into Fidel Castro's favorite pulpit, the huge Plaza of the Revolution here, and urged Cubans to seek "the new paths called for by these times of renewal" and to avoid "exclusion, isolation and conflict."
With Mr. Castro and other senior Cuban officials in the front row at a mid-morning Mass, the Pope delivered a ringing call for pluralism here. He rejected the materialistic, one-party ideology of the Cuban state. And he said true liberation "cannot be reduced to its social and political aspects," but must also include "the exercise of freedom of conscience -- the basis and foundation of all other human rights." 
 Later in the day, though, the Pope also made his most critical reference yet to the American economic embargo of Cuba. At a departure ceremony at Jose Marti Airport this evening, he said Cuba's "material and moral poverty" arose not only from "limitations to fundamental freedoms" and "discouragement of the individual," but also from "restrictive economic measures -- unjust and ethically unacceptable -- imposed from outside the country."
With Mr. Castro at his side, he said: "In our day, no nation can live in isolation. The Cuban people, therefore, cannot be denied the contacts with other peoples necessary for economic, social and cultural development, especially when the imposed isolation strikes the population indiscriminately, making it ever more difficult for the weakest to enjoy the bare essentials of decent living -- things such as food, health and education."
The Pope spoke after Mr. Castro had compared Cuba's relationship with the United States to that of David and Goliath, complaining that Cuba has been "blockaded and subjected to a veritable economic war" for nearly 40 years. "For all your words, even those with which there may be some disagreement, I offer my thanks," the Cuban leader said.
For the morning Mass, groups organized on the basis of church parish or family began arriving at the square well before dawn on foot and by bus, ignoring the unseasonably cool, overcast and windy weather.
TV Rebelde, the state controlled television network, which broadcast the Mass live, said "hundreds of thousands" of people were there, but made a point of specifying that the multitude was composed of both "believers and nonbelievers."
Since he came to power in 1959, Mr. Castro has delivered many of his best-known speeches, on May Day and other political occasions, at the Plaza of the Revolution, and so there was considerable speculation here about the size of the crowd that John Paul would draw. In his remarks, the Pope referred to the location by an alternate name, the Plaza Jose Marti, in honor of the father of Cuban independence, whose statue overlooks the square.
The Pope made no mention of Che Guevara, the martyr of the Cuban revolution who is the object of an almost religious veneration here. Instead, he quoted passages from the writings of Marti that are unfamiliar to most people here. "Every people needs to be religious," the Pope read, further quoting, "An irreligious people will die, because nothing in it encourages virtue."
During a televised speech to the nation nine days ago, Mr. Castro encouraged his supporters to turn out for today's Mass as "a sign of courtesy and consideration," but warned that "nobody should shout 'vivas' for any leader of the revolution." That did not prove to be much of a problem: from start to finish, the crowd belonged to the Pope and the Pope alone.
Indeed, his first words were interrupted by an enthusiastic chant of "You can hear it, you can feel it, the Pope is here!" Later, his comments were greeted with occasional shouts of "Freedom! Freedom!" or sustained and spirited applause anytime he mentioned the concepts central to his 40-minute homily: justice, truth, hope and liberation.
"I am not opposed to applause," the Pope quipped during one such interruption, drawing a smile from Mr. Castro. "Because when you applaud, the Pope can rest a bit."
Later, after another spontaneous outburst, he remarked, "You are an active audience," and then playfully added, "There's still a page to go."
From deep within the crowd, it was impossible to discern whether Mr. Castro joined the faithful in recitation of the liturgy and prayers during the Mass. State television showed Mr. Castro and his retinue arriving at the Mass and talking with the Pope afterward, but did not show him at moments when a response from the congregation was due.
Mr. Castro, wearing a dark blue business suit, was accompanied by the author Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who is a longtime friend of Mr. Castro's, and by several of his closest associates, including Minister of Foreign Relations Roberto Robaina and Ricardo Alarcon, the leader of Cuba's legislative assembly.
The officials remained to the end of the two-and-a-half-hour Mass, following Mr. Castro's advice that party militants "not express the slightest manifestation of disgust at any phrase that displeases us or seems unjust," but they did not take communion.
Ordinary Cubans, some of whom said they were attending a Mass for the first time, declared that they found the Pope's message inspiring. "His words penetrated and stimulated me," Ana Perez, a teacher, said. "I feel very emotional right now."
"I liked everything he said, but especially the part where he said Cuba must open up to the world and the world must open up to Cuba," said Luis Soteras, a graphic designer at a publishing house who attended with his wife, Mirta Lopez, who runs a small private restaurant. "We can all of us learn a lot from the words of this man."
The measured tone of today's pronouncements came after three days of sermons that sounded increasingly critical of Mr. Castro's policies. At a meeting with lepers and AIDS patients on Saturday night, after a Mass in Santiago de Cuba at which a senior Cuban prelate warned against those "who have confused the fatherland with a single party," the Pope called on the Government to release political prisoners.
In private, Government and party officials had expressed dissatisfaction with such appeals and disappointment that the Pope had not given Mr. Castro what he was seeking: an explicit condemnation of 37 years of American economic sanctions directed against Cuba. Instead, John Paul had limited himself to generic criticisms of "economic embargoes, which are always deplorable because they damage the most needy," as he put it in Camaguey on Friday.
The Pope's schedule on his fifth and final day in Cuba was the busiest and most taxing of his trip to the only Latin American country he had not visited previously. An "ecumencial encounter" with Protestant and Jewish leaders preceded the morning Mass, while separate meetings with the Cuban Conference of Bishops and with clergy, seminarians and lay leaders followed.
Meeting with the bishops, John Paul urged Jaime Cardinal Ortega and a dozen other prelates to continue their efforts to insure that the Catholic Church "occupies her rightful place in the midst of the people and has the possibility of adequately serving the brethren." To do so, he added, restrictions on the church's activities here must be lifted.
"When the church demands religious freedom, she is not asking for a gift, a privilege or a permission dependent on contingent situations, political strategies or the will of the authorities," he said. "Rather, she demands the effective recognition of an inalienable human right."
But at the Mass, the Pope also sounded themes that are familiar to Cubans from Mr. Castro's speeches, and in a similar language. "Various places," he said, "are witnessing the resurgence of a certain capitalist neo-liberalism, which subordinates the human person to blind market forces and conditions the development of people on those forces."
Without mentioning the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank by name, the Pope also criticized the austerity programs those organizations have devised for Latin American countries and, most recently, for Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand.
"At times," he said, "unsustainable economic programs are imposed on nations as a condition for further assistance."

HEADLINE: Countdown on Iraq: U.S. Weighs February Attack

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25

 BODY:
The United States and Britain are laying plans for a three- or four-day bombing campaign of Iraqi targets as early as mid-February if President Saddam Hussein continues to block the work of United Nations weapons inspectors, according to senior American officials and Western diplomats.
"We have now entered the threat phase," a senior American official said today. 
 Since the latest crisis with Iraq began in November, when Mr. Hussein began blocking access for United Nations inspectors to suspected weapons sites, the weight of policy has been more toward using a military presence in the Persian Gulf to support diplomacy. But "the balance has now definitely changed," said the official, who like others willing to discuss the issue spoke on condition of anonymity. Diplomatic options are running out, he said, "and they are now designed to give Saddam a last chance to comply before he gets clobbered. It's not like he hasn't had his chances, and we want him to think hard."
Another senior Administration official complained today that the members of the United Nations weapons inspection team, known as Unscom, still "are not in a position to do their jobs" in Iraq. "So with the diplomatic string running out, the question becomes what will compel Saddam to let them do their jobs," the official said.
The President's national security team gathered at the White House on Saturday to discuss Iraq. But the sex scandal surrounding Mr. Clinton has complicated Washington's options and given close Western allies pause, these diplomats and some American officials say.
"A week ago, everything was clear on Iraq," said one senior diplomat from a NATO country, expressing some anguish. "Today, nobody really knows what's going on, or even if Clinton will last."
Another senior Western diplomat said: "I'm reminded of actors all going through their lines, and trying to ignore the earthquake under their feet. No one knows how serious it is or if the theater's going to collapse, but while they're talking, it's all that anyone can think about."
Mr. Hussein is hard to read at the best of times. But Mr. Clinton's troubles have already emboldened the Iraqi President, whose loyal Deputy Prime Minister, Tariq Aziz, has become even less flexible than before in private conversations with diplomats, these officials and diplomats say.
While American officials insist vehemently in private that their planning process on Iraq has not been altered by Mr. Clinton's political troubles, senior Western diplomats say the scandal has already had an impact on allied thinking.
A weakened Mr. Clinton will be more beholden to the Republican majority in Congress, these diplomats have told their home capitals, and consequently will be far less likely to push the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to make serious concessions to the Palestinians for a peace settlement in the Middle East.
The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, addressed the issue today. "Is he in any condition to make the right call?" Mr. Lott, a Mississippi Republican, said on the ABC News program "This Week." "You know it's got to be a problem," he said, referring to the sex and perjury allegations.
Western diplomats say that perception will make it next to impossible for the United States to secure public Arab support for a limited American-British attack on Iraq -- even from Kuwait, which was resurrected as an independent nation when Iraqi forces were driven out during the gulf war.
American officials are considering a trip to the Middle East by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, to consult with and inform allies about the situation, but they are wary of sending her on a journey that will only underscore American isolation and Arab wariness.
While they reject the crude idea that Mr. Clinton will seek a military diversion from his domestic problems, these diplomats believe that the scandal will make the White House more reluctant than ever to appear weak or indecisive, or, as one senior Western diplomat said, "be seen to be worrying too much over the doubts and anxieties of allies or the Security Council."
Senior American officials said today that while there will be more United Nations diplomacy, no decision has been made about whether to seek a Security Council resolution finding Iraq "in material breach" of the cease-fire that ended the gulf war. Such a resolution would give full diplomatic cover to an American-British strike, in particular against the suspected weapons sites and storage installations that Mr. Hussein is not allowing Unscom to inspect and against the general Iraqi ability to threaten its neighbors.
American officials say they do not need any new resolution to take military action against Iraq, even unilaterally. But they would prefer to have as many allies participate as possible, and senior diplomats said today that without a new resolution of material breach, even such a stout American ally as Britain "would have a difficult choice to make."
The matter is likely to become more clear after Prime Minister Tony Blair visits Washington during the first week of February.
Despite clear evidence of Iraq's continued failure to comply, Russia and China are unlikely to vote to find Iraq in material breach because they do not want to give further justification to American military action against Iraq, which both countries have already said is unacceptable.
France might vote for such a resolution but would not participate in military action, diplomats and officials said. French officials say that Mr. Hussein's continuing contempt for the Security Council is so egregious that France can no longer attempt to act as Iraq's advocate for a gradual lessening of sanctions, even if Moscow persists. In the case of military action, one American official said, "the best we could hope from France is silence."
With no chance that the United States will muster enough military force to drive Mr. Hussein out of power, Western diplomats say they are concerned that a military strike would not destroy Iraq's weapons potential. "So you hit him and he throws out Unscom forever," one diplomat said. "What's really accomplished?"
After being in place for seven years, the economic embargo is already broadly criticized on humanitarian and pragmatic grounds, this diplomat said. "All you'll have left to influence Baghdad will be more military force and an unpopular embargo."
A senior Administration official reacted angrily to that argument. "The question is not, 'What's next?' after a strike, but 'What now?' " the official said. "If we're at the point that diplomatic string is running out to get him to let Unscom have access to dangerous and suspect sites, and there is clear danger in allowing those sites to remain uninspected, there may be those who still hope they can talk Saddam into it. But if they can't, and they haven't, they have to address compelling him to do so."
Another senior American official said: "Is the credibility of a beleaguered President at stake here? Of course. But so is the credibility of the United Nations and the Security Council."

HEADLINE: Indonesian Currency Declines On Uncertainty Over Future

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Monday, Jan. 26

 BODY:
The Indonesian currency, the rupiah, lost as much as 15 percent in early trading today as no solution emerged to Indonesia's deepening debt crisis and international banks continued to freeze lending to the country.
"This is an extreme market because either people don't want to trade and the rupiah stays where it is, or they fear that the central bank would come in and push the rupiah below 10,000," said Sani Hamid, an analyst at MMS International, a financial services unit of Standard & Poor's Corporation in Singapore. "Anything can happen." 
 The rupiah fell as low as 15,000 to the dollar from 12,750 at the end of Asian trading on Friday. Last week, the currency lost 34 percent of its value as Indonesia's banking system almost ground to a halt, with several international banks freezing lending. Standard Chartered, ABN-Amro Bank, Bank of America and Rabobank International were among the banks that stopped handling rupiah trades in the interbank market, currency traders said.
Traders estimate that the central bank, Bank Indonesia, spent $5 billion to $6 billion last week attempting to support the rupiah.
The rupiah's plunge -- it has fallen 63 percent this year -- has made it virtually impossible for Indonesia to keep up payments on its $65 billion in foreign debt.
The latest decline came even though Japan's Vice Finance Minister, Eisuke Sakakibara, said the International Monetary Fund would discuss further aid to Indonesia this week. The monetary fund and industrialized countries will jointly take steps to help Indonesia, he said. Last year, the fund cobbled together a $40 billion bailout package in exchange for economic reforms.
Last week, Japan's nine largest commercial banks failed to come up with a solution to Indonesia's debt or to set a date for the next meeting. About $23 billion of the corporate foreign debt is owed to Japanese banks. Japan says it will work closely with Singapore and the United States to save Indonesia from economic collapse.
There is mounting concern that social unrest brought on by the economic crisis will spark political instability, threatening President Suharto's Government. Already, in rural areas of Indonesia prices of staple items like sugar and rice have soared 30 percent. The Government has also forecast that as many as one million Indonesians could lose their jobs this year, swelling the ranks of the unemployed to 3.7 million.
Indonesia is the world's fourth-most-populous country, with 200 million people living on about 17,000 islands strung across the Equator. With one of the worst droughts in decades and the weaker rupiah hampering the country's ability to import food, riots in rural areas have spread in East Java in recent days. Calls are growing for President Suharto to step aside, despite reports that the 76-year-old leader intends to seek a seventh term in office.

Pope Ends Visit to Cuba With Call for Human Rights
On his final day in Cuba, Pope John Paul II told an enthusiastic throng, including President Fidel Castro, that the liberation of mankind must go beyond social and political aspects to include "the exercise of freedom of conscience" as the basis of all other human rights. A1
 
During the Pope's visit, Fidel Castro exchanged military fatigues for business suits, attended Mass, listened to criticism and even gave the Pope a friendly pat on the back. A9 

U.S. Plans Bombing of Iraq
The United States and Britain, noting that Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz has become even less flexible in private talks with diplomats, are laying plans for a three- or four-day bombing campaign of Iraqi targets as early as mid-February, if Baghdad continues to block the work of United Nations weapons inspectors, according to senior American officials and Western diplomats. A1
 
Litany of Crimes in Turkey
An official investigating Turkey's biggest modern political scandal has concluded that agents of previous Governments committed murder; worked with drug dealers, and spent millions of dollars in attempts to assassinate Kurdish rebel leaders and overthrow the Government of Azerbaijan. Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz confirmed most of the official's unpublished report. A3
 
Sri Lankan Temple is Bombed
Three suicide bombers drove a truck through the gates of Sri Lanka's holiest Buddhist temple, killing themselves and eight other people, wounding 23, and setting off ethnic riots. The Government said that a tooth that believers say came from Buddha was not harmed. Senior military officials said Tamil separatists were responsible for the bombing in the highland town of Kandy. A3
 
Indonesia's Chinese Grow Wary
Indonesia's ethnic Chinese, traditionally a target of resentment during hard times, say they are growing more fearful of becoming scapegoats for the country's current economic crisis. Chinese shops and businesses have been prime targets in times of unrest, a result of envy over their economic domination and religious differences. A6
 
Irish Army Sues Government
About 3,000 Irish soldiers have sued their Government over hearing loss incurred during practice artillery sessions. The Government has contended that most of the claimants are malingerers who have hired sharp lawyers. Experts say that Ireland has become one of the most litigious nations in Europe. A4
 
Canadians Still Without Power
About 60,000 Quebec households remain without power nearly three weeks after a paralyzing ice storm hit eastern Canada. Half the households should regain power within the week, but there was no estimate of when electricity would be restored to the rest, said Andre Caille, the chairman of Hydro-Quebec. (AP)

Clinton Supporters Rally Despite Serious Concerns
As the White House mounted an orchestrated campaign yesterday to contain the sex scandal enveloping the White House, Cabinet members and Congressional Democrats privately expressed worries that President Clinton may be unable to recover. Supporters fanned out to discredit Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel. Instead of enjoying the publicity before the State of the Union address, White House aides said they knew everyone would only want to see one shot on Tuesday: Hillary Rodham Clinton's face. A1
 
Despite a scandal that promises to make President Clinton's State of the Union Message the tensest since Richard M. Nixon's 1974 address during Watergate, the President pushed on yesterday. A1
 
Some legal scholars have become intensely critical of Kenneth Starr for transforming his investigation from an examination of the Whitewater land deal into an inquiry seeking to determine whether President Clinton urged a young woman to lie under oath about an alleged sexual relationship. But other experts in criminal law say that Mr. Starr has simply followed a criminal trail. A14
 
President Clinton's legal and political advisers have organized to fight criminal, civil, and political threats that imperil his Presidency. A14
 
Black Americans Lose Ground
A robust economy and years of Government pressure have helped move minority groups closer to the mainstream. But studies show a persistent and, in some respects, growing disparity in health between black and white Americans. For decades, blacks have had higher death rates from most major causes. Though life expectancy has increased over all, differences remain. A16
 
Rival Offers for Airline
Northwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines, the nation's third and fourth largest airlines, are vying for control of Continental Airlines, the fifth largest carrier, in a competition that could touch off a new round of consolidation in the industry. Continental's board met in New York City last night to consider the competing merger offers, people close to the talks said. A16

Pataki Proposes Plan For Longer Prison Time
Gov. George E. Pataki, along with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York City, has often urged an end to parole for violent felons, tapping into a powerful issue that has grown to become a national movement. Most states have linked ending parole with reducing sentences, to reflect the "true" amount of time to be served but Mr. Pataki's proposal would require convicted felons to serve at least 85 percent of their maximum sentences.

Criticism of Red Cross Deal
The American Red Cross prohibits the use of its logo in advertising and bars commercial endorsements of any kind. Its fund-raising arrangement with Laerdal Medical, which makes the manikins used in cardiopulmonary resuscitation training, has raised some concerns about commercialism and a potential conflict of interest.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT UNDER FIRE: THE THEME;
Clinton Wants to Use Surplus for Social Security

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25

 BODY:
President Clinton plans to call in his State of the Union Message on Tuesday for using any Federal budget surpluses in coming years to get an early start on fixing Social Security, Administration officials said today.
The officials said that Mr. Clinton would make dealing with Social Security a central part of his theme that the nation should be fiscally conservative in allocating any surpluses. With White House and Congressional budget analysts predicting that the Government will begin running substantial surpluses in the next few years, a debate has already broken out within both parties over how to divide the windfall. 
 White House officials declined today to provide details of their proposals for addressing the looming problems in the retirement system. But the Administration's strategy appears intended to put Republicans on the defensive over their calls for big tax cuts and to counter the increasing demands from members of both parties for increased spending.
Some private economists predict that the Government could post a surplus of as much as $40 billion in the current fiscal year.
The Social Security system will begin running short of the money it needs to pay promised benefits after the baby boom generation begins retiring in large numbers around 2010. By around 2029 Social Security will have used up the extra money it has set aside in trust funds, and will be able to pay only about 75 percent of promised benefits out of payroll taxes it will collect from people in the workforce at that time.
The options for closing the gap have always been financially straightforward but politically painful. They include raising Social Security taxes, cutting benefits or raising the retirement age.
Administration officials had said in recent weeks that they intended to find a way to work with the Repubican leaders in Congress on a bipartisan approach to the problem, with their hope being to enact a legislative solution within two years, before the 2000 Presidential campaign begins in earnest.
Allocating any substantial surpluses to the problem would help reduce the need for other politically difficult measures.
The most direct way of addressing Social Security's problems would be to use any surpluses to pay down a portion of the $5 trillion national debt, some of which is money the Government has borrowed from the Social Security trust funds to finance its annual operating budget.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT UNDER FIRE: THE SPEECH;
President Preparing Message On Policy, Not Predicament

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25

 BODY:
Bill Clinton stood before a teleprompter this afternoon in a brown suit and green vest, practicing his State of the Union Message in the White House map room with a Roosevelt-era chart of the Allied forces as his backdrop.
Just a week ago Mr. Clinton's closest aides had hoped that this speech would be the triumphant proclamation of a reinvigorated Presidency. Instead, Mr. Clinton's White House is engulfed in such profound crisis that the speech promises to be the most tense State of the Union Message since Richard M. Nixon's in 1974, amid the deepening Watergate scandal. 
 Still Mr. Clinton pushed on. For two hours today, his aides said, the man caught in the political storm sought to perfect his phrases and delivery. He moved paragraphs. He dictated a new passage. He scribbled a note. He joked that he would begin his speech on Tuesday night by asking the American people, "Please turn to page 33."
Section by section, as more than a dozen aides looked on, Mr. Clinton honed and polished a one-hour policy address that as of now, according to his aides, gives not a nod to the questions consuming Washington about his relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, the questions that threaten his Presidency.
Aides who described his run-through said he seemed to tune out everything but the speech, no longer showing the touch of hesitancy and depression they had seen several days ago. "He's very sharp," said one White House official. "If you ask me how he does it, I have no idea."
Mr. Clinton still had 48 hours to weigh whether to change his speech to acknowledge the crisis concerning his personal behavior. Many of his senior aides say they flatly oppose such a course.
So it could very well be that Tuesday night will be more than a touch surreal, as both political parties, for their own distinct reasons, try to put an overlay of normalcy on an address that will not answer the questions most of Washington is asking.
Down Pennsylvania Avenue, Republican Congressional leaders prepared to tutor their legions to take the high road when Congress returns this week, aware that a damaged President will give them immense strategic and electoral opportunities.
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, who will deliver the official Republican response to the State of the Union, promised that Mr. Clinton would be greeted "appropriately" when he walks down the aisle of the House. "He is the President of the United States," Mr. Lott said on the ABC News program "This Week." "And we don't know what the facts are."
That was not the opposition party's attitude on Jan. 30, 1974. With the Watergate scandal entering its 20th month, many Congressional Democrats were sure of Mr. Nixon's guilt, and they hooted rudely when the President whose campaign aides had bugged the Democratic national headquarters promised new efforts to protect "the right of personal privacy for every American."
On that night Mr. Nixon proclaimed, "I have no intention whatever of ever walking away from the job that the people elected me to do for the people of the United States." Six months later he resigned.
Mr. Clinton has known how to rise above crisis before. Two winters ago, with his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury investigating Whitewater, he gazed up at the House gallery where she was watching his State of the Union Message. He called her "a wonderful wife, a magnificent mother." Six months later he gave his acceptance speech to the Democratic convention that had been rocked by the resignation of Dick Morris, the President's strategist, over an affair with a call girl.
Last year Mr. Clinton's State of the Union Message risked being blacked out on television by the second O. J. Simpson verdict. Now both high policy and the drama of scandal surround the speech, and White House officials anticipate 60 million viewers. "This could be one of the biggest audiences ever for a State of the Union," acknowledged one.
Mr. Clinton's advisers have long been aware that the public makes a distinction between what it thinks of Mr. Clinton the man and Mr. Clinton the President. For that reason many of his senior aides want him to remain determinedly Presidential, sticking to his long-planned themes about this moment in American history and the challenge of creating education and child-care programs to ease the transition to the new global economy, and urging a major effort to safeguard Social Security.
Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Clinton's senior adviser, said: "This is about the nation. You don't put on hold the needs of child care. You don't put on hold how we balance the budget. You don't put on hold America's leadership around the world."
Several experienced political speech writers agreed that the President would be best served by setting out his agenda for the year and avoiding the topic of Ms. Lewinsky.
"It's a close question of whether to make some allusion to it or not," said Ray Price, a wordsmith who worked with Mr. Nixon on his State of the Union addresses and his resignation speech. "I'd say probably not."
Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster, said: "He's got a huge audience ready to watch him for an hour, an hour and a half -- with him maybe two hours, you never know -- to talk about substance and talk about issues. It's just what the doctor ordered."
But David Gergen, a former adviser to Mr. Clinton, argued that Mr. Clinton should pursue a different course. "If there is truth to these allegations," he said on the "Fox News Sunday" program, "I believe that on Tuesday night the President should go before the country and confess serious error on his part and ask for public forgiveness."
The planning for the speech began months ago, right after the political high point of his second term -- the balanced-budget agreement with Congress. Last summer Mr. Clinton left for his vacation with a staff-prepared briefing book raising issues and policies that he could pursue in his final years in office.
In December the President sat down with his speech writers, led by Michael Waldman, and told them the thematic directions he wanted to take. Over Christmas, Mr. Clinton read memos and ideas drafted by prominent outside writers, including Prof. Benjamin Barber of Rutgers University and Joseph Ellis, the author of "American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas Jefferson."
By this afternoon, Mr. Clinton and his aides were working from the fifth draft. But for a moment on this extraordinary weekend of turmoil, Mr. Clinton seemed almost nostalgic for the chaotic nights when he and sleepless aides assembled his first State of the Union speeches a few years ago.
Saturday afternoon the President wandered into the Roosevelt Room of the White House, where several staff members were working on the speech changes he had dictated. He talked to them about how far ahead of the game they were. Then, said one aide, "he instructed the speech writers to work all night just for old time's sake."
Oddly, despite the furor inside the White House, aides asserted that the State of the Union Message was actually moving ahead of schedule, unaffected by the damage-control effort, the frantic legal maneuvering, the President's plummet in the polls. One aide said, "It's really easy for people here to be in quite different universes at the same time."

HEADLINE: Health Gap Grows, With Black Americans Trailing Whites, Studies Say

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24

 BODY:
A robust economy and years of Government pressure have helped move minority groups closer to the mainstream. But when it comes to health, studies show a stubborn, daunting and in some respects growing disparity between black and white Americans.
For decades, blacks have suffered higher death rates from nearly all major causes. Although life expectancy has increased for all groups, differences persist. And Government and academic research shows a widening gap between blacks and others in the incidences of asthma, diabetes, major infectious diseases and several forms of cancer. 
 The Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that from 1980 to 1994 the number of diabetes cases rose 33 percent among blacks, three times the increase among whites. The gap in cases of infectious diseases has grown by the same magnitude.
With breast cancer, the C.D.C. reports that from 1990 to 1995 the death rate for all women fell 10 percent, from 23.1 per 100,000 to 21. But black women's higher rate did not budge from 27.5 per 100,000.
The erosion of black Americans' health in relation to Americans at large stands in stark contrast to many blacks' advances in areas like jobs, education and housing that three decades of civil rights laws have helped promote.
In the economy of the 1990's, poverty among blacks has shrunk, and gaps in income have narrowed. Sociological barriers to economic progress like a high teen-age pregnancy rate have receded, too.
But blacks often receive less, and worse, health care than whites, analysts say, meaning that they are sicker than whites and typically die at about 70, six or seven years earlier than whites.
"We have a two-tiered health care system," said Dr. Randall Morgan, an orthopedic surgeon and a former president of the predominantly black National Medical Association.
Limited education, violence and addiction remain partly to blame. But Clinton Administration officials and analysts of health systems say they are finding growing evidence that race, discrimination and social and cultural factors influence the care people receive and, consequently, their health.
The chief White House adviser on health issues, Chris Jennings, said economic status was a big source of the gap. "But even if you control for that, race is huge," Mr. Jennings said. "If you pull out education, race is still huge."
The White House is grappling with new ways to address the problem, most likely in the President's budget proposal early next month. In response to a White House request, officials of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Health Care Financing Administration said they were compiling proposals to try to eliminate the gap after 2000.
Dr. Donald M. Berwick, a pediatrician in Boston and a member of President Clinton's commission on health care quality, said: "Tell me someone's race. Tell me their income. And tell me whether they smoke. The answers to those three questions will tell me more about their longevity and health status than any other questions I could possibly ask. There's no genetic blood test that would have anything like that for predictive value."
The growth of managed care, experts said, has had little effect. "The more we hear about the problems in the health care delivery system and managed care, the more the issues of minorities stand out," said Bailus Walker, health policy director for the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, which focuses on blacks.
Administrations since the 60's have been aware of the gap and have started dozens of programs, committees and conferences to tackle it.
The Department of Human Services has an Office of Minority Health, which among other activities publishes a newsletter, Closing the Gap. The department compiles ambitious annual reports on progress toward goals for 2000 to prolong healthy lives and reduce the disparities.
But the results are mixed. For many conditions that disproportionately touch blacks, including asthma, obesity, homicide, maternal mortality, diabetes and fetal alcohol syndrome, the report published in October shows the incidences not only falling short of the goals but also slipping in relation to the conditions in the late 80's and early 90's, on which the goals were based.
Dr. Morgan said Government attempts to reduce the gap were modest and subject to sporadic financing. "We get a program, and then it's over," he said. "We can't get a sustained effort. The tragic thing is it's costing America more and more every day to have the premature babies -- not the ones who die -- who go on to drain the health system's resources."
Public health programs begun in Mr. Clinton's tenure have made little more headway against the gap than those of prior Administrations, including Medicaid, the insurance program for the poor, and Medicare, the program for the elderly.
Programs that pay for prenatal care for mothers and nutrition and immunization for children have helped many additional children survive infancy. But deaths of black mothers in childbirth, although rare, jumped 48 percent from 1987 to 1995 (the rate soared in the late 1980's), compared with 7.6 percent for all mothers. And blacks still have two times the infant mortality rate of whites, a gap that has not changed in at least a decade.
Since the early 60's, the American Cancer Society said, black men's death rate from cancer rose 62 percent, compared with 19 percent for all American men. A gap in the incidence of prostate cancer has narrowed. But the incidence is 30 percent higher for black men, and 66 percent survive for five years, compared with 81 percent of white men.
In general, the nation has realized declining death rates from leading killers like heart attack, stroke and cancer. But blacks still suffer those and other disabling conditions sooner than whites.
 As a result, new research sponsored by the National Institute for Aging shows that blacks enjoy 56 years of reasonably good health, 8 years fewer than whites and Hispanic-Americans. In an institute survey, one-third of all blacks from 51 to 61 described their health as fair to poor, compared with one-fifth of all whites of the same ages.
 Kenneth G. Manton, director of the Center for Demographic Studies at Duke University, who wrote an analysis of the survey, said: "If you look at the total population, you find a significant decline in chronic disability and institutionalization for people 65 and older. But if you break it down among blacks and whites, you find almost all the improvement is among whites."
 Concern about the gap has entered White House planning for Mr. Clinton's last two years in office. It has risen with experts' doubts that the enactment last year of a five-year $24 million plan to provide care to half the 10 million uninsured children would help reduce the disparities.
 Administration officials expect Mr. Clinton, in his budget message, to ask for additional money to improve minority groups' health. In addition, the officials say, he could ask for revisions of Government health programs so that additional people like nurses and physicians in minority communities join in working on the stubborn roots of the gap.
 The issue is also entering other arenas. The President's advisory board on race, which has been dwelling mostly on discriminatory barriers to economic opportunity, has begun soliciting testimony on health.
Dr. Berwick said he and other members of the health commission were urging the commission to include a proposal to close the gap in the panel's final report in March.
 To curry support to close the gap, the President is likely to define the issue in terms of minority health, not simply black health.
 Other minority groups suffer from some diseases more than blacks. Indians have higher levels of diabetes. Hispanic-Americans tend to suffer more fatal and disabling strokes. Puerto Rican children have the highest incidence of asthma.
The C.D.C. reports that in 1996, tuberculosis among Asian-Americans was nearly 15 times higher than among whites and nearly twice the level for blacks.
But as the largest minority group and the one with the highest death rates from most diseases, blacks arouse the most concern.
"There is a minority group that is very disadvantaged with respect to health, and that's African-Americans," said Samuel H. Preston, a demographer and dean of the School of Arts and Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania. "It's not a minority problem. It's a black problem."
The intractability of the gap is stirring searches for explanations beyond the conventional one of disproportionately low income. Hispanic-Americans, too, are relatively poor and are much less likely to have health insurance than any other group. Yet the C.D.C. finds that they stay healthy longer than non-Hispanic whites, as well as blacks.
 Research has shown slight, apparently genetic, predispositions among blacks for prostate cancer, sickle cell anemia and underweight births. But analysts say the major disparities arise less from inherent differences among races than from attitudes toward the races and unequal care.
A study in October in The New England Journal of Medicine suggested something peculiarly American to being black and unhealthy beyond genes. For the study, two neonatologists in Chicago, Drs. James Collins and Richard David, surveyed the birth weights of all children born in Illinois from 1980 to 1995. They isolated the lowest-risk group of mothers, from 20 to 39, who were college educated, married to college-educated men, had prenatal care in their first trimesters and had no prior miscarriages or stillbirths.
The researchers found that 2.4 percent of the 12,361 American-born white mothers delivered underweight babies, compared with 3.6 percent of 608 mothers living in Illinois and born in sub-Saharan Africa, and 7.4 percent for American-born black mothers.
"These findings discredit the genetic theory of race as it applies to birth weight," the doctors said in a paper presented in November to the annual meeting of the American Public Health Association. "To understand this thing called race, we must turn our attention to the institutions and attitudes which perpetuate and justify unequal treatment of people on the basis of their physical appearance, language or culture."
 In hospitals and clinics, said Sara Rosenbaum, director of the Center for Health Policy Research at George Washington University here, blacks often receive worse care than whites. "When you take black and white Americans," Ms. Rosenbaum said, "and exactly the same situation like being hospitalized for a heart attack and having the same insurance, the chance that the black patient will get the advanced care is much less than it is for the white patient. The medical system appears to treat them differently."
Analysts say solutions require attention to the health conditions of the very young, before the effects of poverty, toxic environments, bad diets, violence and untreated disease.
 "Policy that only deals with people in their 50's is going to have a minor impact on eliminating differences because a series of health shocks has happened already," said James P. Smith, a senior economist at the Rand Corporation who testified this month before the race commission.
Policy goals should also change, said Dr. Berwick in Boston.
"It isn't enough to say we're going to close the gap by equalizing services," he said. "I don't think that's the heart of the problem. It's not equality of access. It's equality of result that we should seek."

State Study Concludes Casinos Benefit Citizens

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY

 BODY:
In a report that praised the state's gambling industry, state officials said Atlantic City's casinos had generated more than $7 billion in Federal, state and local tax revenue over the last 20 years and currently employ nearly 50,000 workers.
The study, by the State Casino Control Commission, was released to officials of the National Gambling Impact Study Commission, a Federal panel that visited Atlantic City last week to study the social and economic impact of legalized gambling. 
 The state commission's report said Atlantic City's casinos, which have an annual payroll of more than $1 billion, had increased local property values to more than $6 billion from $319 million since casino gambling was established in New Jersey in 1976.
The nine-member Federal commission, which made Atlantic City the first stop on its nationwide fact-gathering tour, also heard a report on the negative effects of gambling from critics of the industry. Kevin O'Neill, deputy director of the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey, told the commission that there are an estimated 4.4 million pathological gamblers nationwide, and argued that neither the casino industry nor state officials are doing enough to help problem gamblers.

HEADLINE: Separate Jobs for Blind Spur a Spirited Debate

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
On the fourth floor of a factory in Long Island City, Queens, Clifton Harrell deftly handles heavy machinery to trim, bend and assemble toilet bowl brushes, 150 dozen a day. His hands are a blur; his body, a study in efficient motion.
"It's a lot of work, but once you get used to it, it's like clockwork," said Mr. Harrell, wiping a bead of sweat from his forehead. Then, cocking his head toward the ground, he added, "And I got Austin here." 
 Austin is Mr. Harrell's seeing-eye dog.
Mr. Harrell is an employee at the only factory in New York City that, with the exception of some supervisors, hires only people who are legally blind. The factory, run by a nonprofit organization called New York City Industries for the Blind, produces mops, brooms and reflector vests for numerous clients, including the city's Housing Authority and Police Department.
Inside the factory, there are the same monotonous sounds associated with any production line. But there is also a clearly marked path snaking around the factory floor, a path painted in bright black and yellow stripes, showing workers who can distinguish bright colors how to proceed. Over the path is a clothesline on which people can hook their canes as they walk. And scattered about the workplace are seeing-eye dogs who stay next to their owners.
The factory has grown since its founding in March 1996, with revenue of $7.5 million in its first year and an expected $8.5 million in its second. It has grown from 30 blind employees to more than 50 today. But with that expansion has come some protest, from other organizations serving the blind.
"I think that segregated facilities of any sort, be they schools for minorities or work environments for people with disabilities, are detrimental to the participants," said Betty Bird, senior vice president for rehabilitation programs and services at the Lighthouse Inc., a nonprofit organization in New York City. "It sets up reverberations in people's minds that the only place blind people can work is in a blind environment, and it's an archaic message from the 19th century."
Those who support what are sometimes called sheltered workshops say that however noble the idea of blind and sighted people working side by side, the reality is that mainstream jobs are hard for the blind to obtain.
"I applaud those organizations for wanting to aim as high as we can," said Carl Augusto, president of the American Foundation for the Blind, alluding to the Lighthouse and other groups. "But the reality is that there are too many blind people who are unemployed who want to be employed."
The debate over how to help the blind find work without seeming patronizing or hard-hearted is important to the estimated 1.1 million people in the United States who are classified as legally blind: people with vision of 20/200 or less.
Of the 115,000 people in New York State registered as legally blind with the New York Commission for the Blind and Visually Handicapped, about 50,000 live in New York City. The city, with its intricate subway and bus routes, has a comprehensive transportation system accessible to the blind. And it is home to several national organizations serving the blind.
"Clearly and quite obviously, New York City is a major population center, with the largest organizations serving the blind in the country," said Thomas Robertson, associate commissioner of the Commission for the Blind and Visually Handicapped. "Do they lead the parade on many of these issues? I suspect that they do."
Sheltered workshops began appearing in 1938 after Congress passed the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act to assist blind people who wanted to work. Some organizations for the blind then opened factories that produced brooms, mops and other products using simple, repetitive methods. And for years, New York City was home to several such workshops, run by organizations such as the Jewish Guild for the Blind, Helen Keller Services for the Blind and the Lighthouse.
But by the early 1990's, with the widespread use of walking canes and voice-activated computers, most organizations had phased out the workshops, feeling that the blind had become better equipped to get mainstream jobs.
Now, Marc Maurer, president of the National Federation of the Blind, a nonprofit organization, believes that job-training programs and increasing understanding of the blind are more effective tools in integrating blind workers into these jobs. Some blind people agree.
"If you're all segregated, no one gets an impression that we're people just like anyone else," said John Kolnsberg, 32, who lost his vision after he was shot in 1995. Now he works as a radio dispatcher for Consolidated Edison, in an office with about 30 people, none of them blind. "Of course they know I'm blind, but we work well together, and it's an education for everyone."
But Richard C. Bland, president and chief executive of the New York City Industries for the Blind, described that approach as the function of a "social worker" mentality and said he believes that his organization's approach is more realistic.
Only 45.6 percent of people between the ages of 21 to 64 who are visually impaired, or about 2.1 million people, are employed. So to give the blind more opportunities, Mr. Bland founded the Long Island City factory.
"This is not a charity," said Mr. Bland, a businessman who had worked as a marketing executive for packaged goods and liquor companies. "It's not, 'Oh my, let's help them out.' This is a business. They come. They work. They grumble like everyone else."
The average wage is $6.25 an hour, with a high of $9.50 an hour -- above minimum, but well below what unionized workers would make. The 50 or so blind employees also get disability, life and health insurance.
As a nonprofit organization, New York City Industries for the Blind benefits from a Federal law that designates such organizations as "preferred providers" when seeking contracts. At the same time, these organizations must provide products of equal or better quality for a competitive price or lose the contract. Workplace conditions are also inspected by the United States General Services Administration and the New York State Labor Department.
Phyllis Callender, a seamstress at the Long Island City factory, said, "It beats sitting home and doing nothing." And Mr. Harrell says he gets to work early, at 7 A.M., to have coffee and chat with his co-workers.
"We share a bond because we're in the same position and we need help here and there," he said. "But to tell you the truth, I don't miss my eyes that much because I can handle myself in the dark. And some of the things that's happening out there -- frankly, I don't want to see."

Indonesia Introduces Key Banking Changes

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Tuesday, Jan. 27

 BODY:
With Indonesia's banking system slowing almost to a halt, the Finance Ministry announced a package of measures today that is intended to restart the flow of money into the economy.
The package included guarantees on bank deposits, an end to all curbs on the foreign ownership of banks, and the creation of a special agency that would rehabilitate ailing banks. Those banks would then be merged or sold. 
 "Over the last several months, the waves of economic difficulties have been taking a heavy toll on the health of the banking system," Finance Minister Marie Muhammad said in a statement. "Foreign banks have become increasingly reluctant to accept Indonesian letters of credit, making it difficult for the country to obtain vital imports. Even domestic banks have become reluctant to lend to each other."
Advance word of the package on Monday received generally positive reaction from financial analysts here, though some concerns were expressed on greater foreign ownership of banks. "There is the possibility of foreign banks ending up dominating the banking system here, which would be unacceptable, I think," said Gus Papanek, a Boston-based economist now in Jakarta.
The banking changes were not considered a cure-all for the deep economic damage that has also become a political crisis here, causing a widespread loss of confidence.
Investors have retreated from doing business with Indonesia because of uncertainty about the political future of President Suharto, who appears intent on a seventh five-year term in March, despite wide dissatisfaction with his 32-year rule.
Investors are also waiting to see how the country grapples with $65 billion in dollar-denominated foreign debt owed by private companies, which has grown ever more expensive for the companies as the value of the Indonesian currency, the rupiah, deteriorates.
A new austerity program that Mr. Suharto signed two weeks ago in connection with the International Monetary Fund's $40 billion rescue package failed to restore market confidence. These continuing worries have been put in sharp focus by a near shutdown of the banking system.
"Everything has been cut off," a foreign banker here said. "People have been having their lines of credit cut off for the last month and a half. All foreign banks are scared stiff that there may be a debt moratorium, and they are doing all they can to cut, cut, cut, and get back everything they can. But they still don't have a grip on who owes what to whom."
The problems in banking originated with an easing of regulations in 1988 that enabled poorly schooled financiers to open banks as sources of cash for their private projects.
Economists have warned that Indonesia's 200 banks are far too many for the size of the economy, but their consolidation had been politically difficult until the current financial crisis set in.
When the economy began to sour last year, the banking system began to buckle under the weight of the sharply falling currency and fewer and fewer payments on the private dollar debt. Overseas banks retreated, reducing or ending rupiah transactions, and in some cases, cutting Indonesian banks out of the interbank trading system that allows cash to move through the system.
With their flow of dollars reduced, many banks have stopped making loans and curtailed other kinds of banking transactions. Capital levels are dangerously low. Credit is almost impossible to obtain, causing economic activity to stagnate.
"Local banks like ours need the money because of phenomenal cash withdrawals at all our branches," an Indonesian bank manager said last week. "If we are unable to honor our depositors' obligations, that will create a chain reaction within the system."
The rupiah continued falling Monday, dropping 15 percent but then rebounding to close the day at 12,950 to the dollar, down 1.5 percent from its price here late Friday and down more than 50 percent since the start of 1998. This morning, it eased again, trading at 13,300 to the dollar.
Indonesian stocks were up more than 2 percent at the opening early today.
I.M.F. officials said Indonesia had about $20 billion in foreign currency reserves, enough to keep the economy from collapsing in the short run but not enough to address the larger problems.
In recent days, the nation's central bank has been purchasing rupiah with dollars to help slow the domestic currency's descent, in the process reducing the supply of rupiah in circulation.
But this has done little to strengthen confidence in the currency.
"What is its value?" the foreign banker said. "It's meaningless. It's worth one thing Monday, and it changes five times during the week. It may be 50 percent higher or lower on Friday. If you're going to buy anything, how do you reach a price?"
The near cutoff of loans and other forms of credit have hobbled Indonesian exports at a time the country is relying on them to revive the economy. "The export sector is paralyzed," said Linda Lym, a specialist on Southeast Asian economies at the University of Michigan. "They can't import materials. It's not just a question of the exchange rate; it's a question of credit. So it all comes down to the banking system."

HEADLINE: Denver's Dot on Map Swells in the Afterglow

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: DENVER, Jan. 26

 BODY:
Cow town no more, Denver today was the Broncos' town.
A stylized stallion with its flame-orange mane reigned over the city as residents savored their first Super Bowl victory, a civic boost after 20 years of humiliations, including four losses in National Football League championship games. 
 Bronco-mania, which tinted orange and blue everything from hair to sneakers, swept Mile High Stadium this afternoon as thousands of fans vanished from work or school to greet players from the Broncos' 31-24 victory over last year's champions, the Green Bay Packers.
"This just changes everything," said Daniel Munoz, a barber who has held season tickets to the team since 1968. "We have seen some terrible teams, some real heart breakers."
Between clips, he added, "I have never seen so many happy, grinning faces on a Monday morning."
During the game, a cliffhanger, several pregnant women in Denver went into premature labor, perhaps aided by the excitement.
John Elway, the 37-year-old Bronco quarterback, enjoys such exalted status that he could have a seat in Congress if he wanted it, one Republican National Committee official said today. Representative Dan Schaefer, a Republican who has represented West Denver's suburbs for 15 years, announced today that he would not run for re-election this fall.
This morning, some downtown store owners complained that the euphoria went overboard.
"Today, everyone is so calm, but yesterday they were so wild," Wonnie Geam, manager of the Colorado Souvenir Shop, said as she cleaned up broken glass and arranged a table of Broncos' T-shirts, the only remaining memorabilia from a few frenzied minutes of looting.
In a replay of violence seen here two years ago when the Colorado Avalanche won hockey's Stanley Cup, football fans spilled out of sports bars Sunday night, setting bonfires, overturning cars, throwing bottles at the police and smashing two dozen store display windows.
Chief David Michaud of the Denver police, who was hit in the throat with a rock, estimated about 40 people were injured and 20 arrested. With about 10,000 fans clogging a downtown area, police used so much tear gas to clear the streets that they had to ask for fresh supplies from neighboring police departments.
Up and down the foothills of the Rockies, in Boulder, Colorado Springs, Fort Collins and Greeley, the victory of the underdog Broncos sparked wild street parties.
Today, Coloradans seemed to walk a littler taller in the winter sunshine.
"Because we won, people won't look at us as the dumpy team in the N.F.L.," said one long-suffering fan, Jennifer Googins, as she shopped here for Broncos souvenirs. "This puts Denver on the map."
Putting Denver on the map has been a civic goal since the town was founded during the gold rush of 1858.
Five hundred miles from the nearest major city and 1,000 miles from the nearest seaport, Denver, an English visitor wrote a century ago, looks like a city carried by angels who got tired and just dropped it in the middle of nowhere.
To fight isolation, Denver's early promoters published fictional steamship timetables for the landlocked city and drilled through the Rockies to create an artificial railroad hub. In the last decade, they made sure the Federal Government spent billions of dollars building the nation's most modern airport and the final segment of the 43,000-mile interstate highway system.
"I call it bypass phobia," Thomas J. Noel, a University of Colorado history professor, said. "The Super Bowl victory draws national attention, in a positive, happy way, to a city that always hungered for attention, that always was afraid that, because of its isolation, it would get lost."
On Tuesday afternoon, a parade to celebrate the victory will travel down 17th Avenue ("the Wall Street of the Rockies") and through United Nations Plaza, a failed marketing ploy by the Chamber of Commerce to lure the United Nations headquarters here after World War II.
The Super Bowl victory dovetails with modern Denver's civic ambitions to jump from "capital of the Rocky Mountain empire" to world-class city.
And evidence of Denver's new prominence abounds. In 1993, nearly 400,000 people attended a World Youth Day Mass here led by Pope John Paul II; in 1995, the city's new baseball stadium and $5 billion airport opened to wide acclaim; and last year, the city smoothly handled the two Oklahoma City Federal bombing trials and the annual summit of leaders of the world's eight most powerful nations.
In a city with a booming high-technology economy and a population of migrants, major league sports have provided much of the civic glue.
"The Broncos, like many of us in this fast-growing region, are relative newcomers to Colorado," The Denver Post wrote in an editorial today about players on a team that has been here for 38 years. "In this state of transplants, our sports teams promoted a sense of community."
Far from couch potatoes, Denverites participate in sports as much as they watch them. About 23 percent of the two million people in the Denver metropolitan area ski or snowboard regularly. The region is the nation's largest market for winter sports.
With all the skiing, hiking, rock climbing and mountain biking, Coloradans are, on average, the thinnest people in the nation, according to a recent study by the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Only 19.9 percent of Coloradans are overweight, compared with 26.7 percent of all Americans.
"This is a very sports-oriented city," said Doug Morton, president of Gart Sports Company.
Mr. Morton returned today from the game in San Diego to find that people had started lining up in front of his stores at 3 A.M. to buy Broncos championship caps and shirts.
"The Super Bowl win will help identify Denver as the premiere pro-sports city in the nation today," he said, citing the Broncos, the Avalanche and the Rockies, the baseball team. The only fly in the ointment is the Nuggets, which rank at the bottom of the National Basketball Association, with a season record of 3 victories and 38 losses.
The Super Bowl victory gives a boost to a plan by Broncos' owner, Pat Bowlen, to ask Denver voters later this year to approve a $180 million sales tax contribution to build a $300 million football stadium.
With a half-million fans expected to turn out for the parade, Mr. Morton said, "based on what has happened in the last 24 hours, I can't imagine the city turning down the stadium."

Character Suicide

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
I understand that Paula Jones is not a choir girl. I understand that Linda Tripp is motivated by an intense dislike for the President. I understand that Lucianne Goldberg was seeking more than just truth. I understand that Kenneth Starr is a partisan Republican out to get the President. I understand that Monica Lewinsky was a naive 21-year-old intern who may have exaggerated her relationship with Bill Clinton.
I understand, and detest, all the putrid smoke surrounding this story. But what I don't understand is the spark of fire that ignited it. I don't understand how someone entrusted with the opportunity to lead this country at such a great time, how someone whose political agenda was so substantively appealing -- on issues from abortion to education to the global economy -- could risk it all on a dalliance with a White House intern. 
 Yes, I know we don't know the full story. I know we haven't heard the President's full disclosure. But I've heard enough non-denial denials to know that whether this was an "emotional" relationship, a "special" relationship, a "not improper" relationship or some sort of backroom clothes-on relationship, the President was involved with someone in a way he should never have been and by doing so he has let down all of those who believed, if not in him personally, in the policies he was elected to implement.
Those who identified with many of the domestic, and some of the foreign, policies of the Clinton agenda made a Faustian bargain. We overlooked Mr. Clinton's past indiscretions -- he was hardly the first politician with testosterone overload -- on the condition that he pursue his agenda and postpone his next dalliance until after he left the White House. But he broke the bargain. I knew he was a charming rogue with an appealing agenda, but I didn't think he was a reckless idiot with an appealing agenda.
You feel that you just don't know this President anymore. You feel that you had a read on him, and that when you weighed his personal warts against his policy convictions, and then compared those same strengths and weaknesses against Bob Dole or George Bush or Ross Perot, the Faustian bargain with Mr. Clinton came out ahead. But now you really have to wonder. Who is he? He has clearly crossed some line that one always assumed would never be crossed in the bargain.
And that's why what worries me now is not that he is going to be impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors, but that he has impeached himself with low crimes and Miss-demeanors. It is one thing for a President to have low poll ratings. A President with low poll ratings can change policies to reverse his standing, or wait until his policies vindicate him. But what do we do with a President whose character is impeached, but who is himself not impeachable? What do we do with a President whose policies are still critically important, but who is so personally discredited they become difficult to sell or sustain?
That is the real question we are about to face. I am sure that those who argue that the country cares a lot more about Dow Jones than Paula Jones are right. But what happens if the two collide? What happens if the President can't rally the nation in the next Dow Jones crisis, because he's had one too many Paula Jones crises? What happens if he can't restrain Saddam because he couldn't restrain himself?
The President is planning to give his State of the Union speech tonight on one of the most important issues of his era: how the global economy is reshaping our lives, our workplaces and our communities, and how we need to design more effective institutions to cushion those most brutalized by that economy and to prevent its worst excesses -- like the Asian contagion -- from lapping up on our shores. But you can be sure that all anyone will remember from this speech is how Hillary looked when the camera panned to her in the gallery, or how loudly the Congress applauded when the President rose to speak.
It is hard to really hear what a President has to say when you are too embarrassed to look him in the eye.
As I said, there are a lot of things here we thought we knew and it turns out that we didn't. But there is one thing I was sure of before and am still sure of now: Supporters of Mr. Clinton's agenda deserved better from him -- a lot better.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Prices Rally After Friday's Sharp Selloff as Dollar Gains

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Bond prices rallied yesterday and the dollar rebounded a little as investors seemed to shift their attention to the positive economic fundamentals supporting both markets.
But this shift came only after a sharp selloff of both bonds and dollars last week. While much of the selling followed a strong rally the previous two weeks and was set off by the kind of reassessment that is normal after such a quick run-up, President Clinton's sex scandal appeared to accelerate the selling, analyst and traders said. 
 Yesterday, the price of the 30-year bond jumped 1 1/4, to 103 1/4, as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 5.89 percent, from 5.96 percent on Friday. But the 30-year yield is still well above the recent low of 5.69 percent Jan. 12. Yields on shorter-term Treasury securities also declined.
The dollar rose 1 percent against the German mark, finishing at 1.7956 in late New York trading, compared with 1.7774 on Friday. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was 1 percent higher at 126.85 from 125.57. But the dollar is still off 2.3 percent against the mark and 5.5 percent against the yen since its recent highs.
The rebound in bonds yesterday was in part just a bounce from the sharp selloff. "The market got way ahead of itself on Friday on issues that don't look as scary on Monday," said Russ Sheldon, senior economist at MCM, a market research firm.
He said that although some investors were selling last week because the economy had yet to show signs of an expected slowdown, the outlook for inflation was still so positive that it should be "enough to keep bonds from topping 6 percent for the time being." If he is right, that made the yield of 5.96 percent quite attractive.
On the dollar, the rally was also partly just a bounce after a sharp fall. But President Clinton's strong denial yesterday of an affair with a former White House intern or any attempt at a cover-up also helped the American currency, traders said.
"His statement was something the market wanted to hear," said Robert White, a senior vice president at Standard Chartered Bank. "It is important for this market to see the President in command."
"There is only so much a market can discount something like this before it has a correction," Mr. White said, especially when the scandal is based on allegations and the President has denied them. "We are doing this all on hot air," he added.
But as the Clinton scandal continues to unfold, analysts were lengthening their lists of reasons why the scandal could affect bonds, stocks and the dollar. One comes from Michael P. Andrews, a director in the government relations office of Salomon Smith Barney in Washington. The possible impact is worrisome enough for him to conclude: "We are in for a bumpy ride, so we recommend fastening the seat belts."
He said the crisis could diminish the chances for approval of so-called fast track authority to facilitate Congressional approval of trade agreements. It could undermine the effort to strengthen Asia by making it difficult for the President to win more assistance for the International Monetary Fund. The crisis could make it harder for him to limit the spending, either for tax cuts or new Government programs, of expected budget surpluses. And the President may now be less likely to focus on the restructuring of Social Security.
"When he has a hostile Congress and you throw this on top of it," said Mr. White of Standard Chartered of the Washington scandal, "that has an effect in markets."

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases;
Charting a Life's Course With the Help of a Suit

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
Like many 17-year-olds in New York City, Jayson Mines favors oversize trousers and clunky sneakers that look as if they house rocket boosters. But when it came time to find a part-time job last month, Jayson, a high school junior, knew his street clothes might not impress potential employers.
"You can't exactly go on interviews wearing this," he said, glancing down at overalls so expansive they could be mistaken for maternity wear. 
 As one of four children sharing a two-bedroom apartment on East 102d Street, Jayson did not ask his mother, an unemployed correction officer, to outfit him for his job search. "She has enough trouble putting food on the table," said the lanky, soft-spoken teen-ager, who gathers his crown of meticulously woven braids in a ponytail. "My mom would buy me whatever I want, but I hate to be a burden."
Last month, a job-training counselor at the Children's Aid Society took Jayson shopping on 106th Street, where he picked out a navy suit, black loafers and two conservative ties. The clothes cost $250 and were paid for by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, which supports the Children's Aid Society and six other charities in the city.
Midge Caparosa, who runs the society's job-readiness program in East Harlem, has been teaching Jayson and other teen-agers the A B C's of finding work. The program helps them write crisp resumes, offers them interviewing tips and makes sure they know how to knot their ties properly. "It's amazing the way clothing transforms a kid," said Ms. Caparosa, explaining that a suit and tie can bolster a teen-ager's self-confidence. "It really makes them feel and act grown up."
Equally important is the effect a well-tailored suit can have on how teen-agers like Jayson are perceived. "If a young black man wears a suit, you can bet he'll get more respect," said his mother, Carol Lilly.
When a nattily dressed Jayson showed up for his interview at the Rainbow Pharmacy at Third Avenue and 29th Street, Tom Accomando, the manager, was awestruck. "I asked him if he was coming in to interview for my job," he said jokingly.
The suit apparently had the desired effect. Jayson landed the stock clerk position that very day. It also helped that he had a polished resume and that the report card he brought along had an unbroken string of A's. "I told him he ought to be tutoring my kids," Mr. Accomando said.
A year ago, Jayson might not have made such a favorable impression. He had stopped going to classes at the High School of Art and Design and was spending his days playing basketball or watching television at a friend's apartment. "I guess I just lost interest in school," Jayson said. "I get distracted easily."
Those distractions included several peers who had recently dropped out. "He thought playing hooky would be a lot of fun," said his mother, who was initially unaware of his truancy because Jayson had intercepted notices that arrived in the mail.
But after five months he lost interest in idleness, too. With encouragement from Ms. Caparosa and other counselors at the East Harlem Children's Center, he returned to school last fall. To make up for lost time, he enrolled in night school as well. These days he is maintaining a 93 average and works afternoons and weekends at the pharmacy, where he makes $5.15 an hour. He has already earned $700, more than half of which he has saved.
"Jayson is heading in the right direction, but he's not out of the woods yet," said Ms. Caparosa, who has come to know him well during the five years he has gone to the center. "There are a lot of negative pulls in that neighborhood."
More than ever, Jayson says he is clear about his goals. He wants to go to college for computer science (inspired, he said, by the I.B.M. computer the center gave him last year). He knows he has to keep up his grades if he wants his pick of schools. "I also know I'll never be a bum on the street," he said.
Asked what kind of career he wants, Jayson shrugged. "That I don't know yet," he said. "But at least I know that whatever it is, I want to work in an office and wear a suit."

HEADLINE: Home Resales Off in December, Up for Year

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 26

 BODY:
Home resales declined in December for the second consecutive month but set a record for the full year, the National Association of Realtors said today.
Resales are expected to remain strong this year, aided by low mortgage rates, healthy job growth and rising incomes. 
 In December, resales fell 2.1 percent, to an annual rate of 4.29 million, after a decline in November of two-tenths of 1 percent. In the year, though, resales rose 3.1 percent, to a record 4.22 million, from 4.09 million in 1996, the previous record.
Home resales last month rose in the Northeast, fell in the South and West and were unchanged in the Midwest. The resales are an important measure of the housing industry's health. Previously owned homes account for about 85 percent of all single-family home sales.
"Home sales in January should be taking off," judging from the recent strength in mortgage applications, said Russ Sheldon, an economist at MCM Moneywatch in New York. "The housing industry could scarcely have stronger fundamentals."
That helps other parts of the economy. Jonathan Basile, an economist at HSBC Securities Inc. in New York, said. "Consumers who purchased these homes will likely be spending for furniture and home furnishings," he said. "This will be an engine for consumer spending growth in 1998."

HEADLINE: Teacher Groups to Merge, Creating Largest U.S. Union

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
The nation's two largest teachers' unions announced a preliminary merger plan yesterday that would create the largest union in the nation's history, with 3.2 million members.
The leaders of the National Education Association, with 2.3 million members, and the American Federation of Teachers, with 950,000 members, said the merger was intended to give teachers a more powerful voice when the nation's public schools and public school teachers are under heavy attack. 
 "As forces unite to undermine our foundation of democracy -- public schools -- defenders of public education must unite as well," said Bob Chase, president of the National Education Association.
Under the merger plan, Mr. Chase and Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of Teachers, would both be called "founding presidents" of the new union, whose name has yet to be determined.
The National Education Association is currently the nation's largest union, with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters No. 2, at 1.4 million members. In the teamsters' heyday in the 1970's, it was the largest union in the nation's history, with 2.5 million members.
"This merger is very, very important," said Marjorie Murphy, a Swarthmore College history professor who has written a book on the two unions. "It's the biggest union merger in history. The leaders of the two unions have sought such a merger since 1972 because they know they would be stronger if they unite."
The merger plan comes after Bob Dole, the Republican Presidential candidate in 1996, angrily accused teachers' unions of having too much power and opposing educational overhauls. The plan comes at a time when the teachers' unions feel besieged by criticisms that public schools are failing and by the conservative push for school vouchers to help move students from public schools to private ones.
Ms. Feldman became the A.F.T's president last year after the death of Albert Shanker, the longtime president who turned the union into a powerhouse. Some union leaders said Mr. Shanker had set up numerous roadblocks to completing a merger.
Ms. Feldman, who recently announced that she was stepping down as president of New York City's teachers' federation, said the merger would enable the union to devote more resources to defending public education and improving schools and devote fewer resources to inter-union squabbles.
In the past, the two unions have often fought head-to-head and spent liberally to recruit teachers in the same school districts.
Teachers' union officials also pointed to another form of what they called destructive competition: many times leaders of one of the unions would be reluctant to back controversial changes, like making it easier for school districts to ease out poorly performing teachers, for fear that they would be undercut by officials from the competing union.
In an interview, Mr. Feldman said, "Instead of using resources that we now use fighting each other, we can do a lot more in the way of helping our locals that are trying to do something about failing schools, about safety, about improving public education."
Under the plan announced today, delegates from the two unions are scheduled to vote at conventions this summer on whether to approve the merger. The accord calls for the merger to take place in 2002, and for 15 members from each union to sit on a new executive board.
Although both Mr. Chase, who is 55, and Ms. Feldman who is 58, would be called presidents, the plan states that Mr. Chase would have the constitutional duties of president during an interim period, while Ms. Feldman would have the duties of executive vice president.
Officials from the two unions said many details remained to be hammered out before a formal merger agreement is put to a vote. The two unions have to agree on language for a constitution, on how to merge the state and local affiliates of the two organizations, on what the national dues rate should be and on how to elect delegates to conventions.
"We still have a lot of issues to resolve," Mr. Chase said.
A major sticking point was whether the new organization would affiliate itself with the 13 million-member A.F.L.-C.I.0. The American Federation of Teachers belongs to the umbrella group, and the N.E.A. does not, but the plan calls for the merged union to join, a move that is expected to significantly expand the labor federation's power and reach.
The merger plan calls for the union to pay dues to the A.F.L.-C.I.O. for just 1.4 million of the new organization's 3.2 million members. Under the plan, the new union would pay dues for more than 1.4 million members as local and state affiliates of the education association decide on their own to join local and state A.F.L.-C.I.O. units.
For decades, many N.E.A. members have been happy to remain outside the A.F.L.-C.I.O. They did not want their dues going to the federation, and many felt uncomfortable with being in a federation with teamsters, laborers and other unions with a corrupt past.
The National Education Association was founded in 1857, and for decades its members looked askance at unions, seeing them as groupings of lowly manual workers. Instead, the group's members considered themselves professionals and modeled their association after the American Medical Association.
From its inception in 1916, the American Federation of Teachers had a different concept; it fought from the start to win teachers the right to form unions and bargain collectively.
It was in the 1960's, when the A.F.T., led by its chapter in New York, won the right to bargain in many cities and won some impressive contracts, that many members of the National Education Association warmed up to the idea of collective bargaining. In the early 1970's, the N.E.A. began calling itself a union, as it saw the more militant teachers' federation repeatedly trounce it in contests to recruit teachers from dozens of school districts.
In 1968, some N.E.A. members grew uncomfortable with the A.F.T.'s approach when Albert Shanker, the forceful leader of the federation's New York City affiliate, led a racially divisive 55-day strike over school decentralization. Mr. Shanker became president of the teachers' federation in 1974, and many members of the N.E.A. viewed him as too combative a figure.
Despite doubts among some of the rank-and-file, leaders of the two unions began calling for a merger in the 1970's, seeing little benefit from having the two organizations compete with each other.
Often, when one union signed a contract with a school district, the rival group would boast to teachers that it could obtain even better wages and fringe benefits. This sometimes caused the teachers to sign on with the new union, which, after making extravagant promises, had to lead its members out on strike because school boards refused to agree to its tougher demands.
Formal merger talks began in 1993, but some union officials said that the negotiations had been stalled for several years, partly because Mr. Shanker, the A.F.T.'s longtime president, threw up obstacles to an accord that would result in his union being subsumed by a larger grouping. Union officials said the merger talks picked up momentum after Mr. Shanker died last year.
In New York State, the American Federation of Teachers represents the lion's share of teachers, so the proposed merger is expected to have little effect on reducing competition between the two teachers' unions. Nonetheless, teachers' federation officials predict that the merger will give them a more powerful political voice in New York by putting the N.E.A.'s considerable treasury behind their political efforts.
In this way, the merger is expected to help the teachers counter critics like Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, who has run recent television advertisements attacking the teachers' unions and accusing them of being a selfish lobby that blocks change.
The vast majority of public-school teachers in Connecticut and New Jersey belong to the N.E.A., although the A.F.T. represents teachers in some big cities, including Newark.
The teachers' announcement merger is part of a growing trend within the labor movement. While both teachers' unions have been growing, most mergers have involved unions with declining memberships that agreed to combine in order to increase their flagging clout and to create economies of scale in representing their members.
The biggest previously announced merger involved the 1995 decision of three unions that have been losing members: the United Auto Workers, the United Steelworkers of America and the International Association of Machinists. The merger, which has not yet been finalized, would form a union with two million members.
Another major merger was announced last month when 1199, the National Hospital and Human Service Employees Union, announced plans to join the Service Employees International Union.

HEADLINE: Alter Law on Contractors, Giuliani Urges Legislators

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 26

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani proposed a compromise today to a burdensome and widely unpopular law among some politicians that requires government officials to hire at least four separate contractors for certain construction projects.
For decades, local officials have railed against the statute, known as the Wicks Law, arguing that it inflates the cost of construction projects, but its defenders in the State Assembly, backed by politically powerful trade unions, have always saved it from repeal. 
 Under the 77-year-old law, government agencies must hire at least four separate contractors for any project worth $50,000 or more: one each for general construction, heating, plumbing and electrical work. In most other states, such jobs are awarded to a single general contractor, who can then hire subcontractors.
Economists and local officials say that the Wicks Law results in construction costs that are 10 to 30 percent higher than necessary, a waste of hundreds of millions of dollars a year statewide.
Speaking today at a joint Senate-Assembly hearing on the 1998-99 state budget, Mr. Giuliani proposed that the Legislature allow local governments to escape the Wicks provision, on the condition that they devote half of any savings to renovating and building schools for perhaps 10 years. He estimated that the change would provide New York City with $60 million a year for school construction.
"It would be an influx of dollars that is badly needed right now," Mayor Giuliani said.
Gov. George E. Pataki was quick to endorse the idea. And the Mayor tapped into an issue that is foremost in the mind of the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, who has said that seeking more state money for school construction will be his highest budget priority this year. Last year, Mr. Silver championed a $2.4 billion bond act for building and repairing schools, but it was defeated at the polls, leaving him searching for other ways to obtain that money.
In past years, Mr. Silver advocated a weakening of the Wicks Law but was unable to win enough support to pass.
The law is fiercely defended by the building trade unions, which fear that fewer contractors would mean fewer jobs and that general contractors would be able to coerce subcontractors into lowering their bids, which would mean reduced wages.
Union officials also contend that with a general contractor directly overseeing each part of the work, rather than a government agency, there is greater room for shoddy work, kickbacks and other unsavory practices.
"It would be the state abdicating its responsibility to arrange, police and inspect these jobs," said Denis M. Hughes, executive assistant to Edward Cleary, president of the state A.F.L.-C.I.O. He noted that New York City's trouble-plagued School Construction Authority has been exempt from the Wicks Law since 1989.
Labor unions, which are generally allied with the Democrats, who control the Assembly, are one of the most powerful interest groups in the state, and lawmakers of both parties have been reluctant to defy them. Small construction companies also favor the Wicks Law, which they see as a guarantee that they will not be frozen out of large projects.
Mr. Pataki, who has long favored a repeal of the law, called Mr. Giuliani's proposal "very creative," adding that it "will help increase support for those of us who want to see the law changed."
Some Assembly Democrats said they, too, thought the Mayor had seized on a way of dealing with the issue that might make changes to the Wicks Law more likely. But they questioned whether the changes would save as much money as Mr. Giuliani predicted. Mr. Silver, while not commenting directly on the Mayor's proposal, said the city and state "must commit real dollars, not hypothetical dollars."
Mr. Giuliani and the Speaker of the City Council, Peter F. Vallone, made the annual political pilgrimage to Albany today to comment on the Governor's proposed budget and to begin lobbying for city projects.
Mr. Vallone, who would like to challenge Mr. Pataki this fall, criticized his budget as risky, and noted that by Mr. Pataki's own projections the state faced large deficits in 1999 and beyond.

HEADLINE: A Look at Trimming Aid to Israel by U.S.

 BODY:
The Israeli Finance Minister will meet with Congressional and Administrative officials this week to discuss phasing out America's $1.2 billion in economic aid to Israel starting in the year 2000, according to Congressional officials and Jewish organizations. 
 Israel is the largest recipient of American foreign assistance. Israeli officials on both the left and right have occasionally raised the possibility of weaning themselves away from it, both to free the country from dependence on American largesse, and as recognition of the fact that Israel has prospered.

HEADLINE: At AT&T, Taking News Of Cutbacks in Stride

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: BASKING RIDGE, N.J., Jan. 26

 BODY:
From the unionized crews who dig the holes to lay AT&T's fiber optic lines to the executive secretaries in plush corporate offices, the announcement today by AT&T's chairman that the company would cut its work force by 15,000 to 18,000 jobs over the next few years was not nearly as traumatic as has been the case in the past.
In fact, some employees at the company's headquarters here reported that there was some giddy laughter of relief and even a few cheers from veterans who had gathered around televisions or speaker phones for a closed-circuit telecast of the announcement by AT&T's new chairman, C. Michael Armstrong. What was different about this round of job cuts, the workers said, was that the buyout packages were generous and the job market strong. 
 "I feel better today than I did yesterday because at least I'm being offered something," said a 41-year-old manager who has been with the company for 20 years but spoke only on condition of anonymity. "If the buyout wasn't decent, we would all be just sitting around waiting for the ax to fall. Of course, if I take it I would still have to get another job, but at least they aren't throwing us out through the back door."
Pat Kelly, a vice president for education and training with AT&T's wireless division based in Redmond, Wash., said the fact that Mr. Armstrong linked the company's plans to reduce its work force with announcements of new products and plans to promote new business areas like wireless phones, did much to calm people's fears. She said it showed that he had developed an understanding of the industry after just four months on the job, and had a strategy that involved more than just streamlining the payroll.
"I was here two years ago when they announced 40,000 layoffs and that's when I switched to the new wireless division," she said as she left the headquarters here after a visit for business meetings. "This was different."
When the last round of job reductions was announced, the mood was distinctly different. New Jersey was just emerging from a recession, jobs were scarce and insecurity among workers high. This time, said James Hughes, dean of the Edward Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, the state's unemployment rate is below 5 percent and 78,000 new jobs have been created in the state in the last year.
"They are making the buyout packages attractive enough and people will be jumping on them because they know they can go out there and get another job in this market," he said.
Still, Mr. Hughes was critical of AT&T, which he said has been going through bouts of downsizing since deregulation in 1984. He said the company's success in the effort has looked to be slow and he said that what was the proverbial 800-pound gorilla in the days of regulated utilities "still looks like a dinosaur trying to adapt."
But workers generally said they were pleased with the way Mr. Armstrong delivered the news. In preparation for today's announcement the company had set up 390 locations where employees could watch. The company also set up a toll-free number that workers could call and hear a live feed of the announcement. Some workers, however, bitterly complained that the more than 4,000 ports for the telephone lines were repeatedly busy.
In addition, AT&T posted details of the announcement on its in-house Web site.
"We learned from previous announcements, and it is part of Armstrong's philosophy that we tell employees what is happening before we tell the rest of the world," said Dick Martin, executive vice president for public relations.
The buyout packages included a provision that would allow a large group of workers to take lucrative buyouts or retire with full pensions. In the past, employees needed 30 to 35 years in the company to get a full pension. But under the new provisions announced yesterday, anybody whose age plus time on the job totaled 65 years would be eligible for the full pension.
Mark Burkhart, a 41-year-old worker with the engineering and construction unit for 18 years, considered himself a "rookie" compared with some who have been with the company for 30 or more years. As he listened to the announcement over a speaker phone he saw smiles on the faces of many of his co-workers.
"They liked the buyout package," he said. "The company has been the poster boy for downsizing for a while now and these guys are just tired and they want out."

HEADLINE: Endgame on Iraq

 BODY:
Saddam Hussein's efforts to keep United Nations inspectors away from his biological weapons programs have brought the United States to the edge of military action. Clinton Administration officials warn that a series of punishing air strikes could begin in a matter of weeks, if a last-minute campaign of intensified diplomacy and sanctions fails to force Iraq to obey U.N. Security Council resolutions. With a British aircraft carrier joining a powerful American naval task force in nearby waters, a credible capacity for heavy and sustained air attacks is already in place.
This threat is necessary and appropriate. But a little time still remains to see what can be accomplished with the application of less deadly military force and intensified diplomacy and economic sanctions. Mr. Hussein has so overreached that previously sympathetic countries, like France, are now distancing themselves from Iraq. Russia's position is more ambiguous, as President Boris Yeltsin publicly opposes the use of force while dispatching an envoy to Baghdad to try to persuade Iraq to back down. 
 Security Council members can move beyond words by shutting down Iraq's lucrative contraband coastal oil trade through Iranian waters and the Persian Gulf to the United Arab Emirates, which provides a hefty share of Baghdad's current revenues. The Security Council can also extend existing no-flight zones to cover all the airspace over Iraq.
Washington should take one other important diplomatic step in advance of possible military action. Under the cease-fire resolution that ended the Persian Gulf war in 1991, once U.N. inspectors have destroyed all of Iraq's biological, chemical, nuclear and missile programs and established a reliable long-term monitoring system to prevent their revival, oil export sanctions would be lifted. Yet for most of the past six years, the United States has said it will not agree to end sanctions before other cease-fire terms, like the return of Kuwaiti prisoners and property, are met, or perhaps not until Mr. Hussein is driven from power.
That American position reduces Iraq's incentives for cooperating with the inspectors and has divided the Security Council. The Administration should now make clear that Iraq can indeed speed the end of sanctions, but must begin by letting the weapons inspectors do their work. If the Security Council eventually is satisfied that all mass-destruction weapons have been eliminated, all programs for making them have been shut down and reliable monitoring is in place, sanctions should end. Unfortunately, it seems increasingly clear that what Mr. Hussein really wants is not relief for Iraq but an operational germ warfare program. Washington is rightly determined to thwart that ambition, even if it comes to military force.

HEADLINE: The State of New York City's Parks

 BODY:
New York City's Parks Commissioner, Henry Stern, delivered a State of the Parks address last week and concluded that the state was very good. Thanks to thousands of workfare participants, cleanliness is up. Broken playground equipment has been replaced. The backlog of dangerous dead trees along city streets has dropped dramatically. Rollerblade Inc. has donated $1.6 million in cash and equipment to become the official in-line skate of New York City parks. The list goes on. 
 There is, however, an unreported downside. During the past decade of fiscal restraint, public funding for the parks is down 31 percent. Right now there are only 1,700 permanent park employees struggling to maintain a system of 1,400 parks and playgrounds on 27,000 acres.
Under both Mayors David Dinkins and Rudolph Giuliani, the city has relied more and more on volunteers and private benefactors to support the parks, and contracted out services that used to be done by city workers. Those initiatives have paid off, but they cannot fill the entire gap. Playgrounds may be in good shape, but most of them do not have attendants on duty to hand out recreational equipment, shoo dogs away from play areas and make sure bathrooms are open and safe.
Private support has been a boon to Central Park and Bryant Park in Manhattan, and to a lesser extent to Prospect Park in Brooklyn. But donations to the other large parks barely make a dent in the lost city funds. Illegal dumping is a serious problem in some places. Trails and picnic areas are becoming overgrown and unusable. Large structures like the Rotunda at Riverside Park are deteriorating for lack of maintenance. The number of park gardeners is down 40 percent since the 1980's, and their loss cannot be made up by workfare forces or weekend volunteers.
In its eagerness to benefit from privatization, the department seems to be allowing businesses to set the agenda. For instance, it plans to turn a huge chunk of Dreier-Offerman Park near Coney Island over to a private driving range, miniature golf course and in-line-skating facility. The department was inspired not by a study of the neighborhood's needs or its own internal priorities, but simply by a company's making the offer.
The fact that the city is enjoying good economic times does not mean that the Giuliani administration should rush to bring the Parks Department budget or work force up to its old level. Gains from efficiency and innovation have made a difference. But the park system, a city jewel, is not getting all the attention it deserves.

HEADLINE: Israelis to Discuss Phasing Out 1.2 Billion U.S. Economic Aid

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Jan. 26

 BODY:
The Israeli Finance Minister will be meeting with Congressional and Administration officials in Washington this week to discuss phasing out America's $1.2 billion in economic aid to Israel starting in the year 2000, according to Congressional officials and Jewish organizations.
The mission of the minister, Yaakov Neeman, which was first reported today in the newspaper Haaretz and has not been officially confirmed by the Israeli Government, grows out of a pledge that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made in his address to the United States Congress in July 1996 to start cutting Israel's dependence on American aid by the end of his first four-year term. 
 Since then, Israel has been increasingly reminded of that pledge as Congress has slashed billions from the foreign aid budget. Representative Sonny Callahan, an Alabama Republican and head of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, has been an especially insistent voice in Congress for reducing aid to Israel and holding Mr. Netanyahu to his pledge. Though Mr. Callahan has not succeeded in cutting the Israeli aid, the Appropriations Committee this year for the first time set a $5.4 billion cap on foreign aid to the Middle East. An aide to Mr. Callahan acknowledged that any cut in Israeli assistance would probably lead to a corresponding cut in aid to Egypt.
For many years, Israel has received $1.2 billion a year in economic aid and $1.8 billion in military aid, making it by far the largest recipient of American foreign assistance. Though Israel's special relationship with the United States has so far precluded any cut in those sums, Israeli officials on both the left and the right have occasionally raised the possibility of weaning themselves from it, both as a way of freeing the country from dependence on American largesse, and as recognition of the fact that Israel has prospered.
According to Haaretz, Mr. Neeman plans to discuss a package by which Israel would phase out the economic aid over 10 years or so, starting with the fiscal year beginning October 1999. Under the proposal, the aid would be pegged closer to the debt Israel owes the United States from weapons and equipment bought in the 1960's and 70's.
David Makovsky, the Haaretz diplomatic correspondent, wrote that one goal of Mr. Neeman's mission was to strengthen Mr. Netanyahu's support in Congress as a counterbalance to his low standing in the White House, and to improve his image with the American public at a time when he is being accused of stalling peace efforts with the Palestinians.
An aide to Mr. Callahan said the Congressman had been approached by the Israeli Embassy about a meeting with Mr. Neeman, and would see him on Wednesday. Officials in Washington said the Finance Minister would also see Representative Robert L. Livingston, the Louisiana Republican who heads the House Appropriations Committee, as well as the ranking Democrats on the committee and subcommittee, David R. Obey of Wisconsin and Nancy Pelosi of California.
"Given that we didn't request the meeting, it's hard to predict what the items on agenda will be," said Jo Bonner, Mr. Callahan's chief of staff. "It's certain that the Finance Minister will find a receptive ear not only with Congressman Callahan, but also other representatives who recognize the importance of the peace process and our strong allegiance to the state of Israel, and are also committed to reducing foreign aid wherever and whenever feasible and practical."
Mr. Bonner added, however, that Mr. Callahan was not aware of any plan to start phasing out aid in 1999.
Mr. Neeman met with Mr. Callahan late last summer in Washington, but without reaching an agreement. In fact, Congressional officials said Mr. Callahan had been irked by Mr. Neeman's presumption that Israel was entitled to the American money. "His initial visit did not make a stellar impression with Mr. Callahan," a Republican aide said.
According to Haaretz, Mr. Callahan put forward three alternative plans for consideration.
Under one, the American aid would be used to pay off Israel's multi-billion dollar debt, and then halted. Israel's payments on the debt's interest have dropped from $1.2 billion a year to below $1 billion in recent years, and the difference between the aid and the interest payments, or $200 million, would be applied to paying off the billions in principal owed by Israel. The difference would grow as the debt shrank, until the debt was paid off, when the economic aid would be halted.
A second option was to reduce the economic aid by $200 million in the first year, and to work out a timetable to continue cutting the assistance until it is stopped. Under a third option, part of the economic aid would be cut, and part transferred to the military budget.
Mr. Neeman's mission was evidently to discuss these plans, but with the hope of starting only in late 1999, and stretching it over about a decade. As Finance Minister, Mr. Neeman only recently fought a bitter battle with Mr. Netanyahu's fractious coalition over the 1998 budget, and was evidently reluctant to lose any American income soon.
"The idea would be to develop a plan, a glide path, for Israel to bring its economic assistance down to zero, maybe over a decade," said an official of a Jewish organization who is familiar with the plan.
Starting the reduction in October 1999 would not make a significant dent in the Israeli budget before Mr. Netanyahu's current term ends, in May 2000, but would enable the Prime Minister to maintain to his voters that he was weaning Israel off American money.
In Jerusalem, David Bar Illan, Mr. Netanyahu's communications director, said it was "very possible that Mr. Neeman wants to discuss the possibility that in fiscal year 2000 a step will be made in the direction Mr. Netanyahu promised in his speech to Congress in the joint meeting of July 1996, that before the end of his first term there would be a move toward reducing and ultimately eliminating the U.S. civilian aid."
The aid package for Israel dates in part from the 1973 peace with Egypt, when both countries received pledges of American aid.

HEADLINE: Private Group Offers Bonus Pay As a Spur to City's Public Schools

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
Borrowing an idea from the boardroom to help New York City's troubled classrooms, one of the city's largest business groups announced yesterday that it would offer $30 million to fatten the salaries of hundreds of superintendents, principals and teachers if they are able to raise students' academic performance.
The plan, which could mean up to $30,000 more a year for superintendents, $15,000 for principals and $2,000 for teachers during the next five years, relies on a simple tool widely used by businesses: bonuses for bosses who make their employees and organizations more productive. 
 "We really believe, borrowing from the corporate model, that there has to be good leadership at the top," said Robert R. Kiley, president of the New York City Partnership and Chamber of Commerce, which proposed the plan with the support of Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew. "We have to look at this as the principal acting as the C.E.O. of each school."
The group has raised only $2 million for the program so far, but organizers said they were confident they would come up with the amount needed to begin the plan next fall.
The idea is relatively new and has never been used in New York City. But in Kentucky, which has had a bonus program for three years, disputes have broken out between teachers and principals over who deserved the bonuses, teachers have cheated to increase student test scores and schools have inflated grades. The problems there and with a similar program in Texas raised questions yesterday about whether lessons learned from profits and stock prices can be so easily transferred to test scores and graduation rates.
"Schools should be run in a businesslike way, but you can't run them like businesses," said Thomas Sobol, a former State Education Commissioner. "These plans just mean that you end up rewarding the good people, which is socially a nice thing, but it does not change the problems with the school system."
The plan will reward educators in 2 underperforming school districts, chosen from the city's 32. So far, just one, District 19, which encompasses East New York, Brooklyn, has been chosen, officials said. A third school will be added the following year.
Under a complex system intended to monitor improvement in the schools, the districts will be trying to increase students' scores on two kinds of standardized tests. One shows whether they are learning at or above their grade level when their school is compared with similar schools each year, and another shows how much students, even those doing badly, are improving.
Officials said the dual tests would provide a more accurate yardstick of schools' progress than simple year-end, systemwide tests. The bonuses are also strictly tied to the test results, with no subjective judgment by school officials or the New York City Partnership that could give rise to accusations of favoritism or corruption in the awards.
Theoretically, if students in all the district's schools reach all the necessary goals on those tests, the bonuses for educators could add up to $10 million a year for each district.
But even if districts collectively receive less, the financial impact for those who earn the bonuses will be great. Superintendents now receive about $128,000 a year. Principals, whose performance and recruitment are the primary aims of the plan, make between $70,000 and $80,000. Teachers, who school officials said would receive less per person because bonuses would be given to every teacher in a successful school, make between $29,000 and $70,000.
"The top bonuses can add a lot, and it's going to get people's attention," said Robert E. Riccobono, the superintendent of District 19, which has 28 principals and 1,600 teachers. "It's going to get them to work hard and smart."
He added: "Everybody likes money, and there is no reason why people shouldn't accept it as long as the environment is set up correctly."
The plan is described by business and school officials as a long-awaited carrot to go with the stick handed to Dr. Crew in late 1996, when the State Legislature gave him new powers, including the right to pick superintendents and greater power to dismiss principals and other officials in poorly performing districts.
"You need to have ways to intervene, and have consequences if people fail," Dr. Crew said yesterday of the bonus plan, "and you also have to be equally demonstrative in the other direction if people are successful. I think this will have a really important and substantial impact on the climate of accountability toward children in the schools."
Critics of the plan warned that such incentive programs can encourage teachers or principals to cheat in administering tests or recording results. But a more common and troubling problem is the tempation for schools to "teach to the test," gearing classes not for a rounded education but simply to anticipate multiple choice questions on the standardized exams.
Mr. Kiley and schools officials said the Board of Education would conduct stricter auditing of test scores to guard against cheating. Dr. Crew said other accountability programs and evaluations planned for principals and teachers are intended to discourage the "test-prepping phenomenon."
"But I do think it's something we are going to have to keep our eyes on," he said.
Another criticism leveled against the plan -- one that has surfaced in independent studies of Kentucky's program -- is that competition for bonuses can actually lead to lower morale and motivation among educators who receive less, or narrowly miss test goals.
Susan Amlung, a spokeswoman for the United Federation of Teachers, said that when the bonus plan was first presented to the union, it included incentives only for principals. "We warned them that it would be absolutely counterproductive to reward principals for what had to be the result of a team effort," Ms. Amlung said. "You would set up a kind of tension there that could be disastrous."
Mr. Riccobono, who met with his principals yesterday to announce the plan, said it is a pitfall he has already begun to worry about. "Teachers will be upset if they think it is their work that a principal is being rewarded for," he said. "And I think it's our job at the district to see that the incentives are not being rewarded on the backs of the teachers."
While the plans in Kentucky and Texas, and similar ones in South Carolina and Indiana, allocate money to high-performing schools, giving them the option of using bonuses for salaries, special programs or equipment, New York's appears to be the only one designed to raise academic results solely by increasing educators' paychecks.
Mr. Kiley said that Goldman, Sachs and Chase Manhattan were the first companies to agree to provide money for the bonuses, about $2 million together, and he now hopes to raise more by drawing attention to the plan.
"This is a very, very good way to the get the business community more deeply involved in New York City schools in a way that they understand well," he said.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT UNDER FIRE: THE STRATEGIST;
A Veteran Fighter Returns to the Ring, and Finds His Corner With Ease

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 26

 BODY:
When Gennifer Flowers sent the Clinton Presidential campaign to the precipice in 1992 with her account of a long-running affair with the Arkansas Governor, the candidate dispatched a loyal, pugnacious lawyer with a highly attuned political ear to rescue his drive in New Hampshire: Mickey Kantor.
Now, with his Presidency threatened by accusations of an affair with a young White House intern, Bill Clinton has reached for the same hardened strategist to bring order to his defense and, if possible, find a way out of the toughest crisis of his crisis-filled life in politics. 
A year after he left the Administration, declaring that long battles as the United States trade representative and then Commerce Secretary had taken their toll, the tightly coiled Mr. Kantor is suddenly helping direct what could be the biggest negotiation of his career, although it is still unclear which of several possible opponents will be sitting across the table.
His law firm, Mayer, Brown & Platt, confirmed in a terse statement today that it had been "retained by the President and First Lady to provide legal counsel to them," without ever mentioning Mr. Kantor's involvement.
But long before the announcement was out, Mr. Kantor's return, and its significance, had resonated around Washington.
"You can tell we're in deep, deep trouble," one Administration official said, "when Mickey is called off the bench."
Normally loquacious about even the most sensitive negotiations with Japan or the European Union, and always eager to talk political strategy, Mr. Kantor was uncharacteristically silent today. Through another lawyer in his firm, he offered apologies but said he could not discuss his role in Mr. Clinton's defense.
White House officials, however, made clear that although he would enjoy lawyer-client privilege, he would act chiefly as the legal team's political overseer, meaning that he will be the only political adviser who is not in peril of being forced to testify about his conversations with Mr. Clinton.
Mr. Kantor's associates say they suspect that his first job is to act as a bridge between Mr. Clinton's legal team, which White House officials say has been extraordinarily cautious about letting the President say anything that could be used against him later, and his political advisers, who have been urging him to offer, as quickly as possible, a full explanation of his relationship with the intern, Monica S. Lewinsky.
"Mickey's view of this kind of thing is that it is going to come out sooner or later," one longtime Administration colleague said today. "My guess is that he wants it out, but on our terms."
Mr. Kantor has never been a universally loved figure in the White House: his fiery temper and his absence of patience with those who cross him are legendary.
Those qualities and the enmity they created, especially among some younger colleagues, contributed to keeping him from becoming White House chief of staff in Mr. Clinton's first term. And while he was widely praised for his performance in the trade arena, he left the Administration last year after it had become clear that despite his closeness to the President and Hillary Rodham Clinton, he was not destined to become Attorney General or Secretary of State.
But Mr. Kantor has never wandered far from the Clintons' orbit. And no one in the Clinton camp is considered more fiercely loyal or more skilled at smelling where a deal lies and then working backward to figure out how to get there.
He did just that in winning Congressional approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement, one of the biggest legislative victories of Mr. Clinton's first term.
He did it again with Japan, in a confrontation in 1995 that took the United States to the brink of imposing enormous economic sanctions against one of its closest military allies.
That months-long dance with Tokyo was a classic Kantor concoction: long weeks of threatening public statements, endless nights of negotiation, conciliatory back-channel messages to his opponents and, in the end, a deal laced with ambiguity that enabled all sides to claim a political victory.
And he used all available means: United States intelligence agencies intercepted the telephone conversations of Mr. Kantor's Japanese opponents, which helped very little in the negotiations but caused another uproar after the surveillance was disclosed months later.
"I can't stand to lose," Mr. Kantor once said, musing on his own reputation for combativeness. "I'm the worst loser you ever saw."
Mr. Kantor loved his role as trade representative, in part because he was running a small, lean organization whose staff became highly loyal to him. But he was also able to merge trade to further Mr. Clinton's political fortunes, often overseeing deals that quieted economic discontent in areas of the country where a little managed trade smoothed ruffled political feathers.
"To be successful at this, you need to be political without being partisan," Mr. Kantor said as Commerce Secretary in 1996, when he was steadily on the campaign trail for his old friend. "But are there incidental political benefits in opening markets and creating jobs? You bet there are."
Mr. Kantor is also a man of deep loyalties. He helped Webster L. Hubbell, formerly the No. 3 official at the Justice Department, find consulting work when Mr. Hubbell was driven from the Government by scandal and needed a source of income. Mr. Kantor has said that whatever help he extended came out of friendship; he testified on the issue in front of a grand jury last month.
When he negotiated with foreign countries, it was usually clear who Mr. Kantor's interlocutors were, and what he needed to get from them. In this case, that is a much more difficult issue.
Will Mr. Kantor be dealing with Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel who has expanded his Whitewater investigation to embrace possible perjury charges concerning Mr. Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky? Or would he deal with Congress, if it threatens investigations of its own? And could he deal with a fellow Beverly Hills lawyer, William H. Ginsburg, who is representing Ms. Lewinsky in the negotiations over immunity from prosecution in return for her testimony?
"No one seems to know exactly what Mickey's role will be," one White House official said tonight. "But he has the busiest speed dialer in town."

HEADLINE: After Steady Start, Romania's Centrist Government Begins to Falter

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: BUCHAREST, Romania, Jan. 22

 BODY:
A former geology professor and trade union leader came to power here as President and Prime Minister more than a year ago, riding a popular wave of hope and pride.
Finally, Romanians believed, instead of being relegated as a backwater in Europe, their country might start to catch up with the faster moving nations in the former Communist bloc. 
 But after making important moves like liberalizing prices and slashing spending, the members of the centrist coalition started bickering, or to use Romanians' favorite word -- conspiring -- against each other.
They could not decide what to do about the obsolete industrial plants from the era of the Communist dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu. The Foreign Minister had to resign last month after he said there were spies in important positions, but could not prove it.
Viktor Ciorbea, an indecisive Prime Minister, held 18-hour Cabinet meetings, leaving Government members walking around like sleepless zombies. President Emil Constantinescu toured world capitals and some foreign investment trickled in but mostly it stayed away.
At an emergency parliamentary meeting called last Wednesday by Mr. Constantinescu, the Government presented its privatization law. But the future of the shaky coalition remained uncertain, and how aggressive the Government would be in closing or selling loss-making state-run industries as demanded by the International Monetary Fund also remained unclear.
The new Finance Minister, Daniel Daianu, the former chief economist at the central bank who was installed as part of a Government shuffle last month, sounded pessimistic in an interview here.
"To have a privatization law and an investment law is not sufficient," he said. "They have to be implemented."
But implementation was blocked by "red tape and corruption," which he said were "ubiquitous." "The entire society does not see transparency as a virtue. There is a lot of double talk."
Mr. Daianu said that he would like to see the state-owned banks privatized but that the economic environment made it difficult to attract Western banks as buyers. They would be reluctant to "stake their reputation" in the current atmosphere, he said.
He was disappointed, he said, that the only potential buyer so far for one of the nation's seven oil refineries, was Lukoil, a Russian company. "I'd rather an American company, but I don't see many Americans interested," he said.
Romania made a bid last year to be included among the former Communist countries invited to join NATO. It failed to make the list but as a consolation prize, President Clinton came last July for a brief visit. To be courted economically by Russia is seen by many Romanians as an unhappy aftermath to the effort to join NATO.
There were high expectations for Mr. Constantinescu and Mr. Ciorbea because they represented a sharp break from the former Communists who ran Romania for seven years after the violent overthrow of Mr. Ceausescu, one of the most Draconian of Eastern Europe's Communist leaders.
But while they had never been Communists, the two men appear to have been stymied not only by the economic legacy they inherited but also by their lack of experience in managing anything.
They also seem to be haunted by their country's own history, which differs from that of the Central European nations now moving toward NATO. Until 1944, Romania had a monarchy closely linked to the Orthodox Church, the dominant religion here.
King Michael, who was forced to abdicate as a young man, has come back to Romania since Mr. Constantinescu became President.
Now in his 70's, the King seemed largely irrelevant until he announced this month that he was using his "prerogative" to name his daughter as his heir.
An embarrassed Mr. Constantinescu, who has been sympathetic toward the King but always stressed that Romania was a republic, had to distance himself from any notion of a restoration of the monarchy.
Through all of the political machinations, the Romanian people have been patient. "Surprisingly, people still support the Government," the finance minister said. But he wonders for how long.
The average per capita annual income in Romania is $1,200, two and a half times less than in Poland. The economy shrank by 6 percent last year.
Many people with university educations -- teachers, young doctors -- have to think about how to pay for the next meal. Since the freeing of prices last year, meat has become a rare luxury, with potatoes and beans the staple.
Mr. Daianu said the standard of living would drop further before it got better.
Most worrying, he said, was the condition of the miners, a volatile group concentrated in Petrosani, 100 miles northwest of the capital. In the fall, the Government closed mines and paid generous compensation to the workers. The idea was that the men would voluntarily move back to the countryside. But the miners' ties to the rural areas were broken generations ago, and the men have stayed put.

HEADLINE: Yeltsin Sends Envoy to Iraq to Try to Finesse Crisis With the U.S.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 26

 BODY:
Angered by what he considers needless intensification of tension between Iraq and the United States, President Boris N. Yeltsin today dispatched a special envoy to Baghdad with orders to end the mounting crisis over weapons inspections.
It will not be an easy task, but officials in the Kremlin today said they were increasingly worried that President Clinton -- enmeshed in a deepening scandal at home -- will attempt to assert his leadership abroad with a rapid military strike on Iraq. 
 "Nobody is saying he is going to bomb Baghdad so that Americans will forget about his problems," said a senior Russian diplomat, who refused to be quoted by name. "But the military option has become more obvious there and there is no question that a strike on Saddam Hussein would be popular in America."
That may be true -- but the main reason that Mr. Yeltsin sent Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor Posuvalyuk to Baghdad today was more closely tied to Russian domestic politics.
It has been a tough few months for Mr. Yeltsin. His recent illness revived worries that he may not be in control of the Government. Economic uncertainties in Asia threaten to spread to the fragile markets here. So have numerous economic scandals involving the reformers who were supposed to rid the Russian Government of corruption.
Mr. Yeltsin displayed his irritation with the situation in Iraq in footage aired this evening on Russian television that depicted him approving the diplomatic mission.
Iraq is among the only places left in the world where Moscow can make a serious difference. The Foreign Minister, Yevgeny Primakov, is a Middle East specialist and so is Mr. Posuvalyuk. In 1991 he was the Soviet Ambassador in Iraq and he played a major role in Moscow's fruitless attempts to prevent the Persian Gulf war. In the end, Russians backed the Western alliance in the war.
Since then, Mr. Primakov and his deputy have continued to play a role in Baghdad. Together, they helped ease tensions in November during the last round of conflicts between United Nations weapons inspectors and the Iraqis. But inspectors are still unable to perform their jobs and diplomatic efforts to resolve the dispute seem to have failed.
On Sunday, officials in the United States said Mr. Clinton had decided to consult allies, had made no military decisions, and was trying to determine how to proceed. They made it clear that the military options were being more carefully considered than at any time since this most recent conflict began. Iraq has continued to prevent some United Nations inspection teams from entering sites that may contain nuclear, biological or chemical weapons and materials.
Iraq has banned all United Nations inspectors from eight enormous presidential sites where such materials could easily be concealed. The Iraqis accuse the United Nations of deliberately prolonging the inspection process in an effort to maintain sanctions which were imposed at the end of the gulf war.
Russia has promised to do all it can to help end the sanctions as soon as possible. But that means adhering to United Nations policy, and inspections, which Iraq has repeatedly resisted.
Asked today whether Mr. Posuvalyak's visit had been agreed to in advance with the United States, the Kremlin spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, replied, "Why would that be necessary?"
Mr. Yastrzhembsky declined to provide any details of the mission, who Mr. Posuvalyuk would meet with in Baghdad, or whether Moscow had concrete goals that he was expected to carry out. In an usually blunt statement released here this afternoon, Russian officials made their opposition to any possible military strike in Iraq clear.
"All interested parties have to act in a responsible and balanced manner in order to ease tensions and normalize the situation in the gulf," the statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry said. "All scenarios providing for the use of force are unacceptable and counterproductive."

Police Identify Suspect In L.I. Strangulation

DATELINE: HAUPPAUGE

 BODY:
The police in Suffolk County said yesterday that they were seeking a 56-year-old unemployed Long Island man in connection with the strangulation of a mother of two from Islip Terrace last week.
The woman, Donna Bocklet, 41, was found dead in the back of her minivan in a supermarket parking lot in Bay Shore on Thursday. 
 The police identified the suspect as Anthony Libardi, a white male, 5 feet 7 inches tall, 240 pounds with gray hair. They said he wore a mustache until the day of the murder, when it is believed he shaved it off to alter his appearance.
Detective Lieut. John Gierasch, chief of the Suffolk County Police Department homicide squad, said Mr. Libardi was last seen early yesterday morning and was believed to be driving a red, two-door 1988 Dodge Shadow with a New York license plate, EI44BX. The police would not say why Mr. Libardi was a suspect.

HEADLINE: Northwest Air Getting Control Of Continental

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN

 BODY:
Northwest Airlines agreed to buy a controlling stake in Continental Airlines for $519 million yesterday, beating a bid from Delta Air Lines and creating a third domestic and international airline network to compete with the country's biggest carriers, United Airlines and American Airlines.
In an unusual arrangement, Northwest and Continental plan to merge flight schedules and frequent-flier programs but maintain separate identities and managements. 
 The benefit for consumers would be a larger choice of flights from the new alliance to virtually any spot from Latin America to Asia. But it was unlikely to result in lower prices because the two carriers, which do not now compete with each other on many routes, would have little reason to do so.
One airport most affected would be Newark, a fast-growing hub for Continental that would likely receive even more passengers and flights from Northwest and its European partner, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.
"This is very good news for Newark," said John Dasburg, the president and chief executive of Northwest, in an interview yesterday. The deal would also strengthen Northwest's hubs in Detroit and Minneapolis and Continental's largest hub in Houston.
Airline executives and analysts on Wall Street said the alliance, still subject to approval by the Departments of Justice and Transportation, would likely lead to a new round of deals in the booming airline industry as smaller domestic carriers felt more pressure to compete with a growing number of national and international air alliances.
"The consolidation genie has come out of the bottle," said Kevin C. Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover in New York. "The dance is starting."
That expectation was reflected on Wall Street, where shares in US Airways rose 5.3 percent, to $60, on expectations it would be the next takeover candidate. Shares of Delta fell 1.5 percent, to $112.3125, on fears it might have missed an important strategic opportunity.
The competition to win Continental illustrates just how frenzied the maneuvering can become. Only a few years ago, the airline was the ugly duckling of the industry, having suffered two tours through bankruptcy court. But since 1994, Continental has become profitable for the first time in more than a decade.
Over the last 18 months, David Bonderman, the Texas financier, whose Air Partners Ltd. controlled 14 percent of Continental's shares but about 51 percent of the voting rights, made clear he wanted to sell.
Continental entered merger talks with Delta in late 1996, but they ended inconclusively. Then last month, an alliance between Northwest and Continental was scuttled, when Northwest's pilots, who have the right to approve joint marketing of flights, demanded more time to consider the proposed deal.
The Northwest deal revived Delta's interest. Leo Mullin, Delta's new chief executive, called Mr. Bonderman, who encouraged him to bid. For the Delta chief, who joined the airline after stints at Unicom, the Illinois utility, and a long career as a banker, it was an unhappy introduction to the world of airline deals. Advised by Goldman, Sachs & Company, he offered to buy Continental for cash and stock. Meanwhile, Northwest, which was advised by Credit Suisse First Boston, proposed a revised offer that did not require immediate approval of its pilots.
Rather than take over Continental, it proposed an alliance. It would buy the Air Partners' stake and put the voting rights in a trust outside its control. The arrangement, which both airlines said would create jobs, turned out to be the deciding factor that convinced Continental's board to reject Delta's offer. Executives involved in the negotiations and union representatives said Delta's offer would have resulted in widespread layoffs and that Mr. Mullin did not seem to realize the disastrous impact that would have.
"They failed primarily because they had no appreciation for the magnitude of labor issues in our industry," said one person involved in Continental's deliberations.
But Mr. Mullin said most of the job reductions in a merger with Delta would have resulted from attrition. He said a confederation like the one proposed by Northwest was much harder to manage and required extraordinary cooperation. "A merger is a much more powerful combination," he said.
Some executives and analysts said losing Continental left Delta vulnerable as it slips to fourth place behind the new Northwest-Continental combination. Delta recently ended an alliance with Singapore Air and has failed to line up as many international partners as United, which has an alliance with Lufthansa, Thai International and others, and American, which is awaiting approval of a broad combination with British Airways. American is a unit of AMR and United is a unit of UAL.
"He runs the risk of having Delta sidelined in this wave of consolidation," said Jeffrey Long, an aviation analyst at J. P. Morgan in New York.
Mr. Mullin said that he was "modestly disappointed" by what happened, but did not consider it a major setback. "We have a lot of momentum going at Delta," he said. "Yes, it would have been very good, but it's not overwhelmingly significant."
Mr. Dasburg, on the other hand, was jubilant. A new air services agreement between the United States and Japan that will most likely be concluded later this week will open up significant competition to Northwest's lucrative Asian routes for the first time. With American Airlines expected to conclude an alliance with Japan Airlines and United talking with All Nippon Airways, Japan's second-largest airline, Northwest needed more heft.
"Our feeling is that with an alliance you can achieve 80 percent of the benefits of a merger at a fraction of the cost," he said.
Even after combining with Continental, their share of the domestic market would be smaller than Delta's, Mr. Dasburg said. "Therefore, we have got to find a way to make ourselves as attractive to customers as the larger airlines," he said.
Gordon M. Bethune, Continental's chairman and chief executive, said that combining flight schedules, marketing and frequent-flier plans would add at least $500 million in revenues over three years by drawing more customers. "This is a case where two and two make five, or even six," he said.
Northwest must still get pilot approval before it can put Continental labels on its flights, but Mr. Dasburg was optimistic. The pilots have said they now favor the alliance but are withholding approval until they sign a new labor contract. The machinists endorsed the deal yesterday.
Continental does not need formal approval of pilots, but must appease them for the alliance to succeed. Officials of Continental's pilots' union, which is also negotiating a new contract, were livid yesterday because, they said, they were only told Sunday morning that the airline might decide to merge with Delta later that day.
Though they contended that a memo to the board stating their strong objections was instrumental in shooting down the Delta bid, they demanded a job security provision in their contract. Without it, said Len Nikolai, the union's president, "there will be no economic synergies to be realized in the coming together of these two great airlines."

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT UNDER FIRE: THE PUBLIC VIEW;
Clinton Job Rating Remains High Despite Doubts on Moral Values

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

 BODY:
The accusations that President Clinton had an affair with a White House intern have not dimmed the public's view of how he is handling his job, according to a New York Times/CBS News Poll taken over the weekend.
The findings suggest that Americans may be willing to look beyond Mr. Clinton's personal troubles because they are generally satisfied with their lives and pleased with the economy. The President's handling of his job remains high at 56 percent, virtually unchanged from 58 percent in a Times/CBS News Poll in December. His ratings on the economy and foreign policy are the highest of his Presidency. 
 But one disquieting sign for Mr. Clinton is that people are now less likely than they once were to say that he shares the moral values that most Americans try to live by. Forty percent of the respondents said he shares those values, compared with 55 percent in October 1996, just weeks before he was re-elected. Twenty-six percent said Mr. Clinton had more honesty and integrity than most politicians, 30 percent less and 37 percent about the same.
Women have long been more supportive of Mr. Clinton than have men, and they remain more likely to approve of his job performance than men do. In the poll of 943 adults, they also judged the President somewhat less harshly than men did on the accusations about his involvement with Monica S. Lewinsky, the former White House intern. That may be because women are more inclined to identify with Mr. Clinton on policy than to focus on his personal life.
Despite the President's robust ratings on issues and job performance, most Americans fear that the scandal will interfere with his future ability to perform his job effectively.
For most people, the troubling dimension was not as much that Mr. Clinton may have had an affair or that he may have been involved with a young intern, but that there may have been a cover-up of his association with Ms. Lewinsky and that the affair may have taken place in the White House.
The Clinton White House has long paid close attention to polls, and indeed, one it had taken in recent days showed a significant decline in favorable attitudes about the President. Other, public surveys have recorded strong disapproval of his alleged liaison with Ms. Lewinsky.
But the Times/CBS News Poll is the first public poll to give a hard look at whether the accusations have affected the President's standing on matters facing the nation. Most striking is that on issue after issue, Mr. Clinton's ratings have climbed sharply in the past two years -- and have not been eroded by the recent but relentless debate over his alleged involvement with the former intern.
Mr. Clinton has said he keeps the personal accusations against him "in a little box" that is separate from his Presidential duties. The American people appear to be doing the same thing.
If it turns out that the President encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to lie, there is far from a consensus that he should resign. Thirty-one percent of Americans say that if the accusations are true, Mr. Clinton should admit it and apologize; 30 percent said he should resign, 18 percent said Congress should begin impeachment proceedings and 16 percent said the entire matter should be dropped. The survey, conducted on Saturday and Sunday, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Public opinion is still plainly in a formative stage. Even though Americans have been inundated with television, radio, newspaper, magazine and Internet reports about the scandal, the full ramifications of the disclosures that began last Wednesday have not sunk in. Many people are reserving judgment about whether Mr. Clinton encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to lie under oath.
"If the allegations are true, I feel that is wrong," Kathy Edwards, a 45-year-old nurse from Ionia, Mich., said in a typical follow-up interview. "But without that information, I believe he is doing right by the country right now. I feel he's done a good job in pulling the country together. Economically, I'm better off than I was five years ago, improvements have been made in education and health care -- and I feel pretty good about where the country is right now."
The percentage who said Mr. Clinton had made progress in significantly reducing the budget deficit has more than doubled, to 63 percent, since January 1996. And 61 percent think the President has significantly improved the economy, up from 35 percent from two years ago. And in the past four years the proportion of Americans who are willing to give him credit on welfare and crime has more than doubled.
While Mr. Clinton is expected to highlight those accomplishments in his State of the Union Message tonight, he will also stand before an American public that views the accusations against him as potentially crippling. Forty-one percent of the respondents said the crisis is of great importance to the nation, although overwhelmingly, Americans said it was unfair to compare Mr. Clinton's problems with those of President Richard M. Nixon in the 1972-74 Watergate scandal.
"I don't feel that this womanizing issue is corruption on the level of Watergate," said one poll respondent, Patricia McGuire, a retired social worker from Covington, Ga. "But I do feel that because he's President, he may feel he can cover up what he does, as other people are not able to do." Yet Ms. McGuire, 59, credited Mr. Clinton for having "advanced programs that have helped us, such as health care reform and welfare."
As for the particulars, 42 percent of Americans said the President probably did have an affair with Ms. Lewinsky, 20 percent said he probably did not and 34 percent said they did not know enough to say.
Even more, 40 percent, said they did not have enough information to assess whether Mr. Clinton encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to lie under oath. Thirty-two percent said he probably did and 25 percent said he probably did not.
The poll suggests that it should be no surprise that the White House has started a campaign to discredit Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel. Half of the people said Mr. Clinton's political enemies were more responsible for the crisis than he, while two-fifths blamed the President. On another question, almost half said Mr. Starr was conducting a partisan investigation that was intended to damage the President. Only 3 in 10 said he was impartial.
While the White House is beleaguered, the two people who rallied around Mr. Clinton at a child-care event yesterday have not been tarnished. Vice President Al Gore's favorable rating stands at 35 percent, up from 19 percent in December. Hillary Rodham Clinton's favorable rating is 45 percent, an increase from 39 percent in December.
Women like Mrs. Clinton more than men: 49 percent of women said they had a favorable view, while 39 percent of men did.
One explanation for Mr. Clinton's enduring popularity is that since he has been President, the public has viewed the road ahead more positively than the road behind. Forty percent of Americans said that in general, things were better now than they were five years ago; 38 percent said they were worse and 18 percent said they were the same. When those same questions were asked in the waning days of the Bush Administration, only 12 percent said they thought things were better and 73 percent said worse.
One respondent, Joe Starr, a journalist from Albuquerque, N.M., said in a follow-up interview that given Mr. Clinton's accomplishments on the issues, it was not appropriate to dwell on his private life.
"A person like the President, who is an all-purpose public figure, still has their own life, and what goes on behind closed doors is their own business," said Mr. Starr, 28. "How he conducts his business as leader of our country is a totally different point. He seems to be taking care of business with welfare reform, for example, cleaning up the mess that's been around for quite a few years."
On education, an issue that Mr. Clinton is expected to highlight in the State of the Union Message, 50 percent of Americans said he had made improvements. The public was divided on race relations; 47 percent said the President had improved things significantly and 46 percent said he had not.
Two areas of weakness in the poll for Mr. Clinton are health insurance and crime. Only 34 percent said he had made progress in insuring all Americans, a figure that has not changed from 1994, when his proposed overhaul of the health care system collapsed.
On crime, only 37 percent said he had improved matters. But that is an increase from 16 percent in 1994.
The poll also found that the public's view of how Congress is handling its job stands at 47 percent, up from 33 percent in December.
House Speaker Newt Gingrich's popularity stands at 23 percent favorable and 39 percent unfavorable.
In their responses to several questions, women were particularly cautious in judging Mr. Clinton's culpability in the Lewinsky matter. Among women, 45 percent said they did not know enough to say whether Mr. Clinton encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to lie under oath, compared with 35 percent for men. Twenty-eight percent of women said this accusation was probably true; 36 percent of men said the same thing.
Sixty-five percent of Americans said the news media had spent too much time covering the allegations swirling around Mr. Clinton, while 27 percent said it had been the right amount. But 62 percent said the media had done a good job in the coverage, compared with 29 percent who said they had not done a good job.
Yet the public may be reaching its collective saturation level. Sixty-two percent of Americans said they were sick and tired of all the coverage.
 
How the Poll Was Conducted
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Saturday and Sunday with 943 adults throughout the United States.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country.
Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error is larger. For example, for self-identified Democrats, Republicans or independents taken as a group, it is plus or minus six percentage points.
For the question that asked respondents to rate on a scale of 1 to 10 the way things are going in the United States at the present time, the margin of sampling error was plus or minus 0.13; that is, in 19 cases out of 20, a mean rating of 5.84 on that scale would be no lower than 5.71 and no higher than 5.97.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variations in question wording or the order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat different results.

HEADLINE: Gov. Wilson's High Energy and Low Prospects

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Jan. 21

 BODY:
Pete Wilson may have begun his last year as Governor of California, but he is not going gentle into the night. He still thinks nothing of staying up until the wee hours poring over a speech. His idea of relaxation is still a late-night workout on the Gravitron machine in his garage. His antidote to frustration is still deeper immersion in policy details.
But Mr. Wilson's days are numbered by the California law limiting elected officials to two terms, which voters passed when they elected him eight years ago. Mr. Wilson supported its passage -- and he now makes no secret of his sorrow. 
 "I regret that I have but 11 months more to give to this job, because I'm enjoying it," Mr. Wilson said in a recent hourlong interview in his office here. The truth is that Mr. Wilson, who is 64 and entering his 32d consecutive year in elective office, is all dressed up with no clear place to go politically.
His state is again comparatively flush after a grueling recession and he has money to spend on long-deferred priorities from education to public works. His job-approval ratings are at or near the highest they have been since just after he took office, and he holds sway over a Democratic-controlled Legislature whose leadership has itself been weakened by the turnover brought on by term-limits. He is sponsoring ambitious proposals for the November ballot to restructure education and fight juvenile crime.
"For the next 11 months," Mr. Wilson said, "I intend to make the same kind of full-court press, trying to achieve as much as we can, understanding that this job is endless. I mean, you're part of a continuum."
There is a glittering grail, of course, and it is represented by the picture of a tanned and smiling man that hangs over the Governor's shoulder in the cabinet room of the first-floor suite of offices known as the horseshoe for its U-shaped corridors: "In honor of the first California Governor elected President of the United States," reads the plaque on the portrait of Ronald Reagan.
Mr. Wilson would clearly like to be the second.
"If the question pointedly was, 'Are you going to run,' you know, I would love to," said Mr. Wilson of the Republican Presidential nomination in 2000.
His brief bid for the nomination of 1996 collapsed spectacularly for lack of money and support, amid false rumors that surgery for a benign growth on his vocal chord that left him unable to speak in public for several weeks meant he had cancer.
"If you can't speak for three and a half months, you can't run," said Mr. Wilson, whose reedy Johnny Carson voice still occasionally cracks without warning on consonants. "They were saying, 'Gee, isn't it a shame about poor Pete. Throat cancer. He's going to have to drop out of the race.' The rumors were false, but they were effective."
Now, Mr. Wilson said of a possible Presidential campaign: "I'm going to be realistic. If I can find the money, why I'd say the chances are pretty good that I might. But that remains a huge question mark. It is an immense undertaking, that much I can tell you."
Among Mr. Wilson's friends and enemies alike, there is little doubt that he wants to run again. There is equally little doubt that the Governor thinks such a candidacy is a better idea than almost anyone else.
For starters, there is his political persona, which can sometimes seem both dour and phlegmatic, the result of what even one of his Republican allies in the State Senate calls "a charisma bypass." There is also his firm support for abortion rights, which makes him poison to much of the conservative electorate. The issue dominates Republican primaries and his position left him with only the most token role at the Republican Convention in his own home town, San Diego, in 1996. There is his alienation of black and Hispanic voters over his strong stands against illegal immigration and affirmative action.
And finally, there is no certainty he could even carry the electoral powerhouse that is California, which has always been the principal rationale for any national candidacy. Although his support has edged upward over the last year, he remains far from popular in the state. A survey by the Field Institute late last year found that he is still viewed unfavorably by 57 percent of registered voters in his state, just a bit behind Dan Quayle and Newt Gingrich among a field of nine potential Republican contenders for the 2000 nomination.
"A year from now, he'll be driving his own car," said Bob Mulholland, the tart-tongued spokesman for the California Democratic Party, "and he'll be the loneliest ex-governor in the history of California. He's been in politics his whole adult life, and he has no real friends -- and when he gets out of office, he'll find that out."
Mr. Wilson does lead a remarkably solitary life, and his administration has some of the earmarks of an organization running out the clock. His longtime chief of staff and confidant of nearly 30 years, Bob White, resigned last year to become a consultant. On the personal side, he has no children of his own, though his second wife, Gayle, has grown children. He is not a fixture on the social circuit in a state that includes the world's glamour capital. His indulgences include an occasional cigar and a nightly cocktail and reading history, especially about the Civil War. A former marine, he is intensely disciplined and for years ate an unvarying lunch of plain cooked salmon and steamed vegetables, though aides say he has branched out a bit culinarily.
Personable and relaxed one-on-one, peppering his conversation with an occasional "Oh, hell," he is not a great public speaker or glad-hander. For most of his tenure, he has been forced to preside over the worst economic disaster in California since the Great Depression, and has had to make many unpopular decisions, including raising taxes in his first year in office.
Still, for all his deficits, were it not for his support of abortion rights, most politicians agree that Mr. Wilson would be at the top of the list of Republican contenders for the Presidency -- his poor 1996 showing notwithstanding -- instead of somewhere down among the also-mentioned.
"My own view is that this issue shouldn't be allowed to split the Republican Party," Mr. Wilson said. "Or stand in the way of our appealing to a broad middle ground of Americans regardless of their registration, on the issues on which we are united."
In particular, Mr. Wilson contended, the longstanding Republican platform plank in support of a constitutional amendment banning abortion "has given great aid and comfort to the enemy and not done very much for Republicans."
"The basic purpose of that plank, I think very clearly, is to try to prevent abortions," he added, "and to reduce the number of abortions that are performed in America. I am appalled at the number. I am also convinced that that plank is never going to prevent one, because it advocates a constitutional amendment that I am convinced will never be adopted."
Instead, Mr. Wilson said, candidates who are serious about reducing abortions "have to be determined to change the culture" by supporting mentoring programs for teen-agers to encourage them not to become pregnant out of wedlock.
Mr. Wilson, a former Mayor of San Diego, made one failed run for governor, in 1978, before winning two terms in the United States Senate and then beating out Dianne Feinstein, now a Senator from California, for the governorship in 1990. He is widely credited with learning from that experience, and he insists the lessons of 1996 are not lost on him.
"It is very, very difficult, if not impossible, to be the Governor of a large, complex state and do an adequate job of campaigning," Mr. Wilson said, "because the demands of the office that you're holding as Governor are so great, in terms of consuming time and attention."
That would not be an issue this time.
For now, Mr. Wilson said, it is too early to talk seriously about such options, or other post-Sacramento employment, from being involved in business to running a research group. He said he expected to make appearances around the country this year, and to help Republican candidates from other states raise money in California and work to elect Dan Lungren, the current State Attorney General, as governor this year. Mr. Lungren is the all-but-certain Republican nominee.
"I think until the car drags him away from Sacramento one year from now," said Ken Kachigian, one of California's leading Republican consultants and a longtime Wilson friend, "he's going to be appointing judges, issuing executive orders and probably trying to squeeze one last item out of the budget for the next governor. He has a lot of zest for this."

HEADLINE: Dollar's Rise Is Cited as 3M Profit Falls 5%

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: ST. PAUL, Jan. 27

 BODY:
The Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company said today that profit fell 5 percent in the fourth quarter, hurt by the dollar's strength.
The company, a diversified manufacturer, said the dollar's rise had reduced earnings by an estimated 11 cents a share, or 12 percent. Earnings at many United States companies have been eaten into as the amount of dollars produced by sales denominated in foreign currencies has declined. 
 "I don't view this as a major disappointment," Jack Kelly, industry analyst at Goldman, Sachs, said about 3M's results.
Earnings in the latest quarter declined to $366 million, or 89 cents a diluted share, from $385 million, or 91 cents a diluted share, a year earlier. The 1996 period included a one-time gain of $10 million related to a discontinued operation.
Analysts had expected earnings of about 91 cents a share. Today, the company's stock fell $1.4375 a share, to $80.5625.
The company said sales rose 2.5 percent, to $3.71 billion from $3.62 billion. Excluding currency changes, the increase was more than 8 percent. Sales volume increased 12 percent internationally and 4 percent in the United States, or 8 percent after adjustment for the divestiture of 3M's outdoor advertising business.
As the year gets under way, 3M said it expected to feel the impact of slower world economic growth as well as the strong dollar.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Boeing Posts $498 Million Quarter Loss

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
The Boeing Company, still feeling financial pain from difficulties producing commercial aircraft and last year's merger with the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, reported a fourth-quarter loss of $498 million yesterday, leading to its first annual loss in half a century.
Much of the quarterly loss, equivalent to 51 cents a diluted share, reflected a previously announced $1.4 billion charge related to the merger. But Boeing's operating earnings also came in below Wall Street estimates. 
 Excluding the charge, the company said it earned $290 million, or 29 cents a share, in last year's final quarter, compared with $528 million, or 53 cents a share, in 1996. Revenues grew to $11.7 billion, from $10 billion a year earlier. The average estimate of analysts surveyed by I.B.E.S., a firm that tracks corporate earnings, predicted earnings of 32 cents a share. For the year, Boeing lost $178 million, or 18 cents a share, on $45.8 billion in revenues
Given the financial news from Boeing in the last four months -- $4 billion in charges against earnings -- yesterday's announcement was greeted optimistically by investors. Boeing stock rose 56.25 cents, closing at $45 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
"Investor expectations have been lowered," said Howard A. Rubel, an aerospace analyst at Goldman, Sachs, & Company in New York. "For any other world-class company this would have been a disappointing quarter."
Boeing stock rose as high as $60.50 a share in July because the booming global airline industry had deluged it with orders. But the company stumbled as it tried to raise production to 43 planes a month from 18 in 1996. Production fell behind schedule because of parts shortages and inexperienced workers, causing the company to take a $1.6 billion charge in last year's third quarter. An additional $1 billion in charges because of the production problems will be deducted from earnings this year. As a result, the profit margin of Boeing's commercial airplane division -- which has only one real competitor, the European consortium Airbus Industrie -- was just 3 percent last year.
"Clearly, the only thing you can say is it seems the opportunity for improvement is substantial," said Wolfgang Demisch, an aerospace analyst with BT Alex Brown in New York.
Speaking to reporters yesterday, Philip M. Condit, Boeing's chairman and chief executive, said the company had made significant progress resolving the production difficulties and expected to deliver 550 planes this year and next compared with 374 in 1997. The increase is expected to raise Boeing's 1998 revenues 20 percent, to $55 billion.
The company also said the economic crisis in Asia, where it expects to deliver 20 percent of its planes over the next three years, would have only a limited impact. Based on revised economic growth forecasts for the region, Boeing predicted Asia would require 60 fewer planes over the next three years than previously estimated. But Harry S. Stonecipher, Boeing's president, said those planes would simply be sold to carriers elsewhere. "We still believe the region will recover quickly and remain the fastest-growing market for air travel," he said. 
Some analysts were not so sure. Nicholas P. Heymann, an analyst at Prudential Securities, said he believes Boeing will probably sell between 460 and 475 planes this year and closer to 440 to 450 in 1999. Moreover, he said, most of those lost sales will be wide-body planes like the 747 and 777, which are Boeing's most profitable.
The Boeing executives disputed such projections. They said demand was so great for the 747 that they could not fill a new order until the middle of the year 2000.
"If Asia gets stabilized, their perspective is the right one," Mr. Demisch said. "If Asia gets to be very contagious internationally, then their forecast is just flat out wrong."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Gillette, long a favorite of investors, finds itself walking an edge as thin as one of its razor blades.

BYLINE: By Dana Canedy 

 BODY:
THE Gillette Company may nick investor enthusiasm in coming months.
Despite a long string of earnings gains that has made it a stock market favorite, Gillette has hit a rough patch. Its stock is languishing from its high of $106.375 in July 1997. Its domestic sales have been flat. And much is riding on a new shaving system about which little is known. 
 Anyone buying Gillette stock will also be going against the grain of the company's second-largest investor, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company. Kohlberg Kravis has filed a registration to sell a third of its Gillette shares. That portion would be worth about $1.18 billion at yesterday's price.
Hanging on to Gillette means taking on more than average market risk. While Gillette's stock rose 29 percent last year -- roughly in line with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index -- its shares carry a substantial premium. Gillette's stock, which closed at $102.25 yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, is trading at about 34 times 1998 earnings, compared with 21 times for the S.& P. 500.
Management must hit all of the right buttons for the stock to maintain that lofty level.
When a stock is trading at that large of a multiple, "you run the risk if there is a disappointment that it can tend to be more volatile on the down side," said Rose Papp, co-manager of the Papp American Abroad mutual fund, which owns a small stake in Gillette.
After posting $9.6 billion in 1996 revenue, Gillette disappointed investors in August by saying that it would not meet earnings estimates for the full year. Stock analysts then reduced their earnings estimate by 5 cents, to $2.55 a share, and sent the stock tumbling, although it has since recovered. The stock rose $2.1875 yesterday ahead of its earnings announcement.
Among the company's problems is the Braun appliance division, especially its electric shavers, which have high profit margins. Weak economies in Japan and Germany contributed to a slight decline in Braun sales in 1997. While Asia accounts for less than 5 percent of Gillette's sales, the economic downturn there threatens to further slow sales. Over all, Gillette now gets about 70 percent of its revenue from abroad. The company says it hedges against currency risk, making a slump in sales more of an issue than currency fluctuations.
Compounding the trouble caused by foreign economic conditions, revenue in Gillette's largest category, blades and razors, has been flat for most of the year. Shaving products account for 29 percent of sales and 52 percent of operating profits.
For the first nine months of 1997, sales rose 3 percent compared with the period a year earlier, although unfavorable exchange rates depressed revenue by 3 percent. Profits rose 14 percent, in part because of greater operating efficiency, like a 2 percent reduction in advertising.
Gillette expects its new shaving system to generate sales and to help the company sustain profit levels. Its last large-scale introduction was of the popular Sensor line about eight years ago. The new product "delivers shaving performance far superior to any blade product now on the market," the company says.
As is often the case, management has closely guarded details about the product, including its name and the technology that makes it so special, with an eye toward the publicity that will accompany its introduction. Even some of the company's biggest fans are a bit nervous about what will happen if the new shaver is not an immediate hit when it lands on store shelves in July.
"You can't afford to be a high multiple stock and not deliver," said Drake Craig, a portfolio manager for the Calvert Managed Growth fund, which has a sizable position in Gillette. "Whenever you have a big event like this, you're concerned about whether or not they can meet expectations," added Mr. Craig, who is nonetheless bullish on Gillette because of its stability and the growth prospects for Duracell batteries.
Some fund managers and stock analysts have also expressed concern about Gillette's timing. They say they expected the shaver to arrive sooner because the company has been saying for more than a year that it is paring inventory in preparation for the rollout. They wonder whether Gillette needed until summer to reduce an inflated inventory.
Gillette says the inventory reduction was always meant to be gradual. "We never said anything previously about the time, and we are on schedule," said Steve Brayton, a company spokesman.
Investors may also be worried about the message Kohlberg Kravis is sending. The buyout firm, after all, is known for taking large positions in companies as a stock is gaining momentum and selling just before it loses steam.
Kohlberg Kravis owned 34 percent of Duracell, which Gillette acquired just more than a year ago for $8.5 billion, and received Gillette shares in that transaction. It held on to its 37.2 million shares as Gillette's stock price soared but has recently asked to register for sale of up to 11.5 million shares. Any sale will depend on several factors, including the price, Kohlberg Kravis said.
Both Kohlberg Kravis and Gillette said that the proposed sale did not signal a concern about Gillette's prospects. Mr. Brayton noted that Kohlberg Kravis would retain more than two-thirds of its stake in the company and that Henry R. Kravis, its general partner, would remain on Gillette's board.
"The company has been advised by K.K.R. that the proposed sale by its affiliated investment partnerships of Gillette stock is designed to provide liquidity for the investment partnerships and does not reflect any change in the view of K.K.R. toward the company's stock," Mr. Brayton said.
Of course, many investors remain enamored of the company's stock. Gillette has achieved earnings growth of 18 percent for the five years ended in 1996. The company has also smartly diversified, most recently with Duracell. But if worldwide sales of razors ebb and the new shaving system does not generate enthusiasm in the United States, Gillette may lose its well-known edge.

HEADLINE: More Prisons Limit Tobacco But See Little Early Trouble

BYLINE: By JIM ROBBINS 

DATELINE: HELENA, Mont., Jan. 21

 BODY:
It sounds like a recipe for trouble. Ban all forms of tobacco in a prison where 80 percent of the more than 1,200 inmates and half the guards smoke or chew tobacco.
But a week after the total ban started at the State Prison in Deer Lodge, officials said last week, there had been no trouble. 
 "It's a little early," said the warden, Mike Mahoney. "We probably don't have all of the tobacco out of the institution. As we do shakedowns and find stashes, we might start seeing more withdrawal."
Some inmates said tensions had increased.
"As with most addicts, the first day or two you cut them off it's O.K.," said Greg Jellison, who has been serving a sentence for robbery for 12 years. "But things are starting to get a little nasty. The guards are nitpicking."
Over several months, officials had gradually reduced the number of cigarettes that inmates could buy at the canteen. Starting on Jan. 1, no tobacco was sold, and inmates were supposed to turn in personal caches.
"We didn't provide any nicotine gum or nicotine patches," said a Corrections Department spokesman, Mike Cronin. "But we did provide counseling, and that seems to have kept trouble from brewing."
The prison physician, Dr. Robert D. Jones, said the prisoners could expect it to take six to eight weeks to overcome withdrawal symptoms.
The Montana ban is part of a national trend toward tobacco-free prisons. California, Florida, Maryland, Texas, Utah and Vermont are among the states with varying prohibitions on smoking in prison.
The primary reason, officials say, is economic. Because the justice system is handing down longer sentences and the prison population is growing larger and older, health costs are increasing.
Another factor is a growing number of inmates' suits against the authorities, contending that they had suffered from exposure to secondhand smoke.
But smoking continues in places, and some prison officials say money that inmates would have spent on illicit drugs is being used to buy tobacco, in effect creating a black market for cigarettes.
Banning cigarettes in prisons has not been easy. In Vermont, officials instituted a ban on all tobacco in 1992 and then partly rolled that back, allowing smoking outside.
"It's difficult for people who haven't been able to conform to the basic rules of society, with negative reinforcement, to give up something they're addicted to," said Michael O'Malley, Director of Security and Operations for the Vermont Corrections Department.
Vermont relented, Mr. O'Malley said, because prisoners "were picking up disciplinary reports and being put into higher levels of custody for essentially smoking in the boys' room."
"The largest number of people in maximum custody were there for smoking," Mr. O'Malley said.
Inmates can possess cigarettes, but not matches and lighters, which have to be kept outside.
Texas, which banned smoking in 1995, has stuck to a hard line with a complete ban.
That does not mean that the institutions are smoke free. Cigarettes are contraband, with a single cigarette selling for as much $5 and a couple of puffs for $1. Inmates smoke on the sly, with one prisoner standing next to an air vent while another watches for guards, in return for a few puffs.
Texas has had one disturbance over the policy. "It occurred over which gang would control tobacco," said a spokesman for the Criminal Justice Department, Larry Fitzgerald. "Tobacco has become very valuable."
Banning smoking also means that the prison workers have to comply. In Montana, around 200 employees at the prison, including guards, signed a petition against the smoking ban, concerned that it would threaten security.
Extending the ban to employees is "the only legitimate way to do it in this kind of environment," Mr. Mahoney said. "Staff will need to be counseled and advised."
One inmate, Dennye Harris, predicted that there would be problems in a month or two. "That's when all the tobacco will be gone," Mr. Harris said. "There will be a lot more confrontations. Right now, when stress builds, people walk away and have a cigarette as a way of calming down. I was addicted to PCP, and kicking PCP was nothing compared to cigarettes."
Mr. Harris, who has been an inmate for 12 years, said he quit smoking four months ago.
Some inmates said they were nervous about the potential effects of the ban.
"Inmates are talking about having sitdowns," said Mr. Jellison, who added that he did not smoke.
"Most people get killed in this prison over stupid things," he said. "It would be a real shame if someone lost their life over a cigarette."

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Ford Reports 4th-Quarter Earnings Surge

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., Jan. 27

 BODY:
Buoyed by cost reductions and strong sales of high-profit sport utility vehicles, the Ford Motor Company reported today that it earned $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter, up 49.2 percent from a year earlier and surprising Wall Street analysts, who had expected a smaller gain.
Ford also posted record profits of $6.92 billion for 1997, up 55.6 percent from 1996, while sales rose 4.5 percent last year to $153.63 billion. Ford's profits last year were among the highest ever for any American company. Ford earned $1.45 a share in the fourth quarter and $5.62 a share for the year. 
 The company's stock rose $1.625 today to close at $49.875.
"It was a very impressive quarter and year for Ford," said Scott Sprinzen, an analyst at the Standard & Poor's Corporation, the credit rating agency. "There had been cause earlier in the year for skepticism that they would make their targets."
Ford's automotive operations earned record profits of $4.71 billion last year, mainly because profits nearly doubled to $3.7 billion in the United States. But its financial operations were not quite as successful.
Profits at the Ford Motor Credit Company fell to $1.03 billion last year from $1.44 billion in 1996, as a result of cars coming off leases that could not be sold for as much as expected, car loans that could not be collected and higher taxes. John Devine, Ford's chief financial officer, said in an interview this afternoon that Ford had set a target for the division to increase profits by 10 percent or more during 1998, and planned to continue its leasing activities at roughly the current level.
Economic turmoil in Asia had little direct effect on Ford because its operations there remain small. While Ford did not provide separate earnings figures for its operations in countries that have recently devalued their currencies, it did say that automotive operations outside Europe and the Americas showed a $99 million loss in the fourth quarter after a $112 million profit a year earlier.
With the dollar rising against Asian currencies, which makes it cheaper to import cars and car parts to the United States, the American auto market is likely to become even more competitive in 1998, Mr. Devine said. Partly as a result, Ford will try to cut another $1 billion from its costs this year.
"We're going to see pricing pressures as far in the future as we can see," Mr. Devine said.
Ford said that by redesigning manufacturing processes, simplifying automobile designs, paying less to auto parts suppliers and taking other steps, it was able to reduce its costs by $3 billion. While estimates of cost savings are often controversial, Ford officials pointed out that they were able to manufacture and sell 290,000 more cars and trucks last year than in 1996, while keeping total costs virtually unchanged. Ford controlled costs despite making bigger, more expensive vehicles, as it phased out production of several cars while stepping up production of Ford Expedition full-size sport utility vehicles and introducing its sibling, the Lincoln Navigator.
Mr. Devine said that while cost reductions were the biggest reason for profit gains, a shift in sales toward more profitable models also helped, particularly rising sales of sport utility vehicles in North America. Jack Kirnan, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, estimated that Ford earned at least $12,000 apiece before taxes on the 241,000 Expeditions and Navigators it sold last year, for a total contribution to after-tax profits of about $2 billion. The Ford Explorer, Mercury Mountaineer and F-Series pickup trucks also contributed substantially to Ford's profits, Mr. Kirnan added.
Mr. Sprinzen said that Ford might be too dependent now on these light- truck sales in the United States. "In terms of profitability, Ford is very much a North American light-truck company," he said.
Mr. Devine strongly disagreed, saying that Ford's small cars have been very successful lately in Europe and South America. Ford's European operations earned $273 million last year and $158 million just in the fourth quarter, compared with a $291 million loss in 1996 and an $88 million loss in the fourth quarter of 1996.
Ford's South American operations earned $40 million last year, an abrupt turnaround after a $642 million loss the previous year. Ford has introduced several new small-car models there, after a joint venture with Volkswagen broke up three years ago and left Ford stuck with mostly larger, slow-selling cars. But the profits last year in South America came despite a $71 million loss in the fourth quarter, as Brazil in particular was forced to raise interest rates steeply, protecting its currency from a sharp devaluation but severely crimping car sales in the process.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Solid Corporate Profit Reports Help Push Share Prices Higher

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
Stock prices soared yesterday after several blue-chip companies reported solid fourth-quarter earnings, ending a streak of disappointing results.
The winners were the bluest of the blue chips: the Walt Disney Company, Ford Motor and Merck. In the fourth quarter, these three companies alone had profits of more than $3.8 billion -- a boon to what for weeks had been a dreary stock market. Their stocks all rose in response. 
 "Investors went back to the tried and true blue chips," said Robert Freedman, the chief investment strategist at John Hancock Funds in Boston. "We had three companies that beat forecasts and we still have a strong economy."
The resulting gain in share prices yesterday helped lift a market that had been troubled by everything from an economic crisis in Asia to allegations of a sex scandal at the White House.
Just after the opening bell, the Dow Jones industrial average began its ascent. The Dow was up by as much as 130 points late in the day, before closing up 102.14 points, or 1.32 percent, at 7,815.08.
Broader indexes also fared well. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 12.07 points, or 1.26 percent, to 969.02. And the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index jumped 17.44 points, or 1.12 percent, to 1,578.90.
Robert J. Froehlich, chief investment strategist at the Kemper Funds in Chicago, said the market needed a lift, and investors had been preoccupied with other matters.
"This was a psychological rally," Mr. Froehlich said. "We're finally looking at the fundamentals of this earnings season and not the sex scandal in Washington."
Although the earnings released yesterday were just slightly higher than analysts' estimates, Wall Street strategists said they came at a time when investors were desperate for good news.
Indeed, the fourth-quarter earnings season has been rather lackluster, particularly when compared with the last several quarters.
As of midday yesterday, more than half the companies listed in the S.& P. 500 had reported, with about 49 percent reporting better-than-expected results, according to I.B.E.S. International, which tracks corporate earnings.
In the previous three quarters, between 58 and 65 percent had beaten analysts' estimates.
"This is the slowest growth quarter since 1996," said Joseph Abbott, a research manager at I.B.E.S. "It's not awful. It's decent growth, but there are worries about next quarter."
Because of that weakness, share prices have been largely flat to down this year. While the Dow is down by about 1.2 percent, the Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks is about 3.3 percent lower.
The concerns are clear. After three years of spectacular growth, investors are worried that an economic and financial crisis in Asia will damp corporate growth in the United States and force some companies to cut prices to compete with cheaper Asian goods -- meaning even slimmer profits.
There are those on Wall Street who believe that the crisis in Asia will disrupt the bull market here, but most say it will simply mean smaller profits and therefore weaker stock prices.
The growing consensus on Wall Street is that corporate profits will grow by about 5 to 8 percent next year, down from about 11 percent this year. And that should mean more modest stock gains.
Despite those worries, investors are buying up shares of many of the companies that make up the "nifty 50," like Xerox and AT&T, as well as the blue-chip technology companies.
Shares of Intel and Microsoft -- the twin towers of the high-technology world -- are up about 13 percent already this year, and Dell Computer, Compaq and Lucent Technologies are also soaring.
Yesterday, though, share prices may have been aided by weakness in the bond market, which slipped on inflation worries tied to a Government report that labor costs increased sharply in the fourth quarter.
That same report -- which could mean higher costs for United States companies, and therefore thinner profit margins, was ignored by the stock market. But analysts say it is a concern.
 "This is a red flag to everyone," Mr. Froehlich at Kemper said. "There is no way our economy can grow as fast as we did last year. So anything that is going to cost more for corporate America is going to be bad news."

HEADLINE: Uncovered Short Positions Slightly Lower on Nasdaq

 BODY:
Investors seem to have begun the year with a little more optimism.
After reaching a record 1.79 billion shares in December, open positions on short sales on the Nasdaq stock market declined slightly, to 1.77 billion shares, as of mid-January, according to figures released yesterday by the market. 
 The latest figures reflect trades reported through Jan. 12 and settled as of Jan. 15. In a short sale, an investor sells borrowed shares in the hopes of repurchasing them later at lower prices.
The Oracle Corporation, one of the technology companies to suffer from the economic turmoil in Asia, showed the largest increase. Its short position climbed by more than 5 million shares, to 14.7 million. The shares of the data base software company, which fell sharply last month when it reported disappointing earnings, closed yesterday at $19. Its stock had reached a high of $42.125 last August.
Phycor Inc., a physician-practice management company whose plan to buy one of its competitors, Medpartners, fell apart earlier this month, had the largest decrease. Its short position fell by nearly 9 million shares, to 6.7 million.
While high short-interest positions are typically seen as a sign of bearish sentiment, they can also result from complex hedging and trading strategies involving options futures and other stock-related derivatives.

HEADLINE: Carole Kent Kneeland, 49, Minimized Crime in TV News

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

 BODY:
Carole Kent Kneeland, vice president for news at KVUE-TV in Austin, Tex., and one of the first television news directors to de-emphasize sensational crime and introduce "truth tests" in news reports about political advertising, died on Monday at her home in Austin. She was 49.
She died of breast cancer, family members said. 
 Ms. Kneeland's Austin station, a Gannett-owned ABC affiliate, attracted considerable attention two years ago when it instituted "community standards" guidelines for deciding when to broadcast a story about a local crime. Under the policy, a crime story is broadcast only if news executives can answer "yes" to such questions as: Is there an immediate threat to public safety? Is there a significant community impact? Do viewers need to take some kind of action?
The approach has been adopted by several stations around the nation with varying results. At KVUE, the station has maintained its top ratings position for news in the Austin area in most ratings sweeps.
The policy developed by Ms. Kneeland and Cathy McFeaters, who is now news director, is not without critics, and at least one competitor has derided the station for "filtering its news." Under the policy, for instance, the station declined to broadcast a story about three drifters who shot and killed one another after a night of heavy drinking.
But Ms. Kneeland strongly defended the decision. "We are asking, 'Why do I care?' about stories concerning money, or the raising and lowering of interest rates, and other subjects," she complained in a 1996 interview. "But for crime stories, we only asked, 'Are the pictures good, and can we go live?' "
In 1990 she initiated a "truth test" format for political advertising, in which the station would prepare news reports analyzing candidates' claims in such ads.
A native of Salem, Ore., she was a graduate of the University of Washington.
She is survived by her husband, Dave McNeely, political columnist for the Austin American-Statesman; her parents, Sandy and Lorrainne Kent of Austin; two stepdaughters, Michelle Mueller of Houston and Candace McGriffy of Austin; and a brother, Gale Kent of Littleton, Colo.

A Mayor's Prerogative: Rethinking the City's Street Furniture

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
Talk about waiting for a furniture delivery.
It seemed until yesterday that city officials were close to granting a 20-year citywide franchise to a single company for thousands of pieces of "street furniture" -- bus-stop shelters, newsstands and public pay toilets -- displaying $1 billion worth of advertising. Then Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said he was taking another look at the whole idea. 
 "Is there a better and more competitive way to do it?" the Mayor asked. For example, he said, should there be a single contract or several smaller ones? Should it cover the entire city or be broken into boroughs? Should it include all street furniture or be divided into different types of fixtures?
"We haven't made a decision yet," Mr. Giuliani said. Instead, the matter will be reviewed by Randy Levine, the Deputy Mayor for economic development, planning and administration.
The Mayor's remarks at a morning news conference clearly caught off guard the four prospective contractors, three of which are subsidiaries of large European concerns.
Under a comprehensive franchise, one of these companies would build, maintain and operate at least 3,300 shelters, 430 newsstands and 30 public toilets. Advertising panels on these structures would generate revenue of $1 billion or more over the life of the contract, some of which would cover capital expenses and some of which would be paid to the city.
The comprehensive plan has been in the works since 1995, but lost its chief champion at City Hall last February when Deputy Mayor Fran Reiter became Mr. Giuliani's campaign manager.
The comprehensive approach had not been without critics, who feared a blizzard of advertising on city streets, wondered whether City Hall was playing favorites among bidders and doubted whether any company could effectively perform such a sweeping contract for two decades. There was also speculation that Mr. Levine was not especially eager to advance projects initiated by his predecessor, Ms. Reiter.
But Mayor Giuliani said the administration's reconsideration could be traced back "about six months ago when I started thinking that we never had this single plan for the City of New York."
"I think one of the great values of New York City is that it is not planned," the Mayor said. "We have never tried to impose on New York City one idea, one thought, one plan. We don't have the commissar of planning for the city and everything must look the same way."
"Washington, D.C., is a planned city," he said. "It's a beautiful city. But New York City is more famous than Washington, D.C. It is. People come to New York more. And people know New York more all over the world."
The City Council authorized a comprehensive franchise in 1996. Walter L. McCaffrey, the Queens Democrat who heads the Council's zoning and franchises subcommittee, said that the Giuliani administration's new tack would be scrutinized at a hearing on Feb. 10.
"This is such a radical change as to really raise the question of whether New Yorkers are going to get the benefits of an improved type of street furniture," Mr. McCaffrey said yesterday.
The four bidders are Adshel Inc., a division of the More Group P.L.C. of London; JCDecaux New York, a subsidiary of the United States subsidiary of JCDecaux of Paris; Transportation Displays Inc. (TDI), a division of CBS and Wall City Design Inc., which is a subsidiary of Wall Verkehrsanlagen GmbH of Berlin.
After responding to a request for proposals issued last spring by the Giuliani administration, they made follow-up presentations to city officials last month and responded to written inquiries as recently as two weeks ago.
Before yesterday's mayoral news conference, company representatives had expressed doubts about an article that appeared Saturday in The New York Post saying that a change of course might be at hand. Yesterday, they sought to put the best face on this unexpected twist.
"I think it's appropriate for the city to take a second, even a third look," said Douglas E. Watts, president of Wall's United States subsidiary. "I would suggest that they will come to the conclusion that the comprehensive approach is the best. They will also discover, as far as Wall City is concerned, that nobody is offering a cookie-cutter approach."
William M. Apfelbaum, president and chief executive of TDI, said: "I'm glad that the Mayor is looking at it. It's the biggest contract of its kind in the world. I frankly believe that prudence makes sense."
"At the end of the day, it's advertising that makes the whole system work," he said. "To get new shelters, you have to have advertising. To get toilets, you have to have advertising."
A spokesman for Decaux, Martin McLaughlin, said, "No contract has gotten as much scrutiny and evaluation as this one."
"Our approach was to give the city the most diversified program it could possibly have, with different looks for different neighborhoods," he said, adding that Decaux had submitted designs from seven architects in its bid.
None of the prospective contractors have released renderings of models of their proposals.
Currently, the 2,500 or so bus-stop shelters citywide are operated and maintained by Outdoor Systems Advertising of Phoenix. Chris Carr, the general manager of New York operations, said the company "would very much like to continue to operate the bus-stop shelter system."
The recent history of street furniture in New York City has been a troubled one. Efforts during the last eight years to introduce public pay toilets have foundered, although Decaux temporarily installed six prototypes in 1992 and Wall maintains a demonstration model near City Hall.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Prices Tumble on a Report Showing Rising Labor Costs

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Labor costs rose at the fastest pace in five years in the last quarter of 1997, bringing the annual increase in total compensation to 3.3 percent. The news, which immediately raised some inflationary fears, was enough to send bond prices sharply lower.
But the stock market seemed to ignore the report, although many economists say higher compensation would lead to lower earnings as many companies swallow the added costs because competition, especially from Asia, would prevent them from raising prices. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 102.14 points, to 7,815.08. 
 "It poses a challenge to both earnings and inflation expectations," said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, who, unlike many other economists, is forecasting that the recent wage increases will give inflation an unexpected lift this year.
The Employee Cost Index, which measures increases in wages, salaries and costs for employee benefits of private and state and local government workers, rose 1 percent in the fourth quarter, up from an increase of eight-tenths of 1 percent the previous two quarters. Wages and salaries were up 1.1 percent, the largest increase in seven and a half years, while the cost of benefits rose nine-tenths of 1 percent, the largest increase since the third quarter of 1994.
The Department of Labor data seemed to confirm what many economists had been waiting to see: an increase in wages and salaries from the tightening of the labor market with the unemployment rate under 5 percent for seven months last year.
Bond prices fell sharply after the release and recovered only somewhat during the rest of the day, which also saw the auction of a new two-year Treasury note. The 30-year bond's price fell 18/32, to 102 22/32, while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, jumped to 5.93 percent, from 5.89 percent on Monday.
Many economists on Wall Street had reasons for discounting the report, although some said the increase meant the Federal Reserve could not lower interest rates any time soon. The Fed's policy-making committee meets next week and Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, testifies before Congress tomorrow.
One discounting factor was that approximately one-tenth of the one percentage point increase in total compensation in the fourth quarter was attributable to a surge in commissions paid to people arranging or refinancing mortgages.
This business prospered at the end of the year as long-term interest rates fell and was considered a one-time impact. Without that extra one-tenth of a percentage point, the quarterly increase would have been nine-tenths of 1 percent, the figure most Wall Street analysts had forecast.
Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, added that without the added commissions for the mortgage business and Wall Street bonuses, the increase for 1997 would have been 3 percent, the same as 1996. "In the broader economy there is no increase," he said, adding that a much less ebullient Wall Street this year would bring bonuses down.
"If there is a problem out of this," Mr. Steinberg added, "it is earnings." Higher wages are "going to put pressure on margins and then on profits," he added. "There is no pricing power out there."
Wayne Shelly, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said most of the bonuses for 1997 were expected to show up in the data for the first quarter of 1998, which could give it a lift. The bureau's survey goes through the first two weeks of December so many bonuses have not yet been counted.
The bureau, Mr. Shelly said, does not calculate its own number for compensation that would exclude the bonuses and mortgage commissions in the category of finance, insurance and real estate, where total compensation for private workers rose 6.7 percent last year.
The other argument is that the economic collapse in Asia will slow the American economy enough to repress wage increases.
"The outlook is so befuddled by the Asian turmoil that the bigger risk going forward is for less growth and less inflation," said Neil M. Soss, chief United States economist at Credit Suisse First Boston. That slower growth, he added, would cap the rise in total compensation.
But he did say the index should be reflecting increases in health care costs in coming quarterly reports.
Mr. Roach of Morgan Stanley is less sanguine. "When labor costs build up they do not disappear," he said. "They have to show up in higher prices or lower earnings."
In the bond market yesterday, a small rebound from the initial losses came after the Conference Board, a New York business research group, reported that its widely followed consumer confidence survey fell from a record high in January. The index dropped to 127.3 from 136.2. A fall in optimism about the near-term outlook because of the turmoil in Asia accounted for much of the overall decline in confidence, which however, still remains near record highs.
Traders said that yesterday's auction of $15 billion in new two-year notes was a little disappointing. The two-year note was awarded at the high yield of 5.44 percent, with noncompetitive bidding surprisingly strong and the highest since August. On the other hand, bidding was a little softer than expected.
Today the Government will auction $11 billion of five-year notes. In when-issued trading late yesterday the securities were offered at a price to yield 5.53 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's two-year note auction:

Partial Halt By Indonesia On Payments

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Wednesday, Jan. 28

 BODY:
Attacking one of its biggest economic challenges, Indonesia on Tuesday announced a "temporary pause" in payments on billions of dollars in private debt to overseas lenders, formalizing a halt on repayment that had already taken effect quietly among most corporations.
The move was cautiously welcomed by the United States, the International Monetary Fund and Asian financial analysts. All said they viewed it as a sign that Indonesia was finally grappling with its financial problems. 
 But fears remained that the Government might yet declare a formal debt moratorium if problems worsened, which would indefinitely delay payments on at least $65 billion that Indonesian companies owe foreign banks. That debt, denominated in dollars, has multiplied for the companies that earn income in rupiah, the Indonesian currency. The rupiah has plummeted in value by roughly 80 percent since July.
Over the last two months, most companies have simply stopped making debt payments. Some have paid in rupiah, but those payments are only a fraction of the amount due because of the currency's losses. As a result, overseas banks have virtually halted all new lending to Indonesia, slowing the flow of cash through the banking system and further hobbling economic activity as the nation heads into recession.
In Washington Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin endorsed the move, and other officials said it was the first step toward developing the rough equivalent of a bankruptcy process, which this country lacks. "We welcome the steps taken by the Indonesian Government over the last several days to put in place the reinforced reform program" of the I.M.F., Mr. Rubin said.
The process established will essentially allow overly indebted Indonesian companies to negotiate as a group with creditors. But it is far from clear that those creditors, chiefly banks in Japan and Europe, will be willing to work out a deal similar to the one now under negotiation with South Korean banks. Because Indonesia's political future is considered uncertain, and because the debts are dispersed, it will likely prove far harder to strike a deal.
The country is grappling with a dangerous mixture of economic and political troubles. Fear of unrest has grown in advance of an electoral convention in March, when President Suharto is expected to gain a new five-year term after 32 years in office. Dissatisfaction with his autocratic rule has grown as Indonesians have begun to doubt his ability to address the economic crisis and as unemployment and rising prices have started to hurt.
The announcement of the freeze on interest payments was made by Radius Prawiro, a former Cabinet minister appointed by President Suharto to manage the country's corporate debt. He estimated that 228 Indonesian companies were unable to service their debts.
"A temporary pause in foreign-currency debt service, both of interest and capital, would be needed for these companies, to allow time for new arrangements to be worked out between lenders and borrowers," Mr. Radius said at a news conference. Those companies still able to service debts must continue to do so, he said.
Mr. Radius insisted that his announcement did not amount to a formal moratorium on payment. "A structure is being developed to encourage borrowers to restore full debt service at the earliest possible date," he said.
Mari Pangestu, an economist with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, agreed, calling the arrangement a breather that would allow borrowers and lenders to discuss new arrangements. "A moratorium is only the last resort," she said.
The action on debt followed an Indonesian announcement Tuesday morning of banking changes that included deposit guarantees for at least two years, closing of weak banks, plans for stricter supervision and an end to restrictions on foreign ownership.
These changes responded to demands of the I.M.F., which organized a $40 billion rescue package in October and oversaw a revised austerity package announced here this month.
Despite the steps on banking and debt, Standard & Poor's lowered Indonesia's debt rating on Tuesday for the third time in less than a month. It cited a continuing lack of confidence in the country's ability to grapple with its financial and political problems.
Even so, the rupiah rose sharply here on Tuesday, climbing to an exchange rate of 10,450 to the dollar from 12,950 late Monday. But traders said this was mostly the result of rupiah purchases by the Indonesian central bank.
According to the Bank for International Settlements, Japanese banks were the heaviest international lenders to Indonesia as of June 1997. The Japanese held 39 percent of $58.7 billion in foreign debt owed by Indonesian concerns. German banks had 9.5 percent of the total, French banks 8 percent, American banks 7.8 percent and British banks 7.4 percent.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
RJR Operating Profit Rises, But Charges Cause a Loss

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
The RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation reported yesterday that profits from its operations rose 20 percent in the quarter, partly as a result of higher cigarette prices, but the company posted a $197 million net loss primarily because of one-time charges and expenses stemming from its tobacco business.
The financial results were slightly higher than Wall Street's expectations and contained a few surprises. Among them was the increase in domestic tobacco operating profits, which were up 16 percent -- a sharp contrast to recent years of flat or only meager growth. The growth came after a series of price increases for cigarettes, which were far higher than the rate of inflation, said David Adelman, a tobacco industry analyst at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company. 
 "In April, the industry took its normal price increase and then there were two more," primarily to finance tobacco litigation settlements, Mr. Adelman said, calling the pricing "an anomaly."
Moreover, RJR Nabisco faces some problems at the Nabisco Holdings Corporation, of which it owns 80.5 percent and which accounts for about a third of RJR's operating profits. On Monday, Nabisco, the food company, reported fourth-quarter earnings that were generally in line with analysts' expectations. But it also warned that 1998 earnings were very likely to be flat because of stagnant sales of some products.
Shares of both companies fell sharply on Monday, with RJR Nabisco losing $2.3125. Yesterday, RJR's share rose 31.25 cents, to $31.875, on the New York Stock Exchange.
In a statement yesterday, Steven F. Goldstone, the chairman of both companies, called the food company's performance "respectable" but added, "Nabisco's new C.E.O., Jim Kilts, and his team must resolve several significant performance issues -- biscuit sales softness and lingering problems in the sales force reorganization chief among them -- before Nabisco can resume the sales and earnings momentum it has enjoyed in the past."
Make that the distant past, as far as some investors are concerned. "If there's one common theme with Nabisco or RJR Nabisco, it's manana, manana, manana," said John M. McMillin, an analyst with Prudential Securities. "Shareholders have been told manana for about four or five years now. A lot of them have understandably run out of patience."
Nomi Ghez, an analyst for Goldman, Sachs & Company, said Monday's stock selloff reflected Wall Street's concerns that Nabisco would need a lot of time to rebound. "It will take them the better part of the year to turn the business around," she said. But she added that she was confident James M. Kilts, the former executive of the Philip Morris Companies' Kraft Foods unit, who took over at Nabisco on Jan. 1, could do it.
In its financial report yesterday, RJR Nabisco said it lost $197 million, or 64 cents a diluted share, in the fourth quarter, compared with net income of $215 million, or 63 cents a diluted share, in the comparable period a year earlier. Revenues in the quarter slipped slightly, to $4.58 billion from $4.63 billion in the 1996 quarter.
But excluding one-time charges in both periods, the company said, operating earnings rose to $297 million, or 87 cents a diluted share, from $248 million, or 72 cents, a year earlier. Wall Street's consensus profit estimate for the 1997 quarter was 83 cents a diluted share, according to I.B.E.S. International Inc., which tracks corporate earnings projections.
RJR Nabisco's financial statement included a total of $494 million in special charges and one-time expenses. Among them was a $313 million after-tax expense to cover reorganization costs in the tobacco businesses, announced last month. That expense cost shareholders 96 cents a diluted share.
Another one-time expense was $85 million, or 26 cents a diluted share, for the costs of a legal settlement with the State of Texas. The state's Attorney General had sued the company over Medicaid expenses tied to treating people with diseases caused by cigarette smoking.
The charges also included $75 million, or 23 cents a diluted share, for inventory reduction at RJR's international tobacco company.
For all of 1997, RJR said, net income fell more than 37 percent, to $381 million, or $1.03 a diluted share, down from $611 million, or $1.74 a diluted share, in 1996, including settlement-related costs and one-time items. Sales for 1997 were flat at $17.06 billion.

HEADLINE: Governor's Inmate Estimates Were Too High, Memo Says

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 27

 BODY:
State prison officials said today that they had greatly overestimated how fast the inmate population would grow in the next few years, predictions on which Gov. George E. Pataki based his call for more prison construction.
A year ago, the Department of Correctional Services projected that the prison population would rise by almost 13,000 over five years, to 82,000. But in an internal memorandum written last month, one of the department's chief planners said the increase would probably be less than 6,000. 
 Officials confirmed today that the lower estimates in the memo reflect the administration's current position. A copy of the memo was provided to The New York Times by a Democratic official opposed to the Governor's prison expansion plan.
The numbers were hotly contested during last year's protracted budget debate, with the Governor, a Republican, insisting that much more prison space was needed to keep up with a steadily expanding number of inmates. The Democrats who control the Assembly pointed to a plummeting crime rate and argued that the Governor's figures were inflated.
Mr. Pataki began the budget fight last year by calling for space for 7,000 more maximum-security inmates, and the Legislature eventually agreed to build 3,100, an outcome widely viewed as a victory for the Governor. On top of that increase, Mr. Pataki, who is running for re-election, proposed a new 1,500-bed maximum-security prison, at a cost of $180 million, in the budget proposal he made last week.
A new estimate by the Department of Correctional Services said the prison population, which stood at 69,377 on Dec. 31, would reach 75,000 in 2002, about the same as the estimate offered by Sheldon Silver, the Assembly Speaker, in last year's budget talks. In fact, while the Governor was predicting a continued steep rise in the number of inmates, 1997 saw the first decrease since 1972, a drop of 500 inmates.
"Projections are more of an art than a science, and these projections were not that far off," said Katherine N. Lapp, the Governor's director of criminal justice. "I'm actually amazed at how accurate these projections have been."
She noted that the state's prisons are still 30 percent over the capacity for which they were designed, with extra beds installed in dormitory-style buildings, two inmates in some cells designed for one, and rooms that were not originally built as cells turned into cells. "The fact is, the figures show that we need the prison space the Governor has fought so hard for," she said.
Prison construction is always popular with the Governor's allies in the Republican majority in the State Senate, many of whom represent areas upstate where prisons are one of the few sources of economic development and jobs. Each time a new prison is approved, several small upstate towns engage in a fierce lobbying war to be awarded the prize.
But Democratic legislators, who are mostly from New York City, have argued that with serious crime falling steadily since the early 1990's, there would inevitably be a decline in felony arrests, indictments and convictions.
In fact, the number of people being sent to state prison, after soaring during the 1980's, has dropped every year since 1992, but at first the prison population kept rising, in part because longer sentences were being imposed for certain crimes.
"I'm not surprised that we're being proved right because it was so obvious all along," said Assemblyman Daniel L. Feldman, a Brooklyn Democrat and chairman of the Correction Committee. "No matter what the facts are, they'll find a rationale for more construction. This is about elections and appearing tough on crime."
The Dec. 23 memorandum by Paul H. Korotkin, assistant director for planning, to Glenn S. Goord, commissioner of the state prison system, acknowledges that trend, noting that so far in the fiscal year that began April 1, "indictments are 7.6 percent lower than they were" the year before.
The memo predicts 4,600 fewer people being sent to state prisons each year, beginning next year, than in the projections of a year earlier.
Ms. Lapp said some changes in prison population projections result from a law enacted last year that will allow about 1,000 nonviolent offenders to be released early each year. But so far, that program has cut less than four months off the time served by the average prisoner who qualifies, lowering the prison population by only about 300 at any one time.

HEADLINE: State Splits Use of Orange County Land

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 27

 BODY:
In a decision closely watched by environmentalists and business leaders, the Pataki administration announced today that it would allow development of roughly 1,200 acres of state-owned open space near Stewart International Airport in Orange County, while preserving 6,200 more acres for recreation.
In a one-page statement released this evening, Charles A. Gargano, the commissioner of the Empire State Development Corporation, said the administration's plan for the 7,400-acre tract struck a balance between the needs of the environment and the interests of the struggling local economy. 
 "As we set aside this land for the public to enjoy, we will continue our plans to privatize and develop the remaining lands at Stewart to create jobs and economic opportunity for the people of the Hudson Valley," Mr. Gargano said.
The announcement did not entirely satisfy either environmentalists who wanted more land preserved or community leaders who lobbied to have more land returned to the tax rolls.
George J. Meyers, the city supervisor of New Windsor, which holds 90 percent of the state-owned tract, said he was happy that some land was being opened to development, but that he had hoped for more.
"Obviously, I would have liked to have all of it back on the tax rolls," Mr. Meyers said. "But we're pleased that we are going to get some of that land developed so we get people into jobs."
John Stouffer, the legislative director for the Sierra Club's Atlantic Chapter, said that although he was pleased that the bulk of the land was spared, it was a mistake to carve up a valuable expanse of woods, fields and wetlands that draws thousands of hunters, hikers, bird-watchers and cyclists each year.
"It's better than destroying the whole thing," Mr. Stouffer said. "But this is not great news. This will cut 1,200 acres out of an extremely valuable piece of open space that has an important habitat value because it links fields, forests and wetlands."
Gov. George E. Pataki initially proposed selling all 7,400 acres as part of a plan to privatize Stewart Airport, a state-owned airport 60 miles north of New York City. While the Governor had said he wanted some of the land preserved for recreational space, his original sale proposal did not specify how much land would be protected.
But under the plan announced today, the preserved land would be managed by the State Department of Environmental Conservation. The agency will be responsible for maintaining trails, protecting wildlife and preserving the wetlands. The administration did not say how the other 1,200 acres would be developed.
"The woods, fields and wetlands west of Stewart Airport will remain available to the people of New York State for recreational uses, including hunting, fishing, cycling, bird-watching, hiking, horseback riding and cross-country skiing," Mr. Gargano said.
Mr. Pataki first proposed selling the airport outright in 1995 as part of an effort to privatize many state assets, including the World Trade Center and a network of former mental hospitals. But the sale of any airport is complicated by stringent Federal regulations and oversight.
Now the administration plans to lease the airport to a private company to run day-to-day operations. In November, the Federal Government gave preliminary approval to that proposal.
The administration says the leasing plan would generate revenue for the state, shift the burden of maintaining the airport from taxpayers to private interests and ultimately make the airport more efficient and profitable.
For years, the state has lost money on the operation of Stewart, about $2 million annually, and is just beginning to break even. Stewart, used by 400,000 passengers a year, has 58 daily flights to airline hubs in the United States.
The administration plans to negotiate a lease that runs between 30 and 99 years. The State Economic Development Corporation is reviewing lease proposals from five companies.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Administration Negotiating for a Jazz Concert Hall on Site of the Coliseum

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The Giuliani administration is negotiating a deal to create a concert hall for Lincoln Center's jazz programs, in a move that could jump-start the bidding process for the redevelopment of the New York Coliseum site, a project that has been mired in a variety of disputes for the last 14 years.
The concert hall, which would serve as a home for Jazz at Lincoln Center, which produces both music and educational programs, and be used by other performing artists, would presumably be incorporated into plans to develop one of the city's most valuable pieces of real estate -- a parcel across from the southwest corner of Central Park. 
 Five finalists are vying for the rights to build a combined residential, hotel and retail complex on the 3.4 acres, a 2.1-million-square-foot project. Bidding has soared well above $300 million.
Efforts by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to sell the parcel, which is now occupied by the Coliseum and an office building, have been stalled since last July, when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani suddenly vowed to block the proposed high-rise project unless it included a large theater or performance space.
The subsequent seven-month delay exacerbated a longstanding rift between city and state officials and wreaked havoc on plans by some bidders: Donald Trump, who had bid $275 million, said he was dropping out altogether, and Millennium Partners, which had all but won the bidding, lost two key tenants, Westin Hotels and Resorts and Sony Entertainment. Sony has opened talks with rival developers, real estate executives involved in the bidding said.
In the meantime, Related Companies appears to have strengthened its hand, signing nonbinding agreements with Time Warner for all the office space in its proposed complex and with the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group for a 375-room hotel. The other leading contender, a partnership between the developers Bruce Ratner and Daniel Brodsky, landed tentative deals with Westin Hotels, Sears, and Virgin. Tishman Speyer, the fifth bidder, has adopted a wait-and-see posture toward the project. But as Millennium discovered, any nonbinding agreements or letters of intent can prove ephemeral the longer the process drags on.
City and state officials say that if a deal with Jazz at Lincoln Center is struck some time in the next week it will allow the M.T.A. to finally resume talks with the developers and ultimately select one.
The M.T.A. did not return repeated calls requesting comment, but John S. Dyson, chairman of the Mayor's Council of Economic Advisors, confirmed that a deal with Jazz at Lincoln Center was under discussion.
At the city's request, Jazz at Lincoln Center gave the Giuliani administration a formal proposal on Jan. 22 for a theater with up to 1,200 seats, according to executives involved in the talks. The two sides are now working out the financing for the theater, as well as the role of Lincoln Center in administering the space.
Gordon J. Davis, the chairman of Jazz at Lincoln Center, declined to comment, as did Nathan Leventhal, the president of Lincoln Center.
Charles Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, said, "We would like to accommodate the city and the Mayor in what they want to include in the project."
Some officials and developers say that unless the project moves forward soon there is a danger that the economy will slow down and the state will miss a chance to benefit from a hot real estate market. An 11-year effort to sell the site to the developer Mortimer Zuckerman collapsed during the recession in 1994.
"It's important to bring this to a conclusion while the economy is hot," Mr. Dyson acknowledged. "The public will get a better price and a better project."
According to a senior city official who requested anonymity, the winning developer of the Columbus Circle parcel would be expected to build a shell for the proposed theater, which is expected to cost about $20 million. Lincoln Center would raise money to outfit the theater, with the city contributing part of the cost from its capital budget. To offset the cost of erecting the theater shell, however, developers may choose to pare their bids, which have soared to over $300 million, city officials said.
But the sale price has been an ongoing source of friction between city and state officials. The M.T.A. has wanted to reap as much money as possible from the sale for various capital programs. More than two years ago, the city and state jointly resumed efforts to sell the parcel.
But just as the state agency was about to select Millennium Partners as the winning developer last July, Mayor Giuliani accused the state of ignoring planning and esthetic issues, and threatened to invoke his veto.
In keeping with Columbus Circle's role as a public gateway between midtown and the Upper West Side, he demanded that a "very, very large theater" of about 2,000 seats be included in any project on the site.
The Mayor's announcement surprised Lincoln Center, which was negotiating with Millennium Partners over a 600-seat theater for Jazz at Lincoln Center at a proposed project on Broadway several blocks north of Columbus Circle. At the time, Mr. Leventhal said he would consider Columbus Circle as an alternative.
In August, the five developers met with city officials and began incorporating plans for a performance space into their proposals. But, the developers say, they have not heard from the city or state since then.
Mr. Brodsky and Mr. Ratner, for instance, developed a plan for a 2,000-seat theater that would be operated by a joint venture of the Shubert and Jujamcyn theater groups.
Unable to strike a firm deal with Millennium, Westin Hotels defected to the Brodsky-Ratner team. "We've signed a letter of intent," said Jack Van Hartsvelt, Westin's executive vice president. "We're waiting for a little clarity as to who is going to win this."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Covering Asia With Cash;
Banks Poured Money Into Region Despite Warning Signs

BYLINE: By Timothy O'Brien; This article was reported by Timothy L. O'Brien, Edmund L. Andrews and Sheryl WuDunn and was written by Mr. O'Brien.

 BODY:
A little more than a year ago, several European banks helped Garuda Indonesia airlines lease six huge Airbus jets worth $630 million. The Indonesian economy was surging, and Asian airlines were rapidly expanding their fleets.
Now East Asia is engulfed in its biggest financial crisis in decades. And like thousands of businesses, Garuda is in trouble. Air travel is down, and Garuda could not make an $8 million payment owed on the new jets last month. The loans to Garuda may sour. 
 Even as hints of trouble were emerging in Asian economies, many international banks were stepping up their lending to Asian companies and banks. By the time financing was arranged for Garuda in December 1996, international banks had forked over $367 billion to borrowers in Asia, up 20 percent from the previous year, according to the Bank for International Settlements, which coordinates the world's central banks. Six months later, the borrowings had swelled to $389.4 billion, excluding a large amount of lending to Hong Kong and Singapore.
"There was a huge euphoria about Asia and Southeast Asia," said Dennis Phillips, a spokesman for Commerzbank, a big German bank. "It was the place to be."
The place to be, indeed. The roster of Asia's lenders includes the most well-known names in international banking, all of which found Asian growth -- and loan profits -- too seductive to ignore. Japanese banks have long been the leading lenders in the region.
Among American banks, Chase Manhattan, Citicorp, J. P. Morgan, BankAmerica and Bankers Trust have the greatest exposure to the most troubled Southeast Asian economies. Each bank tallies its loans differently, so lending figures are not directly comparable. But J. P. Morgan -- which said last week that payment on $587 million of its loans, mainly in Asia, was seriously overdue -- has obvious problems. Analysts are also casting wary eyes on Chase and Citicorp.
But as the American banks slightly scaled back their lending during the first six months of 1997, some Japanese, German, French and British banks plunged in deeper. Hemmed in by slow growth and sagging profits at home and eager to feed a growing demand for loans in Asia, lending by French and German banks climbed $7.9 billion, or 10 percent, in the first half of last year, and Japanese institutions added $5.3 billion, or 4 percent more, in loans. More recent data are not available.
While the loan problems are not expected to severely damage any of the banks, one bank could have serious problems: Credit Lyonnais, a long-troubled French financial institution.
"We anticipated some problems, but we did not expect to see anything like what has happened," said Andre Levy-Lang, chairman of Banque Paribas, another large French bank, which does not expect significant losses. "The key thing is that the crisis is not over. And it is very difficult to anticipate how it will evolve."
The World Bank, in a report issued yesterday, said that lax regulations and dubious financial practices in Asian countries "were aggravated by undisciplined foreign lending, which led to too much money chasing bad investments." The World Bank noted that Asia's reliance on short-term debt "left the economies vulnerable to a sudden collapse of confidence."
In a more detailed look, Fitch IBCA -- a major international rating agency -- noted yesterday that Japanese banks were the most at risk in Asia and cited Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. as having particularly heavy exposure to Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea.
Fitch said that Citicorp, among all American banks operating in Asia, "has the highest risk exposure in the region, given its large indigenous retail and commercial banking presence." Among German banks, Fitch said that Commerzbank, Westdeutsche Landesbank and Bayerische Landesbank "are the most vulnerable" to Asian losses. Credit Lyonnais was the sole French bank cited by Fitch as being heavily exposed to losses in Asia.
One particular problem fostered by all the global lenders is that most of the loans are short term -- due in a year or less -- and must be repaid in dollars, francs or marks. Banks liked short-term lending in Asia because it seemed to limit their risk and offered tidy profits. But the result was to create a financial time bomb for Asian borrowers because short-term loans left them less room to maneuver if they were unexpectedly pressed for cash. Starting last summer, when local currencies collapsed in Asia, it took more Thai baht and South Korean won to repay those loans, thus crippling borrowers.
The banks have so far been determined to get all their money back, though billions of dollars have been set aside for potential losses. In New York last week, South Korean negotiators asked to stretch out repayment of their loans well beyond a year. Banks now appear willing to appease the South Koreans, although it is unclear whether that includes swallowing some losses.
Germany's Bayerische Landesbank A.G., saddled with about $11 billion in Asian loans, suspended three of its managers in Singapore last week for reportedly making loans without collateral. Societe Generale, another large French bank, said it would set aside "substantial" funds to brace itself from losses on $6.8 billion in Asian loans.
The Asian lending frenzy began because the region's economic promise once seemed limitless.
"All the banks would be standing in line -- J. P. Morgan, Deutsche Bank, Dresdner," said Klaus Friedrich, chief economist at Germany's Dresdner Bank A.G. "We were all standing in line trying to help these countries borrow money. We would all see each other at the same places. We all knew each other."
Indeed, Asia was heaven for loan officers. Sakura Bank Ltd. and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. led a flotilla of Japanese banks that more than doubled their lending to Thailand between 1993 and 1996; Germany's Deutsche Bank A.G., which lent money to Garuda, also made risky, temporary loans across Asia so it could be first in line for corporate bond deals -- loans that may now go unpaid. International lenders bankrolled everything from empty high-rises in Thailand to South Korean companies' speculation in Brazilian bonds.
The first concrete signs of trouble emerged in Thailand when real estate developments failed to fill with tenants. But bigger trouble hit early last year in South Korea when the Hanbo Steel Industry Company collapsed. A few months later, the Sammi Steel Corporation filed for protection from creditors. Still, Japan's lending to Asia kept rising.
Did Japanese bankers see trouble coming? "We didn't think about it," said one Japanese banker who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Not until Korea First Bank, a large bank and a leading lender to Hanbo, sought a bailout from the South Korean Government last summer did this Japanese banker realize something was amiss.
But an American banker, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said the warning signs had always been there -- bankers just did not want to see them. "There are problems in Asia now because investors and bankers were overly optimistic about the Asian economies, and then they panicked," he said.
Moody's Investors Service, which rates the creditworthiness of borrowers and has been criticized for overlooking the depths of Asia's problems, still sounded an early alarm in March 1996. Citing risks facing Thailand because of its love affair with short-term loans, Moody's said the country was vulnerable to unexpected economic shocks.
"When we put that report out, everyone said how wrong we were and that we didn't understand the numbers," said Vincent Truglia, a managing director with Moody's.
In fact, all sorts of numbers were overlooked in Asia. Data on Asian airlines indicated that the industry was expanding too quickly at the time the Garuda loan was made. One American banker familiar with Garuda's financial picture referred to the company as "toxic waste." And South Korean conglomerates were stuffed with dangerously high levels of debt.
But loans were often made for more than sound banking reasons. In South Korea, a loan to a large conglomerate, or chaebol, was tantamount to making a loan to the Government. "That was the rule of the game in Korea," said Vivien Levy-Garboua, chief executive of international operations for Banque Nationale de Paris. "It was a Korea Inc. loan."
Many of the banks made some risky loans at first in the hope of building a relationship that would yield more business later. A loan might lead to investment banking fees or a lucrative bond offering later.
And some loans are backed by assets or unusual guarantees. Credit Lyonnais and Deutsche Bank remain sanguine about Garuda because a portion of their loans has Government guarantees, and jets are valuable collateral. Credit Lyonnais said that its Garuda exposure was in the "tens of thousands" of dollars.
Deutsche Bank said its portion of the Garuda loan was guaranteed by the British Government, although the bank acknowledges that an undisclosed portion of the loan does not carry any Government guarantees.
American and European bankers said that while they were aware that South Korean companies were overextended, they thought it would require a unique confluence of events to transform Asia's economic problems into a full-blown disaster. Yet that is what happened.
Short-term loans in South Korea made it easy for banks to rush out of the country, and the traffic jam to exit late last year nearly toppled the economy. As much as $20 billion in loans were pulled out of the country between late last summer and the end of December, according to American commercial bankers. While American banks largely kept their money in the country, a large Japanese bank said that Japan's lending to South Korea plummeted nearly 40 percent between last June and last month. By Christmas Eve, international banking regulators were twisting the arms of lenders to prevent them from abandoning the country.
"A headlong rush for the exits only perpetrated the very event everyone was trying to avoid, which was a wholesale liquidity crisis in which you won't get repaid," said Robert E. Fallon, Asia-Pacific division manager for Chase Manhattan.

Before the Asian financial crisis erupted last summer, international banks went out of their way to put billions of dollars in loans into the hands of companies in East Asia.
 
JAPANESE BANKS
They are most at risk because they were the most aggressive. Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, which has committed an estimated 90 percent of its equity cushion to loans in the region, may be in the worst shape.
 
EUROPEAN BANKS
They stepped up their lending even as some Japanese and American banks were beginning to pull back. Among the most exposed are France's Credit Lyonnais, and Germany's Commerzbank and Westdeutsche Landesbank.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Clinton Shelving '98 Trade Bill In Favor of New I.M.F. Funds

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
With the Asian financial crisis threatening the health of the American economy, the Clinton Administration has decided to make Congressional passage of $18 billion in new contributions to the International Monetary Fund a far higher priority this year than winning authority to negotiate new trade accords, according to senior Administration officials.
Mr. Clinton's top economic and foreign policy aides concluded it would be all but impossible to get Congressional approval for both the I.M.F. commitments and the trade legislation, which was withdrawn late last year after Mr. Clinton could not overcome resistance in his own party. 
 Tonight, in his State of the Union address, Mr. Clinton briefly renewed his request for the trade legislation.
But hours before the speech, a top adviser to the President said that getting authority to strike trade deals "will be neither one of the top priorities or the top international economic priority" this year.
That represents a major retreat for the Administration, which pledged late in 1997 to fight for the negotiating authority again this year before Mr. Clinton attends a summit meeting of Latin American countries in Santiago, Chile, this spring.
Even before the President was caught up in the current scandal, doubts had intensified that he could force through fast-track trade negotiating authority, which would allow the President to strike deals that Congress could approve or disapprove, but not amend.
Tonight, Mr. Clinton dwelled at some length on the need for the United States to provide aid, through the I.M.F., to ailing economies that are among the biggest United States trading partners.
"The American economy remains sound and strong," he said, "and I want to keep it that way. But because the turmoil in Asia will have an impact on all the world's economies, including ours, making that negative impact as small as possible is the right thing to do for America, and the right thing to do for a safer world.
"Preparing for a far-off storm that may reach our shores," he added, "is far wiser than ignoring the thunder until the clouds are just overhead."
At the end of the last session, Congress refused to authorize $3.5 billion in additional I.M.F. funds. This money had been intended to give the I.M.F. new resources to aid ailing economies, but it floundered amid debate about American financing of abortion services overseas.
In the interim, the United States has committed its own funds to bailout efforts in South Korea and Indonesia, and the question of whether it should be aiding the Asian economies at all has taken on broader dimensions. Liberal Democrats say the I.M.F.'s bailouts save big investors and borrowers, at the expense of workers, many of whom suffer layoffs and economic downturns after the I.M.F. orders countries to impose austerity measures.
Conservative Republicans say the I.M.F. meddles in the market, rather than letting the economy sort out winners and losers. But the two ideologically opposed groups are likely to mount a joint campaign to defeat further contributions.
"It's going to be an enormously tough fight," a senior Administration official said today.
Mr. Clinton argued tonight that the nation's security and economic interests hinged on stabilizing its trading partners. "These countries are our customers," he said, "and if Asia sinks into recession, they won't be able to buy the goods we'd like to sell them. Second, they are our competitors, and if their currencies lose their value, the price of their goods will drop, flooding our market and others with cheap goods, which make it a lot tougher for our people to compete."
Nonetheless, the decision to shore up the I.M.F. first is bound to be read in Latin America as another long delay in Washington's commitment to some of its geographically closest trade partners.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Plans Budget Seeking Modest Growth For Spending

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
Even though the local economy is expanding and tax revenues are growing, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani plans to announce a relatively austere budget tomorrow that calls for New York City to increase most spending at less than the inflation rate, administration officials said yesterday. Under the Mayor's proposal, the city would squirrel away much of its current budget surplus to help close anticipated shortfalls in the next two years, the officials said.
The Mayor is expected to announce that the city will finish the 1998 fiscal year with a surplus of $1.2 billion, thanks in large part to a surging Wall Street. It will be the second year in a row of good fortune for the city, which was pummeled by the recession in the early 1990's. The city ended its last fiscal year with $1.4 billion more than it expected. 
 But in contrast to the election-year budget that he presented at this time last year, which called for sharply increased spending on education, children's services and other programs, the Mayor is returning to the conservative fiscal stance that he took early in his first term, when he pushed through some of the largest spending cuts since the city's fiscal crisis of the 1970's.
The new budget calls for spending on most programs to increase by roughly six-tenths of 1 percent, well under the annual local inflation rate of about 2 to 2.5 percent, administration officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The Mayor also plans to call for cuts in some programs.
"The message of this budget is that we are putting the city on a sound financial course," said a senior administration official. The overall size of the budget, including Federal and state grants, is expected to be $34 billion to $35 billion.
While the Mayor is proposing that the city reserve most of the surplus to deal with shortfalls in the next two years, some independent fiscal experts say he should use the money for more long-term deficit reduction. In other words, he could allocate the surplus in ways that would spread out the deficit reduction over several years, instead of just the next two. He could do that, for example, by retiring some of the city's growing long-term debt, which would reduce city's payments of principal and interest.
Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group, said last night that he had not yet seen the details of the Mayor's budget. But he said that "retiring outstanding debt, generally speaking, is preferable because you get greater savings spread out over a long period."
Instead, mayoral aides said yesterday, Mr. Giuliani plans to reserve from 70 to 75 percent of the projected $1.2 billion surplus in the current fiscal year, or $840 million to $900 million, and use it for the expected budget gaps in the next two years, officials said. They defended this policy, saying that while it might not be exactly the medicine prescribed by some fiscal watchdogs, it was still a departure from past administrations, which often raised spending significantly when the economy rebounded, leaving the city poorly positioned for the inevitable downturns.
In his new budget, Mr. Giuliani is also expected to call for the city to spend about 20 percent of the money, or $240 million, on new programs, including new education proposals and his anti-drug campaign, which he is hoping will be one of the signature initiatives of his second term. The rest of the surplus would go toward making up for revenue lost to new tax cuts.
During his re-election campaign last fall, Mr. Giuliani proposed $70 million in tax cuts for small businesses and families who pay for child care, and those cuts are expected to be part of the new plan, but administration officials declined yesterday to discuss the exact structure of cuts.
The budget that the Mayor announces tomorrow is known as the preliminary financial plan, and it includes a prediction of the city's financial standing over the next four years. In May, he is to detail the final version of the plan, which is known as the executive budget. Approval by the City Council is required for the executive budget to become law. The 1999 fiscal year begins on July 1.
The city had been facing a projected deficit in the 1999 fiscal year of more than $1 billion, but the Mayor's plan for the surplus should help him avoid proposing large budget cuts to close that gap. The city has also projected shortfalls of more than $2 billion in the 2000 and 2001 fiscal years; the plan for the surplus is expected to help winnow the gap for the year 2000. Part of the $1.2 billion surplus projected for this fiscal year comes from a so-called rainy day fund that the Mayor agreed to set up after prodding from the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone.
The city has been able to end its current and the preceding fiscal years with more money than it expected, largely because the Mayor and the Council have decided to estimate tax revenues as if Wall Street would have a moderately successful year. But because the financial-services sector continues to boom, taxes have climbed and growth in other areas of the economy, like tourism, has also produced added revenue.
While the last two years have been bountiful, the city still must confront many long-term fiscal problems, experts said. Among the most serious is the size of its outstanding debt.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Japan Finance Minister Resigns, Opening Way to a Shift in Policy

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, Jan. 28

 BODY:
Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka formally resigned today to take responsibility for a bribery scandal, in a move that raised the possibility of a shift in Government policy to stimulate Japan's economy and help ease the rest of Asia out of its financial crisis.
Mr. Mitsuzuka told reporters Tuesday that his resignation was a response to the arrest Monday of two ministry officials accused of accepting bribes from the banks that they supervised. The arrests have thrown the Finance Ministry, the most powerful arm of the Japanese Government, into turmoil. 
 The officials were arrested in a dramatic display of force when some 100 prosecutors and investigators marched into what has been Japan's most powerful ministry. The officials are suspected of having accepted lavish meals, and then showing favor to the banks that entertained them.
Entertaining government officials and expecting favors in return is an entrenched business practice in Japan. While the episode is being widely described as a bribery scandal, the press has been filled with speculation that Mr. Mitsuzuka's departure is a result of a political deal between Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and opposition parties, which had long sought his ouster.
The arrests were a humiliating blow to the Finance Ministry and promptly led to calls for Mr. Mitsuzuka's resignation, even though he personally is not accused of any wrongdoing. After initially resisting, Mr. Mitsuzuka bowed to pressure.
For the moment, Mr. Hashimoto will also hold the post of Finance Minister until a new minister is chosen.
Mr. Mitsuzuka's resignation comes at a sensitive time. Japan's banking system, the largest in Asia, has been plagued by problems of bad debts both at home and elsewhere in Asia, where the banks lent heavily, including loans in South Korea and Indonesia.
Major economic policy questions are in the balance. The next Finance Minister will find himself at the vortex of a series of pressures. Legislation intended to stabilize the financial system is pending in Parliament, and a weakened Finance Ministry could have problems getting the bills approved. Japan has committed itself to deregulating its financial system, but it has been pressured by the United States to do far more and do it more quickly, and to stimulate domestic demand in the Japanese economy rather than export its way out of its troubles.
Officials say that Mr. Hashimoto may seize the opportunity of a shuffle at the Finance Ministry to announce a new fiscal stimulus package next month. The Prime Minister has been torn between his desire to stimulate the economy, through such measures as a tax cut or spending increase, and his reluctance to increase the budget deficit. As recently as last month, the Government announced its latest program to cut taxes and stimulate the economy, only to be widely criticized for doing too little too late.
If Mr. Hashimoto does announce an ambitious fiscal stimulus program, the move would be widely welcomed not just in America but throughout Asia, where Japan is seen as the one economy large enough to have the potential to pull the rest of the region back to solid financial ground.
Stock prices in Tokyo rose moderately this morning. At midday, the Nikkei index of 225 issues was up 115.98 points, or seven-tenths of 1 percent, to 17,097.60.
To be sure, Mr. Mitsuzuka is hardly the first Finance Minister to resign under a cloud. The step has not always been politically fatal, nor has it led to a fundamental reshaping of the ministry. Among his recent predecessors is Mr. Hashimoto, who stepped down as Finance Minister in 1991 when the ministry was also facing sharp criticism -- then for its failure to prevent widespread scandals in the banking and brokerage industries. Mr. Hashimoto became trade minister and then rose to Prime Minister in 1996.
Mr. Mitsuzuka announced his impending departure at a news conference tonight. "I called upon the Prime Minister at his official residence shortly past 6 P.M. to express my intention to resign," he said. "I feel keenly my responsibility for the scandal. I want to apologize to the public."
The ruling Liberal Democratic Party has already seemed to signal a shift in economic policy, with a top party official saying Tuesday that the party will announce an economic stimulus package, possibly on Feb. 20. That is more than a month before financial institutions close their fiscal year-end books on March 31. Such a stimulus package could give a lift to the stock market at a crucial time for banks, which must meet new rules for capital strength that take effect April 1.
More important, Mr. Mitsuzuka's resignation provides a face-saving opportunity for Mr. Hashimoto to redirect the economy.
"The change of the head man is a good reason to change macro-economic policy," said a Finance Ministry official who insisted on not being identified.
Mr. Mitsuzuka's resignation, however, could throw into question the speed with which the Parliament will pass major legislation to stabilize the financial system, in particular a tax cut of two trillion yen ($24 billion), a bank bailout costing 30 trillion yen and a supplementary budget package.
Opposition party members have recently voiced dissatisfaction with Mr. Mitsuzuka. They have wanted him to take responsibility for mismanagement of the nation's economic and financial troubles.
"Mitsuzuka's head has been on the block quite a while now," said John Neuffer, political analyst at Mitsui Marine Research Institute, an affiliate of Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance Company in Tokyo. "It's another blow to the Hashimoto administration."
Mr. Neuffer and others said the scandal would also hurt the Finance Ministry, which sets economic policy and has a hand in virtually every major decision about the economy.
It is not clear whether prosecutors will widen their investigation of the ministry, or whether Mr. Mitsuzuka's resignation may suggest an end to the inquiries.
"It's possible this could be the tip of the iceberg, of something important," said Craig O. Chudler, a strategist at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd. "To have the Finance Minister of Japan, the second-largest economy, resigning -- I don't think it's just another day in the life of Japan."
The two officials arrested were bank inspectors but not career bureaucrats -- the cadre of elite men who rise to the top of the ministry and effectively control it. So far, this group has remained essentially untouched by the scandal.
But the credibility of the Finance Ministry has been under attack recently since the financial system suffered a string of institutional collapses that shattered investor confidence. And some critics say that the arrests and Mr. Mitsuzuka's resignation are steps toward diminishing the authority of the ministry.
"In the longer run, we see already that the current system cannot last forever," said Kazuhito Ikeo, an economics professor at Keio University. "Even if it doesn't look like it's changing, this is one frame closer toward the deterioration of the Finance Ministry's authority."
The moves by prosecutors are also shaking up the business community. On Tuesday, prosecutors conducted raids at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Sanwa Bank, Asahi Bank and Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, which shut down last fall. All four are suspected of entertaining the two ministry officials.
Wining and dining clients, business partners and officials has long been a practice of bankers, and so it seemed surprising that prosecutors should suddenly be interested in prosecuting officials for such seemingly petty activities.
One of the arrested officials, Koichi Miyagawa, a 53-year-old chief inspector, is accused of neglecting to act after discovering that a bank had filed a false report on bad loans, according to a leading newspaper.
The scandal took a salacious turn Tuesday with the disclosure that Mr. Miyagawa had asked bankers to entertain him at special shabu-shabu restaurants, according to Asahi Shimbun, a leading Japanese daily. Shabu-shabu is a specially cooked beef, but the restaurants' specialty is actually the scantily clad waitresses.

An Upbeat Clinton Urges Action on Social Security
President Clinton, facing his greatest personal and political peril in a crisis-prone career, emerged from the darkness shrouding his Presidency to proclaim the State of the Union sound and to propose a plan to rescue Social Security. The political world suspended its speculation on Mr. Clinton's personal and legal future and focused intently on his political program. The President delivered what amounted to a political manifesto for the midterm election, proposing billions of dollars in new spending on social programs that are popular with the public, paid for by the closing of unspecified tax loopholes and with billions in tobacco taxes that may never be enacted. A1
 
Mr. Clinton pledged to work with Congress to enact legislation next year to deal with the Social Security retirement system's potential insolvency. And he argued that the nation should address Social Security before indulging in new spending and tax cuts to be made possible by an expected era of fiscal plenty. A16

No proof has been offered to support Mrs. Clinton's allegations that a "vast right-wing conspiracy" is behind the accusations of sexual impropriety imperiling her husband's Presidency, but several figures in the case against President Clinton have common ties in conservative groups and causes. Monica S. Lewinsky's alleged account of a sexual relationship with the President was steered to the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, left, by two lawyers, George T. Conway 3d of New York and James A. Moody of Washington, who have been active in conservative causes. Mr. Starr himself has been active in some of the same causes and groups. All three, as well as other critics of Mr. Clinton, say there is nothing ideological in their handling of the
case. A22
 
President Clinton's personal secretary, Betty Currie, testified before a grand jury at the request of Mr. Starr, left, the Whitewater independent counsel.

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION: DOMESTIC PLANS;
Fixing Social Security Should Come Before Any Surplus Free-for-All, President Says

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
Edging into one of the most politically combustible issues facing the nation, President Clinton urged Congress tonight not to spend any budget surpluses the Federal Government might enjoy in coming years until the two parties solve the Social Security system's looming financial problems.
Mr. Clinton proposed no specific remedies for Social Security, and he stopped short of insisting that the entire fiscal windfall go toward shoring up the retirement program. 
 But he sought to convince Republicans of his intention to avoid partisan warfare over an issue that has economic implications across the generations and a tendency to expose vast ideological divides about the responsibilities of the Government and citizens.
Mr. Clinton pledged to work with Congress to enact legislation next year to deal with the retirement system's potential insolvency. And he argued that the responsible course for the nation would be to address Social Security before indulging in a free-for-all of new spending and tax cuts made possible by the coming era of fiscal plenty.
"Let us say to all Americans watching tonight, whether you're 70 or 50 or whether you just started paying into the system, Social Security will be there when you need it," Mr. Clinton said. "Let us make this commitment: Social Security first. Let's do that, together."
As a symbol of his willingness to tackle the issue and share any political pain, Mr. Clinton said he would lead public meetings around the country this year to discuss why Social Security has to be changed and to stimulate a debate over which of a host of options would be best.
Republicans said they welcomed the President's fiscally conservative approach and his willingness to speak out on Social Security. But they saw a political motive in Mr. Clinton's call to postpone using any surplus for tax cuts.
And with memories still fresh of how Democrats have made political weapons out of previous Republican-led efforts to address financial problems in entitlement programs, they remained wary that the President and Congressional Democrats would turn the Social Security issue against them in this year's elections.
Mr. Clinton's proposals on Social Security were among an array of domestic policy initiatives he outlined, including raising the minimum wage, expanding Medicare health care coverage to people ages 55 to 64 and improving access to child care. He called for a new push to reach a settlement with tobacco companies over liability for the health damage caused by smoking, and he signaled a plan that the Administration will unveil on Wednesday to overhaul the Internal Revenue Service.
Social Security will pay out about $100 billion less in benefits this year than it takes in from payroll taxes and interest income on the Government bonds it holds, and on the Government's books the system has about $650 billion set aside to pay future benefits.
But when the 76 million-member baby boom generation begins retiring in large numbers in 2010, Social Security's financial strength will erode rapidly. By 2019 the system will begin eating into its reserves to pay benefits. By 2029 it will exhaust all its reserves, and the revenues it will take in from payroll taxes are projected to meet only 75 percent of its promised benefit payments, leaving the system technically insolvent.
White House officials have been debating for months how they could use the rapidly improving fiscal situation to begin dealing with Social Security. Gene Sperling, the White House economic policy adviser, said the Administration now expected budget surpluses totaling $200 billion over the next five years.
Allocating the entire surplus to shoring up Social Security could add 8 to 15 years to the system's solvency, studies by the White House have shown. But Administration officials have concluded that solving Social Security's problems would ultimately have to involve a national debate over a variety of possible fixes.
The fixes include increasing payroll taxes, raising the retirement age and cutting benefits. But the debate will also encompass proposals to rethink Social Security's structure and the nature of the Government's commitment to providing retirement security.
One camp, which includes many Democrats and organizations representing the elderly, wants to preserve the current system. Another, made up largely but not exclusively of conservatives, wants to give more freedom and responsibility to individuals for their retirement savings.
Mr. Clinton's advisers have made clear that he will not accept the most radical proposals for changing the system into something like a giant 401(k) program. But they said he had not ruled out a compromise that would allow individuals to put part of their payroll taxes into a personal account.
 
Family Leave
Mr. Clinton asked Congress to expand the reach of a 1993 law to guarantee family and medical leave for 10 million additional workers.
Under the law, an eligible worker may take a maximum of 12 weeks of unpaid leave each year to recover from an illness or to care for a newborn child or a seriously ill relative. The law applies to companies with 50 or more employees, covering 58 percent of the private labor force, or 55 million workers. Administration officials said Mr. Clinton wanted to extend the requirements to companies with 25 to 49 employees.
Donna R. Lenhoff, general counsel of the Women's Legal Defense Fund, welcomed the proposal and said it would not hurt small businesses. But Lonnie P. Taylor, senior vice president of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, said: "This proposal is ridiculous. It would impose a new burden, a new mandate, on small employers. The President is responding to the unions. He's throwing them a bone."
 
Health
Saying that America was on the brink of breakthroughs in biomedical research, President Clinton tonight proposed major increases in spending for the National Institutes of Health.
Congress provided $13.6 billion for the agency this year. Mr. Clinton asked for an increase of $1.15 billion, or 8.5 percent, next year. Moreover, Mr. Clinton said he wanted an increase of about 50 percent over the next five years, raising the agency's budget to more than $20 billion in 2003. In Congress, there is bipartisan support for such an increase. Representative John Edward Porter, the Illinois Republican who is chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee responsible for biomedical research, said he wanted to double spending for the health institute in the next five years, and many lawmakers shared that goal.
Congress has appropriated more than the President requested for the health institute in each of the last few years. Mr. Clinton's request thus becomes a floor on which Congress will build.
"It's very heartening that the President has indicated his support for increased investment in science," said Dr. Jordan J. Cohen, president of the Association of American Medical Colleges. "An even greater investment in biomedical research could be justified."
Within a decade, Dr. Cohen said, the fruits of such research will be available in new drug therapies to treat arthritis, childhood diabetes and multiple sclerosis. Moreover, he said, "we will be able to counteract many of the genetic changes that lead to colon cancer and other major cancers before they accumulate and cause malignancy."
Even as researchers discover new cures, many patients have difficulty getting access to basic medical care. Mr. Clinton said that this year Congress should pass legislation to protect the rights of patients, especially those in health maintenance organizations.
Noting that 160 million Americans were enrolled in H.M.O.'s and other managed care plans, Mr. Clinton said: "These plans save money, and they can improve care. But medical decisions ought to be made by medical doctors, not insurance company accountants."
He urged Congress to enact a bill of rights for patients, stipulating: "You have the right to know all your medical options, not just the cheapest. You have the right to choose the doctor you want for the care you need. You have the right to emergency room care, wherever and whenever you need it. You have the right to keep your medical records confidential."
H.M.O.'s, insurance companies and employers of all sizes have banded together to block such legislation, and they plan a $1 million advertising campaign to publicize their concerns. They contend that the guarantees proposed by Mr. Clinton would increase the cost of health care and health insurance, so that many employers would cut back coverage.
Mr. Clinton challenged Congress to pass comprehensive bipartisan legislation to reduce teen-age smoking. Such legislation, he said, should raise the cost of a pack of cigarettes by $1.50 over the next decade, "with penalties on the tobacco industry if it keeps marketing to our children."
 
Medicare
Mr. Clinton called on Congress to open Medicare, which finances health care for people who are elderly or disabled, to people 55 to 64 years old.
"It won't add a dime to the deficit," Mr. Clinton said of his Medicare proposal, "but the peace of mind it will provide will be priceless."
Under the President's proposal, people 62 to 64 could buy Medicare coverage for premiums of $300 a month. They would have to pay a surcharge of $10 to $20 a month on top of the regular premiums they must pay on reaching 65 to help offset the costs of earlier coverage.
People 55 and older who lose their health benefits because they are laid off from their jobs would also be allowed to buy into Medicare. They would have to pay premiums of $400 a month, considered sufficient to cover their costs, until they reach the current age of eligibility for Medicare, which is 65.
Finally, the President would offer a new insurance option to retirees 55 and older who have lost health benefits promised by former employers. Such retirees could participate in the health plan of the company where they worked, but might be required to pay the full premium paid by the company and active workers, plus 20 percent to 25 percent.
 
Child Care
Mr. Clinton asked Congress to support a package of child care proposals that he unveiled on Jan. 7.
Under the proposals, which would cost $21.7 billion over five years, the Government would increase Federal subsidies for day care, so that two million children would eventually receive Federal aid. That is more than double the number who now benefit from such subsidies.
Mr. Clinton also urged Congress to increase the income tax credit that parents can take for child care expenses. The White House said this proposal would eliminate income tax liability for most families with substantial child care expenses and with incomes less than twice the official poverty level (less than $33,000 a year for a family of four).
The President also asked Congress to provide $800 million over the next five years to finance after-school care for up to 500,000 children a year.

HEADLINE: Iraqis Must End Defiance On Arms, Clinton Warns

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
President Clinton sought to intensify pressure on Iraq today, dispatching senior officials to consult with American allies in Europe and the Middle East and warning President Saddam Hussein, in the State of the Union address, that his defiance of the United Nations cannot continue.
In his speech tonight to a joint session of Congress, Mr. Clinton cautioned the Iraqi President: "You cannot defy the will of the world." Mr. Hussein has used weapons of mass destruction before, Mr. Clinton noted, and said, "We are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again." 
 Mr. Clinton said he spoke "for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats," acknowledging a unity on Iraq today that was missing in Congress before the Persian Gulf war, even after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990.
"Together," Mr. Clinton said, the United States "must confront new hazards: chemical and biological weapons" that could be obtained "by outlaw states, terrorists and organized criminals."
He added: "Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade, and much of his nation's wealth, not on providing for the Iraqi people but on developing nuclear, chemical and biological weapons -- and the missiles to deliver them."
While the United Nations arms inspectors "have done a truly remarkable job, finding and destroying more of Iraq's arsenal than was destroyed during the entire gulf war," Mr. Clinton said, Mr. Hussein "wants to stop them from completing their mission."
In his speech, Mr. Clinton made no direct reference to joint American and British plans for military strikes against Iraq unless President Hussein capitulates.
But all day long, the drumbeat of military noises -- and the urgent dispatch of American Cabinet members to consult with allies -- gave a sense of moment to Mr. Clinton's words.
Mr. Clinton is considering sending Defense Secretary William S. Cohen to the Persian Gulf early next week to seek backing for a military strike against Iraq if Mr. Hussein continues to block the inspections, and American officials have begun to talk more openly of attacking Iraq.
"There is an increasing feeling that the diplomatic options have exhausted themselves," the Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, said today, "and that leaves us little choice to achieve our goals than to look at military action."
Mr. Clinton is also sending Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright on Thursday to Europe, where she will confer with the British, French and Russian Foreign Ministers about Iraq. "She will go to explain the stakes involved and her feeling that diplomatic options are becoming exhausted," a senior Administration official said.
Nonetheless, the British are taking the lead in discussing a new resolution to be introduced in the United Nations Security Council that will try to give President Hussein another chance to back down in the face of the military threat, while a Russian diplomat is in Baghdad trying to find a way to avoid a military strike of any kind against Iraq.
The Russians have insisted publicly that the crisis in Iraq be resolved without the use of force, and there will be time for the Russians to try, at least until the Muslim holy month of Ramadan ends on Jan. 30, consultations with allies are finished and the Security Council pursues another round of diplomacy.
To that end, Mr. Clinton is also sending Bill Richardson, the chief American delegate to the United Nations, on a visit to new members of the Security Council to explain what is happening in Iraq, officials said.
But Washington insists that its threat to use military force is credible and that Iraq will be hit hard if it does not allow United Nations weapons inspectors "full and complete access" to all suspected sites, even those labeled presidential palaces, senior American officials say.
If full Iraqi compliance is offered, some Western diplomats said, the United States and Britain are considering a French suggestion to give Iraq at least a symbolic acknowledgment that progress on eliminating some weapons, in particular its nuclear weapons research program, is being made. But British and American diplomats insisted that economic sanctions would not be lifted until all United Nations demands were met.
Ms. Albright will travel from Europe to the Middle East to confer with the Persian Gulf allies most directly threatened by Iraq, who are urging that Washington hit Baghdad hard or not hit it at all, senior Western diplomats and American officials say.
Support from Saudi Arabia will be particularly important, the officials acknowledge. They hope that the Saudi royal family will authorize the use of the country's air bases for any air campaign against Baghdad. Western military officials insist that generalized Saudi political support is essential but the bases are not, given three American and British aircraft carriers in the gulf and land-based bombers in Diego Garcia and Bahrain.
American officials insist that new Security Council authorization is not required and that Washington will act alone against Iraq if necessary.
American and British officials are planning for a military option that would include a three- or four-day intensive bombing campaign aimed at suspected weapon sites, control and intelligence centers and the elite Republican Guard. Those strikes might be followed by a pause to allow Mr. Hussein to back down.
Ms. Albright is also expected to visit Israel and the Palestinian Authority to follow up Mr. Clinton's talks last week with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, with the hope that a concrete sign of progress on the negotiations will make talk of war against Iraq more acceptable to moderate Arab nations.
"They've now had a week to consider their options," a senior State Department official said. "We're expecting a more considered response."
Speaking for the Republicans in response to Mr. Clinton, the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, underscored Congressional support for action against Iraq.
"Let me make one thing clear to Saddam Hussein -- or anyone else who needs to be told: Despite any current controversy, this Congress will vigorously support the President in full defense of America's interests throughout the world," Mr. Lott said.
Mr. Lott also used the Iraqi threat to urge Mr. Clinton to work with the Republicans to create a national defense against missiles, which the White House regards as too complicated and expensive.
In his State of the Union address, Mr. Clinton had only one relatively new international initiative: pressing for a new inspection system to detect and deter countries from cheating on the 23-year-old Biological Weapons Convention. "The rules are good, but the enforcement is weak," he said.
Officials said Washington wanted "more rigorous and frequent inspections," both voluntary and mandatory, to prevent Russia, China and countries formerly part of the Soviet bloc from continuing banned biological weapons programs. Mr. Clinton wants signatories to submit annual declarations about installations and activities that could be used for a biological weapons program.
Mr. Clinton also made an appeal for Congressional support on key foreign policy questions, including approval of the applications of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to join NATO.
"Within days," Mr. Clinton said, he will formally ask the Senate for its advice and consent on admitting the three countries to the alliance. The Senate is expected to vote this spring; approval requires a two-thirds vote.
"By taking in new members and working closely with new partners, including Russia and Ukraine, NATO can help to assure that Europe is a stronghold for peace in the 21st century," Mr. Clinton said.
He also appealed for bipartisan support for American troops and their mission in Bosnia, which has now been extended past June. "The progress there is unmistakable -- but t is not yet irreversible," Mr. Clinton said.
After extending the presence of American troops in Bosnia twice now, Mr. Clinton has refused to set a new deadline, saying their mission will be completed when achievable goals are met.
And he asked the Senate to approve the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which the United States signed in September 1996. While nearly 150 countries have signed the treaty against nuclear weapons tests, only 8 have ratified it, and the earliest it could come into force would be this September.
With the Iraq crisis continuing, Mr. Clinton also made an appeal for Congress to "make good on our debt to the United Nations." Increasingly, he said, "we are working with other nations to achieve common goals. If we want America to lead, we got to set a good example."
The world is also interconnected in its economic life, he said, "whether we like it or not," as the current crisis in Asia has shown. For that reason, he said, he is asking Congress to renew the American commitment to the International Monetary Fund.

HEADLINE: Top Woman in Iran's Government Once Spoke for Hostage-Takers

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, Jan. 26

 BODY:
Massoumeh Ebtekar is the highest-ranking woman in Iran's Government, a symbol of President Mohammed Khatami's promise to promote women into high-profile positions.
A 37-year-old mother of two with a doctorate in immunology, Ms. Ebtekar was appointed last August as vice president for the environment, a job that gives a woman Cabinet rank for the first time in Iran's Islamic Republic. 
 But Ms. Ebtekar is a woman with a history, a history she would rather not dwell on these days.
More than 18 years ago, as an 18-year-old freshman at the Polytechnic University in Teheran, Ms. Ebtekar was the official interpreter and spokeswoman of the militants who occupied the American Embassy in Teheran. Speaking the near-perfect English she learned in the United States as a child, hiding her hair under a black hood, and using the nom de guerre "Mary," she became an object of anger and curiosity with her appearances on American television.
Night after night she listed the "crimes" of America against Iran and denounced the hostages as "spies" who should be put on trial if the United States did not turn over the deposed Shah, Mohammed Riza Pahlevi, to Iran's revolutionary leadership.
Asked by an ABC News correspondent whether she could see herself picking up a gun and killing the hostages, she replied: "Yes. When I've seen an American gun being lifted up and killing my brothers and sisters in the streets, of course."
These days her role in the embassy seizure is largely forgotten, or at least ignored. It is nowhere on her official resume; it was not included in the extensive profile and interview of her that appeared in Zanan, a prominent women's magazine, after her appointment.
Ms. Ebtekar meets foreign journalists and dignitaries to explain how Iran is struggling to improve Teheran's dismal air quality and to prevent further pollution of the Caspian Sea from oil development. Later this week she will accompany Iran's Foreign Minister and the Governor of the Central Bank to the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
But when confronted by an American journalist who said she recognized her from her role in the embassy occupation, Ms. Ebtekar acknowledged that she was the face and voice of the keepers of the hostages.
Her words came slowly, when asked directly whether she was "Mary."
"I was," she said. "But I don't bring those things up."
Asked about the wisdom or folly of that chapter in Iranian history, she had no apology and made no excuses.
"I wouldn't think that it would be logical for any nation to look back and to see any part of their revolution or their movement as negative because at that time, when it is considered in its own context, that was the best direction that could have been taken," she said in English in an interview in her office. "I feel that in that context, that reality, it was a basic necessity in society, in that period of the revolution to preserve the values."
Dressed in a long pin-striped coat, a dark-blue headdress and high-heeled boots, Ms. Ebtekar seemed nonplussed that she had been recognized.
She said it was a band of students, not the authorities, who planned and carried out the embassy takeover. She recalled that she, like the other hostage-takers, lived in the embassy compound at different stages to guard their captives.
Asked how she was assigned such an important role as official spokeswoman at such a young age, she smiled. "Everybody just naturally found their roles," she said.
After the hostages were freed on the day of Ronald Reagan's Inauguration as President in January 1981, some hostage-takers were rewarded with influential jobs -- as ambassadors and deputy ministers, for example. Others were elected to Parliament.
In 1981 Ms. Ebtekar was made editor in chief of the English-language newspaper Kayhan International. The man who gave her the job was Mr. Khatami, who was then head of the Kayhan publishing house.
As President, Mr. Khatami has stressed the importance of creating a civil society in which the rule of law prevails.
In his interview with CNN earlier this month, Mr. Khatami even expressed regret that the feelings of the American people had been "hurt" by the hostage crisis, the closest any senior Iranian official has come to apologizing.
But his appointment of Ms. Ebtekar to such a lofty post raises questions about whether he considers her past role relevant or if he simply does not understand how deeply it affected both the American Government and the American people.
"I continue to regard the seizure of the embassy as among the most egregious violations of the traditions and norms of diplomacy and a gross violation of human rights," Bruce Laingen, the charge d'affaires and most senior diplomat at the American Embassy when it was seized, said in a telephone interview. "I'm offended and regret that one of those involved in that violation is now honored in this way."
Iranian officials declined to speculate about the reasons for Ms. Ebtekar's appointment, except to say that she is eminently qualified for the job.
During the interview, Ms. Ebtekar explained how she came to speak English so well. She lived in Teheran until she was 3, then moved with her parents to a middle-class suburb of Philadelphia. She lived there for six years, attending Highland Park elementary school while her father was a doctoral student in engineering at the University of Pennsylvania.
After returning to Iran, she continued studying English at the international school in Teheran. As a freshman majoring in engineering at the Polytechnic University, she took part in demonstrations that helped topple the Shah.
Later she became a university professor and activist in women's affairs. Her father, she said, was the revolution's first Minister of the Environment, and she is proud to sit in the same office he once did.
She also talked about the burden of the early days of the revolution, when she was so young.
"The men and women who came up with the revolution have undergone such difficult stages, difficult stages -- both social and political turmoil," she said. "Just undertaking and shouldering the responsiblity of implementing and bringing forth a new set of values."
At the end of the interview, Ms. Ebtekar told her American guest to turn off the tape recorder. Then she asked that not very much be written about her role as Mary.

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION: NEWS ANALYSIS;
The Subtext Vs. the Text

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
Like Richard M. Nixon in the same ceremonial setting almost 24 years ago, Bill Clinton struggled tonight to convince Congress and the country that he has not already become a past-tense President.
It seemed almost as if two films were running at once on this intensely charged evening in the Capitol, with one depicting a ritual of state, complete with traditional gestures of politesse, and the other telling a depressing, altogether more sordid story. Which was true? Which mattered the most? 
 "It's not so much a question of whether Clinton can survive," one of the President's aides said glumly this afternoon, "but whether he can lead effectively for two or three more years when he'll be the butt of Jay Leno's jokes every night."
In a State of the Union Message originally designed to re-energize his Presidency, with a potentially highly popular proposal to use any budget surpluses to shore up the Social Security system, Mr. Clinton tonight sought to muffle the drumbeat of accusations about his involvement with a White House intern, Monica S. Lewinsky.
Unlike Mr. Nixon, who vowed in his final State of the Union address in 1974 to survive Watergate, Mr. Clinton never mentioned the crisis that gripped his Presidency.
Instead, he began with a glowing report on American life today, in accord with the Constitutional mandate requiring Presidents to "from time to time give the Congress information of the state of the Union." Then, as if unfazed by the frenzied melodrama of recent days, he slowly unrolled the traditional national shopping list -- education, trade, welfare, health, defense, campaign reform, urban development, the environment.
"Save Social Security first," he said in a key passage of a speech as formulaic in structure as last year's or next year's. "I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus -- that's every penny of any surplus -- until we have taken all the measures necessary to strengthen the Social Security system."
Not that he and his aides and the members of Congress arrayed beneath him were not thinking about Ms. Lewinsky. A few Senators and Representatives, but only a few, confessed beforehand that they would be pondering their Constitutional roles as accusers and jurors (should it come to impeachment). Many more, along with White House staff members, were wondering about Mr. Clinton's capacity to continue to govern.
A senior Democratic Senator, speaking on condition of anonymity, put it this way: "I don't think he's through as President, but unless he's lucky, I think he may be through as a commanding political figure."
The President's strategy was clear enough: to persuade the nation that in these "good times for America," as he called them, the vigor of the economy, low inflation, reduced crime and new proposals for Social Security and child care and other measures to help those whom the boom has bypassed were far more important than his own sexual peccadilloes, real or imagined.
By dwelling only on substance, he sought to persuade voters to compartmentalize their minds the way he and his wife say they do, setting aside charges and lawsuits and scandals and concentrating on the serious business of government. No connection between the two, he implied. One public, the other private.
But how much attention did ordinary people pay to what he was saying? Were they wondering how he could pull any of this off, given the Lewinsky situation? Were they searching his eyes for clues as to whether they should believe his earlier denials of a sexual relationship with her, and watching for body language that might bespeak his state of mind, even if his words did not?
Or were they carefully digesting his list of policy prescriptions?
Underlying the whole spectacle -- indeed, the whole Lewinsky episode -- was the proposition that Thomas Jefferson expressed so elegantly in his inaugural address: "Sometimes it is said that man cannot be trusted with the government of himself. Can he then be trusted with the government of others?"
In trying to put across his program tonight, and then put it into effect, Mr. Clinton faced a multi-layered problem that would have daunted most men but seemingly not him.
First, all State of the Union speeches are wish lists, unlike speeches that open European parliaments, which are specific pledges to pass specific laws. No American President can make such promises, because while he proposes, Congress disposes.
Second, in this Congress both Houses are controlled by the Republicans, who have no real incentive to go along with the President.
Third, Mr. Clinton has only limited influence with the members of his own party on Capitol Hill.
And fourth, a series of scandals -- Whitewater, Travelgate, Filegate, fund-raising violations -- plus the Gennifer Flowers and Paula Jones cases, have eroded the President's credibility, to some degree with the public and to a greater degree among officeholders. Political professionals here and in Arkansas have for years heard tales of a licentious personal life, so they are extremely skeptical about his denials in the latest "bimbo eruption," to use the expression coined by his onetime aide, Betsey Wright.
Even before the Lewinsky case became public, the electorate took a somewhat jaundiced view of the President, which must haunt him as he seeks to cement a prominent place in history. In a Time magazine poll in early June, voters were asked what they thought Mr. Clinton would be remembered for 25 years from now. More than twice as many said "controversy over his personal life and financial dealings" as said "his accomplishments as President."
One of Mr. Clinton's goals has been to restore people's faith in government. That theme was sounded toward the end of his speech tonight. "Our government, the instrument of our national community, must earn the confidence of the American people," he said.
Missing from his text, perhaps not wholly surprisingly, was any acknowledgment that disillusionment with leadership played a role in disillusionment with government.

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION: CONGRESS;
Republicans Seek to Seize High Ground as Democrats Begin to Rally Around President

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
Facing a weakened adversary, Republicans today sidestepped the titillating questions surrounding President Clinton and sought to present themselves as the stable, substantive political alternative.
Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, captured the tone in the party's official televised response to the President's State of the Union address, devoting his speech to Republican proposals for tax cuts and tax simplification, better schools, and smaller government. 
 His hands folded, staring intently into the camera, he framed the difference between the two political parties with two simple questions: "Big government or families? More taxes or more freedom?" And just as Mr. Clinton has in recent years he spoke repeatedly of children and families.
He may have been taking a veiled swipe at Mr. Clinton when he said the Republican Congress had only just begun "the difficult job of stopping big government, making it more responsive and -- perhaps hardest of all -- rebuilding the trust you used to have in your elected officials."
The Mississippi Republican's only oblique allusion to Mr. Clinton's problems was a warning to Iraq. "Let me make one thing clear to Saddam Hussein, or anyone else who needs to be told," Mr. Lott said. "Despite any current controversy this Congress will vigorously support the President in full defense of America's interests throughout the world."
Democrats, aware of the high stakes for their party and reassured by polls that show Mr. Clinton retaining public backing, began rallying around Mr. Clinton in force, echoing Hillary Rodham Clinton's combative defense of her husband.
They cheered him and grabbed for his hand as he came down the aisle of the House chamber and rose to their feet for him time and again.
Just hours earlier, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader who has so often been at odds with Mr. Clinton, gave a rousing speech of support for him before a closed-door caucus of House Democrats.
Democrat after Democrat emerged from the session slamming the press, the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, and blaming for President's troubles the same right-wing conspiracy machine that Mrs. Clinton had attacked earlier in the day.
"There are strings that lead, wires that lead, to the right wing camps from the very beginning," said Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the House minority whip. Representative James P. McGovern, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said, "Starr is dropping new allegations and innuendos every day. This is not "Melrose Place." This is the United States Government. We need to get on with the people's business."
But intent on holding the moral high ground, Republicans resolutely promoted their own view of policy issues. "If we're truly going to help American families," said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the chairman of the Republican conference, "and we're going to renew the moral spirit in our country, we've got to find a way to get this tax load down on American families."
Under the banner of "family, faith and freedom," Mr. Lott spoke of the past successes of the Republican Congress, then outlined a program that played to historic Republican advantages on tax cutting and tax simplification, and on fighting crime and drugs.
"Republicans want you, the people who work hard for the money, to keep more of what you earn," he said. "The President seems to think that big Government can solve all of your children's problems if you if you will just give Government more of your money and more control over your lives. Nonsense." He called for oversight hearings to find out why Americans "aren't getting their money's worth from Government."
He also highlighted proposals on education -- including teacher merit pay and school tuition vouchers -- to try to erode the Democratic edge on that issue. "When one quarter, one out of four, of our high school students can barely read, isn't it obvious the current system isn't working?" Mr. Lott asked.
On a social issue of importance to party conservatives, Mr. Lott challenged Senate Democrats to help override Mr. Clinton's veto of legislation that would have banned a particular abortion procedure in which a fetus is partly delivered and then its skull is collapsed. Mr. Lott called this "the dreadful practice of partial-birth abortion."
With the nation looking toward the first budget surpluses in three decades, Republicans began aggressively standing against new spending programs. But they did not immediately embrace Mr. Clinton's call for 100 percent of the surplus to be dedicated to shoring up the Social Security system for the retirment of the baby boom generation.
"We should commit here and now not to spend any budget surplus on unnecessary Government programs," Mr. Lott said. "If there is a surplus we should use it to pay down the national debt and return the rest to you the taxpayer. After all it's your money.".
Representative Robert Livingston, the Louisiana Republican who chairs the Appropriations Committee, said, "If you took his speech at face value, you'd have a very difficult time to find any surplus because he spent it all on everything else."
Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority whip, called many of Mr. Clinton's proposals a "nonstarter for a Republican Congress." He said Republican leaders were looking to go beyond Mr. Clinton's promise to present a balanced budget for the 1999 fiscal year and to seek balance in the current fiscal year, which ends in September. That would require a $5 billion reduction in spending.
In a sign of how determined the Republicans are to play hardball while the White House is reeling, even before Mr. Clinton spoke, Mr. DeLay declared one Clinton initiative after another dead or in peril.
He said the President had actually lost some of his Republican support for expanded trade authority. He proclaimed that there was "no way in the world right now" Congress would approve more financing for the International Monetary Fund "particularly when the "President of the United States is not out there taking the lead, trying to convince the American people it's in the interests of the United States to bail out corporations and banks for bad economic decisions."
Mr. DeLay also cast doubt on the fate of the tobacco settlement, saying Republicans had doubts about the precedent that would be set if tobacco companies have immunity from prosecution.
Buoyed Democrats, rallied not just around Mr.Clinton but around a program they saw as a winning election-year platform. "The speech reminded us why the President stays popular through everything that's hit him," said Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, a New Jersey Democrat.
Only occasionally during the day did lawmakers veer from their respective party scripts. Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan, ignoring party instructions not to delve into the details of the allegations against the President, could not resist going after the credibility of Monica S. Lewinsky, the former White House intern who has reportedly said that she had an affair with Mr. Clinton. "I haven't heard that she played with a full deck in her other experiences," Mr. Rangel said.

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION: REACTION;
Tics and Gestures Steal the Show

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD 

 BODY:
Watching with a contagious interest in nuance and deportment as much as in words, in what was not said as much as what was, Americans reacted to President Clinton's State of the Union Message with varying enthusiasm for his agenda and equally divided opinions on the state of his composure.
Drawn to television by a week of frenzied pursuit of Presidential amatory entanglements, people seemed to find it difficult to sort out their thoughts on what they saw and heard, as they weighed the personal with the political. Never were they more attentive to physical attributes, or lack thereof. 
 "Look at those bags under his eyes," said Lilian Redondo, 64, a retired phone company worker who was watching at a bar in Los Angeles. "You know he hasn't slept."
When he had finished his speech, Ms. Redondo remarked: "It didn't matter what he said. But he gave it his best shot."
Kate Lockwood, a sophomore at Middlebury College in Middlebury, Vt., said the scandal enveloping the President made her skeptical of his every smile and gesture.
"The facts that he gave in the whole speech, they are hard to deny," Ms. Lockwood said. "I just had a hard time believing. The whole time, I kept thinking, How do I know what you're saying? Maybe you're lying to me."
A small, sometimes boisterous crowd assembled around a television at Louie's, a bar and restaurant in Dallas. John E. Collins, 58, a lawyer, furnished a running commentary in which he underscored the President's repeated use of the phrase, "a more perfect union." Yet Mr. Collins gave the President an A-plus for his performance.
Richard Scherba, a Republican lawyer at Louie's, added, "If this was his swan song, he did it with great grace."
But Mr. Scherba judged the substance of the address unfavorably. "We've now entered the realm of the virtual reality surplus," he said. "They say it's real. It looks real. But it doesn't exist off the screen."
Nonetheless, Mr. Scherba's belief was that people were less curious than customary about Mr. Clinton's words. "They were observing the state of the President," he said.
Indeed, for most viewers, the Presidential address had the feel of a fictive adventure, a declaration of political intent caught in a salacious subtext. There was often an anticipatory undercurrent as the words were spoken: Might he say something about it? Would there be news of the bedroom as well as the budget?
It was a speech in which viewers dissected facial tics, worry lines, eye movement, the demeanor of the First Lady -- keys, they hoped, that would unlock inner secrets.
"He seems a little strained," said Katie Towler, 41, a freelance writer who watched the address with her husband, James A. Sparrell, 41, a psychologist, at the home of friends in Portsmouth, N.H. "He doesn't have his usual, his usual verve."
"Yeah," her husband said. "I don't think he looks or sounds the same. I have never seen him look like that. He looks exhausted."
"He looks terrible," his wife said.
Others saw the same picture and judged the President's demeanor altogether differently.
"He seemed quite composed in spite of all the misery he's in," said Lyle Mercer, a Seattle retiree. "He put on quite a good show."
Mr. Sparrell, in Portsmouth, said the focus on scandal took attention from other issues.
"It's sad that the substantive stuff, unemployment, the deficit, are down and no one is paying attention," he said.
Robert Gainor, 34, a lawyer at the Portsmouth gathering, also wanted to look beyond the events of the last week. "I give him credit," Mr. Gainor said. "I think he's done stuff."
As the President turned in his speech to his proposal to hire more teachers and reduce class size, Mr. Gainor signaled his approval: "Yeah, well, that's good. He's going to points that people understand."
Jack McEnany, 41, a writing teacher, could not refrain from alluding to the accusations that Mr. Clinton had had an affair with a White House intern in her 20's: "He's been doing some mentoring himself, hasn't he?"
Many people came away from the address imbued with hope.
"He transcended the crisis," said William O. Goodman, a plaintiff's lawyer in Austin, Tex. "He didn't abandon any of his principles. It's like his problems didn't even exist. It's a class act. Remarkable."
Others gave the address itself high marks. "The speech was fantastic," said Ramon Casteneda, 54, a bartender in Los Angeles. "He addressed the points that are especially important to children so that they can go to college. I'm a working man. I can't afford things like college for my two kids because it is so expensive."
Six people who watched the address together in Miami were disappointed that Mr. Clinton did not include more serious proposals on the environment, and one wanted to hear about food stamps being restored to the elderly and disabled. But on the whole, they approved of the speech.
"He satisfied everything that I wanted him to do," said Kathleen Egan, 42, a hospital administrator. "He got on with the business at hand, the business of running the country."
Diane Greenwald, a Manhattan psychiatrist, said she liked what the President said about rescuing Social Security and about health plans, but otherwise thought the topics were too global. "He gave everybody everything they needed," she said.
Ms. Greenwald's daughter, Laurabeth, who is in eighth grade, said she thought the President "made everything too perfect."
"It got kind of annoying," she said.
She grimaced when the President mentioned mandatory summer school, and she asked, "Isn't he going to extremes?"
Any number of viewers confessed, not without some pangs of chagrin, that the scandal had intensified their interest in the speech.
"Ordinarily, I may not have been very interested in the State of the Union, though we watch it every year, but I will have my antenna up and listen more thoroughly tonight," Sue Dickerson, 75, a retired social worker, acknowledged before tuning in at her Memphis home. "I guess it's kind of sadistic, but here's a man up there squirming for his life and it will be interesting to watch. Isn't that terrible?"
Some people said that they were disappointed that the President did not address the accusations against him, while others were relieved at the omission.
"He has to mention it, he should mention it," said Bill Prett, 46, an inventor of refrigeration equipment who watched the address at the Texas Chili Parlor in Austin. "People expect it and they'll wonder what's up if he doesn't."
Doatsy Shrake, 54, a real estate agent who also watched while indulging in chili, agreed, saying, . "He needs to acknowledge it somehow, even if it's only to refer to domestic affairs."
But Jesse Petty, 26, the manager of the chili parlor, had a different view. "As long as he's not sleeping with me, I'm not interested," she said. "It's none of my business."
Loren Callahan, 26, a photographer in Seattle, said there was a time and place for answering the accusations, and last night was not it.
"No, not in the State of the Union," Ms. Callahan said. "That's the state of Bill."
Eight students who watched the speech with one of their professors in a dorm room at DePaul University in Chicago, punctuating their viewing with snickers and sly jokes, agreed that the President appeared strong and did what he needed to do.
There was applause when Mr. Clinton issued his stern warning to the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Applause resounded again when he called for the United States to pay its tardy dues to the United Nations.
Though the students had their disagreements on various policy points in the speech, they echoed the sentiments of Angela Lam, 21, a senior and political science major, who said: "I think we saw vintage Clinton. No matter what's going on behind the scenes, he's going to show strength. He wasn't going to let on that there was any crisis in his Administration."
Thomas Stein, 21, also a senior and political science major, said he thought the President managed to put people at ease.
"He appears to be strong at a time of weakness and presents to the nation that his Administration is moving forward," Mr. Stein said. "I think the nation forgot about his problems for this hour."
Sharon Bicks, 36, a caterer in Memphis, watched the address while making 11 dozen ham biscuits. "The speech enhanced my opinion of Clinton," she said. "I had been distracted by these allegations, but now I'm refocused on what this President has meant for this country and the world, and it is all absolutely positive."
Of course, not everyone could weigh the words and the issues without strong sour emotions.
"I had a hard time focusing on what he was saying," said Karen Shea, 52, a Memphis investment broker and a registered Republican who said she voted for Mr. Clinton in 1992 and 1996. "All I could think was, You're a liar and a hypocrite."
"A lot of good things have happened during his Presidency," Ms. Shea said. "I voted for him because he does care about the issues I care about. And I like a lot of what he said tonight. But I still think he needs to go. I couldn't help but laugh when he talked about responsibility."

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION: THE OVERVIEW;
CLINTON, WITH CRISIS SWIRLING, PUTS FOCUS ON SOCIAL SECURITY IN UPBEAT STATE OF UNION TALK

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
President Clinton, facing the gravest personal and political peril in a crisis-prone career, emerged from the darkness shrouding his Presidency for more than an hour tonight to proclaim the state of the Union sound and to propose a plan to rescue Social Security.
Swathed in bright television lights and enveloped in the grandeur of the House chamber, the President was met by a thunderous ovation from both sides of the aisle as he arrived at 9:09 P.M. to deliver his annual State of the Union address. On a rainy night in a scandal-fevered capital, the political world suspended its speculation on Mr. Clinton's personal and legal future and focused, if distractedly, on his political program. 
 Mr. Clinton decided several days ago to make no reference in his speech to the accusations against him and he did not. He hewed more closely than usual to his prepared text, which was released late in the afternoon -- hours earlier than for any previous State of the Union speech. Transcript, page A19.
The President delivered what amounted to a political manifesto for the midterm election, proposing billions of dollars in new spending on social programs that have proved popular with the public, paid for through closing unspecified tax loopholes and billions of dollars in tobacco taxes that may never be enacted.
As the soaring economy generates surplus revenue beyond what is needed to balance the budget and pay for the President's spending priorities, Mr. Clinton hopes to use the excess money to begin to address the largest fiscal problem confronting the nation -- the future of Social Security.
In the centerpiece of his speech, Mr. Clinton said that the surpluses bequeathed by six years of robust economic growth should be set aside until a solution is found to the looming insolvency of Social Security, the politically sacred core of the Government's contract with the American people. His message to both Democrats and Republicans salivating to spend the bounty on new programs or tax cuts was the same: Wait.
"What should we do with this projected surplus?" Mr. Clinton asked rhetorically. "I have a simple four-word answer: Save Social Security first." The chamber erupted in applause.
"Tonight I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus -- that's every penny of any surplus -- until we have taken all the necessary measures to strengthen the Social Security system for the 21st century," Mr. Clinton said.
Two years after he declared the end of the era of big government, Mr. Clinton painted a sweeping landscape of Federal activism, from subsidies for care of babies to expansion of the health-care program for the elderly.
He presented a Democratic plan to distribute the spoils of a strong economy to schoolteachers, working parents, laid-off workers and Medicare recipients, a distinct contrast to Republican desires to cut taxes, bolster military spending and devote billions of dollars to traditional public works projects.
"We have moved past the sterile debate between those who say Government is the enemy and those who say Government is the answer," Mr. Clinton said in a succinct statement of his animating philosophy. "My fellow Americans, we have found a third way. We have the smallest Government in 35 years, but a more progressive one. We have a smaller Government, but a stronger nation."
But the unanswered question that hung over the Capitol was whether Mr. Clinton would remain in office or have the political clout to carry out his ambitious plan to use Government as a lever to carry the nation into the next century.
And even if he manages to survive the current crisis over his reported sexual misconduct with a former White House intern, it remains uncertain whether he will command the political and moral authority to govern.
The only sign of the strain Mr. Clinton is under were the deep bags beneath his eyes.
Once the decision was made to avoid mentioning the scandal, aides said that they combed the wording for any word or phrase that could be interpreted as an oblique reference to the accusations.
Few other politicians of his generation -- or any other -- could have pulled off a performance like that of Mr. Clinton tonight. For 74 minutes, the President bestrode the national stage enveloped in the trappings of great office -- the Speaker's throne and the vibrant colors of the oversized American flag behind him, before him the assemblage of the elite of the three branches of American Government and the diplomatic corps.
The hum of the evening was not of greatness, but of the proximity of tragedy to triumph, a reminder that such offices are occupied by mere men who can be stripped of their majesty overnight by their own human frailty.
In yet another sign that history looks upon humanity with a gimlet eye, Mr. Clinton delivered his State of the Union address on the same day that his personal secretary, Betty Currie, was called before a Federal grand jury investigating charges of perjury and obstruction of justice involving the President.
Also today, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has taken charge of her husband's defense against the accusations of adultery and perjury, said on national television that she and her husband were the targets of a "vast right-wing conspiracy."
Mrs. Clinton, who gazed down on her husband from the House balcony with assent and apparent admiration as he spoke, has been Mr. Clinton's most stalwart defender in the most personally punishing week the President has endured.
In Oslo, three conservative members of the Norwegian Parliament nominated Mr. Clinton for the Nobel Peace Prize, citing his foreign policy accomplishments.
The speech was well-received, interrupted at least 90 times by applause, frequently only by Democrats. That was the highest number of applause interruptions in Mr. Clinton's State of the Union address in the past four. In 1995, there were 96.
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, delivered the Republican response to Mr. Clinton's address. He argued that the President offered a vision of more Government, while the Republicans promised a smaller Government and lower taxes.
And he said that the Republican-led Congress intended to hold Government accountable: "From the classrooms to the courts. From the clerks to the President's Cabinet. From the post office to the Presidency."
Mr. Clinton sailed forward into the stiff wind of adversity, taking political comfort from what he called the healthiest domestic economy in a generation and the first balanced budget in 30 years.
"Turning a sea of red ink into black is no miracle," Mr. Clinton said. "It is the product of hard work by the American people and of two visionary actions in Congress -- the courageous vote in 1993 that led to a cut in the deficit of 90 percent and the truly historic bipartisan balanced budget agreement passed by this Congress.
"Here's the really good news: if we maintain our resolve, we will produce balanced budgets as far as the eye can see."
He promised more spending for food safety and biomedical research, renewed his call for a war on smoking by teen-agers, advocated an increase in the minimum wage and proposed new programs to help workers displaced by foreign competition.
On foreign policy, he urged Congress to support his call for shoring up the International Monetary Fund so that it could deal with the economic crisis sweeping Asia. He said that the fate of the economies of Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea have a direct impact on American jobs and prosperity.
"Preparing for a far-off storm that may reach our shores is far wiser than ignoring the thunder until the clouds are just overhead," he said.
To Iraq, he issued a threat of military action if Baghdad did not quickly come into compliance with the United Nations weapons inspection program.
"I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats, when I say to Saddam Hussein: You cannot defy the will of the world. And when I say to him: you have used weapons of mass destruction before and we are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again."
He threatened military action against Iraq and chided his own party for denying him authority to negotiate free-trade deals.
Many of the specific proposals in the speech had been foreshadowed over the past several weeks. The President's desire tonight was to describe the philosophical threads that weave the programs into a coherent vision of governance.
"We are moving steadily toward an even stronger America in the 21st century," Mr. Clinton said. "An economy that offers opportunity. A society rooted in responsibility. And a nation that lives as a community."
Mr. Clinton, who only a day earlier angrily pronounced the humiliating words, "I never had sexual relations with that woman," tonight spoke of using his office to strengthen the American family.
He repeated his proposal for a $1.50-a-package tax on cigarettes to discourage smoking by young people. He proposed scholarships and background checks for child care workers. He asked Congress to increase the tax deduction for day care for middle-income families.
He called for the hiring of 100,000 new teachers, to reduce the size of classes in grades 1 to 3 to 18 students nationwide, but did not specify the means to pay for the costly plan. He renewed his proposal for expanding Medicare to cover Americans as young as 55 who had lost their health insurance because of corporate layoffs, which officials said would be financed by reductions in "fraud and abuse" in the Medicare program.

Transcript of the State of the Union Message From President Clinton

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

 BODY:
Following is President Clinton's State of the Union Message, as transcribed by The New York Times:
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of the 105th Congress, distinguished guests, and my fellow Americans: 
 Since the last time we met in this chamber, America has lost two patriots and fine public servants. Though they sat on opposite sides of the aisle, Representatives Walter Capps and Sonny Bono shared a deep love for this House and an unshakable commitment to improving the lives of all our people. In the past few weeks, they've both been eulogized. Tonight, I think we should begin by sending a message to their families and their friends that we celebrate their lives and give thanks for their service to our nation.
For 209 years, it has been the President's duty to report to you on the State of the Union. Because of the hard work and high purpose of the American people, these are good times for America. We have more than 14 million new jobs. The lowest unemployment in 24 years. The lowest core inflation in 30 years. Incomes are rising, and we have the highest homeownership in history. Crime has dropped for a record five years in a row, and the welfare rolls are the lowest in 27 years. Our leadership in the world is unrivaled. Ladies and gentlemen, the state of our union is strong.
But with barely 700 days left in the 20th century, this is not a time to rest; it is a time to build, to build the America within reach.
An America where everybody has a chance to get ahead with hard work. Where every citizen can live in a safe community. Where families are strong, schools are good, and all our young people can go on to college. An America where scientists find cures for diseases from diabetes to Alzheimer's to AIDS. An America where every child can stretch a hand across a keyboard and reach every book ever written, every painting ever painted, every symphony ever composed. Where government provides opportunity, and citizens honor the responsibility to give something back to their communities. An America which leads the world to new heights of peace and prosperity.
This is the America we have begun to build; this is the America we can leave to our children, if we join together to finish the work at hand. Let us strengthen our nation for the 21st century.
Rarely have Americans lived through so much change, in so many ways, in so short a time. Quietly but with gathering force, the ground has shifted beneath our feet, as we have moved into an information age, a global economy, a truly new world.
For five years now, we have met the challenge of these changes as Americans have at every turning point in our history, by renewing the very idea of America: widening the circle of opportunity, deepening the meaning of our freedom, forging a more perfect union.
We shaped a new kind of government for the Information Age. I thank the Vice President for his leadership and the Congress for its support in building a government that is leaner, more flexible, a catalyst for new ideas. And most of all, a government that gives the American people the tools they need to make the most of their own lives.
We have moved past the sterile debate between those who say government is the enemy and those who say government is the answer. My fellow Americans, we have found a third way. We have the smallest government in 35 years, but a more progressive one. We have a smaller government, but a stronger nation.
We are moving steadily toward a an even stronger America in the 21st century. An economy that offers opportunity. A society rooted in responsibility. And a nation that lives as a community.
 
An Economy Offering Opportunity
First, Americans in this chamber and across our nation have pursued a new strategy for prosperity: fiscal discipline to cut interest rates and spur growth. Investments in education and skills, in science and technology and transportation, to prepare our people for the new economy. New markets for American products and American workers.
When I took office, the deficit for 1998 was projected to be $357 billion, and heading higher. This year, our deficit is projected to be $10 billion, and heading lower.
For three decades, six presidents have come before you to warn of the damage deficits pose to our nation. Tonight, I come before you to announce that the federal deficit, once so incomprehensibly large that it had eleven zeroes, will be, simply zero.
I will submit to Congress for 1999 the first balanced budget in 30 years.
And if we hold fast to fiscal discipline, we may balance the budget this year, four years ahead of schedule.
You can all be proud of that, because turning a sea of red ink into black is no miracle. It is the product of hard work by the American people and of two visionary actions in Congress -- the courageous vote in 1993 that led to a cut in the deficit of 90 percent and the truly historic, bipartisan, balanced budget agreement passed by this Congress. Here's the really good news. If we maintain our resolve, we will produce balanced budgets as far as the eye can see.
We must not go back to unwise spending, or untargeted tax cuts, that risk reopening the deficit. Last year, together we enacted targeted tax cuts, so that the typical middle class family will now have the lowest tax rates in 20 years.
My plan to balance the budget next year includes both new investments and new tax cuts targeted to the needs of working families: for education, for child care, for the environment. But whether the issue is tax cuts or spending, I ask all of you to meet this test: approve only those priorities that can actually be accomplished without adding a dime to the deficit.
Now if we balance the budget for next year, it is projected that we'll then have a sizable surplus in the years that immediately follow. What should we do with this projected surplus?
I have a simple four-word answer: Save Social Security first.
Tonight, I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus -- that's every penny of any surplus -- until we have taken all the necessary measures to strengthen the Social Security system for the 21st century.
Let us say -- let us say to all Americans watching tonight, whether you're 70, 50, or whether you just started paying into the system, Social Security will be there when you need it. Let us make this commitment: Social Security first. Let's do that together.
I also want to say that all the American people who are watching us tonight should be invited to join in this discussion in facing these issues squarely, and forming a true consensus on how we should proceed. We'll start by conducting nonpartisan forums in every region of the country, and I hope that lawmakers of both parties will participate. We'll hold a White House conference on Social Security in December. And one year from now, I will convene the leaders of Congress to craft historic, bipartisan legislation to achieve a landmark for our generation, a Social Security system that is strong in the 21st century.
In an economy that honors opportunity, all Americans must be able to reap the rewards of prosperity.
Because these times are good, we can afford to take one simple, sensible step to help millions of workers struggling to provide for their families. We should raise the minimum wage.
The information age is first and foremost an education age in which education must start at birth and continue throughout a lifetime.
Last year, from this podium, I said that education has to be our highest priority. I laid out a 10- point plan to move us forward, and urged all of us to let politics stop at the schoolhouse door.
Since then, this Congress, across party lines, and the American people have responded, in the most important year for education in a generation, expanding public school choice, opening the way to 3,000 new charter schools, working to connect every classroom in the country to the information superhighway, committing to expand Head Start to a million children, launching America Reads, sending literally thousands of college students into our elementary schools to make sure all our 8-year-olds can read.
Last year I proposed, and you passed, 220,000 new Pell Grant scholarships for deserving students. Student loans, students loans already less expensive and easier to repay, now you get to deduct the interest. Families all over America now can put their savings into new, tax-free education I.R.A.'s. And this year, for the first two years of college, families will get a $1,500 tax cut, a Hope Scholarship that will cover the cost of most community college tuition. And for junior and senior year, graduate school, and job training, there is a lifetime learning credit. You did that, and you should be very proud of it.
And because of these actions I have something to say to every family listening to us tonight. Your children can go on to college. If you know a child from a poor family, tell her not to give up. She can go on to college. If you know a young couple struggling with bills worried they won't be able to save for their children to college, tell them not to give up. Their children can go on to college. If you know somebody who's caught in a dead-end job and afraid he can't afford the classes necessary to get better jobs for the rest of his life, tell him not to give up. He can go on to college.
Because of the things that have been done, we can make college as universal in the 21st century as high school is today. And my friends, this will change the face and future of America.
We have opened wide the doors of the world's best system of higher education. Now we must make our public elementary and secondary schools the world's best as well, by raising standards, raising expectations, and raising accountability.
Thanks to the actions of this Congress last year, we will soon have, for the very first time, a voluntary national test based on national standards in fourth-grade reading and eighth-grade math. Parents have a right to know whether their children are mastering the basics.
And every parent already knows the key, good teachers and small classes. Tonight I propose the first-ever national effort to reduce class size in the early grades. My balanced budget will help to hire 100,000 new teachers who've passed a state competency test. Now, with these teachers, we will actually be able to reduce class size in the first, second, and third grades to an average of 18 students a class all across America.
Now, if I've got the math right, more teachers teaching smaller classes requires more classrooms. So I also propose a school construction tax cut to help communities modernize or build 5,000 schools.
We must also demand greater accountability. When we promote a child from grade to grade who hasn't mastered the work, we don't do that child any favors. It is time to end social promotion in America's schools.
Last year, in Chicago, they made that decision not to hold our children back, but to lift them up. Chicago stopped social promotion and started mandatory summer school to help students who are behind to catch up. I propose an effort to help other communities follow Chicago's lead. Let's say to them, Stop promoting children who don't learn, and we will give you the tools to make sure they do.
I also ask this Congress to support our effort to enlist colleges and universities to reach out to disadvantaged children starting in the sixth grade, so that they can get the guidance and hope they need so they can know that they too will be able to go on to college.
As we enter the 21st century, the global economy requires us to seek opportunity not just at home, but in all the markets of the world. We must shape this global economy, not shrink from it. In the last five years, we have led the way in opening new markets, with 240 trade agreements that remove foreign barriers to products bearing the proud stamp, "Made in the U.S.A."
Today, record high exports account for fully one-third of our economic growth. I want to keep them going, because that's the way to keep America growing and to advance a safer, more stable world.
All of you know, whatever your views are, that I think this is a great opportunity for America. I know there is opposition to more comprehensive trade agreements. I have listened carefully and I believe that the opposition is rooted in two fears: first, that our trading partners will have lower environmental and labor standards which will give them an unfair advantage in our markets and do their own people no favors even if there's more business; and second, that, if we have trade, more of our workers will lose their jobs and have to start over.
I think we should seek to advance worker and environmental standards around the world. It should, I have made it abundantly clear, that it should be a part of our trade agenda. But we cannot influence other countries' decisions if we send them a message that we're backing away from trade with them.
This year, I will send legislation to Congress, and ask other nations to join us, to fight the most intolerable labor practice of all, abusive child labor.
We should also offer help and hope to those Americans temporarily left behind by the global marketplace or by the march of technology, which may have nothing to do with trade.
That's why we have more than doubled funding for training dislocated workers since 1993, and if my new budget is adopted, we will triple funding.
That's why we must do more, and more quickly, to help workers who lose their jobs for whatever reason. You know we help communities in a special way when their military base closes. We ought to help them in the same way if their factory closes.
Again, I ask the Congress to continue its bipartisan work to consolidate the tangle of training programs we had today into one single G.I. Bill for Workers, a simple skills grant so people can on their own move quickly to new jobs, to higher incomes and brighter futures.
Now we all know, in every way in life, change is not always easy, but we have to decide whether we're going to try to hold it back and hid from it or reap its benefits. And remember the big picture here. While we've been entering into hundreds of new trade agreements, we've been creating millions of new jobs.
So this year we will forge new partnerships with Latin America, Asia and Europe. And we should pass the new African Trade Act. It has bipartisan support.
I will also renew my request for the fast-track negotiating authority necessary to open more new markets, and create more new jobs, which every President has had for two decades. You know, whether we like it or not, in ways that are mostly positive, the world's economies are more and more interconnected and interdependent.
Today, an economic crisis anywhere can affect economies everywhere. Recent months have brought serious financial problems to Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea and beyond.
Now, why should Americans be concerned about this?
First, these countries are our customers. If they sink into recession, they won't be able to buy the goods we'd like to sell them. Second, they're also our competitors, so if their currencies lose their value and go down, then the price of their goods will drop, flooding our market and others with much cheaper goods, which makes it a lot tougher for our people to compete. And finally, they are our strategic partners. Their stability bolsters our security.
The American economy remains sound and strong, and I want to keep it that way. But because the turmoil in Asia will have an impact on all the world's economies, including ours, making that negative impact as small as possible is the right thing to do for America and the right thing to do for a safer world.
Our policy is clear. No nation can recover if it does not reform itself. But when nations are willing to undertake serious economic reform, we should help them to do it. So I call on Congress to renew America's commitment to the International Monetary Fund.
And I think we should say to all the people we're trying to represent here that preparing for a far-off storm that may reach our shores is far wiser than ignoring the thunder until the clouds are just overhead.
 
A Society Rooted in Responsibility
A strong nation rests on the rock of responsibility.
A society rooted in responsibility must first promote the value of work, not welfare. We can be proud that after decades of finger-pointing and failure, together we ended the old welfare system. And we're now replacing welfare checks with paychecks.
Last year, after a record four-year decline in welfare rolls, I challenged our nation to move two million more Americans off welfare by the year 2000. I am pleased to report that we have also met that goal two full years ahead of schedule.
This is a grand achievement, the sum of many acts of individual courage, persistence and hope. For 13 years, Elaine Kinslow of Indianapolis, Indiana, was on and off welfare. Today she's a dispatcher with a van company. She's saved enough money to move her family into a good neighborhood and she's helping other welfare recipients go to work. Elaine Kinslow and all those like her are the real heroes of the welfare revolution. There are millions like her all across America and I'm happy she could join the First Lady tonight. Elaine, we're very proud of you. Please stand up.
We still have a lot more to do, all of us, to make welfare reform a success, providing child care, helping families move closer to available jobs, challenging more companies to join our welfare-to-work partnership, increasing child support collections from deadbeat parents who have a duty to support their own children. I also want to thank Congress for restoring some of the benefits to immigrants who are here legally and working hard, and I hope you will finish that job this year.
We have to make it possible for all hard-working families to meet their most important responsibilities.
Two years ago, we helped guarantee that Americans can keep their health insurance when they change jobs. Last year, we extended health care to up to five million children. This year, I challenge Congress to take the next historic steps.
One hundred and sixty million of our fellow citizens are in managed-care plans. Those plans save money and they can improve care. But medical decisions ought to be made by medical doctors, not insurance company accountants. I urge this Congress to reach across the aisle and write into law a Consumer Bill of Rights that says this: You have the right to know all your medical options, not just the cheapest. You have the right to choose the doctor you want for the care you need. You have the right to emergency room care, wherever and whenever you need it. You have the right to keep your medical records confidential. Now, traditional care or managed care, every American deserves quality care.
Millions of Americans between the ages of 55 and 65 have lost their health insurance. Some are retired, some are laid off, some lose their coverage when their spouses retire. After a lifetime of work, they're left with nowhere to turn.
So I ask the Congress: Let these hard-working Americans buy into the Medicare system. It won't add a dime to the deficit, but the peace of mind it will provide will be priceless.
Next, we must help parents protect their children from the gravest health threat that they face, an epidemic of teen smoking, spread by multimillion-dollar marketing campaigns.
I challenge Congress. Let's pass bipartisan, comprehensive legislation that will improve public health, protect our tobacco farmers and change the way tobacco companies do business forever. Let's do what it takes to bring teen smoking down. Let's raise the price of cigarettes by up to $1.50 a pack over the next ten years, with penalties on the tobacco industry if keeps marketing to our children. Now, tomorrow, like every day, 3,000 children will start smoking. And a thousand will die early as a result. Let this Congress be remembered as the Congress that saved their lives.
 In the new economy, most parents work, harder than ever. They face a constant struggle to balance their obligations to be good workers and their even more important obligations to be good parents.
 The Family and Medical Leave Act was the very first bill I was privileged to sign into law a President in 1993. Since then, about 15 million people have taken advantage of it, and I've met a lot of them all across this country. I ask you to extend that law to cover 10 million more workers, and to give parents time off when they have to go see their children's teachers or take them to the doctor.
Child care is the next frontier we must face to enable people to succeed at home and at work. Last year, I co-hosted the very first White House conference on child care with one of our foremost experts, America's First Lady. From all corners of America, we heard the same message without regard to region or income or political affiliation: We've got to raise the quality of child care. We've got to make it safer. We've got to make it more affordable.
So here's my plan: Help families to pay for child care for a million more children. Scholarships and background checks for child care workers, and a new emphasis on early learning. Tax credits for businesses that provide child care for their employees. And a larger child care tax credit for working families. Now, if you pass my plan, what this means is that a family of four with an income of $35,000 and high child care costs will no longer pay a single penny of federal income tax.
You know, I think this is such a big issue with me because of my own personal experience. I have often wondered how my mother, when she was a young widow, would have been able to go away to school and get and education and come back and support me if my grandparents hadn't been able to take care of me. She and I were really very lucky. How many other families have never had that same opportunity? The truth is, we don't know the answer to that question. But we do know the answer should be. Not a single American family should ever have to choose between the job they need and the child they love.
A society rooted in responsibility must provide safe streets, safe schools and safe neighborhoods.
We pursued a strategy of more police, tougher punishments, smarter prevention. With crime-fighting partnerships with local law enforcement and citizen groups, where the rubber hits the road. I can report to you tonight that it's working. Violent crime is down, robbery is down, assault is down, burglary is down, for five years in a row, all across America.
Now we need to finish the job of putting 100,000 more police on our streets.
Again I ask Congress to pass a juvenile crime bill that provides more prosecutors and probation officers to crack down on gangs and guns and drugs, and bar violent juveniles from buying guns for life.
And I ask you to dramatically expand our support for after-school programs. I think every American should know that most juvenile crime is committed between the hours of 3 in the afternoon and 8 at night. We can keep so many of our children out of trouble in the first place if we give them someplace to go other than the streets, and we ought to do it.
Drug use is on the decline. I thank General McCaffrey for his leadership, and I thank this Congress for passing the largest anti-drug budget in history. Now I ask you to join me in a groundbreaking effort to hire 1,000 new border patrol agents, and to deploy the most sophisticated available new technologies, to help close the door on drugs at our borders.
Police, prosecutors, and prevention programs, as good as they are, they can't work if our court system doesn't work. Today, there are large numbers of vacancies in our federal courts. Here is what the Chief Justice of the United States wrote, " Judicial vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice." I simply ask the United States Senate to heed this plea, and vote on the highly qualified nominees before you, up or down.
We must exercise responsibility not just at home but around the world.
On the eve of a new century, we have the power and the duty to build a new era of peace and security. But make no mistake about it, today's possibilities are not tomorrow's guarantees.
America must stand against the poisoned appeals of extreme nationalism. We must combat an unholy axis of new threats from terrorists, international criminals and drug traffickers. These 21st-century predators feed on technology and the free flow of information and ideas and people and they will be all the more lethal if weapons of mass destruction fall into their hands.
To meet these challenges, we are helping to write international rules of the road for the 21st century, protecting those who join the family of nations and isolating those who do not.
Within days, I will ask the Senate for its advice and consent to make Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic the newest members of NATO. For 50 years, NATO contained Communism and kept America and Europe secure. Now these three formerly Communist countries have said "yes" to democracy. I ask the Senate to say yes to them, our new allies.
By taking in new members and working closely with new partners, including Russia and Ukraine, NATO can help to assure that Europe is a stronghold for peace in the 21st century.
Next, I will ask Congress to continue its support for our troops and their mission in Bosnia. This Christmas, Hillary and I traveled to Sarajevo with Senator and Mrs. Dole and a bipartisan Congressional delegation. We saw children playing in the streets, where two years ago they were hiding from snipers and shells. The shops were filled with food, the cafes were alive with conversation.
The progress is unmistakable, but not yet irreversible. To take firm root, Bosnia's fragile peace still needs the support of American and allied troops when the current NATO mission ends in June. I think Senator Dole actually said it best. He said, this is like being ahead in the fourth quarter of a football game. Now is not the time to walk off the field and forfeit the victory.
I wish all of you could have seen our troops in Tuzla. They're very proud of what they're doing in Bosnia, and we're all very proud of them.
One of those brave soldiers is sitting with the First Lady tonight, Army Sgt. Michael Tolbert. His father was a decorated Vietnam vet. After college in Colorado, he joined the Army. Last year, he led an infantry unit that stopped a mob of extremists from taking over a radio station that is a voice of democracy and tolerance in Bosnia. Thank you very much, Sergeant, for what you represent. Please stand up.
In Bosnia, and around the world, our men and women in uniform, always do their mission well. Our mission must be to keep them well-trained and ready, to improve their quality of life and to provide the 21st-century weapons they need to defeat any enemy.
I ask Congress to join me in pursuing an ambitious agenda to reduce the serious threat of weapons of mass destruction.
This year, four decades after it was first proposed by President Eisenhower, a comprehensive nuclear test ban is within reach. By ending nuclear testing, we can help to prevent the development of new and more dangerous weapons and make it more difficult for non-nuclear states to build them. I am pleased to announce that four former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- Generals John Shalikashvili, Colin Powell and David Jones and Admiral William Crowe -- have endorsed this treaty. And I ask the Senate to approve it, this year.
Together, we must also confront the new hazards of chemical and biological weapons and the outlaw states, terrorists and organized criminals seeking to acquire them.
Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade, and much of his nation's wealth, not on providing for the Iraqi people but on developing nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them. The United Nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job, finding and destroying more of Iraq's arsenal than was destroyed during the entire Gulf War. Now, Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from completing their mission. I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats, when I say to Saddam Hussein, you cannot defy the will of the world. And when I say to him, you have used weapons of mass destruction before.We are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again.
Last year, the Senate ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention to protect our soldiers and citizens from poison gas. Now, we must act to prevent the use of disease as a weapon of war and terror. The Biological Weapons Convention has been in effect for 23 years now. The rules are good, but the enforcement is weak.We must strengthen it with a new international inspection system to detect and deter cheating.
In the months ahead, I will pursue our security strategy with old allies in Asia and Europe and new partners from Africa to India and Pakistan . . . from South America to China. And from Belfast, to Korea to the Middle East, America will continue to stand with those who stand for peace.
Finally, it's long past time to make good on our debt to the United Nations.
More and more, we are working with other nations to achieve common goals. If we want America to lead, we've got to set a good example. As we see so clearly in Bosnia, allies who share our goals can also share our burdens. In this new era, our freedom and independence are actually enriched, not weakened by our increasing interdependence with other nations. But we have to do our part.
 
A Nation That Lives by Community
Our Founders set America on a permanent course toward "a more perfect union." To all of you I say it is a journey we can only make together, living as one community.
First , we have to continue to reform our government -- the instrument of our national community.
Everyone knows elections have become too expensive, fueling a fund-raising arms race. This year, by March the 6th, at long last the Senate will actually vote on bipartisan campaign finance reform proposed by Senators McCain and Feingold. Let's be clear. A vote against McCain-Feingold is a vote for soft money and for the status quo. I ask you to strengthen our democracy and pass campaign finance reform this year.
But, at least equally important, we have to address the reason for the explosion in campaign costs, the high cost of media advertising. I will -- to the folks watching at home, those were the groans of pain in the audience -- I will formally request that the Federal Communications Commission act to provide free or reduced cost television time for candidates who observe spending limits voluntarily. The, the airwaves are a public trust, and broadcasters also have to help us in this effort to strengthen our democracy.
Under the leadership of Vice President Gore, we've reduced the Federal payroll by 300,000 workers. Cut 16,000 pages of regulation, eliminated hundreds of programs and improved the operations of virtually every Government agency. But we can do more.
Like every taxpayer, I'm outraged by the reports of abuses by the I.R.S. We need some changes there. New citizen advocacy panels, a stronger taxpayer advocate, phone lines open 24 hours a day, relief for innocent taxpayers. Last year, by an overwhelming bipartisan margin, the House of Representatives passed sweeping I.R.S reforms. This bill must not now languish in the Senate. Tonight I ask the Senate, follow the House, pass the bipartisan package as your first order of business.
I hope to goodness before I finish I can think of something to say follow the Senate on, so I'll be out of trouble.
A nation that lives as a community must value all its communities.
For the past five years, we have worked to bring the spark of private enterprise to inner city and poor rural areas -- with community development banks, more commercial loans into poor neighborhoods, cleanup of polluted sites for development. Under the continued leadership of the VicePresident, we propose to triple the number of empowerment zones to give businesses incentives to invest in those areas. We should also give poor families more help to move into homes of their own. And we should use tax cuts to spur the construction of more low income housing.
Last year this Congress took strong action to help the District of Columbia. Let us renew our resolve to make our capital city a great city for all who live and visit here.
Our cities are the vibrant hubs of great metropolitan areas. They are still the gateways for new immigrants, from every continent, who come here to work for their own American dreams. Let's keep our cities going strong into the 21st century. They're a very important part of our future.
Our communities are only as healthy as the air our children breathe, the water they drink, the earth they will inherit.
Last year, we put in place the toughest-ever controls on smog and soot. We moved to protect Yellowstone, the Everglades, Lake Tahoe. We expanded every community's right to know about toxics that threaten their children.
Just yesterday, our food safety plan took effect, using new science to protect consumers from dangers like e-coli and salmonella.
Tonight, I ask you to join me in launching a new Clean Water Initiative, a far-reaching effort to clean our rivers, our lakes and our coastal waters for our children.
Our overriding environmental challenge tonight is the worldwide problem of climate change, global warming the gathering crisis that requires worldwide action.
The vast majority of scientists have concluded unequivocally that if we don't reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, at some point in the next century we'll disrupt our climate and put our children and grandchildren at risk. This past December, America led the world to reach a historic agreement committing our nation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through market forces, new technologies, energy efficiency.
We have it in our power to act right here, right now. I propose $6 billion in tax cuts and research and development to encourage innovation, renewable energy, fuel efficient cars, energy efficient homes.
Every time we have acted to heal our environment, pessimists have told us it would hurt the economy. Well, today our economy is the strongest in a generation and our environment is the cleanest in a generation. We have always found a way to clean the environment and grow the economy at the same time. And when it comes to global warming we'll do it again.
Finally, community means living by the defining American value -- the ideal heard round the world -- that we're all created equal.
Throughout our history, we haven't always honored that ideal and we've never fully lived up to it. Often it's easier to believe that our differences matter more than what we have in common. It may be easier, but it's wrong.
What we have to do in our day and generation to make sure that America truly becomes one nation, what do we have to do? We're becoming more and more and more diverse. Do you believe we can become one nation?
The answer cannot be to dwell on our differences, but to build on our shared values. We all cherish family and faith, freedom and responsibility. We all want our children to grow up in a world where their talents are matched by their opportunities.
I've launched this national initiative on race to help us recognize our common interests and to bridge the opportunity gaps that are keeping us from becoming One America.
Let us begin by recognizing what we still must overcome. Discrimination against any American is un-American. We must vigorously, we must vigorously enforce the laws that make it illegal. I ask your help to end the backlog at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Sixty thousand of our fellow citizens are waiting in line for justice, and we should act now to end their wait.
We should also recognize that the greatest progress we can make toward building one America lies in the progress we make for all Americans, without regard to race. When we open the doors of college to all Americans, when we rid all our streets of crime, when there are jobs available to people from all our neighborhoods, when we make sure all parents have the child care they need, we're helping to build one nation.
We, in this chamber and in this government, must do all we can to address the continuing American challenge to build one America. But we'll only move forward if all our fellow citizens, including every one of you at home watching tonight, is also committed to this cause.
We must work together, learn together, live together, serve together. On the forge of common enterprise Americans of all backgrounds can hammer out a common identity. We see it today in the United States military, in the Peace Corps, in AmeriCorps, wherever people of all races and backgrounds come together in a shared endeavor and get a fair chance. We do just fine.
With shared values, and meaningful opportunities and honest communications, and citizen service, we can unite a diverse people in freedom and mutual respect. We are many. We must be one.
 
Millennium: Gifts to the Future
In that spirit, let us lift our eyes to the new millennium. How will we mark that passage? It just happens once every thousand years.
This year, Hillary and I launched the White House Millennium Program to promote America's creativity and innovation, and to preserve our heritage and culture into the 21st century. Our culture lives in every community, and every community has places of historic value that tell our stories as Americans. We should protect them. I am proposing a public private partnership to advance our arts and humanities and to celebrate the millennium by saving America's treasures, great and small.
And while we honor the past, let us imagine the future.
Now think about this. The entire store of human knowledge now doubles every five years. In the 1980's, scientists identified the gene causing cystic fibrosis. It took nine years. Last year, scientists located the gene that causes Parkinson's Disease in only nine days. Within a decade, "gene chips" will offer a road map for prevention of illnesses throughout a lifetime. Soon, we'll be able to carry all the phone calls on Mother's Day on a single strand of fiber the width of a human hair. A child born in 1998 may well live to see the 22d century.
Tonight, as part of our gift to the millennium, I propose a 21st Century Research Fund for path-breaking scientific inquiry, the largest funding increase in history for the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and the National Cancer Institute. We have already discovered genes for breast cancer and diabetes. I ask you to support this initiative so ours will be the generation that finally wins the war against cancer and begins a revolution in our fight against all deadly diseases.
As important as all this scientific progress is, we must continue to see that science serves humanity, not the other way around. We must prevent the misuse of genetic tests to discriminate against any American. And we must ratify the ethical consensus of the scientific and religious communities, and ban the cloning of human beings.
We should enable all the world's people to explore the far reaches of cyberspace.
Think of this. The first time I made a State of the Union speech to you, only a handful of physicists used the World Wide Web. Literally, just a handful of people. Now, in schools and libraries, homes and businesses, millions and millions of Americans surf the net every day.
We must give parents the tools they need to help protect their children from inappropriate material on the Internet, but we also must make sure that we protect the exploding global commercial potential of the Internet. We can do the kinds of things that we need to do and still protect our kids. For one thing, I ask Congress to step up support for building the next generation Internet. It's getting kind of clogged, you know. And the next generation Internet will operate at speeds up to a thousand times faster than today. Even as we explore this inner space in the new millennium we're going to open new frontiers in outer space.
Throughout all history, humankind has had only one place to call home, our planet Earth. Beginning this year, 1998, men and women from 16 countries will build a foothold in the heavens, the international space station. With its vast expanses, scientists and engineers will actually set sail on an uncharted sea of limitless mystery and unlimited potential. And this October, a true American hero, a veteran pilot of 149 combat missions and one five-hour space flight that changed the world, will return to the heavens. Godspeed, John Glenn.
John, you will carry with you America's hopes and on your uniform, once again, you will carry America's flag marking the unbroken connection between the deeds of America's past and the daring of America's future.
Nearly 200 years ago, a tattered flag, its broad stripes and bright stars still gleaming through the smoke of a fierce battle moved Francis Scott Key to scribble a few words on the back of an envelope, the words that became our national anthem. Today that star-spangled banner, along with the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, are on display just a short walk from here. They are America's treasures. And we must also save them for the ages. I ask all Americans to support our project to restore all our treasures so that the generations of the 21st century can see for themselves the images and the words that are the old and continuing glory of America, an America that has continued to rise through every age, against every challenge; a people of great works and greater possibilities, who have always, always found the wisdom and strength to come together as one nation, to widen the circle of opportunity, to deepen the meaning of our freedom, to form that more perfect union. Let that be our gift to the 21st Century.
God Bless You, and God Bless the United States.

New York City Leads Upstate in New Jobs

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
The disparity that emerged in New York State in 1997 between economic strength in the New York City region and protracted weakness upstate continued last month, highlighted by some of the starkest job numbers of the year, the State Department of Labor said yesterday.
Of 18,800 new jobs created across the state in December, the state said, 15,100, more than 80 percent, were in the five boroughs of New York City. If the city's suburbs on Long Island, Westchester, Rockland and Putnam are added in, the result is 24,800 new jobs. The total job count is brought back down to 18,800 because of job losses in many upstate areas. 
 Of the 12 metropolitan areas measured by the Labor Department, eight showed month-to-month declines on a nonseasonally adjusted basis, with sharpest drops in Rochester, which lost 1,400 jobs, Utica-Rome, 900 jobs, and Syracuse, 400.
The state unemployment rate fell slightly during the month, to 6.1 percent from 6.2 percent in November, seasonally adjusted, the state said. The biggest improvements were concentrated in New York City, where the jobless rate fell by three-tenths of a percentage point, to 8.4 percent, from 8.7 percent in November.
One year ago, the city's unemployment rate was 9.2 percent, and unemployment reached 10 percent just last June. The state's unemployment rate, meanwhile, has barely budged; it was 6.2 percent in December 1996.

New Honduran President Says He'll Fight Poverty

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras, Jan. 27

 BODY:
Pledging to take on rising crime and endemic poverty, Carlos Flores Facusse was sworn in as President today before a cheering crowd of 30,000 people at a soccer stadium here in the capital.
With his American wife, Mary, at his side, Mr. Flores Facusse, a 47-year-old newspaper owner and past president of Congress from the Liberal Party, accepted the presidential sash and took his oath of office. 
 In his inaugural address, he said he would combat the poverty afflicting 80 percent of Honduras' 5.9 million people.
He also vowed to combat rising street crime and Government corruption, improve wages and stimulate investment. But he offered no specifics on how he would do so.
"Honduras is a country that does not tolerate the misery of underdevelopment," he said.
As the fifth President elected by popular vote in 17 years, Mr. Flores Facusse also spoke of moving the country beyond its painful shift from military rule, which ended in 1980.
Elected Nov. 30 to a four-year term, Mr. Flores Facusse defeated Nora Gunera de Melgar, former Myor of Tegucigalpa and widow of a former military ruler.
He succeeded the Liberal Party politician Carlos Roberto Reina, 71.
Mr. Reina left office after having promised to crack down on corruption and the human rights abuses that he once suffered as a political prisoner under military rule.

Proposed alliance between Continental and Northwest is expected to push air fares higher.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell 

 BODY:
AIR fares for business and leisure travelers are likely to rise in the wake of the proposed alliance between Northwest Airlines and Continental Airlines, travel and airline pricing experts say, but not necessarily steeply or for the long term. And joining the carriers' frequent-flier programs, which is expected by June 1, will open many new foreign and domestic destinations to members of both existing programs.
"It's worth remembering that alliances and mergers don't usually result in lower prices for passengers," said Michael W. McCormick, a vice president of Rosenbluth International, the large Philadelphia-based travel management company. "You have to assume that Northwest and Continental will try to provide more services in order to get higher yields, and that means higher costs." 
 Travis Tanner, chief executive of the Carlson Wagonlit travel agency chain, said the alliance made sense, especially since the route systems hardly overlap at all. "But in the short term it could accelerate the existing pressures on pricing," he said, which are already rising because of record passenger loads and the use of narrow-bodied airplanes, which has led to a shortage of airplane seats in some markets.
Those combined pressures, Mr. Tanner predicted, are likely to lead to additional restrictions on leisure travelers, including their having to book flights further in advance than usual to obtain discount fares.
Steven Morrison, a professor of economics at Northeastern University in Boston, who is a specialist in airline pricing, said that with the Northwest-Continental alliance involving few overlapping routes, "There should be a negligible effect on fares," therefore "the Justice Department shouldn't care" about the alliance. But that does not mean fares on any of those routes will fall, he added, because, "As the economy continues to be strong, there is generic upward pressure on fares."
Likewise, Paul Zifkin of Duke University's Fuqua School of Business, who is also an authority on pricing decisions, said: "In principle, any consolidation is bad for consumers. On the other hand, when the big players are so dominant, strengthening two smaller airlines could have long-term benefits."
Kevin C. Murphy, the airline analyst for Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company, thinks the alliance will definitely strengthen the two carriers. He said the alliance was concerned with "incremental growth," not gouging customers.
Ivan Michael Schaeffer, the chief executive of Woodside Travel Trust, a global travel-management organization, is still considering whether to ask the Justice Department and the Department of Transportation to oppose the alliance, but he has no ambiguity about air fares: "They're going to rise," he declared.
"Even 14 percent ownership," Mr. Schaeffer said, referring to Northwest's proposed stake in Continental, "will lead to further concentration in the industry and lead to a diminution of competition in the marketplace." The most worrisome aspect of the alliance, he said, is that "Continental and T.W.A. were the carriers we looked to for some semblance of competition."
According to Mr. Schaeffer: "In 1978, the year of airline deregulation, there were 36 big carriers and the top 10 had less than 50 percent market share. There are 23 big carriers today, and the top 10 have 92 percent of the market."
Bijan Vasigh, a professor of economics at Embrey Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Fla., said that air fares could be kept in check by continued competition on the major routes served by Northwest and Continental.
The two carriers' frequent-flier programs, with a total of more than 30 million members, will allow participants to fly to Asia, South America and Russia on the airlines or other carriers with which the two have agreements.
Northwest acknowledged that its alliance with Continental was spurred in part by United States-Japan negotiations that could greatly increase the number of flights between the two countries, routes where Northwest is now dominant. Northwest's concern apparently is not misplaced, since a comprehensive open skies policy, according to Jeff Barrett, a vice president of BTI Americas, a major travel management company in Northbrook, Ill., "would lower fares, add cities, and increase the number of competitors."
Because of lack of competition, "Fares to Asia, which mostly means Japan, are some 70 percent higher relative to other places, adjusting for distance," Professor Morrison of Northeastern said. But he and Professor Zifkin of Duke cautioned that a comprehensive open skies policy was not necessarily a certainty.
"There are all sorts of ways," Professor Zifkin said, "to reach a 'liberalization agreement' that's just cosmetic."

Some meaty stuff on monetary policy, from a former Fed hand.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
ALAN S. BLINDER, widely seen as one of the brightest lights in academic economics, spent less than two years as vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board before returning to Princeton in 1996. The unofficial explanation: With Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, virtually running the central bank as a one-man show, Mr. Blinder was deeply frustrated by his lack of impact on policy.
But Mr. Blinder has not stopped thinking about matters monetary. And while his about-to-be-published book, "Central Banking in Theory and Practice" (M.I.T. Press), will disappoint those seeking the inside story on who bruised whose ego, it is full of meaty stuff about monetary policy. Here are some selected nuggets of Blinder insight for those who are cowed by the occasional equation, or the $20 cover price: 
 MODELS MATTER. There are lots of reasons for the makers of monetary policy to take computer-based forecasts at less than face value. They are based on statistical inference, and thus offer only a range of predictions. They assume, incorrectly, that the Fed has absolute power to control levers of policy -- say, the quantity of money in checking deposits. They are bedeviled by uncertainty on key questions, such as how long it takes for interest rate changes to affect spending.
That said, econometric models remain the most rigorous statements of what is known about how the pieces fit together. And ignoring the models amounts to rejecting the acccumulated wisdom of economics. Or, as Mr. Blinder more colorfully puts it: "You can get your information about the economy from admittedly fallible statistical relationships, or you can ask your uncle."
PRE-EMPTIVE STRIKES MAKE SENSE. Until the last few years, conservatism in monetary policy meant waiting until something went wrong -- inflation or recession -- and then reacting. But there are good theoretical reasons to run monetary policy the way a helmsman steers a sailboat, changing direction frequently to reach port even if the wind and current remain steady. And after the Fed managed to avoid both inflation and recession with a deft tightening of the monetary tap in 1994, the notion of pre-emptive monetary policy has become fashionable among pragmatists, too.
Must the Fed's board of governors go to graduate school to learn the calculus of variations before they can successfully play the pre-emption game? Hardly, Mr. Blinder says, who explains with another metaphor. "Like a skilled billiards player who does not understand the laws of physics, a skilled practitioner of monetary policy may follow a dynamic-programming-type strategy intuitively and informally," he argues.
MONETARISM REALLY IS DEAD. During the 1960's and 1970's -- the decades in which today's movers and shakers were trained -- macroeconomics was deeply divided between those who thought that the Fed should stress money in circulation and those who argued that it should focus on interest rates. But unlike most academic battles, this one was settled by events rather than scholarship.
Since the late 1980's, the growth in the supply of money has veered erratically. Expanding narrow definitions of money to include, say, money market deposits, has not made the numbers any more useful in predicting economic activity.
Mr. Blinder notes that the Fed still occasionally rationalizes policy shifts, such as the Draconian tightening of credit in the early 1980's, with the rhetoric of monetarism. But it's just that: rhetoric. In the words of Gerry Bouey, a former Canadian central banker, "We didn't abandon the monetary aggregates, they abandoned us."
CREDIBILITY REALLY DOES COUNT. Like the Dr. Seuss character, central bankers go to great lengths to say what they mean and mean what they say. Their alleged payoff: credibility that makes it less painful to meet policy targets. If, for example, Mr. Greenspan warns that he will not tolerate higher prices, unions temper wage demands even before the Fed raises interest rates.
But Mr. Blinder argues that there is not much evidence to support the contention that Fed credibility on, say, its commitment to prevent inflation actually reduces the social cost of preventing inflation. Why, then, do central bankers work so hard to be taken so seriously?
Perhaps they are inclined to believe their own hype, the way Republicans serving rich constituents have grown to believe that the capital gains tax is the root of all evil. Mr. Blinder, however, suggests more practical reasons for keeping the Fed on its pedestal.
For one thing, it paradoxically gives the board greater latitude to change course: when Paul A. Volcker allowed the money supply to grow sharply in 1983, no one assumed he was abandoning his commitment to price stability. But most strikingly, credibility is the only asset that can stop incipient financial panics, such as the stock market crash in October 1987. "When a central bank's word is as important as its deed, it pays to be believed," Mr. Blinder reminds.

HEADLINE: Unfair Visa Profiles

 BODY:
A recent ruling by Federal District Judge Stanley Sporkin against the State Department sheds light on offensive, racially biased visa policies used in the American consulate in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and other consular offices around the world. Instead of defending these policies, the State Department should be working to eliminate them.
The case involved a Foreign Service officer, Robert Olsen, who was dismissed because he refused to follow "profiles" used in the Sao Paulo office in rejecting non-immigrant visa applications. When there is evidence of a fraud ring operating among specific groups, a profile or checklist of characteristics can help alert consular officers to shady applicants. But it is another thing entirely to enforce a standing policy that denies tourist and business visas to people based on their race, ethnic background or style of dress. 
 That apparently was what happened in Sao Paulo. The consulate manual included codes such as "LP" for "looks poor," "TP" for "talks poor" and "LR" for "looks rough" to justify visa denials. All Koreans, Chinese and Arabs were treated as fraud suspects. People born in some regions of Brazil, particularly areas with large black populations, were also instantly tagged as fraud suspects and subjected to more rigorous application review. Even the dubious physical-appearance test, which ostensibly dealt with economic status, functioned as a racial discriminator since a disproportionate percentage of blacks in Brazil are poor, and many applicants who "looked poor" were black.
The Government argues that these generalized stereotypes are used to increase scrutiny, and do not necessarily lead to the denial of a visa. But even that difference places a heavy, unjust burden on some applicants that other applicants of non-suspect races do not face. Judge Sporkin ruled that these profiles were illegal under Federal immigration law, and that the termination of Mr. Olsen for refusing to use these profiles was improper. The case has been remanded to the Foreign Service Grievance Board, which should reinstate Mr. Olsen to his job.
Consulates need discretion in determining who gets a visa, but those decisions should be based on objective and fair criteria. The need for busy Foreign Service officers to rely on shorthand lists is understandable, but does not justify the reprehensible use of factors like ethnic background. Foreigners have no legal recourse if they are unfairly denied a visa, but it offends the spirit of fairness to carry out a discriminatory policy in consular offices that Americans would not tolerate at home.

HEADLINE: Monthly Drop For Durables Is the Biggest In Six Years

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
The aircraft industry's order book dried up in December, causing orders for durable goods to fall 6.1 percent, the largest monthly drop in six years. Outside of aircraft, though, orders rose for the first time since September, a sign that heavy industry remained healthy.
In all of 1997, orders for durable goods -- big-ticket items such as autos and furniture -- increased 7.1 percent, the largest yearly gain since 1995, the Commerce Department said today. 
 Orders for durable goods tend to be volatile from month to month, and economists caution against reading too much into one month's report. Orders for aircraft, in particular, tend to exaggerate trends. A single jumbo jet, for example, costs hundreds of millions of dollars.
December's transportation orders dropped 22.7 percent, mainly reflecting the decline in aircraft orders, which had surged in November, when durable goods orders over all rose a revised 5.1 percent. Indeed, when the category of transportation equipment was excluded, orders for durable goods in December showed a rise of four-tenths of 1 percent.
Excluding military hardware, orders decreased 6.5 percent last month.
With the full effect of Asia's financial crisis still to be felt in this country, "a lull is anticipated" for manufacturers in early 1998, according to a forecast by Scott Brown, an economist at Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla. Exports are expected to sag while inexpensive imports put a squeeze on domestic producers, the forecast said.
Already, "inventories are piling up slightly relative to factory shipments," according to Mr. Brown's forecast.
Unfilled factory orders for durable goods, a gauge of pent-up demand, decreased four-tenths of 1 percent in December after rising 2.5 percent in November. Shipments of goods, a gauge of current demand, rose 1.5 percent last month after falling four-tenths of 1 percent the previous month.

HEADLINE: U.S. Spy Agencies Find Scant Peril on Horizon

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
While the world still bristles with weapons, the United States itself is relatively secure from the threat of war, the Government's top intelligence officials testified today.
The nation confronts dangers to world peace, personified by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, and a Pandora's box of potential threats, exemplified by the spread of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, the intelligence experts said. 
 But "the danger of nuclear attack, large-scale conventional attack and other threats to our national existence is low," Phyllis Oakley, the Assistant Secretary of State for intelligence and research, said in testimony before the Senate intelligence committee.
The rest of the world's nations are spending 40 percent less on their armies and on military weapons than they did a decade ago, said Lieut. Gen. Patrick M. Hughes of the Army, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. And no well-armed, technologically advanced nation is likely to make war on the United States in the foreseeable future, he said.
The witnesses, especially George J. Tenet, the Director of Central Intelligence, did warn the Senators of a long list of problems that, left untended, could lead to war somewhere, sometime.
That list was evidence of the unsettled and, for some, unsettling nature of the post-cold-war world. Few of the threats they cited could be solved by American military prowess. Many were economic, ecological, technological, political and criminal phenomena that warplanes and smart bombs cannot combat.
The intelligence chiefs, joined by Bob Bryant, the deputy director of the F.B.I., presented what has become an annual "state of the world" briefing to the Senate intelligence committee. Intelligence professionals are famously pessimistic; an old joke has it that when they smell flowers, they look for a funeral. But today's briefing left the impression that, for the time being, the United States faces no lethal threat from abroad, a state of affairs unimaginable from the 1940's through the 1980's.
Still, uncertainty and threats cloud the horizon. Mr. Tenet cited first and foremost the spread of weaponry, pointing to China's sales of military hardware to Iran and Pakistan, and Russian companies' sales of missile technology to Iran. The C.I.A. had estimated in 1996 that Iran could have medium-range missiles capable of hitting Saudi Arabia or Israel within a decade; he said today than Iran would have such missiles "much sooner."
Whether Iran would ever use those missiles is another question. The C.I.A. sees "a genuine struggle" between moderates and fundamentalists in Iran that, if resolved in the moderates' favor, "could lead to a less confrontational stance toward the United States," Mr. Tenet said.
The C.I.A. sees "hopeful signs" in its old cold-war adversary, the former Soviet Union. "Moscow cooperates with the United States and the West in ways that were unimaginable during Soviet times," Mr. Tenet said. But the fact that Russia has 6,000 nuclear warheads capable of reaching the United States remains "a major preoccupation for U.S. intelligence."
Addressing Iraq and its intentions, Mr. Tenet chose tough, confident words. He called President Hussein "a desperate man in terrible shape," whose military forces are deteriorating even as he tries to hide his biological and chemical arsenal from the world's view.
"I wouldn't want to play his deck of cards," Mr. Tenet said. "We have this man in a box, and he's going to stay in a box."
General Hughes concurred. "Iraq's military capability continues to erode," he said. "Saddam's forces have significant weaknesses -- in leadership, morale, readiness, logistics and training -- that would limit their effectiveness in combat."
Going down the list of the nation's potential enemies, the general said Russia is no more likely to attack the United States than America's allies in Europe and Asia; Iran is "likely to seek better relations" with Washington; and "North Korea's overall military readiness continues to erode." He did not even mention the possibility of an attack from China.
"The global threats facing the United States are diminished in magnitude," he concluded.
Few of the potential threats to peace mentioned by the witnesses -- poverty, pollution, disease, hunger, political disenfranchisement, drug trafficking, cultural struggles, and shortages of fresh water and arable land -- fit on a military target list.
Yet, all "bring great stress to the international order," General Hughes testified, and added, "No condition, circumstance or power is likely to emerge over the next 10 to 20 years which will somehow transcend them and lead to a more stable global order."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasury Prices Mixed as Greenspan's Testimony Is Awaited

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday, getting a lift from the Commerce Department's report of a drop in orders for durable goods last month, but hurt by several other factors.
The Treasury's auction of a new five-year note met weak demand, and investors were hesitant to make big moves before Senate testimony today by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. 
 The 30-year bond slipped 2/32, to a price of 102 20/32, while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, inched higher, to 5.94 percent, from 5.93 percent on Tuesday.
Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of the fixed-income securities department at J. W. Charles Securities Inc. in Boca Raton, Fla., said demand at auction was tepid at best. The bid-to-cover ratio, which compares the total bids with the amount of securities being sold, was 2.03 to 1, down from 2.63 at the last auction, he said. Over the last 12 auctions, the ratio has averaged 2.64 to 1, according to Standard & Poor's MMS. The high yield at auction was 5.558 percent, above forecast and down from last month's 5.685 percent.
Today the Treasury plans to sell $12 billion of a new one-year bill -- in addition to the $26 billion of securities with two- and five-year maturities that have been auctioned this week. The amount of that new supply may have weighed on the market in trading yesterday. Yields often drop in trading leading up to an auction as dealers try to drive down prices to make the securities more attractive. But Mr. Pugliese said that even after the auction yesterday, yields continued to rise, to the point that buyers appeared. "When people perceive they can get value for their money, they'll buy," he said.
Today Mr. Greenspan will address the Senate Banking Committee. Mr. Pugliese said that the Fed chairman, whose words are always closely watched by the markets, would have to sort through a particularly difficult set of economic indicators. On the one hand, for example, there is the Asian crisis, and on the other, a report earlier this week of rising labor costs in the United States. Mr. Greenspan will be joined by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin in testimony on the Asian crisis. Investors expecting the Asian crisis to slow the economy got ammunition for their view yesterday in the report that durable goods orders fell by 6.1 percent in December. Still, investors said the reason the market did not rise further on the report was that much of the decline in orders came in the volatile aircraft category.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new five-year notes:

HEADLINE: UAL's Profit Surged by 57% in 4th Quarter, Topping Expectations

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 28

 BODY:
The UAL Corporation said today that net income rose 57 percent in the fourth quarter, exceeding analysts' expectations, as the airline operator benefited from heavy passenger traffic, strong fares and lower fuel prices.
The company, the parent of United Airlines, the nation's largest airline, posted net income of $222 million, or $1.67 a fully distributed share, up from $141 million, or 84 cents, in the comparable period a year earlier. Before extraordinary items and preferred stock transactions, earnings in the latest period amounted to $1.74 a fully distributed share, up from $1.06. 
 Analysts had expected UAL to earn only $1.61 a fully distributed share. The company said on Dec. 15 that earnings would meet or exceed the estimate at that time -- $1.58 a share -- because the strong passenger demand and lower fuel prices more than compensated for lackluster revenue growth in Asia.
The Dec. 15 announcement caused UAL stock to jump 6.4 percent that day. On the New York Stock Exchange today, the shares rose $1.6875, to $88.25.
Operating revenue rose 6.5 percent in the fourth quarter, to $4.24 billion from $3.97 billion.
Other major airlines have also reported profit increases in recent days, citing the same factors as UAL.
UAL said the Asian economic crisis, which had reduced demand for air travel in the region, had little effect on the airline. The company said it "anticipates solid performance" in the first quarter that should meet analysts' expectations.
Glenn Engel, a Goldman, Sachs analyst, said, "They're still comfortable, so that's good news." UAL is expected to earn $1.61 a share in the current quarter.
The company says that fully distributed earnings are the best way to assess its profit because UAL is majority-owned by its employees. The fully distributed basis excludes all employee stock compensation and assumes that all shares owed to employees are distributed to them.

HEADLINE: U.S. Planning To Extend Tax Credit For Research

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 28

 BODY:
In a move certain to be greeted enthusiastically by Silicon Valley technology companies, Vice President Al Gore will announce here on Thursday plans to extend a $2.2 billion research-and-development corporate tax credit for one year.
The plans will be announced in a speech at the Genentech Corporation, a biotechnology company, said Clinton Administration officials, who spoke on the condition that they not be identified. In his speech, Mr. Gore will also outline details of a new program to finance and promote science that was announced by President Clinton on Tuesday in his State of the Union Message. 
 The tax credit was first enacted in 1981 to create an incentive for companies to increase their research and development work in the United States. It was originally intended to expire at the end of 1985, but has been extended eight times since then. It was allowed to lapse in 1995, but was revived for 1996 and 1997. Last year the tax credit was estimated to cost the Treasury about $1.7 billion.
The Clinton Administration will emphasize that the tax credit encourages corporate spending, leading to a significant increase in high-skilled well-paying jobs that define the "new economy."
"This is our way of saying, 'This is where the economy is heading in the future,' " an Administration official said.
Under current regulations, companies can claim a 20 percent tax credit for expenditures above a certain amount for research and development. A similar 20 percent credit can also be gained for university-financed research.
While economists have said that the effects of the tax credit have been diminished because the yearly extensions have made it difficult for companies to plan, studies have shown that the credit does have a significant effect on the economy.
"You wouldn't have a Silicon Valley unless you have significant research and development spending," said Douglas Henton, president of Collaborative Economics, an economics consulting firm in Palo Alto, Calif.
A 1994 study by the accounting firm of KPMG Peat Marwick found that from 1970 to 1994, direct Government financing of research and development declined to 36 percent from 57 percent of overall spending for that purpose in the nation, while at the same time spending by private industry increased to 60 percent.
In his speech on Thursday, Mr. Gore will also sketch out details of the 21st Century Research Fund mentioned by Mr. Clinton on Tuesday. The fund, Mr. Clinton said, will constitute the largest financing increase in the history of the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and the National Cancer Institute.
For example, the Administration hopes to provide a 10 percent increase in money for the National Science Foundation and an 11 percent increase for the Department of Energy in 1999. At the Department of Commerce, the financing of the Advanced Technology Program, intended to seed specific high technology programs, is planned to rise to almost $400 million in 2003 from $182 million in 1998, Administration officials said.
At the National Science Foundation the increased money will help finance a new cross-disciplinary program to be called the Knowledge and Distributed Intelligence Foundation. The program has been a priority for the Vice President, who has mentioned the idea before in speeches. It would enable the National Science Foundation to push into computer science research areas that have traditionally been pursued by artificial intelligence researchers.
New priorities will include developing technologies that automatically extract knowledge from seas of raw data that are being created by the emergence of the World Wide Web. Other areas will include new tools for managing complex systems and techniques that will permit researchers to search for information in fields other than the ones in which they specialize.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Moves Quickly to Defend Budget Before It Comes Out

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani moved swiftly yesterday to head off criticism of his new budget even before formally releasing it, defending his plan to channel most of an expected $1.2 billion surplus in the current fiscal year toward closing projected shortfalls in the next two years.
Mr. Giuliani dismissed suggestions from some independent budget experts that it might be more prudent for New York City to use the surplus to reduce its outstanding debt, which in relative terms is higher than that of most other major cities. Calling that advice "totally irresponsible," he said that if he followed it, he might have to make deep spending cuts and scale back tax cuts in an effort to patch the projected gaps in the next two years. 
 "We've got to first reduce those gaps before you start worrying about reducing debt four and five and six years from now," he said.
Mr. Giuliani made his comments in an unusual briefing a day before the official announcement of his preliminary budget for the 1999 fiscal year, which begins on July 1. He declined to give many details on the budget, but his aides said he called reporters to his office because he wanted to discredit the views of independent budget experts who believe that the city should use the surplus to reduce its long-term debt.
The Mayor trained most of his fire on the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonpartisan watchdog group that has often drawn his anger. Raymond D. Horton, the commission's president, said on Tuesday that Mr. Giuliani should consider using at least some of the surplus for cutting the long-term debt. Most of the surplus stems from increased tax revenues that the city has reaped from the boom on Wall Street.
In the budget that he is to present today, the Mayor is expected to propose that the city reserve 70 to 75 percent of the surplus in a so-called rainy-day fund that could then be allocated to reduce the expected budget gaps in the 1999 and 2000 fiscal years. About 20 percent would go to new programs, and the rest would be used to make up for revenue lost to new tax cuts. None of the money would go toward lowering outstanding debt.
While Mr. Horton raised questions about those choices, he and some other independent budget experts praised the Mayor for not spending most of the surplus on so-called recurring items -- programs and tax cuts that the city would then have to continue paying for each year. If he had done so, then the city might have had trouble financing them in the future if the economy sags.
Those budget experts, including analysts at Wall Street firms that rate the city's bonds, also noted that Mr. Giuliani was proposing that the city spend more of its surplus on deficit reduction than it did last year, when it also had a surplus. Last year, the Mayor and the City Council adopted a budget that allocated the majority of the surplus for new programs and tax cuts. The Mayor also opposed any plans last year to reduce the city's long-term debt.
Todd Whitestone, a managing director at Standard & Poor's, the Wall Street firm, said Mr. Giuliani's plan and any competing proposals to reduce the city's long-term debt both appeared to be appropriate ways for allocating the surplus. He said he understood why Mr. Giuliani favored putting the money toward cutting the projected short-term shortfalls.
"They do have a near-term issue with 1999 and 2000," Mr. Whitestone said, "and I think they quite correctly want to deal with that and put themselves in the best possible position for the future."

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT UNDER FIRE: IN THE POLLS;
Confidence Grows in Clinton's Ability to Remain Effective

BYLINE: By MARJORIE CONNELLY 

 BODY:
The State of the Union address appears to have bolstered the American public's view that President Clinton can continue to govern effectively and accomplish policy goals, but the public remains divided on the issues surrounding accusations of an affair with Monica S. Lewinsky, according to several polls conducted immediately after the President's speech.
Support for the job Mr. Clinton is doing increased in a poll conducted by CBS News. But Presidential job ratings tend to receive a bounce in polls taken immediately after a State of the Union address. 
 The polls also found Mr. Clinton's morals and honesty to be viewed more positively. For example, the Gallup Organization conducted polls before and after the speech with the same group of people. Before Mr. Clinton's address, only 35 percent said he set a good moral example for the nation, and 61 percent said he did not. After the speech, opinion was more evenly divided: 49 percent said the President set a good moral example and 47 percent said he set a poor one.
These findings and other survey results need to be viewed in the context of limits of these types of polls, which are typically quick and taken minutes after a specific event. For example, only the opinions of people who are home during a short period of time are measured.
CBS News asked whether assertions of infidelity and obstruction of justice would interfere with Mr. Clinton's ability to do his job effectively. On Monday night, 51 percent said those accusations would interfere with his ability to govern effectively; 46 percent said they would not interfere. But after the speech that impression changed as well: 41 percent said he would be impeded, while 58 percent said he would not.
But there appears to be no real change in the public's view of whether there is any truth in the accusations that Mr. Clinton had an affair with the 21-year-old intern. In NBC polls both before and after the speech, nearly 40 percent said they thought Mr. Clinton did have an affair with Ms. Lewinsky. About 30 percent continued to say that the accusations were untrue. The rest offered no opinion.
NBC and ABC each polled random samples of adults by telephone immediately after the speech, finding that about 6 in 10 had watched the speech. The NBC poll includes the views of 405 adults and the ABC poll is based on 528 adults. Gallup called back 488 adults who had previously been polled, and re-interviewed the 400 who had watched the speech. CBS News recruited a sample of the public to watch the speech, and 843 participants called an 800 number to respond to questions after the speech.
The margin of sampling error for all of the nationwide polls was plus or minus 4 or 5 percentage points. In addition, polls conducted entirely in one night introduce additional error.

HEADLINE: Hispanic Workers Revitalize a Town

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN 

DATELINE: DODGE CITY, Kan.

 BODY:
Like a swaggering cowboy coming in off the trail of old, Dodge City is flush these days. Its economy, if not booming, is at least "hitting on all cylinders," in the words of one business leader, and the muscle is being supplied largely by men and women from Mexico and Central America.
For more than a decade, the immigrants have been pouring onto the High Plains to work in the meatpacking plants here, drawn by the lure of stable jobs at union wages with full benefits and the chance to buy a home and join the middle class. Some come wearing cowboy hats and driving pickup trucks with Mexican license plates. Others are veterans of the insecure life of migrant farm work farther west. 
 Still others are fleeing what they see as the increasingly unwelcoming atmosphere of Southern California, or they have left lower-wage jobs in Texas. They are taking jobs that civic and business leaders say local young people shun as they leave for opportunities in larger cities.
"The story here and across this part of the country is that we've quit producing an adequate number of workers to do the jobs traditionally done in various communities," said John C. Campbell, president of the Dodge City Area Chamber of Commerce.
"Dodge City is engaged in the important business of feeding the population," Mr. Campbell said, "but without enough workers. In this country, we've made it socially unacceptable for our own young people to do anything except the white-collar-and-tie kind of job. So Hispanic workers are doing those jobs -- in the slaughter houses -- for average wages of $22,000 a year, which makes them middle income in Dodge City."
Hispanic workers constitute about 75 percent of the work force at Dodge City's two largest meatpackers, those of the Excel Corporation, part of Cargill Foods, with about 2,500 workers, and the National Beef Company, part of Farmland Industries Inc., with 1,300 to 1,400 workers. Similar estimates are made for the work forces of meatpacking plants at Garden City, Kan., 50 miles to the northwest, and Liberal, Kan., 75 miles to the southwest.
The trend is being repeated in many other low-population counties across the Midwest, the South and the Plains States, especially in communities with meat- or chicken-processing plants and low unemployment.
The Center for Immigration Studies, in Washington, said in a report last year, "Counties where immigration's impact is rated as 'intense' or 'hot' are found not only in California, Texas, Florida and New York, but also in Iowa, Georgia, Kansas and Idaho."
In addition, the spreading impact of immigration is thought to be understated in the report because it was based on data from the 1990 Census. In Dodge City's case, most of the immigrant influx has occurred since 1990.
The changing makeup of Dodge City resonates throughout the community, nowhere more so than in the public schools, which are struggling to deal with explosive growth and change in the student body. In Unified School District 443, which serves Dodge City, Hispanic students make up 42.7 percent of the 5,115 total. In the lower grades, they account for 52 percent to 54 percent of the pupils.
The population of Dodge City is estimated to be up 18 percent to 20 percent from the 1990 census figure of 21,000, and civic leaders say all of the increase, and more, can be attributed to the Hispanic arrivals. Without them, they say, the population would be declining.
More than half the home purchases last year were by Hispanic buyers. Some churches have become bilingual, with Hispanic members making up about half the congregations. Banks and stores are looking for bilingual employees.
The Dodge City Daily Globe publishes a tabloid weekly in Spanish. The School Superintendent, Sharol Little, is studying Spanish. So are the officers and staff members of the Ford County Sheriff's Office, a successor to law-enforcement operation once run by the fictional Marshal Matt Dillon and the real-life Bat Masterson and Wyatt Earp. About half the people in the county jail, which holds 72, are usually Hispanic detainees, said the Under Sheriff, Bryan Burgess.
Dodge City was founded in 1872, first serving as a center for the buying of buffalo hides and later as a trailhead for cattle driven up from Texas and then sent east on the Santa Fe Railroad, which still slices through the center of town.
Although a handful of Hispanic families have been here since their ancestors came as railroad workers, most of the longtime inhabitants of Dodge City are descendants of northern Europeans, some of whom made their way west along the Santa Fe Trail long ago.
 "We have two cultures that are diverse, but they're merging," said Jeffrey Hiers, an insurance man and chairman of the Chamber of Commerce. "If we said it was easy, we'd be lying, but we've not seen any big racial incidents, not like what I saw growing up in Atlanta in the 60's."
Israel Padilla, a native of the Mexican state of Chihuahua who married a Kansan, said he got along with both cultures in Dodge City and dismissed the problems as mostly small things. Mr. Padilla said, for example, there were complaints of rowdiness involving Hispanic residents.
"Spanish-speaking people like to express themselves, outside as well as inside," he said, "so noise is a problem for some people. But I always think that if you know the language you can get along with anyone."
Mr. Padilla, 32, is the youngest of nine children in a family split between Kansas and Chihuahua. He arrived as a high school junior, cared for by an older sister who found work in the meat plants. Struggling to learn English, Mr. Padilla finished high school, then went to St. Mary of the Plains College in Dodge City on a soccer scholarship and earned a degree in physical education. Along the way, he, too, went to work for Excel, where he remains today while looking for a job that will make use of his college degree.
As Mr. Padilla talked, another sign of the cultural divide showed when two of his brothers and two teen-age nephews walked in the front door of his home -- unannounced.
"They never call first," said Mr. Padilla's wife, Rebecca, who grew up in Wichita and met her husband in college.
One of the brothers, 36-year-old Jesus, sat down and talked about his work at the National Beef plant, pulling out a pay stub showing that, in a week with extra holiday pay, he earned $583 and cleared $443. A good job is all that keeps him in Dodge City, he said.
"I never wanted to come to the United States," he said. "I began to work in California years ago, then I returned to Chihuahua. But I couldn't find a good job, and my mother kept telling me to leave, that she didn't want me lying around the house being lazy."
By contrast, Horacio Padilla, 39, newly arrived from Texas, seemed thrilled that he had already been hired by National Beef, despite a shriveled left arm.
A question that seems to arise very infrequently is whether all of the immigrants are in this country legally. The Immigration and Naturalization Service has occasionally raided meatpacking plants in western Kansas and elsewhere on the High Plains, but civic leaders say the immigration service is spread so thin that its agents seldom get west of Wichita.
"We have no interest in hiring illegals," said Jim Maher, the human resource manager of Excel. "They do nothing but cause trouble because if they're caught they leave, and then we're short workers. We require all the documents the Government will allow us to request without running into conflicts with civil rights laws."
Mr. Maher said that "word of mouth" was his main recruitment tool, with workers here telling relatives in Mexico about the benefits and the wage scale, which starts at $8.64 an hour and goes to $12. Despite that, he said, the turnover at the plant is about 50 percent a year, with many people working a few months, then returning to Mexico, often to return here a year or so later.
The turnover in the beef plants is one reason school administrators and teachers face stiff challenges in educating some of the immigrants' children, as they are regularly withdrawn from school to return to Mexico. While maintaining instruction in English, the school system has hired a few bilingual teachers and more than 30 bilingual teachers' aides to provide individual help to new students with limited English.
School officials say about 20 percent of the Hispanic students arrive with virtually no knowledge of English. This year, a newcomers' class was initiated for those in grades three through six. It includes a six-week course in basic English, and then, with an assigned "buddy" to accompany them, the new students start regular class.
"When they come, they are intimidated by the United States," said Veronica Williams, the bilingual teacher of the newcomers' class. "We try to teach them self-esteem and build on the skills they have."
After more than 30 years without new schools, the school district opened three new elementary schools in 1995 and plans a vote this spring on a proposed $45.5 million bond issue to build a new high school and convert the old one into middle school classrooms. But administrators expect to be using portable classrooms before it is ready.
Even though most of the new Hispanic residents are not eligible to vote, school leaders expect the bond issue to pass easily, reflecting the expansive and optimistic mood that seems to pervade Dodge City. Last June, voters overwhelmingly approved an additional 1 cent sales tax to finance public works, including a special-events center.
All this adds up to an estimated $150 million in nonresidential construction, expected to begin within a year.
"And meatpacking is paying the bill," said Mr. Campbell of the Chamber of Commerce. "Does it smell? Yes. So do paper mills. And our air is cleaner than in Los Angeles."

HEADLINE: On the Record, Arab Leaders Oppose U.S. Attacks on Iraq

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Jan. 28

 BODY:
As the United States intensifies its threat to use military force against Iraq, Arab leaders are once again voicing strong public opposition to that course. But some officials are reportedly hinting in private that they would not be altogether dismayed if the United States did carry out military attacks.
In public, officials led by President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt are warning as they have for months that military strikes would compound the misery of the Iraqi people, who have suffered enough through more than seven years of economic sanctions. 
 Foreign Minister Amr Moussa of Egypt, whose country was a crucial ally of the United States during the Persian Gulf war in 1991, declared this week: "A military settlement cannot be considered a solution. It would be another problem."
And Esmat Abdel-Meguid, the Secretary General of the 21-member Arab League, said on Monday: "The principle of using force is downright rejected. Such a military strike would only add to the suffering of the Iraqi people."
But such statements have sounded less vociferous than those made as recently as November, when the latest crisis between the United Nations and Iraq began. And among strong American allies like Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, diplomats and officials there say, there appears to be growing resignation that the crisis must be resolved, even if that means the use of military force.
Diplomats in the Persian Gulf region say some officials there have told them in confidence that they would support military strikes at the weapons installations that give Iraq the ability to threaten its neighbors.
The apparent contradiction between those public and private views tells much about Arab sentiment about Iraq seven years after the gulf war. Concern about the plight of the Iraqi people has grown so deep across the Arab world that virtually no Arab leader is ready to publicly counsel military action.
At the same time, there remains no love lost for the Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, who is reviled by his fellow Arab leaders. When promised anonymity, some Arab officials in the Persian Gulf have counseled the United States against the pinprick strategy adopted by American military planners in the past, which they say has only enhanced the Iraqi leader's popularity with his people.
Instead, they have argued, the United States should wage a sustained bombing campaign to destroy Iraq's capacity to produce weapons of mass destruction and undermine President Hussein's power.
Such thinking may be reflected in the private meetings that Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright is likely to hold with Arab leaders if she proceeds, as is now expected, from meetings in Europe beginning on Thursday on to Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf countries.
"I cannot imagine any Arab state joining in or publicly endorsing any renewed attacks, and I would expect the criticism from many quarters to be vehement," said one gulf official. "At the same time, Saddam remains a headache for us all, and I think some of us would applaud privately if the United States can find a way to make him feel some pain.'
Still, the Arab news media and diplomats have voiced considerable skepticism in recent days about what may be behind the new show of American muscle-flexing.
A front-page editorial in the Egyptian Government daily Al Jumuriya addressed to Mr. Clinton warned on Tuesday: "Killing more Iraqis who are besieged and exhausted will not take you out of your problem. Your salvation remains in your ability to resist blackmail."
Some prominent Egyptians have argued that United States officials and Western diplomats are deliberately exaggerating the possibility that any military strike might receive private support.
Raouf el-Reedy, a former Egyptian Ambassador to the United States, said in an interview today: "This is a common line in American foreign policy. They always talk about private talk from some Arab countries. They need to show that they still have allies in the region."
And even as the Clinton Administration is trying to refocus attention on its months-long standoff with Iraq, Arab leaders say they are determined to maintain a focus on what they regard as an increasingly dangerous stalemate in peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.
After a meeting this week with Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, Egypt signaled that it might soon throw its support behind a Palestinian proposal for an Arab summit conference.
Mr. Moussa of Egypt said after the session that it was "a bit early" to set a time and place. But he described the convening of such a session as "a probability," which appeared to reflect the depth of Arab dismay over what has been perceived as the lack of progress last week in President Clinton's meetings with Mr. Arafat and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.
Since leaving Washington last week, Mr. Arafat has paid visits to Mauritania, Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia in a bid to rally support for an Arab summit meeting.
If such a meeting is held, it could serve as a forum for Arab countries to express opposition to the prospect of new American attacks on Iraq.
But the force of such statements could be dulled if Ms. Albright and other American officials who are expected to tour the region in the days ahead receive assurances in private that such attacks, while not preferable, would not lead to a rupture in relations between the United States and the Arab world.

HEADLINE: Israel Sketches Out an Overall Drop in U.S. Aid Over 10 Years

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
Israel's Finance Minister met with Administration and Congressional officials today to outline a proposal by the Israeli Government to phase out $1.2 billion in annual economic aid from the United States in exchange for a $600 million increase in Washington's yearly military aid package.
The proposal by Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman met with a cautious reception at the State Department and on Capitol Hill, with some officials questioning why the United States should increase its military assistance to Israel at a time when the Israeli Government is supposed to be committed to peace negotiations with its neighbors. 
 Mr. Neeman's mission to Washington this week grew out of a pledge made by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during an address to Congress two years ago to reduce Israel's dependence on American aid. Israel has repeatedly been reminded of that pledge as Congress has slashed billions of dollars from the foreign aid budget.
In a statement, Mr. Neeman said that the Israeli proposal to reduce the size of the overall American aid package, while increasing military aid, was "a bold step on the road to economic independence" that also recognized "Israel's ever-growing security needs."
Under the proposal, the current $1.2 billion annual economic aid package would be ended entirely over the next 10 to 12 years, while American military aid to Israel would be increased to $2.4 billion a year, from the current level of $1.8 billion.
Gadi Baltiansky, a spokesman for the Israel Embassy, said the increase in military aid was necessary because "we are not in a peace process with Iran or Iraq -- they are threatening to launch missiles at us and calling for our destruction."
While Congressional officials said they would welcome an effort by Israel to reduce its economic dependence on the United States, they were still concerned about the long time frame suggested by the Israelis for the phasing out of the economic aid, and by an Israeli request to spend more of the military aid in Israel.
Under the current aid package, Israel is limited to spending no more than 25 percent of the American military aid in Israel; most of the rest of the money is spent on weapons and other products from American contractors. In their meetings this week, Israeli officials asked that they be allowed to spend more of the military aid -- possibly most of it -- at home.
"I think members are impressed, definitely, that the Government of Israel has come forward with a proposal for a meaningful reduction in assistance," said a Congressional official who was involved with the talks and insisted that he not be identified. "But 10 to 12 years is a long time. I think we would definitely want the time frame to be shorter." And he said the Israeli request to spend more of the military aid in Israel "is problematic -- a lot of members of Congress would have a hard time justifying that."
Another Congressional official said that any increase in the military aid budget for Israel should be reviewed closely. "I guess the question is, why should we be talking about spending more money on weapons at a time when we all hope the Middle East is moving towards peace," he said, insisting on anonymity.
The State Department had no comment on its aid talks and said the United States had not yet taken a position on the proposal. "We're in listening mode," said a department official.

Frozen North Doesn't Jump For Hot News

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: WATERTOWN, N.Y.

 BODY:
WITH the news on the television at Kegler's Lounge and Restaurant, the lunchtime regulars were slightly distracted from their post-Super Bowl quarterbacking. Todd LaVere, behind the bar, heard President Clinton's name and gave a little smile.
"If the President can run the country and have relations on the side," he asked, "then what's it to anybody?" 
 "Yeah," said Jerry Corbett, rocking back on his bar stool. "If the President has as many women as they say and the country's in this good a shape, I say that makes him a pretty darn good President."
"What somebody does on the side -- their morals -- that's their business," Mr. LaVere said.
"I think so too," Jerry Corbett said.
Sitting next to him, Francis Hoffman, nursing a Molson, looked a little bored. A Jefferson County transportation worker who has spent the last three weeks clearing toppled trees from roads and driveways, he was still more interested in talking about the North Country ice storm than the Washington firestorm.
"People around here really aren't talking about the President," he said. "They're impressed by the ice storm. They've been talking about it for weeks. They'll be talking about it for years. Clinton? Nah."
He, like most everyone else here, has more immediate concerns. The Great Ice Storm of 1998 may have been knocked off the front pages of the local papers by the allegations that the President had sex with a former White House intern. But Watertown (pop.: 29,900) could be Paris in terms of its take on the scandal. Not that people don't care about what is happening in the capital; they do. But the sex scandal doesn't seem to have earth-shattering implications in this Republican stronghold, no matter what the talking heads on the news say.
The President of the United States might be relieved to know that not everyone is riveted to his political crisis. In a place that is dealing with its own catastrophe, his rates a distant second. Time and again, people interviewed here on the streets and in the mall said there was too much to do at home to worry about sorting out the ever-changing salacious details in the news.
"I don't really see why this story is as big as the media is making it out to be," Mr. Corbett said. "It's not Watergate." Mr. Corbett, a state transportation worker, has been working overtime clearing trees and assisting emergency situations. His own house on the outskirts of the city was without power for two weeks, but he considers himself lucky. "There are still some people in Alex Bay without power," he said.
THE ice storm, which knocked down power lines in six vast upstate counties, caused the Black River, which runs through Watertown, to overflow at more than 16 feet above flood level, a record. It continues to disrupt routines three weeks later. Businesses have yet to reach full speed, schools must rejigger exam and vacation schedules, and buildings are still flooded.
Few people would say they were left unscarred by the disaster, even those who lost power for only a few days. "I have a tree sitting on my roof," Mr. LaVere said nonchalantly, as if it belonged there. "The biggest problem for me is the loss of business. We were open, but people were busy coping with the storm."
About 150 city trees, mostly maples, are marked for euthanasia. That doesn't include the trees in backyards and front yards that must be cut. All day, every day, dump trucks and front-end loaders inch their way through town, picking up debris. And all day, every day, people are in and out of the old Woolworth building, which has become a one-stop emergency disaster center housing the Red Cross and other relief organizations.
Not to mention there are uncalculated millions in lost wages and business and in damage to assess in a city that was struggling economically before the storm.
Clinton? Nah. "Right now, people are still in recovery mode," said Mary Corriveau, the assistant city manager, when asked about the White House scandal. "There's always the talk when you're sitting around at lunch. But the major focus is on getting things back in order."
And ice storm or not, some people think the White House crisis does not merit their close attention. "I'm tired of trying to sort out the gossip," said Cara Weiss. She was buying The Watertown Times at Stewart's convenience store -- to catch up on storm-related developments.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Solid Earnings Drive Dow Up In Busy Session

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The stock market erased the vestiges of an early-year decline yesterday, surging for the second consecutive day after a broad array of big-name companies reported solid quarterly earnings.
The profit reports overshadowed resilient anxiety over Asia's economic crisis that has hurt stocks for much of January and sent investors shopping for a wide variety of stocks on what turned out to be one of the heaviest trading sessions ever. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average soared 100.39 points, or 1.28 percent, to close at 7,915.47.
It was the highest close since Jan. 5 and marked the first time since August that the Dow had gained 100 or more points on consecutive days.
Broader indexes also rallied, with health care, technology and transportation stocks in heavy demand. The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index rose 8.44 points, or nearly nine-tenths of 1 percent, to 977.46, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index gained about 2 percent.
"This was a very, very impressive showing," said Hildegard Zagorski, a market strategist at Prudential Securities. "Corporate profits were good, the economy remains strong and events in Asia have calmed down a little bit."
Strong profit results from Coca-Cola, Philip Morris and United Airlines helped set the tone early yesterday. Technology stocks surged after the Oracle Corporation, which had been struggling, said it expects to post solid earnings in its fiscal third quarter.
Few sectors were left out of yesterday's rally. The Dow Jones transportation index gained 2.7 percent and big technology stocks, as listed in the Morgan Stanley high tech index, gained 3.6 percent.
"Health care and technology stocks were screaming today," said Philip J. Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management. "And transportation stocks also took off. That's partly because jet fuel is getting cheaper."
Although the stock market had been weathering a difficult January -- one plagued by a political fiasco at home and fears of a spreading economic crisis in Asia -- stock prices have held up relatively well. Wall Street strategists say that is an indication investors continue to send money into the market.
Profit expectations have been trimmed back for 1998, largely because of a slowdown in Asia, but investors may be recognizing that the American economy remains healthy and inflation seems to be a diminishing threat.
Those points were emphasized Tuesday night in President Clinton's State of the Union address, and some analysts believe the speech helped lift investor confidence. The possibility that the crisis at the White House may be subsiding may also be lifting investor spirits, they said.
"President Clinton underscored all the positives last night," said Robert H. Stovall, president of Stovall 21st Advisers in New York. "So I think the market decided that bedrock basics are still very positive."
Among those basics are a strong domestic economy, what Abby Joseph Cohen -- the widely followed market strategist at Goldman, Sachs & Company -- calls the "supertanker" economy because of its relentless course of growth, job creation and improved corporate profits.
Although fears remain about the impact of the crisis in Asia, many analysts continue to look to health care and technology stocks -- sectors that have proved to be the backbone of the stock market for more than a year.
Yesterday was no exception. Technology stocks had been underperforming the broader market since mid-October. But the last few days they have been gaining, led by the largest companies.
Intel and Microsoft -- the twin towers of the technology industry -- soared again yesterday. This year, shares of each of those companies are already up more than 15 percent. With yesterday's gain, Microsoft is now valued at $180 billion, more than the Big Three in the auto industry -- Ford, General Motors and Chrysler -- combined.
Even though corporate profit growth will slow in 1998, several Wall Street strategists said the market might have already factored in a slowdown. Since June, for instance, the Dow has been in what some Wall Street analysts call a "trading range," bouncing up and down between 7,500 and 8,200.
The Dow closed 1997 at 7,908.25. Coming into this week, it looked like the blue-chip average would post a loss in January for the first time since 1990, when the index fell nearly 6 percent.
But yesterday, the Dow crept above its 1997 close, and although there's almost no chance it will match the 5 percent gains recorded in the first month of the last two years, a positive return at the beginning of the year could help lift investor confidence.
"If we end up with a positive January, that could improve their psychology," Mr. Stovall said.
That was the attitude yesterday. At least for a day, it seemed, Wall Street strategists believed that investors wanted to view the stock market glass as half full.
Financial reports that usually spell trouble for the market were largely ignored. The price of oil and gold are rising and there is Government evidence that wage pressures are rising sharply in the United States -- all dour signs for corporate America -- and yet the stock market gained.
Heavy inflows into mutual funds may be partly responsible for the gains, analysts said, noting that trading volume has been soaring this month.
Yesterday, more than 706 million shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the fifth-highest volume session of all time. And more than 25 million shares of Oracle traded hands on the Nasdaq market.
"There's substantial money flowing into equities," Mr. Stovall said. "We're seeing a little resumption of the bull market that had pulled back."

G.O.P. Opens Attack on the President's New Spending Plans

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
Republican Congressional leaders today began a battle against President Clinton's new agenda, saying his spending proposals would revive the era of big government that he so dramatically declared dead just two years ago.
Presenting a joint front the day after Mr. Clinton's State of the Union address, the chairmen of the House and Senate budget committees said they estimated that his expansive proposals would amount to as much as $50 billion in new spending and break the balanced-budget agreement struck just last year. 
 "That means we would have a bigger Federal Government," said Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, the chairman of the House Budget Committee. "I thought we had convinced the President and the President had made up his mind that he was committed to a smaller Federal Government."
The Republican complaints signaled the resumption of an intense ideological struggle over the size of government, a battle that had abated briefly once the President and Congress reached across party lines to arrive at the landmark agreement to balance the budget.
The Democrats do not want to be labeled as big spenders once more. But they believe that the particular health care, education and environmental initiatives that the President outlined in his speech, and will offer in more detail in his budget, will prove more popular in an election year than will Republican proposals for tax cuts.
"The Republicans have said, 'Let government stay out of the lives of people,' " said Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee. " 'If they're sick, if they're old, if they're uneducated, if they have no place to live, let the private sector handle it. Just give them a tax cut.' "
White House officials said the President's budget proposal, to be issued next week, would not jeopardize the balanced-budget agreement, because offsetting savings would pay for any new programs.
"We certainly acknowledge that we have new initiatives in child care, health care, education and the environment," said Gene Sperling, Mr. Clinton's chief economic adviser. "But we are paying for them with specific offsets that keep discipline and should keep us on a path to an early balanced budget."
The chief way the President plans to pay for his new proposals, while at the same time preserving a budget surplus that he would dedicate to shoring up Social Security, is to use billions of dollars from proposed tobacco settlement legislation.
But it is far from certain that Mr. Clinton will ever get that legislation out of Congress, particularly if he is considered too weakened by scandal to fight for it. Several Republican leaders have already expressed doubts about the proposal.
Further complicating the issue, Speaker Newt Gingrich suggested in an interview that any money from the tobacco industry could be used to support Mr. Clinton's call to bolster Social Security and also leave room for Republican tax cuts.
"What if we skip all of his new spending programs?" Mr. Gingrich said.
Republicans spent most of January letting Mr. Clinton get his agenda out and dominate the news. But the sex scandal gives them hope that if they move fast, they can take the initiative away from him. Mr. Kasich and Senator Pete V. Domenici, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said they hoped to produce a joint budget plan for the 1999 fiscal year by March, which would be unusually early.
But the Republicans have their share of internal disputes to resolve, as the prospect of surpluses whets appetites. Republicans are pushing several competing tax-cut plans, and the party also has its share of spenders.
One faction of Republicans wants to see an increase in spending on highway programs. Aware of the potential to break the budget agreement, the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, said today that such a bill, which had been expected to be one of the first matters before the Senate in the new session, would most likely be delayed until spring.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT UNDER FIRE;
Many Turn Deaf Ear to Scandal

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: CHAMPAIGN, Ill., Jan. 28

 BODY:
Jack McHale, 80, does not believe it. Arvin Gee, 24, does not want to hear about it. And Tanya Lieb, 42, does not care.
"I'm sick of hearing about this scandal," said Ms. Lieb, a beautician in the town of Monticello, Ill., who joined a crowd of about 13,000 people in a thunderous welcome for President Clinton here today. "What he does in his personal life, that's his business." 
 Some people said they might reconsider a defense of the President if he engaged in a cover-up. But from what they have heard so far, most people who showed up today for the warm-as-toast reception for Mr. Clinton at the University of Illinois here said they wanted to put the scandal to rest.
Indeed, the largest group of protesters today denounced the news media for focusing on accusations that Mr. Clinton had sexual relations with a young White House intern. One protester held a sign that said, "Kill the Overkill." Another placard demanded, "News, Not Views!
To be sure, there were some people who said adultery alone would prove a man unfit to lead the country.
"He has not provided moral leadership," said Brian Rummery, 31, an associate pastor at Windsor Road Christian Church. "And nothing he says will make me feel differently."
But most people here said private sin had little to do with public statesmanship. "I might not think of him as a good husband," said Scott Inman, a 36-year-old warehouse worker, "but I approve of him as a President."
While college students numbered heavily in the crowd, there were plenty of teachers, farmers, tradesmen and mothers with young children in tow.
Time and again, people invoked the widespread reports of former President John F. Kennedy's infidelities as evidence that sexual conduct had little to do with leadership capabilities.
"This moral stuff, that's all pretty personal," said Melvin Sims, 49, who was directing traffic at today's gathering and who said he had voted twice against Mr. Clinton. "Let's just worry about how he does his job."
And some might judge Mr. Clinton more harshly, they acknowledged, if the economy was in trouble. "As long as he's running the country and I'm working and making money," said Arthur Johnson, a 49-year-old carpenter, "he can do whatever he pleases in his spare time."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
German Bank Acts to Shield Itself on Asia

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Jan. 28

 BODY:
The Asian financial crisis reached into the heart of Europe's banking system today, when the biggest bank in Germany announced that it would set aside $777 million to cover potentially soured loans in the region.
The announcement by Deutsche Bank A.G. marked the largest amount yet set aside by a Western bank as a cushion against possible defaults. The cushion was nearly twice the size of the bank's loss provisions for all loans in 1996. 
 "It is inevitable that other banks will follow," said Piers Brown of UBS Securities in London. "The issue going forward is whether this is all they need to do."
German and French banks have been among the most aggressive lenders to South Korea and Southeast Asia, their commitments exceeded only by the Japanese. Many German banks significantly expanded their lending just before Asian financial systems began to unravel last summer.
Until now, Deutsche Bank and other big European banks have insisted that their potential Asian losses would be modest, at most. But investors became increasingly convinced that large losses lay ahead and began selling a range of French and German banking shares.
Deutsche Bank said the size of the loan-loss provision was still considered minimal and did not mean that it would sustain significant damage from Asia.
"If you're a small bank, one billion D-marks is a very big number," a spokesman, Detlev Rahmsdorf, said, "but we are a very big bank." He referred in very broad terms to a billion German marks, now about $555 million.
But the increased cushion for possible losses surprised banking analysts in its magnitude. It is meant to protect the bank from any losses on about $5 billion in loans to four of the most-troubled Asian economies -- those of South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia.
Deutsche Bank also set aside $1.4 billion to cover the costs of a further reorganization of its investment banking and commercial banking operations, which analysts said could result in thousands of job losses. Taken together, the two moves reduced 1997 operating profit by one-third.
The bank has spent billions in the last decade to try to establish itself as a leader in worldwide investment banking. It recently shuffled the leadership of the investment banking effort, and has spent huge amounts of money in New York and London, the principal centers. But it has yet to even come close to reaching its goals.
Deutsche Bank's move to protect itself from bad Asian loans partly reflected the inability of many Asian borrowers to repay debts coming due because of the weakened values of their currencies.
The big French bank Societe Generale announced last week that it would set aside $164 million to cover any Asian loan losses.
Paradoxically, the news provided the biggest boost in weeks for Deutsche Bank's stock, which jumped 8.55 marks here today, or 7.8 percent, to 118.65 marks, on heavy volume. Analysts said investors had primarily been encouraged by news of the restructuring charge, which they interpreted as a harbinger of plans to slash the bank's work force and reduce future costs.
"Markets always like news of a restructuring," said Manfred Piontke, an analyst with Bank Julius Baer here. "The bad news is out, and things can only get better."
But many other big French and German banks are expected to be affected by Asia's financial crises. Analysts estimate that Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank. Germany's second and third largest, each have more than $3 billion in loans to troubled Southeast Asian countries. And because Commerzbank is substantially smaller than the two German giants, its exposure to problem loans is more dangerous.
Mr. Brown of UBS estimated that Commerzbank loans to the most troubled Asian nations added up to 37 percent of its equity, compared with roughly 26 percent for Dresdner Bank and 27 percent for Deutsche Bank.
Indeed, rumors were rampant today that Commerzbank would announce new provisions for bad loans in the next few days. A spokesman for the bank refused to comment.
The most exposed French banks, besides Societe Generale, are Credit Lyonnais, Credit Agricole Indosuez, Banque Nationale de Paris and Banque Paribas.
Several analysts noted that Deutsche Bank's new provisions for bad loans were bigger than they had expected.
"They are larger than what we had been looking for," said Matthew Czepliewicz, who follows European banks for Salomon Smith Barney. Mr. Czepliewicz had figured that bad loans would account for less than 10 percent of the total loan portfolio, while Deutsche Bank increased its provisions by 15 percent.
Also surprised was Peter Thorne, banking analyst with Banque Paribas, who has in recent months been one of the sharpest critics of European banks' exposure to Asian loans.
"I didn't expect them to take such large provisions," Mr. Thorne said, while adding: "They are facing up to reality. They are maintaining the high ground of accounting."
Beyond problem loans, many banks may also have substantial Asia-related losses in their trading operations, including in foreign-exchange dealings and in the use of securities known as derivatives to hedge risks against currency and stock-price fluctuations.
Deutsche Bank, which has aggressively expanded its business in derivatives, has been rumored to have lost more than $100 million during the wild market swings in Asian stocks and currencies. A question among analysts was whether the loan-loss provisions announced today included a cushion for possible losses from derivatives.
Another important question lies in bank exposure in Asia beyond the countries at the center of the crisis. Lending to Hong Kong, in particular, is far higher than that to South Korea or Indonesia but is generally not considered as part of the problem. Yet Hong Kong has been under intense pressure of its own. Property prices, which underlie much of the banking system there, have plummeted, though the Hong Kong dollar has remained within a United States dollar-linked trading range.
"Hong Kong is the big wild card," Mr. Czepliewicz of Salomon Smith Barney acknowledged.
Deutsche Bank's latest restructuring seemed to reflect an effort to stick with its original goal of trying to build a world-class investment bank, even while reining in costs.
As part of the reorganization, two of its board members, Josef Ackermann and Ronaldo Schmitz, will assume responsibility for overseeing the company's corporate and investment banking. Deutsche Bank has appointed Michael Dobson, who has been chief executive of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, to head its asset management business.

HEADLINE: Pataki's Dairy Farm Plan Risks Consumers' Anger

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 28

 BODY:
The beleaguered dairy farmers of upstate New York have long demanded an increase in milk prices, warning lawmakers here that after years of rising costs and stagnant incomes, farms are going out of business at a startling rate.
But the requests have run into strong opposition from residents and lawmakers from New York City and its suburbs, who as big consumers of upstate milk would shoulder the potential burden of a price increase that critics say could run as much as 21 cents a gallon. 
 Now, with upstate farmers reeling from the effects of this month's devastating ice storm, Gov. George E. Pataki has thrust himself into the debate, saying he wants to find a way to bail out an industry that has been among his staunchest supporters. But the issue puts the Governor in a difficult political bind, since the relief the farmers are seeking would be likely to anger downstate consumers.
Milk prices are generally set by the Federal Government, under a Depression-era system intended to insure even distribution and fair pricing of the perishable product. But New York's farmers are pressing the Governor to back legislation allowing them to join a regional dairy group that is permitted under Federal rules to set higher milk prices for farmers.
Mr. Pataki's advisers are also considering less-sweeping alternatives, like specific tax cuts that would give the state's 9,000 dairy farmers some financial relief. But the farmers, who complain that milk prices are as low as a decade ago, are unlikely to be satisfied with anything short of the price increase. And the Governor will be under considerable pressure to deliver, since they represent the economic backbone of a region whose support was crucial to his victory in 1994.
But at the same time, he must weigh the concerns of people in the New York City metropolitan area who say that a price increase amounts to an unfair tax on consumers that is merely intended to transfer income from downstate to upstate. They also say that such an increase would be especially hard on poor people because they typically spend twice as much of their income on food as wealthier families.
"The Governor is in a tight spot," said Russ Haven, the legislative counsel for the New York Public Interest Research Group, a good-government organization. "Dairy farmers have united to push for a price increase. On the other hand, downstate consumers will be very unhappy if government action pushes milk prices up."
New York is the third-largest producer of dairy products in the nation, after California and Wisconsin. But the state's dairy farmers, 80 percent of whom run family farms, have been on the brink of financial ruin in recent years as their profit margins have declined sharply. Last year alone, more than 200 farms went out of business after the price of wholesale milk dropped 20 percent.
The debate in New York has largely centered on the question of whether Mr. Pataki should push legislation allowing New York to join a coalition of the six New England states, known as the New England Dairy Compact, that can set wholesale milk prices higher than the Federal pricing system permits. The Federal Government has allowed states to form such compacts as it refines its current milk pricing system amid complaints from dairy farmers nationwide.
Mr. Pataki has not taken a position on the compact, but it is being considered by a 15-member task force he created in the fall to examine the dairy issue. The task force is expected to make final recommendations as early as next week.
A bill to allow the state's farmers to join the compact is already moving through the Republican-led State Senate. The position of the Democrats who control the Assembly is less clear, but upstate Democrats, whose hold on their seats may be precarious to begin with, are likely to plead with the Speaker, Sheldon Silver, not to stand in the way of the measure.
The major lobbying group for farmers, the New York State Farm Bureau, recently took the unusual step of calling on the state to enter the dairy compact. Until then, the farmers themselves had been divided on the issue, with some saying they would fight any new form of regulation.
The fundamental problem farmers face is that the price milk processors pay them has dropped to about the same level as a decade ago: $13.95 for every 100 pounds of milk. That translates into $1.06 per gallon, compared with the roughly $2.55 that retailers charge at stores. The prices have dropped partly because of an oversupply both locally and nationally and partly because of new Federal policies intended to remove Government price supports.
If New York joined the dairy compact, dairy farmers could charge an additional $1.30 for every 100 pounds of milk, according to industry experts. That would translate into an additional 10 cents per gallon.
The dairy farmers contend that such an increase would not necessarily raise milk prices for consumers but would rather cut into the profits of companies that process milk, as well as retailers.
These middlemen generally have larger profit margins than the farmers themselves.
"If we enter into the New England Dairy Compact, farmers will get more money for the milk they produce," said Randall Sawyer, a spokesman for the New York Farm Bureau. "The people who will determine whether consumers get hurt are the milk processors and the retailers."
But critics, including consumer groups and advocates for the poor, say the compact amounts to a legal cartel that has hurt consumers in other states. In Connecticut, for example, the price of milk on store shelves went up 20 cents a gallon because the higher prices were passed on to consumers, the critics say.
The critics estimate that New York consumers could see milk prices rise by up to 21 cents a gallon if the state entered into such an agreement. And they say that consumers in the New York City metropolitan area would end up paying about $50 million of an estimated $91 million in increased milk prices each year.
"We are sympathetic to the plight of farmers," said Art Jaeger, the executive director for Public Voices for Food and Health Policy. "But we don't think the solution is raising prices for consumers."

Albright Says U.S. Is Ready To Act Alone Against Iraq
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said the United States was ready to act alone if necessary to punish Iraq for its efforts to develop chemical and biological weapons. Though Ms. Albright reiterated the warning that President Clinton delivered on Tuesday, White House and Pentagon officials sought to stamp out expectations that a strike against Iraq was imminent or inevitable. A6 

Iraq said it might ask the International Court of Justice to intervene in the standoff. The Iraqi Foreign Minister, Mohammed Said al-Sahaf, said the Clinton Administration was trying to cover up its "miserable crisis" by making Iraq a scapegoat. A6
 
In public, Arab leaders are voicing strong opposition to the use of force against Iraq. But diplomats in the Persian Gulf region say some officials there have told them in confidence that they would support military strikes at the weapons installations that give Iraq the ability to threaten its neighbors. The apparent contradiction between those public and private views tells much about Arab sentiment about Iraq seven years after the gulf war. A6
 
Worries Over Riots in Indonesia
Indonesia's Government has begun to fear that thousands of newly unemployed people could rise up in violent protests and shake its hold on power. Small food riots have already begun in parts of Java, and the Government is bracing for the possibility of more riots when it ends price subsidies for beans, sugar and flour on Sunday. The moves are part of an austerity plan to end the country's economic crisis. A3
 
Safer World for the U.S.
Top American intelligence officials testified that while the world bristles with weapons, the United States is relatively secure from the threat of war. In testimony before a Senate committee, the experts warned, however, that potential threats still come from the spread of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. A3
 
Environmental Law for Brazil
The Brazilian Congress gave the country's environmental agency legal authority to enforce environmental protection laws, days after Government figures showed that destruction of the Amazon rain forest had reached its worst-ever level in the mid-1990s. A8
 
De Klerk Acknowledges Affair
Answering speculation, former South African President F. W. De Klerk publicly acknowledged a longstanding affair with a married woman, but denied that it had forced him to leave politics last year. Mr. DeKlerk, 61, is also married. He said that the matter "is a typical human drama which happens in many families" and that "there are no dramatic scandals involved." He did not name the woman, saying he hoped she would not be hounded. (Agence France-Presse)

New Account Offered Of Meeting at White House
Monica S. Lewinsky has said that President Clinton told her at a private meeting late last month that she could testify in the Paula Corbin Jones lawsuit that her visits to the White House were to see his secretary. She says he also told her that she could avoid testifying by being in New York City. The recent account of the meeting, two weeks after Ms. Lewinsky was ordered to testify in Ms. Jones's sexual misconduct suit against Mr. Clinton, was described by an associate of Ms. Lewinsky's who had spoken with her, and by others who know Ms. Lewinsky's version of what happened. A1
 
President Clinton barnstormed in the Midwest to promote policies outlined in his State of the Union Message. He was well received at the University of Illinois in Champaign, where he was introduced by Vice President Al Gore, who forcefully defended Mr. Clinton on television for the first time since the accusations of sexual misconduct. In Washington, Mr. Clinton's former chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, testified before a Federal grand jury that he was unaware of a relationship between the President and Ms. Lewinsky. A1
 
Multiple Sclerosis Study
Researchers reported that multiple sclerosis appears to go beyond the stripping of insulation that sheathes nerve cells, and severs the nerves themselves. The finding may explain why people with multiple sclerosis eventually become unable to walk, for example, or may lose vision in an eye. It also suggests strategies for treatments with experimental drugs that can prevent nerve cell death, at least in laboratory experiments. A1
 
Minority Applications Rise
The University of California reported that despite the abandonment of affirmative action policies in California, there had been a small but significant increase in applications to the university system from blacks, Mexican-Americans, Indians and Filipino-Americans. A19
 
Fighting F.A.A. Computer Bugs
F.A.A. officials said they would find and remove the "year 2000" bugs from 40 crucial, aging air traffic control computers within 90 days, and then replace the computers, at a cost of about $100 million, because of uncertainty over whether the changes could ever be tested adequately. A10
 
Shaking Up the I.R.S.
Senate Republicans said they would take a tougher approach to revamping the I.R.S., describing last year's House bill and the agency's own proposals as a good jumping-off point. Senator William V. Roth Jr., chairman of the Finance Committee, emphasized that the agency needed to be shaken up from top to bottom. A15

The leaders of both parties in the New Jersey Assembly said that they expected to pass a law requiring women to wait 24 hours before having an abortion, and Governor Whitman said she would support it. B1
 
H.I.V. Births Upstate
Two women infected with H.I.V. by Nushawn J. Williams have given birth to babies who are also infected with the virus that causes AIDS, raising to 16 the number of H.I.V. cases in western New York linked to the 21-year-old man, state health officials said. In addition, at least 10 of Mr. Williams's sex partners in New York City have tested positive for H.I.V., officials said. B5

South Korean banks and their international creditors reached an agreement to extend payment on $24 billion in short-term loans, ending three weeks of often tortuous negotiations. The South Korean Government agreed to guarantee repayment of the loans, all of which were coming due in a year or less. The loans have been the focus of intense concern in Washington and elsewhere because the South Koreans' inability to repay them has threatened to topple the country's fragile economy.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT UNDER FIRE: THE PRESIDENT;
Clinton Leaves Washington Controversy Behind to Talk Policy in the Midwest

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: LA CROSSE, Wis., Jan. 28

 BODY:
Setting aside certain slight if metaphorically inconvenient mishaps -- notably when Air Force One got stuck in the Illinois mud -- President Clinton had a politically comforting day today after a very bad week.
With his last national election behind him but perhaps his toughest political fight ahead, Mr. Clinton returned to the campaign style that he loves, trying as he has in past crises to substitute public excitement about his policies for any suspicions about his personal conduct. 
 Introduced by a revved-up Vice President Al Gore and showered with cheers by the biggest crowds he has seen since his second Inaugural Address, President Clinton spoke here and in Champaign-Urbana, Ill., about fixing the Social Security system, fighting global warming, and improving education.
He did not take questions. And he did not mention accusations boiling over back in Washington -- and on the minds of many in his audiences -- that he had had an affair with an intern, Monica S. Lewinsky, and then urged her to lie about it under oath.
"It feels good to be back in God's country tonight," Mr. Clinton shouted at the rally here, on his first trip out of Washington since the disclosure of the accusations against him a week ago. Thousands of people packed the plaza outside the La Crosse Center and spilled back down the streets leading to it.
As he listed the economic accomplishments of his Administration, Mr. Clinton predicted for the first time tonight that the budget would be balanced this year. "I think it'll be balanced before the year's out," he said. His aides had previously indicated that they expected the deficit to all but disappear this year, for the first time in three decades.
Mr. Gore delivered growling stemwinders in urging the audiences to stand by the President, although he never mentioned the charges against Mr. Clinton. By contrast, the President rambled a bit, as he often does before smaller crowds. He extolled the virtues of the Internet, and, as he discussed Social Security in Illinois, he grew wistful about his youth. "I thought I would live forever, always young," he said.
"Keep your eyes on the future," he urged the crowd of more than 10,000, which filled the University of Illinois Assembly Hall up to its ceiling. Then, because his whole audience could not fit into the Assembly Hall, Mr. Clinton addressed two overflow crowds of thousands more in other auditoriums.
Today's trip had been carefully planned by Mr. Clinton's aides -- who picked friendly towns with strong economies -- to produce enthusiastic crowds for a reprise of policies Mr. Clinton outlined in his State of the Union Message Tuesday night. But the timing and venues, Mr. Clinton's aides said, turned out to be perfect to showcase the President going about the people's business, the image his aides want to project in this crisis.
When Mr. Clinton left the University of Illinois to travel here, the White House's plans went slightly awry. As Mr. Clinton's 707 attempted a right turn onto the main runway, one wheel rolled off the tarmac onto grass, and the plane stopped dead.
The President was delayed for more than an hour while a substitute airplane rushed to Champaign-Urbana. His aides sadly shook their heads over an embarrassing image that they believed would dominate television newscasts. They were right.
Mr. Clinton also confronted less figurative reminders of his difficulties. Directly across the Mississippi River from the rally here, carved into the snow piled on the western bank, was a one-word message: "Impeach," in gigantic letters. The same message, in similar dimensions, appeared in a field near here under the President's flight path.
White House advance teams in both locations had been drumming up crowds for days. At the University of Illinois only two previous Presidents had ever spoken -- Gerald R. Ford in 1976 and William Howard Taft in 1911. The line to see Mr. Clinton started forming at 2 o'clock this morning, in frosty air redolent of nearby hog farms.
Opinions about Mr. Clinton and the scandal were as varied as the rumors dogging the President. But among Democrats at least, the general sentiment was captured by one of the rock songs played by the school band as Mr. Clinton arrived at the stadium in Illinois: "Carry On, My Wayward Son," by the band Kansas.
"That's his own business, between him and his wife," said Betty Williams, 61, of Urbana.
Michelle Palmer, 24, said that she did not vote for Mr. Clinton in 1996. But she said that people made too much of his private life. "If it didn't directly have anything to do with the way this country's ran, I don't think it's any of my business," she said.
Her father, John S. Palmer, who called himself a die-hard Republican, disagreed. "Sure it's our business,"' he said. "He's the President of the United States." Mr. Palmer, a disabled veteran, said that he was concerned about accusations that Mr. Clinton had lied and obstructed justice. But, he said, if he could just resolve his personal troubles, Mr. Clinton would "be a damn good President."

HEADLINE: Mayor, Ordering City Hall Review, Delays Plan to Build Mall Over Brooklyn Terminal

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

 BODY:
Saying that City Hall needed to be more involved in the planning process, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday delayed by at least a month a plan to build a shopping mall over the Atlantic Terminal in downtown Brooklyn.
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority had been set to vote on the plan at a meeting yesterday, but the item was abruptly pulled from the agenda at Mr. Giuliani's request. 
 Curt Ritter, a spokesman for the Mayor, said Mr. Giuliani decided yesterday morning that "City Hall wanted the opportunity to review the plan more carefully."
On Tuesday night, the M.T.A. received a letter from the city's Economic Development Corporation that authorized the developer of the mall, Forest City Ratner, to proceed with the project. John S. Dyson, who is the chairman of the Mayor's Council of Economic Advisers and one of Mr. Giuliani's representatives on the board of the transportation authority, said that after seeing an article about the mall in The New York Times yesterday morning, the Mayor had some questions about it that Mr. Dyson and other administration officials could not answer.
"The E.D.C. thought they had enough information on this," Mr. Dyson said, "but at the Mayor's meeting this morning, we wanted to look at it one more time. It's kind of a communications snafu a little bit."
Mr. Dyson said the Economic Development Corporation, which must approve any development at the terminal because it falls within a city-designated redevelopment zone, withdrew its letter yesterday morning after being contacted by the Mayor's office. But an official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that the Mayor pulled the item from the M.T.A. agenda because he was angry that the plan appeared to be going ahead without his knowledge.
"It's unfortunate," the official said. "This project is a very meaningful project. Perhaps there will be a briefing with the Mayor's office as to the contents of the project so that it could move forward smoothly."
The project calls for a 450,000-square-foot mall to be built above the terminal, which is home to a Long Island Rail Road station and 10 subway lines.
Mr. Dyson said the Mayor had questions about some changes in the plan, but he would not specify what they were. However, another official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the plan had been virtually unchanged for six months.
A spokesman for Forest City Ratner did not return a phone call yesterday.
The item is expected to be back on the transportation board's agenda next month, Mr. Dyson said.

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION: SOCIAL SECURITY;
Yes, a Surplus Would Help, But Tough Choices Remain

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
Applying projected budget surpluses to the financial problems of Social Security could help make fixing the retirement system easier than Washington had feared, but would not eliminate the need for politically excruciating choices, White House officials and members of both parties said today.
Congress and the Clinton Administration would still have to wrestle with raising taxes, cutting benefits, increasing the retirement age or making other unpopular decisions to shore up Social Security. 
 Moreover, they still must resolve an emotional ideological debate over whether the Government should continue to take money from the working-age generation and transfer it to retirees, which is what happens now, or whether Social Security should be transformed so that individuals would have more freedom and responsibility to save for their own retirements.
The day after President Clinton urged Congress to deal with Social Security before spending any Federal budget surpluses, members of both parties acknowledged being concerned that overplaying the potential benefits from the surplus could erode the political will necessary to deal with Social Security's financial woes.
And some analysts said that the entire notion of using the surplus for Social Security was meaningless in the complex world of Government accounting, amounting to no more than moving money from one pocket to another. "Applying the budget surplus to Social Security is not a substitute for structural reforms," said Representative Charles W. Stenholm, a Democrat from Texas who has been pressing for action to shore up the retirement system.
Although Administration officials had considered calling for every dollar of the surplus to be allocated directly to Social Security, Mr. Clinton in the end took a more measured step, saying that Congress should not parcel out the surplus to tax cuts and new spending programs until it had determined how much of the fiscal windfall it needed for the Government to pay the baby boom generation's retirement benefits.
The Administration now believes that the surplus will rise sharply in a few years and total $200 billion over the next five years.
If Congress and the White House decided to use the entire surplus on Social Security, they could eliminate a big chunk of the problem before having to take unpopular steps like cutting benefits, raising taxes or increasing the retirement age, according to early estimates. Alternatively, they could use the money to provide much of the financing needed for a transition to a system in which more of the responsibility for retirement savings was shifted to individuals.
Henry J. Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who is an authority on Social Security, said his rough calculations suggested that the projected surpluses could close about 25 percent of the gap between Social Security's long-term obligations and the money the retirement system would have available if no changes were made.
But that would still leave the nation to decide how to make up the rest of the shortfall.
Government economists said that as a rough rule of thumb, every $100 billion of budget surplus that could be applied to Social Security would help extend the system's solvency by one year beyond 2029, when the program will no longer be able to pay all of the benefits promised to retirees.
"We're saying there should not be legislation that drains the surplus through spending or tax cuts until we know how much of the surplus will be required, along with other measures, to solve the long-term Social Security challenge," said Gene Sperling, the White House economic policy adviser and the primary architect of the Administration's approach.
"We're not saying this is the full solution," Mr. Sperling said.
The Administration also had other goals in mind. Linking the surplus directly to Social Security makes it easier for Mr. Clinton to argue against the sweeping tax cuts that many Republicans are seeking. And by wrapping himself in the mantle of fiscal responsibility, Republicans said, Mr. Clinton is seeking to divert attention from the budget implications of the array of domestic policy initiatives he laid out in his State of the Union Message.
Indeed, neither party showed any signs of curbing its appetite for using the surplus to other ends.
"There is room both to save Social Security and to protect Americans from high taxes," said Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and one of the most ardent Republican proponents of tax cuts.
Social Security currently takes in about $100 billion a year more from payroll taxes and interest income than it pays out in benefits. The excess money is nominally placed in a trust fund, although the fund is largely an accounting fiction. In reality, the Government uses the Social Security surplus to help finance its annual operating budget, and gives the retirement system an i.o.u. in the form of special Treasury bonds.
The result, many economists say, is no practical difference between using any budget surpluses to reduce the overall national debt and using it for Social Security. White House officials disagree, saying it is possible to bolster Social Security's balance sheet in a meaningful way by applying the surplus to it.
Advocates of substantially overhauling Social Security say the best use for any budget surpluses would be to pay the transition costs to the new system. Under the current system, employees and employers split a 12.4 percent payroll tax. One widely discussed proposal calls for two percentage points of the payroll tax to go into individual accounts for the future retirements of the workers paying the taxes rather than to the Government to pay for the benefits of current retirees.
But such a shift would leave the Government with about $70 billion a year less than it takes in now to pay benefits for current retirees. The budget surpluses, advocates of such a change say, could fill that gap, allowing the Government to pay current benefits and require today's generation of workers to save for their retirements.

Banks in Accord to Extend $24 Billion in Korea Loans

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
South Korean banks and their international creditors reached an agreement late last night to extend payment on $24 billion in short-term loans, granting the country an important reprieve in the financial crisis that has afflicted much of Asia since last summer.
The agreement, which ended three weeks of often tortuous negotiations, marks the first time in the crisis that banks have given any of the stricken Asian nations such a measure of relief. 
 It also reflected the pressure confronting both the South Korean banks and their creditors to find a speedy solution to avoid defaults on the most pressing debts. Otherwise those debts may have spiraled into much larger problems that could have affected industrial countries like Japan. Moreover, the creditors, which have been accused of reckless lending to Asia during its boom years, had little choice but to extend repayment unless they were willing to absorb big losses.
The agreement represents a turning point that gives South Korean banks more breathing room and could lay the basis for foreign investment to flow back into what had been the world's 11th-largest economy until a few months ago. It also could provide a precedent for Indonesian debtors, which also are struggling under the weight of short-term foreign bank loans and are seeking relief from international banks.
Investors and lenders have been unwilling to take a long-term view of South Korea's prospects until the country's short-term debt problems were resolved.
"The key thing is putting a financial backstop in place, and that is what this agreement achieves," said Gene Frieda, an emerging-markets specialist with I.D.E.A., a research firm based in New York.
But it is premature to call the agreement a definitive event that could expedite an end to the crisis. The South Koreans, who already have a $57 billion rescue package from the International Monetary Fund, must still raise billions of dollars for additional debt repayments and for rebuilding their economy.
The South Korean Government agreed to guarantee repayment of the loans, all of which were coming due in a year or less. Under the deal, the maturities have been extended from one to three years.
Although people involved in the negotiations were optimistic last week that a deal might be concluded earlier this week, that optimism had faded last weekend as the South Koreans and an unwieldy collection of international banks haggled over how high an interest rate the new debt would carry.
The South Koreans, as was in their interest, had been pressing for lower rates, while the bankers had been pressing for higher rates. The final agreement appears to strike a middle ground.
"This achievement marks a critical step in the efforts of Korea to surmount its current liquidity crisis and to restore stability to the Korean banking center," Chung Duck Koo, South Korea's Deputy Minister of Finance, said in a statement. William Rhodes, a Citicorp executive and veteran debt renegotiator who was the spokesman for American banks in these talks, said: "I think it was a very positive negotiation. We were striving to get a realistic negotiation and that's what we achieved."
The one-year loans will pay interest of 2.25 percentage points above the six-month London interbank offered rate, known as Libor, a benchmark international lending rate, which is at 5.625 percent. Korea's two-year loans will pay 2.5 percentage points above Libor. The three-year loans will pay 2.75 percentage points above Libor.
Another point of contention in the negotiations was what portion of the debt would be guaranteed by the South Korean Government. But that issue was less contentious than how steep an interest rate the new debt would carry, according to people close to the negotiations.
It was resolved relatively quickly with the Government agreeing to guarantee the entire $24 billion.
"We started far apart, that's certainly true," said one person involved in the negotiations. "People had different expectations."
But people involved in the negotiations said that the talks had been congenial and that both sides hoped the agreement would improve South Korea's borrowing prospects.
The country will now need to raise a substantial, though as yet undetermined, amount of money, most likely through a multibillion-dollar bond issue.
"The South Koreans need a lot for the year, but the question is, how much do they need right away?" said a person involved in the negotiations.
When banks recently agreed to extend payment on, or roll over, about $28 billion in short-term loans coming due by March 31, it was thought that South Korean banks had $5 billion more in short-term loans coming due by the end of the year, for a total of $33 billion. But the total short-term bank debt due by the end of 1998 was recently revised to less than $30 billion.
Only short-term loans owed by South Korean banks are subject to the terms of last night's agreement. Other corporate debt is not being renegotiated. In December, the South Korean Government said it had $153 billion in external debt, with about $92 billion of that in short-term debt due to repaid by the end of 1998. Those figures are no longer considered accurate.
Under the agreement, the creditor banks will exchange old South Korean debt for the new debt before the end of February. The exchange will be completed by March 31, when temporary extensions on some of the old debt had been due to expire. The South Korean Government has said that it will need at least $15 billion of the short-term debt to be converted for an exchange to be successful.
Now that the South Koreans have tentatively addressed their short-term debt problem, they face the even trickier task of deciding how to raise new money to further bolster the country's economy.
Although some bankers had suggested the Government might try to raise as much as $30 billion in a bond offering, most analysts think that number is far too high, given the fact that the South Korean Government has never done a major bond issue.

Japanese Stocks Rise
 TOKYO, Thursday, Jan. 29 (Bloomberg News) -- Japanese stocks rallied today after being down most of the session.
The benchmark Nikkei 225-stock index climbed 40.76 points, or two-tenths of a percent, to 17,014.59. Stocks fell nearly 30 points in early trading, led down by Sakura Bank Ltd. and Fuji Bank Ltd., on concern that a Government plan to aid banks will be delayed by a Finance Ministry scandal.
Markets in other Asian countries, including South Korea, Indonesia and Singapore, were closed for holidays.

Valentin to Get $25 Million Contract

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
The yearlong disenchantment of John Valentin turned to economic satisfaction yesterday. His agent, Richard Moss, and the Boston Red Sox concluded negotiations on a new contract, agreeing to a four-year deal for $25 million.
Valentin, who had put in $7 million for salary arbitration to the team's $5.5 million, was unhappy a year ago because the Red Sox moved him to second base so that Nomar Garciaparra, a highly touted rookie, could play shortstop. After he staged a brief spring training walkout in protest, Valentin wound up playing 79 games at second and 64 games at third. Garciaparra wound up as the American League rookie of the year. 
 Valentin, who batted .306 while earning $3.8 million, had expected to be traded, but the Red Sox did not want to lose the offensive punch he provides as an infielder. He achieved career highs last season with 176 hits, 47 doubles, 5 triples and 287 total bases.
In another salary arbitration case, Jeromy Burnitz of the National League Milwaukee Brewers went from a $225,000 salary last season to a four-year contract worth $14.5 million. The outfielder, who had sought $2.6 million to the club's $1,505,000, led the Brewers with 27 home runs and 85 runs batted in. MURRAY CHASS

HEADLINE: James Bond, Then to Now: Agent of Cultural Change

BYLINE: By DINITIA SMITH

 BODY:
James Bond is back. In fact, he will not go away. The James Bond films are the most successful movie franchise in history, with most of the movies among the top earners of the year. "Tomorrow Never Dies," the current Bond film, opened on Dec. 19 and was still in the Top 10 at the box office last weekend, having earned $115.5 million, second only to "Titanic" among the current hits.
Over the last 36 years, there have been 18 Bond films -- 20 if you count the Bond parody, "Casino Royale," and "Never Say Never Again," the 1983 remake of "Thunderball," which marked Sean Connery's return after 12 years. 
 For the unenthusiastic, all Bond movies, which were initially based on a character created by Ian Fleming, seem to be pretty much the same: James Bond, the handsome, rakish British secret agent, after flirting with his boss's secretary, Moneypenny, and ably assisted by the devices of "Q," the equipment officer, escapes death several times. Bond seduces, or is seduced by, an untrustworthy woman, and finally, Theseus-like, penetrates the innermost lair of the villain and destroys him. In the end, Bond gets the girl, usually drifting off with her in a boat, or at least necking with her near a body of water.
But to Bond aficionados, and scholars in the field of cultural studies, James Bond just isn't what he used to be. Fathers, brought up on the early Bond movies like "Dr. No" and taking their sons to see "Tomorrow Never Dies," have complained that the new Bond film devotes no time to character development. For them, "Dr. No," with its relatively leisurely pace, in which Bond flirts a little, drinks a little, then kills off a villain or two, is the ideal Bond.
But just as the audience judges the Bond films, the films judge the audience, providing a kind of map of cultural change over the years.
Literally scores of scholarly works have been written on the James Bond films. "The primary ideological and cultural coordinates within which the figure of Bond has functioned have been, first, representations of the relations between West and East," Tony Bennett and Janet Woollacott write in their 1987 book, "Bond and Beyond," and second, "representations of the relations between the sexes." The authors, drawing on the work of the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, write that the figure of Bond has provided a focus "within the ideological construction of gender relations and identities."
"He's gone from being an anti-Communist, to fighting rogue generals, to being against a combination of Bill Gates, Rupert Murdoch and William Randolph Hearst," said Daniel Leab, a professor of history at Seton Hall University. Mr. Leab was referring to Elliot Carver, the villain in "Tomorrow Never Dies," a media baron who manipulates the news. Mr. Leab pointed out that the screenplay for "Tomorrow Never Dies," written by Bruce Feirstein, even has Elliot Carver uttering words attributed to Hearst: "You give me the pictures. I'll give you the war."
In the old days, Bond used to be at war with the Chinese Communists. "Now Bond works with her," Mr. Leab said, referring to Michelle Yeoh, a veteran of Hong Kong kung fu movies cast in the film as a Chinese Communist agent who cooperates with Bond.
Along with the political economy, the character of Bond himself has evolved through the years. "Sean Connery was the classic working-class Scot," said Toby Miller, a professor of cinema studies at New York University, who is writing a scholarly study of spy films, including the Bond movies. "He's a person who, because of his accent, every time he says anything cultivated about brandy, is sticking it to the Brits. There is a dissonance between his accent and his observations, and in the Britain of the 1960's, that was an important part of his appeal."
Roger Moore, who played Bond for 12 years starting in 1973, was more like the Bond envisioned by the Fleming novels, cool and smooth and a little stiff. Timothy Dalton was a blip on the horizon, and George Lazenby got to play Bond only once.
Pierce Brosnan is very much a Bond for the 90's. The Irish-born Mr. Brosnan has an indeterminate accent, not quite high English, not quite Connery, a reflection perhaps of the breakdown of English class lines. Some women find Mr. Brosnan a rather unsexual Bond, more interested in killing off his enemies than in attending to his girlfriends.
"The women are the key to the evolution of the Bond films," Mr. Miller said. "In 'Tomorrow Never Dies,' the time that would have been spent in the past establishing the relationship between Bond and the Bond girl goes to letting her have her own fight scenes. There are three to four minutes of Michelle Yeoh fighting. Normally, that would have been three to four minutes of her staring into his eyes.
"Also, another significant change: she has a fight scene and Bond is not there the whole time to see it. She doesn't need Bond's approval and protection."

Did you want to look at an aardvark or an armored truck? A balloon or a battleship? A rare garden bug or a garden-variety politician? From her vast stock, Romana Javitz (1903-1980) could find you a picture of anything. As chief custodian and cultivator of the New York Public Library's Picture Collection from 1929 to 1968, Ms. Javitz helped it grow from a modest resource to a major repository of five million items that reflect the ever-changing shifts in popular taste.
Although the library is much better known as a source of linear learning, it is also one of the great centers for pictorial research, used by artists, designers, publishers, illustrators, television prop staffs, advertising people, Web site developers, students, historians and others wanting ideas and documentation. Its Picture Collection circulates material from books, magazines, catalogues, pamphlets and advertisements, as well as from prints, movie stills, postcards and photographs, filed under nearly 12,000 subject headings. 
 Now, 18 years after Ms. Javitz's death, the library is commemorating her role in making all this happen. "Subject Matters: Photography, Romana Javitz and the New York Public Library" is a small but, despite its uncatchy title, lively show. It presents an overview of the Picture Collection and its development, along with some of the more than 2,000 photographs she acquired from such luminaries as Lewis W. Hine, Dorothea Lange, Walker Evans and Berenice Abbott, among others.
The Picture Collection started informally in 1914 as a response to growing demand for pictorial material viewed in terms of subject rather than esthetics. By 1926 the expanding file had been given its own space, and in 1929 Ms. Javitz, who initially worked part-time at the library while studying painting, took over.
"She saw the Picture Collection as an encyclopedia of visual knowledge, and built a useful system for the dissemination of that knowledge," writes Anthony T. Troncale, associate head of the Digital Imaging Unit in the library's Preservation Division, who organized the show with Julia Van Haaften, curator of the Photography Collection in the Division of Art, Prints and Photographs.
One of Ms. Javitz's salient contributions was devising an up-to-date indexing system that made pictures readily accessible by subject matter. Seeking "Relationships," for instance, you might look under Conversation, Courtship, Love, Kissing, Marriage or Erotica. And she also encouraged borrowers to draw, rather than write, their requests. Whisky stills, Queen Victoria and nudes are some of the quirkily illustrated call slips on view in the show. A signed scenario for a projected film about a photographer by Joseph Cornell, a Picture Collection user who became a Javitz friend, is there, and a 1995 cartoon strip about the collection by Art Spiegelman that includes a three-panel view of Ms. Javitz plying her trade with a pair of scissors.
Another significant contribution to the field of visual research came about through her concern over the neglect of American folk arts and crafts. In 1935, she, along with artist-users of the collection, hatched a proposal (its typescript is on view in the show) under which the New Deal's Works Progress Administration would hire unemployed artists and illustrators to document American decorative arts. Thousands of watercolors recording everything from toys to quilts to clothes to iron railings were produced. Now ensconced at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, as the Index of American Design, the collection forms a significant record of indigenous American crafts.
Much of the show's space is given to works from the group of photographs that Ms. Javitz acquired over the years, sometimes as gifts from photographers, which is now separated out as the Romana Javitz Collection. She chose them more for their subject matter than as works of art. "As a librarian," she said in an interview, "I find that I want very much to read the facts in the photograph."
Hine, befriended by Ms. Javitz late in his life, is represented by five documentary prints, among them a touching 1910 scene of a little boy working at midnight in a glass factory. Photographs by Lange include a 1934 view of an assembly of unemployed men in San Francisco, surprisingly well-dressed and wearing snappy fedoras. A 1938 shot by Abbott shows the French liner Normandie in the North River, cheered by a crowd on shore.
Among Ms. Javitz's most important acquisitions, in 1936 and 1937, were duplicates from the photographic division of the Federal Resettlement Administration (later known as the Farm Security Administration). A New Deal agency, set up to help farmers displaced by drought and economic ruin, it had a division that hired talented photographers to document the farmers' plight. One was the artist Ben Shahn, a friend of Ms. Javitz, who suggested to Roy D. Stryker, chief of the agency's photo division, that it provide the Picture Collection with duplicates. And thereby hangs a tale.
From the initial shipments, in 1936 and 1937, came such works as Shahn's 1935 photo of a North Carolina fiddler at home on a Sunday afternoon, Evans's 1936 study of black men in front of a Vicksburg, Miss., barber shop and Arthur Rothstein's stark 1935 night shot of a stretch of highway in the Texas Panhandle. But by the early 1940's, with economic conditions looking up, the agency was pushed by certain Congressmen to project a more positive image of America.
During World War II, a number of the agency's 180,000 images came to the Picture Collection clandestinely, in anonymous packages, while Congress threatened to impound its files as un-American. Later it turned out that Stryker, alarmed over that possibility, wanted to make sure that a duplicate file would be available in New York. But he didn't dare to send them officially until the threat was removed. That happened in 1944, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a directive giving the Farm Security archive to the Library of Congress.
After World War II Ms. Javitz kept on acquiring, by gift or purchase, the documentary work of American photographers, making the Picture Collection one of the few institutions willing to take on young contemporaries. For some reason, she eschewed what is now known as the New York School of Photographers, including Diane Arbus and Robert Frank. With some notable exceptions, like Helen Levitt, her choices are mostly unknown today. The best of the works on view are urban vignettes, like Ann Treer's 1963 look at tough neighborhood kids on West 20th Street, David Turner's 1962 shot of a well-hatted pair of loquacious subway riders and a 1963 homage to a broken doll in the street by Beuford Smith, one of several black photographers whose work entered the collection in the 1960's.
It is a challenge in a small exhibition to represent the work of a system as vast and varied as the Picture Collection, now slowly being digitized, as a computer in the show gives evidence. And perhaps the library has not given the Picture Collection part of the show enough space and explanation. But as a tribute to Ms. Javitz and her innovative role in the art world, the exhibition is a real occasion.
"Subject Matters: Photography, Romana Javitz and the New York Public Library" is at the library's Center for the Humanities, Fifth Avenue at 42d Street, through March 28.

HEADLINE: WEEKEND EXCURSION;
In Search Of Bridges To a Time Long Lost

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL 

 BODY:
Our search for remote, exotic specimens of the covered bridge ends with a toast of the local lager: Here's to frosty mornings, icy streams and raindrops on hex signs. 
 The largely uncelebrated bridges of Berks County in Pennsylvania are worth a salute, although they number only five. The reward of the hunt for these 19th-century wooden trusses is not just an architectural tour, but also a sentimental journey along two-lane roads that swoop by blond fields of winter and hand-painted signs advertising fresh eggs and the Republican candidate for constable.
There is no Clint Eastwood movie or steamy best seller to enshrine this southeastern Pennsylvania county and draw the tourists. There is just the quiet romance of burgundy barns and clattering wooden bridges decorated with hex sunwheels and tulips, stars and hearts. And there is scrapple.
"You want to talk Madison County," scoffed Roger A. McCain, referring to the book by Robert James Waller, "The Bridges of Madison County," and the movie made from it. "Madison County is the best place to see covered bridges in south central Iowa. Not in the world. Not in North America. Not even in the Midwest. But in Iowa."
Perhaps it is no surprise that Mr. McCain, an economics professor at Drexel University and master of a Web site devoted to covered bridges, prefers his home territory of Pennsylvania for the gentle pursuit of "bridging." In Berks County, he admires remote wooden spans like the red Dreibelbis Station Bridge, with its unusual step-shaped portal, or the 165-year-old Griesemer's Mill Bridge, topped by a handpainted hex sign (a form of Pennsylvania Dutch folk art).
"Biased as we may be," Mr. McCain acknowledged, "we still regard Pennsylvania as the Covered Bridge State."
Winter is one of the best times to roam Berks County, when the dark branches of trees are stripped bare, and snow is drifting against the creek beds. For the engineer at heart, this is when the pure, clean outlines of the covered bridges are clearly visible for careful study. For the romantic, the fragrance of hot apple cider and wood smoke hovers in the brisk air.
There is an amber-in-time quality to the villages and hamlets of Berks County, which have avoided the worst of the commercialism of neighboring Lancaster County and its relentless Amish tourist industry.
Berks, a diamond-shaped county of 864 square miles, is about 125 miles southwest of New York and 56 miles northwest of Philadelphia. Its first European settlement was founded by Swedes at the mouth of the Manatawny Creek in 1701. The early pioneers were followed upstream by successive waves of immigrants, Huguenots from France in 1704 and Germans in 1712. Later, a steady migration of Germans came from upstate New York to the county's Tulpehocken Valley.
The influence of these immigrants has endured, from the Griesemer Bridge, named for an early Huguenot, to staple recipes of Pennsylvania Dutch cooking like "drechter kuche," funnel cake.
Old Route 22 presents such an extensive outdoor collection of vivid Pennsylvania Dutch barn signs in red and blue, yellow and white that it has been dubbed the hex highway. That highway links two of the farm roads leading to the Kutz's Mill Bridge and the Dreibelbis, which is just a short drive from the warm refuge of the Deitsch Eck (Dutch Corner), a restaurant offering Pennsylvania Dutch meals.
Inside the Deitsch on a winter weekend, a waitress served apple cider and pumpkin custard pie to a Sunday post-church crowd, settled at red-checked tables below a white ceiling of pressed tin. The dark oak bar was decorated with green-striped squashes; tulip hex signs lined the shelves.
Draped from a wall was a thin linen towel emblazoned with the names and pictures of the Berks bridges: Pleasantville and Wertz Mill (Red Bridge) as well as Dreibelbis, Kutz and Griesemer.
Here, my husband and I committed a minor social gaffe, asking for mustard to eat with a dark brown brick of scrapple, a deep-fried mix of beef, pork liver and corn meal that is a quintessential Pennsylvania breakfast staple.
As we later learned, some aficionados like their scrapple generously swathed in butter and pepper bits so that the dish resembles a gravel trail. Others prefer maple syrup.
"You eat this with something sweet like apple butter or syrup," the waitress gently corrected us before excusing herself to leave for church.
As we lingered through Sunday evening after a long weekend in Berks County, we discovered that the pace of life slows virtually to a halt after sundown on Sundays.
It's so quiet in Boyertown, for example, that our hosts at the isolated Enchanted Cottage -- a cozy bed and breakfast set in the woods near the Landis Store Hotel -- suggested that we consider dining at the Hill Country Church, where you can get a turkey plate for $7.
In fact, the Landis Store Hotel closes on Sundays, but on other evenings it attracts diners up a winding, dark, two-lane road for generous mugs of the local Stoudt Golden Lager and dishes of terrine of duck. Teddy bears handmade by a local farmer's wife line the windowseats of the two-century-old tavern.
During the day, the pace quickens in Berks County, but according to its own gentle rhythms. There's the monthly trap shoot in Perrytown or the weekend quilt auctions advertised on Fridays in The Mercury in Pottstown and The Reading Eagle.
Daniel Boone's 18th-century stone homestead, in Birdsboro, is open for tours of its log house and blacksmith shop. And there is a quiet industry serving people in search of ancestors' tombstones that may be among those scattered in more than 100 family burial grounds throughout the county, said John Moxon, owner of Reiff Farm bed and breakfast in Oley.
Guests at his stone farmhouse can stroll up a hill to the Reiff family cemetery of seven graves, which includes plots of Revolutionary War soldiers, Capt. Daniel Reiff and Conrad Reiff.
Mr. Moxon's family bought the farm from the Reiffs, and he grew up in the farmhouse where he now flips blueberry pancakes and serves them on a table set with English china and family silver.
A former money manager in New York and in Bucks County, Mr. Moxon opened the bed and breakfast two years ago, drawn home by cherished childhood memories of "wandering the woods and the stream, and watching the moon rise over the pond."
A sense of history so pervades Berks County that the area, which is better known for its outlet shopping in Reading, is an antiques browser's paradise with a wide variety of flea markets offering prices to shame New England antiques stores.
In Leesport, flea markets alternate weekends with exhibitions dedicated to guns, Lehigh rabbit breeders, scale railroads and reptiles (sponsored by the Reptaquatics). The market is a particularly good place to sample warm braids of pretzels or that rarest of rare dishes: prune pie.
Some of the merchandise is contemporary and of garage quality; sweatshirts and towels are sold along with small family heirlooms. But it remains a place of little bargains like our purchase of a $3 set of handblown, pastel-colored liquor glasses that an elderly woman was clearing out along with plastic Christmas decorations.
Other stops on the washboard circuit are Stoudtberg Antiques Mall, in Adamstown, where, if you time a visit correctly, you can dance a polkato a live band; or Renninger's Antique and Farmer's Market in Kutztown, which has a Saturday antiques market and three huge outdoor flea markets held in April, June and September.
Antiques bargains can also be found in small towns like Shartlesville, which is worth a stop to visit two old-fashioned hotels, Haag's Hotel and Shartlesville Hotel. They serve generous multi-course meals of Pennsylvania Dutch salads and applesauce and slabs of hams and roast chicken that leave you breathless from the sheer quantity.
Somehow the taverns of 19th-century Berks County have managed to flourish as working hotels, run by owners who are city refugees with a talent for restoration.
The Oley Valley Inn, a hotel on Main Street with a wide white porch and green shutters, features remodeled rooms with antique armoires and marble furnishings and offers banana pancake breakfasts. Southeast of Oley, which is itself listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is the Yellow House Hotel, a stagecoach stop dating back to 1801.
The Yellow Hotel's present owners, Jack Rahn and Carl Brown, both from Philadelphia, bought the business more than 19 years ago. Some of the employees have worked there for more than 30 years, watching the hotel evolve from little more than a bar and pool hall into a working hotel.
Just a short drive north of the hotel are the bridges of Pleasantville and Griesemer. Cars can still rumble through the Griesemer and three of Berks County's other covered bridges, but the entrances of the Pleasantville Bridge are piled with small mountains of smooth, gray rocks to bar the traffic of the 20th century.
Built in the 1800's, when inland farmers and water-powered mills needed practical transportation across streams, the bridges were covered because the wood was vulnerable to rot and roofing provided protection.
Today, the cool, dark shade of a covered bridge is an impractical refuge from the world, a place where the characters of "The Bridges of Madison County" found love, or, in some extreme cases, obsession.
Recently Mr. McCain, whose hobby is bridging, encountered a man in a drugstore who noticed some postcards of covered bridges and then boasted that he had photos of the same structures. He started pulling pictures out of his wallet, recalled Mr. McCain, and offered to show him more shots that he had outside in his car. Mr. McCain politely demurred.
"It's nostalgia," Mr. McCain said. "The bridges give you a feeling of being in touch with the 19th century that you can't find in any other way."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Greenspan's Reassuring Comments Cause Treasury Rally

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities rallied yesterday after the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, said that Asia's economic crisis would give the American economy "some breathing room from inflation pressures."
Mr. Greenspan, who made his comments to the Senate Budget Committee, helped clear up several of the questions that were overhanging the bond market and sparked the recent selloff. 
 He reassured investors that he expects the economic turmoil in Asia to result in slower growth here.
"We have as yet experienced only the peripheral winds of the Asian crisis," Mr. Greenspan said. "But before spring is over, the abrupt current-account adjustments that financial difficulties are forcing upon several of our Asian trading partners will be showing through here in reduction in demand for our exports and intensified competition from imports."
"All of this suggests," he continued, "that the growth of economic activity in this country will moderate from the recent brisk pace."
This reassurance from the central bank was important because there are no significant signs yet that the economy is slowing from its rapid pace of last year.
The Fed chairman indicated that the inflation outlook, already the best in more than a decade, could improve. "The likelihood that we shall be seeing some lower prices on imported goods as a result of the difficulties in Asia may afford some breathing room from inflation pressures," he said.
But he also warned that tight labor markets could add to wage pressures, a fact shown in the jump in the Employment Cost Index for the fourth quarter that was reported earlier this week. And he once again mentioned deflation -- the fact that prices could fall -- although he did not indicate that deflation was an immediate concern.
"As a consequence, we must be vigilant to the re-emergence of destabilizing influences -- both higher inflation, and shortfalls in demand and decreases in some prices that would press the disinflation process too far, too fast," he said.
Together, his comments seemed to bolster the view that the Fed is on hold for the time being, with no chance of a rate increase and, unless the Asian drag is more than expected, no rate cut either.
The 30-year bond gained 1 1/2 points, to 1043/32 , while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 5.83 percent, from 5.94 percent on Wednesday.
The Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's policy-making arm, meets next Tuesday and Wednesday to determine the Fed's outlook for short-term interest rates. Later, the chairman will make a formal presentation of central bank policy to Congress.
"His comments were very balanced and the market liked it," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management. "While carefully presenting the risks on both sides of the economic outlook, Mr. Greenspan was nevertheless very reassuring to the bond market."
Elsewhere, the Treasury said its auction of $12 billion in 52-week bills produced an average rate of 4.965 percent, down from 5.065 percent last month and the lowest since 4.64 percent on Feb. 1, 1996. The bond-equivalent yield on the bills was 5.2 percent.
"Low yields are back, retail is showing signs of buying and corporate issues are crawling out of the woodwork," said John M. Atkins, senior analyst with Technical Data of Boston.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of a new 52-week bill:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Average Price	94.980	Discounted Rate	4.96%	Coupon Yield	5.23%	High Price	94.995	Discounted Rate	4.96%	Coupon Yield	5.23%	Low Price	94.980	Discounted Rate	4.95%	Coupon Yield	5.21%	Accepted at low price	91%	Total applied for	$48,393,314	Accepted	$19,169,574	Noncompetitive	$1,097,119

HEADLINE: Rowland Asks For Purchase Of Open Land

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Jan. 29

 BODY:
Gov. John G. Rowland today proposed spending $160 million to preserve more than 20,000 acres of open space in Connecticut over the next five years, a plan that in its first year alone would increase by nearly tenfold the money the state has spent on open space during his administration.
Mr. Rowland, who is seeking re-election this year, also set a goal of preserving about 670,000 acres of open space within 25 years. There are currently about 450,000 acres of open space, about half of it owned by the state and the rest owned by municipalities, land trusts and water companies. 
 The Governor's proposal, which comes less than two weeks after Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey promised in her inaugural address to preserve 300,000 acres of open space, is a departure for Mr. Rowland, who has been under fire from Democrats and some environmental groups for his environmental record.
In the last 2 1/2 years, the state has spent $2.1 million on open space. Mr. Rowland is proposing to spend $32 million next year. A spokesman for United States Representative Barbara B. Kennelly, who is seeking the Democratic nomination to run against Mr. Rowland, called his proposal "campaign rhetoric."
At a press conference today to announce his proposal, Mr. Rowland acknowledged that he had a different priority when he took office: improving the state's economy. With Connecticut out of the recession, he said, "We can now turn to preserving our open space and improving our quality of life.
"What we're really trying to do with this plan is to protect open space from ourselves," Mr. Rowland said.
Environmental activists seemed almost giddy at today's press conference, and praised Mr. Rowland for backing the recommendations of an open-space task force, which released its final report today.
"It's going to make a huge difference," David Sutherland, co-chairman of the Land Conservation Coalition of Connecticut, an alliance of environmental groups, said of Mr. Rowland's proposal. "There are towns that are going to look different in 20 years than they would have."
Democrats said Mr. Rowland's open-space proposal was at least partly motivated by politics. "I think he knows he's weak on the environment," said Kevin B. Sullivan, the president pro tempore of the State Senate. "But whether he's a Johnny-come-lately or not, he's here. The good news is I think we'll do something."
Democrats also criticized Mr. Rowland's plan as moving too slowly. Last year, the Legislature approved a goal of preserving about 10 percent of the state as open space. Mr. Rowland's proposal called for reaching that goal in 25 years. Democrats said they would push for reaching it in 10 years.
As part of his announcement, Mr. Rowland also said the state would try to intervene in a controversial and high-profile development plan in Easton in which a private company is offering $14.1 million to buy 737 acres of land owned by the Bridgeport Hydraulic Company to build 100 million-dollar homes and an 18-hole golf course.
Mr. Rowland said the state, with the towns of Easton and Weston, would try to exercise its right of first refusal to buy the water company's property. The actor Paul Newman, who lives in Westport, has pledged $500,000 over five years to help preserve the land.

HEADLINE: Regulators Oppose End to Session if Dow Plunges

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 29

 BODY:
The nation's top financial regulators told Congress today that they oppose a proposal by securities markets to suspend trading for the day after stocks fall sharply, saying that the new rules would be too restrictive.
"Closed markets create panic, create fear, create uneasiness, create uncertainty," Arthur Levitt Jr., chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said before a Senate Banking subcommittee on securities. "That's when investors get scared." 
 The staff members of the New York Stock Exchange and 10 other securities markets agreed this week on a plan that would close markets for the rest of the day if the Dow Jones industrial average fell by 20 percent.
The proposal, drafted by staff members of the exchange and scheduled to be considered by its board on Feb. 5, would also close markets for the day if the Dow fell by 10 percent after 2:30 P.M., Eastern standard time. It would close the market for an hour if the Dow index fell by 10 percent before 1 P.M. and for 30 minutes if the 10 percent decline occurred between 1 and 2:30 P.M.
Under current rules, the Dow must fall only 350 points -- or less than 5 percent at current levels -- before trading is halted for 30 minutes. If the Dow falls 550 points, or about 7 percent at current levels, trading is halted for an hour.
While the regulators support raising the limits on the amount that stocks can fall before trading is interrupted, they oppose the plan to close markets for the rest of the day.
Mr. Levitt, whose agency must approve any proposal, threatened to have the S.E.C. and Commodity Futures Trading Commission unilaterally change the rules if the exchange does not act "to protect investors adequately."
The exchange's "circuit breaker" changes are designed to give investors a breather to avoid panic selling. "Circuit breakers help insure our market is fair for all and does not become a free-for-all for a handful of large traders during periods of market volatility," the exchange's chief economist, James L. Cochrane, testified today.

HEADLINE: Zambia Gazes at the Power Elite's Dirty Laundry

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: LUSAKA, Zambia, Jan. 23

 BODY:
When former President Kenneth D. Kaunda arrives at court each morning, up to 100 soldiers surround him and not only shove photographers back with rifle butts, but also jump like basketball forwards trying to block his face.
Inside, when a political ally of his asks for a glass of water, a lawyer for Mr. Kaunda makes the court clerk taste it first. 
 Suspicion runs deep in Zambian politics these days.
In the last two years, Zambia has had a bomb blast outside the President's house, a roundup of opposition leaders, a flawed election, the shooting of two opposition candidates, a lawsuit asserting that the President is secretly a foreigner, threats of invasion, riots in the capital, a coup attempt, a roundup of 90 coup suspects, torture allegations and, on Christmas Day, the arrest of Mr. Kaunda.
And yet, life goes rather normally. The country, some say, would probably be much the same if none of this had happened. This nation of nine million people on the divide between relatively stable southern Africa and chaotic central Africa is stumbling along: Once relatively wealthy, now poor; once staunchly socialist, now aggressively free-market; never wholly democratic nor wholly despotic, Zambia is still giving the donor nations that support it a combination of hope and the heebie-jeebies.
A state of emergency is in effect. But there is no curfew, airports are open and rush-hour traffic jams the business district. As a police sergeant in the northern city of Kitwe said, "The state of emergency is only for the political elite in Lusaka."
Under the emergency's broad detention laws, Mr. Kaunda is under house arrest while the police try to build a case that he was behind the three-hour coup attempt on Oct. 28.
His lawyers are fighting to have him released, since the prosecutors have presented no evidence, other than an unsubstantiated statement that he agreed to give the coup leaders money and jobs. But Zambia's courts are so slow that a habeas corpus hearing, normally urgent, has dragged on for a month. The Government says Mr. Kaunda exploits the hearings to make speeches, and the court has barred all press contact with him.
Many Zambians and outside experts believe that the coup attempt had nothing to do with Mr. Kaunda, but was a foray by a few captains and majors who had been drinking and were bitter about their low pay and their generals' handsome lifestyles.
One of the two accused coup leaders, Capt. Jackson Chiti, testified on Jan. 15 that the police had tortured him, demanding that he implicate Mr. Kaunda. But he denied that the former President was involved and tearfully apologized to him in court.
But there are other theories too: one put about by some American officials and South African military experts is that Zambia overreacted to a feeble coup attempt because it is terrified that Angola is plotting against it.
Supply flights to the Unita rebels in eastern Angola have originated in western Zambia, prompting threats of invasion by the Angolan Government. Since Angolan troops helped overthrow Presidents Mobutu Sese Seko in the former Zaire and Pascal Lissouba in the Congo Republic last year because Unita had bases in those countries, Zambia is nervous.
But Eric Silwamba, the President's chief of staff and a special envoy to Angola, said Zambia closed the airstrips and expelled the South African company running the supply flights, Meteor-Ex. Its relations with Angola are cordial again, he said.
Nonetheless, a South African military expert said western Zambia's airspace is still largely unwatched by radar and the Zambian Army is spread thin in border areas west of the Zambezi River.
Mr. Silwamba denied that the demoted Defense Minister and other party insiders had enriched themselves by helping Unita, which still controls diamond areas.
The most common outlook on the repeated crises of the last two years is that they all spring from a deep hatred between two very touchy men: Mr. Kaunda, a schoolteacher who led Zambia to independence from Britain in 1964 and ruled it for 27 years, and President Frederick J. T. Chiluba, a trade unionist who formed the coalition that ousted Mr. Kaunda in a democratic election in 1991 and then fractured in squabbles.
Mr. Chiluba "tried to destroy Dr. Kaunda's reputation, calling him a dictator who ruined the country," said the Rev. Nevers Mumba, a clergyman building his own political party. "That touched Dr. Kaunda's ego and pride. That's what made him come back into politics."
The two could hardly be more different. Mr. Kaunda is tall and solid, wears Nehru suits and affects a large white handkerchief into which he alternately storms and weeps; as a liberation leader he combed his hair like Don King's, but now, at 73, he has a gray beard and lives on raw vegetables.
Mr. Chiluba, 54, is tiny and efficient, a fundamentalist Christian who wears natty suits and does without a scurrying entourage. In his rapid-delivery speeches, he quickly lapses into tart scorn, doing imitations while telling folksy stories deriding Mr. Kaunda, African and Western leaders and other critics.
"I think he's driven by a fear of appearing weak," said Jim Polhemus, an American consultant studying democracy here. "The people around him are telling him not to let Mandela or Mugabe or the donor nations push him around."
Asked about the series of crises,Mr. Kaunda's party says Mr. Chiluba changed the Constitution to bar him from running again in 1996, planted small bombs as an excuse to claim the existence of a "Black Mamba gang" and jail his party leadership until the 1996 race was over, rigged the election, secretly ordered the police to fire into Mr. Kaunda's car during a 1997 party meeting, grazing him and seriously wounding an ally, framed him on the coup charges and hopes for another chance to kill him.
Mr. Chiluba's aides say Mr. Kaunda ignored the people's will by running again, produced false witnesses saying Mr. Chiluba is Zairian, faked his own shooting, provoked the 1997 riot in which the downtown market was burned and arranged the coup attempt.
Almost every one of these charges has led to court; almost all have petered out inconclusively. The Black Mamba bombing charges were dropped for lack of evidence. The Supreme Court ruled that Mr. Chiluba did not have to take a DNA test to prove his identity. It still has not ruled on the 1996 election. The wounding of Mr. Kaunda has yet to be officially investigated.
Acknowledging that it looked as if the Government trumped up the Black Mamba case, Mr. Silwamba says the police botched it by being hasty. They do not want to repeat that mistake over the coup, he said. He denied that the Government was persecuting Mr. Kaunda.
Many Zambians view these fights as confined to the political elite.
"The average Zambian is marginalized completely, and the playing ground is being left to the politicians," said Ngande Mwanajiti, who ran the Clean Campaign Committee in 1996. As a defender of civil liberties, though, he feels threatened. "The police can come and take me away at any time."
Most Zambians, however, are just trying to get by. The standard of living today is about half what it was in 1964, when copper prices were high. Mr. Kaunda's socialism unraveled the economy, and Mr. Chiluba's bold privatization efforts have forced thousands of layoffs.
The foreign investment he hopes to attract is slow in arriving, and the budget is propped up with foreign aid. Mr. Silwamba calls that "the pity of being a poor country -- they give the money, so they want you to play the tune."
Mr. Chiluba's Government resents the fuss foreigners are suddenly making over Mr. Kaunda. They recall that Mr. Kaunda muzzled the press, jailed hundreds of political opponents and made children leave school to line the roads and wave whenever his motorcade went by. Many Zambians remember waiting all night for cooking oil or sugar, which inevitably ran out, leaving soldiers to whip angry shoppers away.
"Now," a museum guard said, "it is the opposite. There is food on the shelves -- but no money to buy it."

HEADLINE: Fed Chief Sees Benefit to U.S. In Asia Crisis

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 29

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, warned today that Asia's financial crisis would soon be felt in the United States, but said the resulting slowdown in economic growth would reduce any remaining risk of inflation derailing the nation's seven-year expansion.
Testifying before the Senate Budget Committee, Mr. Greenspan called the economy exceptionally healthy, with inflation so far remaining dormant despite strong growth, low unemployment and solid income gains. 
 Mr. Greenspan said he was not ready to conclude that inflation was no longer a threat, especially given that wages are being pushed up as employers struggle to find the workers they need. But he acknowledged that the economy could also be endangered by a rapid weakening in demand and falling prices. And he left analysts and investors with the impression that the central bank was likely to hold interest rates steady at its meeting next week and for months to come.
"We have as yet experienced only the peripheral winds of the Asian crisis," Mr. Greenspan said.
"But before spring is over," he said, the effects of tumbling currency values in Asia "will be showing through here in reductions in demand for our exports and intensified competition from imports. All of this suggests that the growth of economic activity in this country will moderate from the recent brisk pace."
Such a slowdown, Mr. Greenspan said, "would appear helpful at this juncture."
Appearing on Capitol Hill as Congress begins drafting next year's budget, Mr. Greenspan also generally supported President Clinton's call to dedicate any budget surpluses first to shoring up the ailing Social Security system. While saying that broad-based tax reductions are good for the economy, he said there was "no urgency at this point to move" on tax cuts and suggested that Republicans should wait to do so until the Government had made some progress in paying down the national debt, including its i.o.u.'s to the Social Security system.
The prospect of surpluses provides "a very useful platform to finally get to a point where the Social Security problem is something which is truly resolvable without exceptionally difficult political problems," he said.
Mr. Greenspan warned Congress not to assume that all the projections of huge surpluses in coming years would necessarily come true, and he made a veiled criticism of Mr. Clinton's array of new spending proposals.
"We must not allow the recent good news on the budget to lull us into letting down our guard," Mr. Greenspan said. "Programs can be easy to initiate or expand, but extraordinarily difficult to trim or shut down once a constituency develops that has a stake in maintaining the status quo."
The chairman also said he supported the Administration's request for $18 billion in new financing for the International Monetary Fund. Bolstering the fund, he said, will allow it to confront any future international financial crisis in a way that "minimizes their disruption and minimizes the impact on the United States."
Mr. Greenspan's statements about the spillover from the problems in South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand and their neighbors came as a senior Clinton Administration official signaled the White House's growing frustration with Japan for not doing more to stimulate its own weak economy and help the rest of Asia recover.
After months of goading Japanese diplomats in private, Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, went public today, saying in a speech here that Japan had to do more to deregulate industry, open up its economy to trade and spur domestic demand.
"Japan, as the world's second-largest economy, must play a more active role in helping to bring Asia out of its current economic crisis," Ms. Barshefsky said. "Its efforts to date have been woefully inadequate."
Like Mr. Greenspan, Administration officials and private economists expect the United States trade deficit to surge in coming months. Because the dollar has risen sharply in value relative to Asian currencies, they are projecting that American companies, whose products are now more expensive in foreign markets, will see their exports to the region fall off. At the same time imports of goods from Asian competitors, which are falling in price in dollar terms, will rise sharply.
The cheap foreign goods will help hold down inflation, Mr. Greenspan said.
"But they will not permanently suppress the risks inherent in tightened labor markets," he added.
So far, improvements in productivity have made up for the increased wages employers are being forced to pay to attract workers at a time when the unemployment rate, at 4.7 percent, is near a quarter-century low. But Mr. Greenspan continued to caution that it was unclear how long that pattern could hold.
"As a consequence, we must be vigilant to the re-emergence of destabilizing influences -- both higher inflation, and shortfalls in demand and decreases in some prices that would press the disinflation process too far, too fast," Mr. Greenspan said.

HEADLINE: A New Era Of Wheeling And Dealing;
Rising Competition Squeezes Car Sellers

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 29

 BODY:
When James Bordoshuk shopped for a Ford Explorer seven years ago, he lugged his young children to one showroom after another over several weekends and haggled for hours. He finally bought the sport utility vehicle from a dealership three miles away from his home -- one of 42 Ford dealers in metropolitan Chicago.
Last August, when Mr. Bordoshuk decided he wanted another Explorer, he took a different approach. He went on the Internet to check wholesale prices. Then he turned to an Internet buying service and ordered the vehicle from a dealer 18 miles away, bypassing a dealership only a mile from his home. In fact, he made his only trip to a showroom when he drove the Explorer home. 
 "I wouldn't do it any other way," Mr. Bordoshuk said.
After nearly a century of making comfortable livings selling cars in their immediate areas, car dealers now face one of the most difficult environments in years. Despite buoyant sales of cars and trucks, 850 dealerships have closed since 1992. Pretax profit margins are now wafer thin, and many experts predict that hundreds of dealerships will close within the next five years.
Thanks to the Internet, almost anyone selling the same product is a potential competitor whether the showroom is in the next town or the next state. The used-car lot and the service department, long big moneymakers, are facing fresh competition from superstore used-car chains and specialized repair stores. And in an unexpected turn, the improvement in car quality and longer-lived components are producing a dark side for dealers: lucrative warranty repairs have declined and tuneups are few and far between.
Dealers are also being squeezed by big players entering the business. Publicly traded companies with wads of Wall Street capital are buying dozens of dealerships, hoping to operate chains with money-saving efficiencies. Even the manufacturers have gotten into the act. They are buying out some dealerships and shutting them down.
Strong auto sales for the last four years have helped even the weakest dealers. But given the high rate of attrition among dealerships during recent recessions, the next sales slump could drive far more dealers out of business. When auto dealers from across the country gather in New Orleans this weekend for their annual convention, competition will be Topic A; not whether it will continue to increase, but how quickly.
A few experts, like Mark Rikess, a Los Angeles-based consultant to 400 dealerships, predict that up to half the nation's dealerships will disappear within five years, even without a recession. "Margins are continuing to tumble across the board, and will tumble severely in the next two to three years," Mr. Rikess said. "It's just going to be too difficult to make a return on investment."
Many dealers say that such predictions are too gloomy. Dealers are learning to use the Internet themselves, while constantly re-evaluating ways to stay competitive, said John P. Peterson, a Pontiac and GMC dealer in Bloomington, Minn.
Car dealers have overcome difficulties before, such as rising gas prices in the 1970's and high interest rates in the 1980's, he said, adding, "Not many of us run and hide and not many of us get out of the business."
But many dealers are clearly concerned, particularly about the Internet. A survey released earlier this month by J. D. Power & Associates, a consulting firm, found that only 10 percent of dealers viewed the Internet as a help, while 48 percent saw it as a threat.
Traditionally, dealers tried to stay out of each other's way to avoid needless competition. Auto makers have long assigned territories to dealers, although several of them can share an area in large cities. Though nothing prevents car buyers from traveling across these imaginary lines to check prices, time-consuming haggling has discouraged most buyers from doing so.
But the Internet now allows some dealers to market their low-cost cars to anyone with a computer and a modem. There has also been a rapid proliferation of car buying services on the Internet that take orders from buyers and forward them to dealers willing to sell at close to invoice prices.
These buying services charge up to $3,500 a month to dealers in exchange for referring buyers. The services have generally concluded that there are far more dealerships in the United States than are really necessary, because Americans are willing to drive greater distances to buy cars. Auto-by-Tel, which arranged for Mr. Bordoshuk to buy his Ford Explorer, has stopped recruiting new dealers now that it has a network of 2,700 dealers around the country. But that is still only an eighth of the dealers in the United States.
All told, roughly 1 in 5 auto purchases is made by buyers who consult the Internet or a traditional car buying service that for a fee helps buyers locate the car and price they want. Only a few years ago, just about 1 in 10 buyers consulted an intermediary. About a third of those who consult the Internet or a buying service actually buy cars through them, while many of the other buyers use the prices they obtain to wrangle better bargains from nearby dealers.
Either way, the result is that showroom profits are being squeezed and on-line services are growing. Executives at on-line buying services acknowledge that they are making life more difficult for many dealers. "We allow a dealer to reach other dealers' customers, and get their customers," said Frank Zamani, the chief executive of Autoweb.com. The typical buyer who uses the Internet winds up driving twice as far to purchase a vehicle as a traditional buyer, Mr. Zamani added.
Auto makers are encouraging the consolidation of dealerships, concluding that many dealers are needlessly competing with others selling the same brands. But auto executives are trying to avoid panicking dealers by suggesting that there will be widespread closings.
"I don't see it as being a fast process," said John F. Smith Jr., the chairman and chief executive of the General Motors Corporation. "I see it as a slow process."
An extreme example of long-distance auto marketing has been unfolding in Kellogg, Idaho, a rural town of 2,600 people where a Dodge dealership, Dave Smith Motors, has been selling nearly 4,000 cars and light trucks a year. Using low prices and traditional marketing methods -- giving solid gold coins to people who refer buyers -- as well as the Internet, the dealership has drawn customers from as far as Seattle, some 300 miles to the west. It even provides a shuttle service from the airport in Spokane, Wash., for buyers who fly in and drive their purchases home.
Rival dealers in the region are furious, and they have complained bitterly to the Chrysler Corporation that Dave Smith Motors should not be allowed to buy so many vehicles from the manufacturer, particularly popular full-size Dodge Ram pickups.
But Chrysler has continued to ship ever more vehicles to the dealership in northern Idaho, while trying to reassure smaller dealers that they, too, can increase sales if they improve customer service and attract more buyers by word of mouth.
General Motors and the Ford Motor Company have been more cautious than Chrysler in shipping lots of high-profit vehicles to successful dealers, but they are consolidating dealerships. Ford agreed this winter to set up a joint venture with its dealers in Tulsa, Okla., for example.
The company's plan is to buy all eight Ford and Lincoln-Mercury dealerships in Tulsa and close at least half of them. It will also open several shops that service cars but do not sell them. G.M. is acquiring a dozen of its dealerships in the San Fernando Valley, north of downtown Los Angeles, with the goal of closing many of them and consolidating the rest under a single owner.
But factory takeovers of showrooms are few compared with acquisitions by publicly traded companies. Until late 1996, auto makers resisted the idea of publicly held companies controlling dealers, fearing that the manufacturers would lose control of their distribution systems. But they now say that corporate management and deep pockets could prove useful in transforming the business.
Republic Industries, run by H. Wayne Huizenga, who has already made a fortune consolidating the nation's waste disposal business and the video rental business, has been the busiest acquirer of dealerships. Mr. Huizenga has amassed 52 dealer groups with a total of 268 franchises, mostly clustered in big cities in the South.
With competition eroding showroom profits, some experts suggest that the next area of trouble could come in service and parts departments. Most service business comes from new-car customers. But as quality has improved, repairs are more likely to come to light later, when the vehicles are in the hands of second owners, who tend to use independent garages. Auto service and parts chains, owned by companies like the Penske Corporation, have also taken away from dealerships much of the high-profit oil and lube business. Now they are moving into more complicated repairs.
With all these changes happening simultaneously, profit margins are under pressure in every area of a dealership, said George E. Hoffer, an economics professor at Virginia Commonwealth University who specializes in the business. "Consolidation in auto industry retailing," he said, "is inevitable."

Charts/Photos: "Let's Make a Deal ... Please"
Despite strong sales, auto dealers should expect to see fewer of their peers this weekend in New Orleans at their annual convention. Dealerships are threatened as consumers embrace buying through the Internet and superstore car chains.
 
INTERNET -- In a recent survey, 48 percent of dealers saw Internet sites like Auto-by-Tel as a threat to their business. Chart shows dealers signed up with Auto-by-Tel (in thousands) from 1995 through the last quarter of 1997*. (*Fourth quarter 1997 figure is estimated.)
 
LONG-DISTANCE MARKETING -- Relying on low prices, the Internet and other marketing methods, Dave Smith Motors in Kellogg, Idaho, sells 4,000 cars and light trucks a year in a town with a population of 2,600. Rival dealers are worried. Charts show the breakdown (service and parts, used cars, and new car sales) as the overall share of sales and share of profits (figures are averages for dealers nationwide) for the years 1985 and 1997*. (*Through November)
 
SUPERSTORES -- Mostly concentrated in Southern cities, these used and new car chains draw customers away from smaller dealerships.

HEADLINE: After Derailing Trade Bill, Labor Sets Ambitious Goals

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 29

 BODY:
Looking for new legislative successes after blocking President Clinton's fast-track trade bill last year, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. outlined an ambitious legislative agenda today that would raise the minimum wage and require employers to pay at least 75 percent of workers' health insurance premiums.
At an executive council meeting here, the group's leaders also voiced support for bills that would require employers with more than 50 workers to offer pensions and would bar companies from paying part-time workers less an hour than they pay full-time workers who do equivalent work. 
 At a news conference, John Sweeney, the president of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, also said the federation would oppose new Federal outlays to the International Monetary Fund unless the fund did more to protect workers' interests when it imposed austerity programs on third-world countries.
Peggy Taylor, the federation's legislative director, said the 13-million-member group hoped that some proposals, especially a minimum wage increase, would be enacted this year. But she acknowledged that others, like a proposal to require employers to pay three-fourths of health insurance premiums, were long-term goals that the federation hoped would eventually be passed after years of building support.
"Some of what we're doing here is to set out how things ought to be," Ms. Taylor said.
Federation officials voiced confidence that at least some of their legislative proposals could win approval in a Republican-controlled Congress even if the sex scandal swirling around President Clinton undercut his ability to push through legislation.
"I think it's too early to say this legislative agenda will be in trouble because of what's happening with the President," said one senior federation official. "The Republicans respond to what the public wants, and the public has responded very well to these proposals."
Union officials said they adopted the proposals after surveying union members and the public. This polling found that Americans were optimistic about the economy, but still feared losing basics like health insurance.
While acknowledging that wages have started to rise faster than inflation, Mr. Sweeney said, "Working families remain deeply concerned over their long-range future because of the growing cost of education as well as growing gaps in some of the basics no American family should be without: health care and pension coverage."
Federation officials noted that even though unemployment was dropping, the number of Americans without health insurance had climbed to more than 40 million. According to a new study commissioned by the labor federation, the uninsured population has risen principally because employers have increasingly embraced plans that raise the premiums and deductibles that workers must pay. As a result many financially pressed workers have decided to forgo insurance.
Union leaders aim to make health insurance more affordable with their proposal to require that businesses with more than 50 workers pay 75 percent of premiums. The federation sees this as an attractive proposal that Democrats can rally behind to help them in this November's Congressional elections. Currently, 32 percent of American workers who have health insurance end up paying more than 25 percent of their health care costs
But business groups attacked labor's proposal. Asserting that it would create a new mandate that would cost employers hundreds of millions of dollars, Thomas J. Donohue, president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, said, "What they don't understand is that this piling-on of mandates from labor unions and the Clinton Administration is posing a threat to businesses' continuing to provide health coverage at all."
Business leaders are also alarmed about the federation's proposal to require corporations to provide pensions -- another mandate that employers insist would result in astronomical costs.
Even with a Republican majority in Congress, labor leaders predict that they can get a higher minimum wage enacted by wooing enough Republicans to join Democrats to muster a majority. The federation helped push through a higher minimum wage two years ago by doing just that, and the minimum rose to $5.15 an hour from $4.25 as of last September.
When President Clinton called for a higher minimum in his State of the Union Message on Tuesday, Democrats applauded, but Congressional Republicans were conspicuously silent.
"Two years ago there were very few people who thought we could get an increase in the minimum wage Mr. Sweeney said, "I would hope the minimum wage would be brought up over a period of time to a level where these workers could keep up with the standard of living."
He called for increasing the minimum and then letting it rise automatically each year with inflation, a formula that would eliminate the perennial political battles on the minimum wage. Some federation officials are backing a bill, proposed by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, that would raise the minimum by 50 cents a year for three years.
Randy Johnson, the chamber's director of Congressional affairs, opposed a higher minimum, saying: "It's too soon. We still don't know what the effect of the last one was."
Federation officials said they would back President Clinton's plans to increase spending on child care and education and would work closely with him to strengthen Social Security's finances.
Ms. Taylor said it appeared that the White House would not seek to push through a fast-track trade bill again this year. Last year, unions were pivotal in derailing the bill, which would have made it easier to negotiate free-trade agreements with more countries.
Ms. Taylor said, "The feeling is the Administration doesn't have enough political capital to push through fast-track and additional I.M.F. funding in a campaign year."
The federation's executive council approved a resolution today stating that the United States should condition its proposed $18 billion in new contributions to the monetary fund "on fundamental changes in the I.M.F.'s program."
The federation said the fund should provide money to nations only if they allow basic human rights and labor rights.
"We have an interest in having Asian currencies stabilized," Ms. Taylor said. "We don't want a worldwide depression. We have hundreds of thousands of jobs at stake. But that doesn't mean we should give the I.M.F. the money no matter what."

HEADLINE: Exile Group Seeks More Aid for Cuba, With Strings Attached

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Jan. 29

 BODY:
In a move to undermine a bill that would allow the sale of food and medicine to Cuba, a leading Cuban exile organization said today that it would try to increase the amount of humanitarian aid to the island by having international relief agencies distribute such assistance.
The group, the Cuban-American National Foundation, the most politically prominent exile group and a staunch advocate of tight trade restrictions against Cuba, said that it was seeking Federal legislation or a Presidential order to permit more humanitarian aid, including United States Government assistance, as long as it is distributed directly to needy Cubans. The group said that with groups like the Red Cross distributing the aid, the Cuban Government could not benefit by levying taxes or assessing unwarranted costs. 
 The officials said that they had developed only the "nonnegotiable principles" of their plan and that other details had not been worked out. They said that no relief agency had agreed to participate yet.
But Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who heads the Foreign Relations Committee, has endorsed the proposal, which includes exploring use of the Federal "Food for Peace" program.
The foundation's announcement does not signal a softening in the group's position as much as a tactical maneuver to derail a bill that they believe would weaken the embargo. It is also a response to growing criticism of the embargo here and abroad, the officials said.
Today's announcement came less than a week after Pope John Paul II, in his recent visit to Cuba, repeated his opposition to the trade sanctions.
But the plan has created a rift over tactics among conservative exiles who are unwavering supporters of the embargo and usually present a united front on Cuba policy. Two Cuban-American House members from Florida, Representatives Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, both Republicans, broke ranks with the group, saying its idea needlessly opens a new debate over the embargo and invites legislation that could end up being very different from what was intended.
In a statement, the two said that the embargo already allowed private donations of food, medicine and clothes to Cuba, and that if a problem existed it was that "Fidel Castro has never allowed food and medicine to flow freely to the Cuban people."
But embargo supporters have been put on the defensive by the embargo's failure to spur democratic change in Cuba after nearly 40 years and by increasing criticism that they are adding to the misery of the Cuban people. This month, as the Pope drew attention to Cuba's humanitarian needs, a large coalition of American business groups and religious and human rights organizations announced their support for a bill that would allow Cuba to buy food, medicine and other medical supplies from American companies.
Officials with the foundation conceded that their proposal was more a political move than a realistic one because they doubted the Cuban Government would accept their conditions. But they said it was meant to put the onus on President Fidel Castro of Cuba, who, they said, had used the hardships inflicted by the embargo to gain international sympathy and as a source of blame for problems on the island.
"This is a way to unmask the Cuban regime," said Jorge Mas Santos, son of the late chairman of the foundation, Jorge Mas Canosa.
Today, one of the sponsors of the bill that would allow sales of humanitarian items to Cuba, Representative Esteban E. Torres, Democrat of California, said free trade between the United States and Cuba was the best way of meeting humanitarian needs on the island.
"My response to these well-intended relief initiatives is to restate our central goal: Let's provide trade, not aid," Mr. Torres said in a statement. "That is the principle that motivates U.S. global policy, and it certainly has relevance to current economic problems and needs in Cuba."

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
Park Avenue Hotel Being Converted Into Condos

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Aiming for the top of the Manhattan residential market, the owner of the Mayfair Hotel at the corner of Park Avenue and 65th Street is spending $55 million to convert the 1925 building into 70 luxury condominiums.
The sponsor of the conversion, to be completed in September, is Park 65th Associates L.P., an affiliate of Colony Capital, a real estate investment group in Los Angeles. The company bought the 15-story hotel at 610 Park Avenue for $15 million at a foreclosure sale in July 1996 and closed it last March. 
 Initially, Colony had intended to maintain the Mayfair as a hotel. But the principal in charge of East Coast assets, Lawrence A. Kestin, said that Colony switched because "we felt the conversion was economically more viable, since there was a pent-up demand for large luxury prewar condominiums."
The Trump Organization is helping to develop and construct the apartments, which replace 210 hotel rooms. A Manhattan brokerage, the Sunshine Group, is the exclusive sales agent.
The building entrance has been relocated to Park Avenue from 65th Street.
The conversion highlights several characteristics of residential development in Manhattan. One is that it is a condominium, underscoring what brokers and developers say is buyers' increasing preference for their flexibility over the restrictions of cooperatives.
The Mayfair joins several recently built or converted condos. They include the 76-unit Siena on 76th Street between Third and Lexington Avenues and the Trump International Hotel and Tower, with 168 units, at 59th Street and Central Park West.
Additional condos are planned. Last year 8 plans, representing 423 apartments in new or converted buildings, were accepted for filing, according to the State Attorney General's office, which reviews condo plans before sales proceed. About 15 additional projects, totaling 2,045 apartments, are in development, according to Marketing Directors Inc., a marketing and brokerage concern. Among them is a 35-story building with one apartment per floor at 60th Street and Park Avenue. Construction is to begin in midsummer.
The conversion at 610 Park Avenue also reflects buyers' appetite for large prewar-style units. Because of limited construction, the demand outstrips the supply, brokers said.
Such buildings typically have spacious apartments with entrance foyers, 10-foot-high ceilings, elaborate moldings and fireplaces. Larger apartments also have maids' rooms, separate dining rooms and full kitchens.
The Real Estate Board of New York recorded the median per-square-foot sales price at $321 for the 226 prewar condominiums sold from July through September, up from $273 for the 191 units sold in that period in 1996. The board attributes the rise largely to increased sales of luxury units, primarily on the East Side.
Since sales started in the summer at 610 Park Avenue, contracts have been signed on all but three apartments in the brick-and-limestone neo-Gothic building. The apartments have 986 to 4,400 square feet and are priced from $700,000 to $7.4 million.
In the sales campaign, the average per-square-foot selling price rose, to $1,100 from $950, said Louise Sunshine, head of the sales agent. Buyers have primarily been Manhattan residents or people with a pied-a-terre in the city, Ms. Sunshine added.
Marketing Directors said Trump International was the only other project where the average per-square-foot price broke the $1,000-a-foot level for new apartments.
Each apartment, designed by Costas Kondylis & Associates, will have nine-foot coffered ceilings, entrance foyers, wood herringbone floors and seven-inch base moldings. A typical 2,000-square-foot two-bedroom unit will have a 20-by-20-foot living room. Some apartments will also have libraries and fireplaces.
The building reflects a trend toward increased services. Owners will be offered the services of Daniel Boulud, chef of Restaurant Daniel, which in December will open a 12,000-square-foot establishment in the lobby. The services include, for a fee, preparing and serving meals in the condos and advice on managing wine collections.
Maid service and valet parking will be available. Among the planned amenities is a fitness center, which is included in the monthly maintenance fees. The fees range from $1,250 to $7,500, including real estate taxes.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
S.& P. 500 at Record Close On Low-Inflation Outlook

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Expectations of lower inflation lifted stocks yesterday for a third consecutive session, propelling the Standard & Poor's 500 index to a new closing high.
The market's exuberance was fueled by comments by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who told the Senate Budget Committee that slower United States economic growth as a result of the financial crisis in Asia would have a positive effect, helping to ward off inflation. His words were also taken as a sign that interest rates would not be increased anytime soon. 
 His comments lifted the bond market and reversed an early selloff caused by concern about earnings.
The rally in stocks was helped by gains among technology and telecommunications shares and by cyclical stocks, which tend to benefit from low interest rates. Makers of consumer staples benefited, too.
In addition, oil, gas and other energy stocks were broadly higher as expectations of a United States military attack on Iraq raised oil prices and dampened expectations of excessive supply.
Mr. Greenspan's comments followed strong earnings reports earlier this week from a number of companies, including Disney, Coca-Cola and United Airlines.
"This is a feel-better rally," said Marshall Acuff, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney.
"Investors had time to sort through the month of January, earnings are better and the Far East isn't getting any worse. And Greenspan sounded reassuring that growth was still solid without any problems with inflation."
The S.& P. 500 closed at 985.49, up 8.03 points, just eclipsing its previous closing high of 983.79 on Dec. 5. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 57.55 points, to 7,973.02. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite jumped 8.67 points, to 1,619.49.
While investors took heart from the recent flow of positive earnings reports, in reality, corporate earnings are in line with expectations, said Chuck Hill, director of research at the First Call Corporation.
So far 308 companies in the S.& P. 500, or about 62 percent, have reported their most recent quarter's results. Of those, 50 percent have come in above analysts' expectations, 23 percent have been in line with forecasts and 27 percent have been below estimates. Those figures are in line with quarterly averages going back to 1994 and suggest that on average fourth-quarter earnings will be about 2.2 percent above expectations over all, which is in line with previous years, he said.
In fact, Mr. Hill said that companies' reports were being compared with expectations that analysts had earlier reduced. He added that analysts were cutting their forecasts for the first quarter.
And while the S.& P. reached a new high yesterday, the Dow has failed to maintain a break through 8,000, a ceiling it has been struggling with since its record high of 8,259.31 on Aug. 6. The last time the Dow closed above 8,000 was Dec. 9.
"I don't like to see the averages get out of gear," said Richard McCabe, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch. "I'd like to see if the Dow can catch up. It's a little bit of a divergence, but I don't think it's a major problem now."
The S.& P. was able to reach a new high because it has a high concentration of companies that make consumer staples, pharmaceuticals and beverages. These are attractive when investors fear slower earnings growth and greater market volatility over all, as was the case as the year began, Mr. McCabe said.
The stock of the Keebler Foods Company, the cookie and cracker company, gained 2 13/16, to 26 13/16, on its first day of trading. The company sold 11.6 million shares at $24 in its initial public offering.

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases;
Ready to Work, After Battling Mental Illness

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
Darius Hayward is between jobs. Almost a month has passed since his holiday-season stint as a Toys "R" Us stock clerk, and he does not relish the feeling of joblessness. On the other hand, he finds a certain pleasure in telling people he is temporarily unemployed, because until November, Mr. Hayward, 36, had never held a job.
For nearly a decade, he was in and out of the psychiatric ward of Brookdale Hospital Medical Center, fighting off the taunting voices he heard in his head. Until last year, it was a major effort for him simply to get out of bed. 
 "It gets boring being in the hospital day after day," said Mr. Hayward, whose paranoid schizophrenia was diagnosed when he was 22. "In fact, it wasn't any fun at all."
He caromed from one anti-psychotic regimen to the next, and until he started taking monthly doses of Haldol last year, nothing seemed to silence the voices. "Either the drugs would make me sick or just make me want to sleep," he said.
Before the onset of his illness, Mr. Hayward says his life was unremarkable. He lived with his mother and grandmother in Brownsville, Brooklyn, spent his free time playing basketball and, after graduating from high school, attended Wiley College in Texas. "I was the happiest kid on earth," recalled Mr. Hayward, a genteel, soft-spoken man with a neatly trimmed goatee.
But during his sophomore year, he began to hear the whispered taunts. One night he was arrested for disorderly conduct at an off-campus fast-food restaurant and jailed for four days, although he does not recall what he had done. Expelled from Wiley, he transferred to a college in Alabama, where he stayed only a few semesters. He returned to Brooklyn to live with his mother, and the voices became increasingly cruel, ridiculing his every move. "It was like I had the devil sitting on my shoulder," he said. When his delusions became unbearable, his mother had him hospitalized.
As his condition stabilized with medication, he moved back home. Pleased with his recovery, a psychiatrist referred him last spring to a job-training program run by the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The bureau has helped hundreds of formerly institutionalized adults find jobs as porters, messengers and sales clerks. "The employees we've hired are consistent, efficient and take pride in their work," said Lee Waxman, the owner of Vita Plus, a natural-food store in downtown Brooklyn, of his referrals from the program.
During his six months in the bureau's retail training program, Mr. Hayward learned the fundamentals of good customer service: keep smiling, try to make helpful suggestions, never chew gum and arrive on time.
Punctuality was never a problem for Mr. Hayward; most days he arrived 20 minutes early for his shift at the Toys "R" Us on Fulton Street, where he restocked shelves, fed the trash compactor and climbed a ladder to help customers reach merchandise. "It was a lot of fun," said Mr. Hayward, who saved $250 during the holiday season.
Gail Elias, the coordinator of the retail training program, says Mr. Hayward has been a role model for other participants, many of whom arrive timid and fearful but graduate with self-confidence. "Darius really wants to succeed," she said. "I don't think he'll have any problem finding another job." On Monday, he has an interview at Kmart that Ms. Elias helped arrange.
While he seeks a job, Mr. Hayward spends his days at his immaculate apartment in Brownsville. Family photos are carefully arranged along his living-room wall and a shelf displays a half-dozen basketball and baseball trophies. He rarely plays sports anymore, he said, "because I can't make those fancy moves like I used to."
Mr. Hayward has been living on his own for the last three years on disability benefits, since his mother, grandmother and brother died. He has overcome a stutter, and he smiles more than ever. "I used to avoid people, but now I like talking to everyone," he said.
Now confident in his ability to hold a job, he says he is ready to take the next big step. "I've proven that I can take care of myself," he said. "Now I want to prove that I can support a family."

On Asian Crisis Balance Sheet, Credits and Debits for the U.S.

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
For drivers who pull into gasoline stations these days, the Asian crisis is a blessing. Falling demand for oil in Asia has helped to cut the average price of a gallon of regular gasoline in the United States to $1.08, from $1.20 last month. Not since 1989 has gasoline been so cheap. Home owners are similarly blessed. Thanks largely to the crisis, interest rates have fallen and the number of mortgage refinancings is higher than ever.
But for Caterpillar Inc., the crisis is not much fun at all -- demand for its heavy construction equipment, until recently so strong in Asia, has "declined sharply" as building projects have been canceled. For Eastman Chemical, the crisis blows fair and foul. Chemicals and plastics, the products it makes, have fallen in price as demand in Asia has fallen. But the price of a $20 million plastics plant that Eastman is building in Malaysia is shrinking, thanks to the falling currency there. The Limited is a winner for similar reasons. Making stylish blouses, sports clothes and underwear in Asia is suddenly less costly, which means a windfall profit for the big retailer, or the leeway to lower ticket prices in America, or a bit of both. 
In many ways, both positive and negative, the Asian crisis is affecting American businesses and consumers.
Most forecasters hold that by summer the entire economy could very well be growing more slowly, battered down by Asia. Indeed, many say that the more widespread the problems in Asia become, the more they would affect American businesses that rely on business abroad, and the more they could threaten the health of American stock markets.
But whatever the future holds, in the present, the Asian turmoil has produced a surprise -- throwing off enough pluses in America to dilute the minuses.
"The Asian crisis is real," said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Company, an investment consultant. "But even as it takes away with one hand, it gives with the other."
What it is giving, more than anything else, is lower interest rates, making home and car loans cheaper. Weakening global demand coupled with overproduction of many goods -- felt most powerfully in Asia, where the crisis has crippled currencies, disrupted businesses and dried up lending over the last six months -- helps to explain the decline in rates here. So does an influx of investment in American government securities from investors looking for a safer bet than Asia. Home construction is strong, and so are vehicle sales. These two huge industries are giving the American economy a powerful if perhaps temporary boost. "Most data still depict a solid path for economic growth," Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, recently told clients.
Some members of Congress said the prospect of consumers benefiting in some way from the Asian crisis without any immediate economic problems had made it somewhat harder to justify American involvement in the international bailouts of South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia. Among other things, they said, it is difficult to convey a sense of urgency about the Clinton Administration's request for $18 billion to bolster the ability of the International Monetary Fund to deal with any future crises.
But those who support the bailouts said that in their conversations with American business leaders, most executives were deeply concerned about the implications of the Asia crisis for their profits, their competitiveness and their ability to continue creating new jobs.
"The concern about lost jobs more than offsets the benefits of cheaper goods," said David Runkel, the spokesman for Representative Jim Leach, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the House Banking Committee.
Mr. Steinberg's latest weekly advisory lists the damage that he sees ahead -- particularly a "horrendous deterioration" in the trade balance as cheaper Asian goods arrive in the United States while American exports, made more expensive by the strong dollar, dry up.
Basing their predictions on the expected trade damage, many forecasters estimate that the Asian crisis will in time shave half a percentage point from the nation's annual economic growth, which was more than 3.5 percent last year.
Nonetheless, the pluses from the Asian crisis pop up frequently, and in unexpected ways. South Korea, for example, rarely purchased soybean meal from America. But over the last four weeks, it has suddenly bought 200,000 tons of this staple. Seeking to shield American farmers from the Asian damage, the Agriculture Department in late December guaranteed the repayment of $1 billion in Korean loans for the purchase of American food.
"No one had penciled in Korea as a buyer of American soybeans," said Robert Kohlmeyer, a grain specialist, "and now their soybean purchases explain why food exports to Asia are still strong."
Crude oil prices have fallen by nearly 30 percent since last summer. The unusually warm American winter has helped by reducing the demand for heating oil. A sharp rise in worldwide oil production is another big factor. But Asia looms largest.
"Until a few months ago," said John H. Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, "explosive growth in the demand for oil came out of Asia. Now that is gone, and suddenly there is too much oil. You are likely to see in 1998 not only the lowest price in years for gasoline, but also for jet fuel, diesel and heating oil. That is a bonanza for consumers."
The Limited appears to be enjoying a similar bonanza, one that will soon show up as a combination of lower retail prices in America and higher profits, the company said. Weaker Asian currencies make whatever is produced in the region less expensive in dollars. And rising unemployment in Indonesia, Sri Lanka and the Philippines holds down the wages of those who make The Limited's clothing there.
"Even outside Asia, where currencies have not devalued, our suppliers are sensing the competitive pressures from Asia and they are holding back on what they charge us," said Martin Trust, president of the Limited's manufacturing arm. That is the case, he said, in Mexico, a big supplier for the retail chain.
Often the pluses are coupled with the minuses. The world, for example, is awash in petrochemicals and plastics, partly because of rising production in Asia as demand there falls. The prices of these products, naturally, are falling and that squeezes Eastman Chemical of Kingsport, Tenn. On the plus side, however, the company is not only saving money in constructing its new plastics plant in Malaysia but also in building a petrochemical operation in Singapore.
Vehicle sales remain strong -- roughly 15 million cars and trucks a year, the same high level for nearly four years. But while American car makers gain ground in the marketing of expensive sport utility vehicles, two Korean companies, Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors, are making modest gains in the American subcompact market, having nearly doubled their combined sales in December, to 22,600 vehicles, from November's 12,300. Some Hyundai models sell today for $8,500, down $1,000 from last year.
Similarly, the nation's agricultural exports are holding up, thanks in part to the $40 million in soybean meal sold to Korea this month. But grain prices have fallen, hurting farmers. Despite the Korean sales, soybeans, for example, are off more than 25 cents a bushel since Dec. 1, closing last week at $6.70. "You would be a fool if you tried to sort out all the reasons for the price declines," said Mr. Kohlmeyer, the grain specialist, "but there is no doubt that in people's minds, Asia looms largest."
The damage to fourth-quarter earnings showed up particularly at three giant money center banks -- J. P. Morgan & Company, Citicorp and the Chase Manhattan Corporation. All are struggling to hold down losses from Asian loans and from trading in the region's currencies. But even as they struggle, the banks are finding opportunity in the crisis. Chase, for example, is the newly hired chief financial adviser to three troubled companies in Indonesia and Thailand.
"You adjust your fees so that you collect a little up front, and substantially more down the road when these companies are healthy again," said Robert Fallon, chief of Chase's Asia-Pacific division.
For Ronald Bullock, president of the Bison Gear and Engineering Company, near Chicago, sorting out the pluses and minuses is like trying to solve Rubik's cube. His company makes electric motors. The copper and manganese he buys for these motors have fallen in price on world markets, reducing his cost. Falling demand in Asia helps to explain the falling price. But Mr. Bullock's customers in America are not as quick to buy his motors, whatever their price. They are manufacturers of motor-driven ice-making machines and soft-drink dispensers, often sold in Asia. And their orders are falling.
On top of this, electric motors made in Korea and Malaysia are coming into the American market in larger numbers, competing with Bison's product. The prices of these imports have fallen, but not by much, Mr. Bullock said. The Asians, too, must buy copper and manganese, which are priced in dollars. That is not easy when Asian currencies are falling in value.
"The inroads these competitors can make into our markets may be limited," Mr. Bullock said hopefully, "because of the dollar costs of their materials."
There is outright damage from the Asian crisis, of course, even on college campuses. Two hundred students at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa., 5 percent of the total enrollment, are from Asian countries caught in the turmoil. "They have been asking for tuition relief and more on-campus employment, which we are providing," said Lorna Hunter, dean of admissions and financial aid. "I don't see a panic, but they are watchful."
While reporting record fourth-quarter earnings, Caterpillar nevertheless noted that Asian demand for its heavy construction equipment had fallen significantly. In otherwise upbeat earnings reports, the International Business Machines Corporation and the Microsoft Corporation also warned of trouble ahead. And the Raytheon Company announced last week that its engineering and construction division would eliminate 1,000 jobs, partly because of less Asian business.
That may be just the vanguard of Asian-related downsizing. If the crisis continues, half a million jobs in the United States could be eliminated, the Economic Policy Institute concluded in a new study. Clearly the public is beginning to associate Asia with unemployment.
"In our latest poll, 10 percent of the people we interviewed spontaneously mentioned the Asia problem," said Richard Curtin, director of the University of Michigan's Consumer Surveys. "They see it as a danger to jobs and also as a source of downward pressure on prices. The job insecurity tends to inhibit shopping, and so do the falling prices. Some people are waiting for prices to get even lower."
Beyond the damage that can be measured now or in the near future, there is what some experts describe as the toll from lost opportunity -- the business that will never be done.
Wal-Mart Stores, for example, has curbed plans to expand into Asia, said Kenneth Harris, a partner at Cannondale Associates, a marketing and sales consulting firm near Chicago.
"They had not publicly spoken of going into Asia," Mr. Harris said, "so there is nothing to pull back on. They also have plenty of room to expand elsewhere. But something is lost."

For Better . . .
 
The Asian financial crisis has raised fears about the damage it could do to the American economy, but it also has had unexpected benefits.
 
FALLING PRICES Falling demand in Asia for oil and other commodities has reduced prices here.
 
FALLING INTEREST RATES With inflation lower and fewer places to lend abroad, American banks are lowering rates on mortgages and car loans to stimulate borrowing.
 
. . . and Worse
 
RISING TRADE DEFICIT As Asian countries reduce their imports and flood this market with cheaper exports, the trade gap is expected to grow.
 
FALLING PROFITS Some companies doing business in Asia have already felt the impact, and profits could be hit further.

HEADLINE: Mr. Giuliani's Budget Choices

 BODY:
With sizable budget surpluses flowing from New York City's economic boom, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani could easily have proposed major new spending programs and tax cuts for next year. Instead, he has prudently chosen to stick with fiscal discipline. The financial plan outlined by Mr. Giuliani yesterday calls for selective new expenditures for education and anti-drug programs, as well as elimination of the sales tax on clothing and other modest tax reductions. But these would be paid for with spending cuts elsewhere. His projected $35 billion budget thus lays the groundwork for economic stability in the city.
Mr. Giuliani's most flamboyant gesture was aimed at the city's community college system, which he asserts spends too much on remedial programs for students who cannot read, write or do arithmetic at college levels. In a threat certain to rile the City University's leadership and the State Legislature, he suggested he might withhold the city's portion of the community colleges' budget if they do not shut down their remedial programs and farm them out to private institutions. 
 That sounds, however, as if Mr. Giuliani has fired a warning cannon rather than proposed a realistic solution. He will need to demonstrate why he believes that a wholly new remedial approach would work better than existing remedial programs, and will have to explain what impact his approach would have on traditional open admissions policies in the community colleges.
This has been a year of budget surpluses at all levels. Earlier in the week, President Clinton took a cautious approach by proposing to set aside the first Federal surplus in 30 years for use in financing the long-term deficit in the Social Security system. By contrast, Gov. George Pataki is recklessly proposing to use New York State's surplus for a spending increase to bolster his re-election campaign.
Mr. Giuliani comes out somewhere between these two approaches. He declined to use the surplus to pay down some of the city's mountain of long-term debt, the most prudent fiscal approach. Instead he would simply close budget gaps projected for next year and the year after.
Because this is a state election year, the debate with the City Council over the budget could be especially lively. The Council Speaker, Peter Vallone, is running for governor, and he wants the city to set more money aside in a reserve fund that could be tapped in the event of an economic downturn in the years ahead. He also proposes to cut the city's personal income tax instead of the business and sales taxes that Mr. Giuliani wants to cut. But these will be quibbles over happy choices.
The Mayor's budget contains no new ideas for improving the productivity of the city's work force, including the use of civilians to replace deskbound police officers. But its priorities are generally sensible, there are very few egregious gimmicks, and the overall spending restraint reflects a sound stewardship of the city's finances.

Israel Ready to Retaliate
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said Israel would respond if Iraq attacked it in retaliation for an American military strike. Israeli officials say there is a low probability of an Iraqi missile strike and they see no imminent threat. But many Israelis have been unsettled by intense media coverage of the dangers posed by chemical and biological agents. A6
 
French Trial Suspended
The trial in France of Maurice Papon on charges of complicity in German war crimes ended its 58th session with a wave of controversy concerning the judge. Questions were raised whether the judge should step down after an unexpected assertion that he was distantly related to one of the surviving victims. The judge suspended the trial until Monday. A4
 
31 Die in Peru Avalanche
At least 31 people died when an avalanche caused by heavy rains obliterated part of a remote town in Peru's southern Andes, local officials and witnesses said. A river burst its banks some 400 miles southeast of Lima, setting off a landslide. It buried nearly 100 homes and forced hundreds of people to flee by running or swimming in the flood of mud and rocks, according to the witnesses and officials. (Reuters)
 
Explosion on Russian Sub
A naval captain was killed and at least four sailors were hurt in a gas explosion on a nuclear submarine in Russia's far north, the Russian navy said, adding that no radiation leaked. The submarine was undergoing maintenance at Zaozersk base at the time of the blast, which sent poisonous ammonia gas, used as a coolant, spewing as the workers were fixing an energy unit. (Reuters)
 
Couple Missing on Barrier Reef
An American couple is missing from a scuba-diving cruise to the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. A Queensland Emergency Services helicopter was scheduled to search the coastline on Friday for the divers, missing since Sunday, but an airplane search was called off, a police spokesman said. The police have indicated that the chances for their survival are slim. (AP)

Judge in Clinton-Jones Trial Bars Lewinsky Evidence
A Federal judge in Little Rock, Ark., ruled that lawyers representing Paula Corbin Jones in her sexual misconduct lawsuit against President Clinton could not use any evidence involving the former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky, a setback in helping them to make their case. The judge said that while information about Ms. Lewinsky might be relevant to Ms. Jones's case her participation in Ms. Jones's sexual misconduct trial could interfere with the criminal investigation being conducted by the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr. A1
 
Negotiations between Ms. Lewinsky's lawyer and Mr. Starr have stalled, lawyers said, partly because she is not offering prosecutors as much detail about her conversations with President Clinton as she reportedly disclosed to a friend on secretly recorded tapes. A1

HEADLINE: THE GIULIANI BUDGET: THE POLITICS;
Beyond Budget, Mayor Looks to Larger Stage

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
Wielding his steel pointer like a conductor's baton, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani delivered an hourlong lecture yesterday on how his administration had transformed New York City's disastrous budget into a model of fiscal prudence. Then, just when another pie-chart display could have sparked audience rebellion, he energized the room by suddenly declaring war on the City University of New York -- a tangential budgetary issue at best.
It was the masterstroke of a teacher confident in his material and presentation, not unlike a history scholar reciting a few of the Draconian codes of ancient Greece. But yesterday's subject matter extended beyond the righteousness of a tight budget and the need to fix what the Mayor said was a flawed educational system. Beneath all the verbiage about "budget stabilization accounts" and "city-funded head counts," there seemed to be a subliminal message as well: 
 Wouldn't you like this intellectually brash ex-prosecutor -- someone ready to brawl at the drop of a moral tenet -- to run your state or country the way he runs his own city?
"No rocket science is required in this," said Fred Siegel, the author of "The Future Once Happened Here," an examination of large American cities. "This year, he looks at a wider audience. His budget is consistent with the logic of his State of the City speech, and positions him to market his success in New York City as a model of what he could do on a larger stage."
Mr. Giuliani has just begun his second, and -- because of term limits -- last four-year term; at this point, he usually responds to questions about his political future with just-happy-to-be-Mayor answers. But there is no doubt that the steps he takes now, beginning with yesterday's unveiling of a $34.3 billion preliminary budget plan, are intended to establish a public-policy template that could very easily be applied to a larger body politic.
It begins with the city's budget, his fifth. Mr. Giuliani proposed an increase of only six-tenths of 1 percent in spending, which is below the rate of inflation, as well as a series of tax cuts for small businesses, commercial rentals and people buying clothes and shoes.
More telling, perhaps, is his proposed use of a $1.2 billion surplus: to close projected budget gaps over the next two years and to bolster a so-called rainy-day fund to help the city respond to the inevitable conclusion to the current Wall Street boom.
Then, under his stated rubric that "everything is a budget issue," the Mayor shifted attention to the city's six community colleges, all of which operate under the CUNY umbrella. Because the city contributes about $110 million a year to CUNY, Mr. Giuliani found fiscal justification to blast an educational system that he says deludes many students into thinking they are prepared for higher learning.
He laid out a plan to have all CUNY community college students take a proficiency examination. Those who pass could continue in the two-year colleges; the rest, which he guessed would be about 75 percent, would take remedial classes overseen by some outside institution hired to do the job. Citing an extremely low graduation rate after two years, he said: "It cannot get worse. It can only get better."
In the past, the Mayor's austere policies, the kind best delivered through pursed lips, have been criticized as too moralistic, too severe. But on the budget plan, at least, Peter F. Vallone, the City Council Speaker; Alan G. Hevesi, the City Comptroller, and even H. Carl McCall, the State Comptroller whose battles with the Mayor have raised the art of vitriol, all praised Mr. Giuliani for resisting the temptation to spend away the surplus.
Clearly enjoying their we-told-you-so moment, the Mayor and his advisers were quick to note that the administration's handling of the billion-dollar surplus, the second in a row for the city, stands in marked contrast to the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch, which spent the city's last round of surpluses on social services and other programs -- not on closing budget gaps.
Beyond the history lessons, mayoral advisers also swiftly contrasted Mr. Giuliani's budget to that of Gov. George E. Pataki, whom the Mayor endorsed for re-election during a visit to Albany this week. Mr. Pataki ended his pattern of fiscal austerity by proposing a 7.6 percent increase in spending, which some critics say represents artless pandering in a gubernatorial election year.
Here are the comments of Raymond B. Harding, one of the Mayor's closest political confidants: "As part of restoring the fiscal soundness of the city, the Mayor resisted the temptation -- which the Governor did not -- during a period of surplus to come out with a Christmas tree financial plan. I can't think of a more responsible thing to do."
The implication, of course, is that Mr. Pataki comes off as somewhat less responsible than Mr. Giuliani (who, by the way, was unable to resist spending a little extra last year when facing an election of his own).
Mr. Giuliani was not about to waste yesterday's assembly of television cameras and reporters on budget matters alone. Pointing to a chart titled "Raising CUNY Community College Standards" -- one of 41 displayed during his presentation -- the Mayor laid out his assault on the CUNY system with jaw jutting. Of the conflagration almost certain to follow, he said, "I enjoy big battles" -- an understatement that prompted guffaws a bit too loud from his team of deputy mayors.
"He clearly sees it as a winner for him," said Kevin McCabe, the senior political adviser to the Council Speaker, Mr. Vallone. "And he's done this throughout his career here. He raises the bar to a level where it gets a lot of attention. He sets the parameters of the debate. And then he negotiates his way back to declare victory."
Whether Mr. Giuliani's budget withstands the five months of scrutiny and negotiation that lay ahead remains to be seen. The Citizens Budget Commission, a private fiscal-watchdog panel gifted in its ability to irritate the Mayor, has already characterized his fiscal prudence as an illusion. The same uncertainty surrounds his drastic education plan, given that it needs the approval of state officials and a CUNY board already girding for battle.
Even so, as he stood alongside his charts, the Mayor looked every bit the part of Mr. Giuliani the teacher, ready to dispense the castor oil in his drawer, eager to share a lesson plan with other, larger schools. As Mr. Siegel, the author, said, the Giuliani plan contains the following instruction: "My values are yours. I'm moving in your direction."

HEADLINE: Reuters Unit Is Investigated Over Theft of a Rival's Data

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD 

 BODY:
Federal prosecutors are investigating whether an American subsidiary of Reuters Holdings P.L.C., the news and financial data giant, commissioned computer specialists to steal confidential information from the corporate computers of a major competitor, Bloomberg L.P.
The inquiry, under way for close to a year, has included an undercover investigation of the subsidiary, Reuters Analytics Inc., people who have been briefed on the case said. At least one confidential informant was said to have helped the Government obtain an array of evidence during the investigation, including audio recordings of executives. In the apparent scheme, Reuters was said to have obtained information from Bloomberg's operating code, which governs how the company's data terminals work. 
 The case has emerged at a time of increasingly heated competition in the financial data industry. The two companies -- far and away the largest in the business -- have been battling to increase the number of investment institutions that use their services to help decide which stocks, bonds and other investments to trade.
Already, the investigation has begun to reach the London headquarters of Reuters. During the summer, investigators were said to have begun examining the role of certain executives in London to determine whether they knew about the apparent scheme. Indeed, without the knowledge of those executives, investigators in recent months have examined their travel to the American subsidiary and their contacts with its executives, people who have been briefed on the case said.
Investigators have evidence that some of the data obtained from the Bloomberg corporate computers may have wound up on the desks of some executives in London, people who have been briefed on the inquiry said. It was not immediately clear whether such data could be recognized as coming from Bloomberg or whether the executives knew about its origins.
The evidence in the investigation indicates that some executives with Reuters Analytics were responsible specifically for overseeing the apparent scheme, people briefed on the case said. Indeed, industry executives said, a large part of the division's purpose was to develop a product intended to take over much of Bloomberg's business. But that effort was unsuccessful.
According to people who have been briefed on the inquiry, investigators have developed evidence that the scheme worked like this:
The Reuters subsidiary commissioned another company, whose identity could not immediately be determined, to conduct electronic break-ins of Bloomberg's computers. They would then obtain confidential data and later turn it over to Reuters executives.
The investigation, which was said to have been touched off by a former employee of one of the companies involved, is part of a new Government effort to crack down on industrial espionage by foreign companies. That effort began in 1996 with the passage of the Economic Espionage Act, which made theft of trade secrets a Federal crime. Despite that law, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said earlier this month that such espionage against American companies had increased, with the potential damage reaching $300 billion in 1997 alone.
In the Reuters investigation, prosecutors were said to have developed evidence that the analytics division, based in Stamford, Conn., used the scheme to obtain the operating code of Bloomberg's market data system, which one person briefed on the case described as "the Holy Grail" of Bloomberg's product. In essence, the operating system represents the central nervous system of the software on which Bloomberg built its business.
Bloomberg was made aware of the inquiry several months ago, people who have been briefed on the inquiry said, and has been secretly cooperating with the Federal inquiry. Federal agents were said to have been permitted to monitor Bloomberg's corporate computers, tracking at least some of the break-ins as they occurred. In a statement, Michael Bloomberg, the company's chairman and chief executive, declined to comment.
The existence of a grand jury investigation was disclosed yesterday in a news release by Reuters Holdings. In the short statement, Reuters said the analytics subsidiary was the subject of a grand jury investigation in New York and added that Reuters was cooperating with the inquiry.
Reuters said the investigation was focused on whether the subsidiary "improperly obtained access to, and used information from, Bloomberg L.P.'s product." The company also said it had hired an outside lawyer to conduct an internal investigation. It declined to comment further.
People involved in the case said that Reuters was notified of the criminal investigation on Jan. 21. American companies are required to disclose such information immediately. It was not immediately clear why Reuters delayed its announcement for eight days.
The disclosure sent shares of Reuters Holdings down 28 pence, or 4.5 percent, to 592 pence in London trading. American depository receipts for the company, which trade on the Nasdaq exchange, fell 5.8 percent, or $3.625, to $57.875.
Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for the United States Attorney's office in Manhattan, declined to comment.
The investigation could shake up the highly competitive world of the nearly $6 billion financial information industry. Some 15 years ago, Bloomberg was little more than an idea; the industry largely belonged to Reuters and the company now known as Dow Jones Markets. But both companies failed to notice the phenomenal growth of Bloomberg, which built its foundation on a squat terminal that sits on more than 75,000 desks worldwide.
As the years passed, Reuters remained the undisputed leader, offering a breadth of market information that remains unsurpassed. But Bloomberg, focusing on the needs of institutional investors and investment analysts, homed in on the business of providing historical data packaged with analytical software. That made the company's equipment almost a requirement on Wall Street, for bankers, traders and others who rely on that analysis.
"What Bloomberg did was come to the market and appeal to a new set of users who had been underserved," said Andrew Delaney, senior vice president with Inside Market Data, an industry publication. "Reuters noticed several years ago that Bloomberg was growing at an alarming rate, not only in North America but globally. It also noticed it wasn't growing at those same rates."
In response, Reuters decided to take on Bloomberg at its own business. It contracted with Capital Markets Decisions Inc., an American company, to develop Reuters Decision 2000, its own data and analytics service. Within the industry, Decision 2000 was nicknamed the "Bloomberg killer," because it was thought that the purpose of developing it was to capture Bloomberg's market and put the company out of business.
But relations between Reuters and Capital Markets Decisions broke down, and Reuters eventually bought the small company. After its purchase, the company was renamed Reuters Analytics, the subsidiary at the heart of the current investigation.
Decision 2000 never took off. But Reuters came back with a new product, Reuters 3000, which supplies historical data and analytical software that allows users to accomplish much of what they could do with a Bloomberg terminal. By the end of last March, Reuters had received orders for nearly 18,000 installations.
Now, prosecutors are keenly interested in Reuters 3000 and are said to be examining whether lines of code from the Bloomberg operating system were used in its development.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT UNDER FIRE: THE SPEAKER;
Conservatives Quietly Find Ways to Talk Of Scandal

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Va., Jan. 29

 BODY:
Speaker Newt Gingrich suggested today that the White House was becoming "unstable," in part because of the sex scandal that threatens to engulf President Clinton.
Mr. Gingrich's comments amounted to the first partisan blow, however glancing, by Republicans who until today have been content to let the President suffer without any help from them, help that could lead the public to dismiss the issue as partisan grumbling. 
 Mr. Gingrich spoke in the context of the need for Republicans to develop a positive message:
"As things become more unstable, people are going to want to look to somebody who cares about the nation first, who is patriotic first, who is solution-oriented first," Mr. Gingrich told hundreds of people as the lead-off speaker at the 25th anniversary of the Conservative Political Action Conference.
"Between the financial crisis in Southeast Asia, the problems we now see developing in Iraq, the difficulties we see developing around the White House," he said, "people are going to want somebody who cares about America first and who's offering a positive sense of a long-term future."
By weaving this muted thread into his bolder theme -- that Republicans must learn to govern, not just sling darts -- Mr. Gingrich left barely a trace.
And so it went throughout a day of speeches by some of the nation's leading conservatives -- any references to the President's personal problems were brief and understated and in some cases non-existent.
One of the few who was direct, predictably enough, was one of the freshmen elected in 1994 under Mr. Gingrich's revolutionary banner. That lawmaker, Representative David M. McIntosh, Republican of Indiana, first said the President deserved to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, but then added:
"I categorically reject the notion that private morality is not related to public service. After all, if you'll cheat and lie to those you love, you'll cheat and lie to the American public. This is unacceptable."
Mr. McIntosh was strongly applauded.
Another speaker, Representative Helen Chenoweth, Republican of Idaho, also a sophomore, said she intended to start speaking out about "the crisis in the Presidency."
"Character does count," she said. "It's important that we stand up for the strong moral fiber of the United States of America."
But most speakers did not address the accusations that President Clinton was sexually involved with a young intern and then urged her to lie about it.
Those who did were fleeting, like Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, the former chief United States delegate to the United Nations. Discussing Mr. Clinton's responsibilities toward the public, Ms. Kirkpatrick added parenthetically, "He had more trouble exercising responsibility, I think, than we did."
Former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a once and probable future candidate for President, told reporters after he spoke, "It's a national embarrassment," but Mr. Alexander refused to discuss the matter.
"I'm going to let the facts speak for themselves," he said.
Former Vice President Dan Quayle delivered his traditional speech about family values, which took on extra resonance in the current context. "America is hungry for creative, strong, and, yes, moral leadership," he declared tonight.
But it was Charlton Heston, the actor and top spokesman for the National Rifle Association, who was most graphic about the situation.
"Our President's recent troubles are dramatic proof that cultural war is not a clash over the facts, or even between philosophies," he said. "It's a clash between the principled and the unprincipled."
He added: "I'm not talking about whether he 'did it' or 'didn't do it.' I am talking about people who cannot comprehend moral absolutes, and a country that seems to accept it."
David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union, which sponsors the conference, said that this group tended to attract economic conservatives more than social conservatives and that Republicans were smart to heed Mr. Gingrich's early advice to avoid discussing the President's sex life.
In fact, there were more questions from the audience about Mr. Gingrich's future than Mr. Clinton's. In response, Mr. McIntosh said that he, for one, was pleased that Mr. Gingrich was thinking about running for President because primary voters would force him to take more conservative positions than he has so far.

HEADLINE: Joseph Alioto, 81, Dies; Antitrust Lawyer Was San Francisco's Mayor in Boom Years

BYLINE: By IRVIN MOLOTSKY 

 BODY:
Joseph L. Alioto, the two-term Mayor of San Francisco during the city's most dynamic growth in the late 1960's and early 1970's and a lawyer who earned millions of dollars with the nation's largest civil antitrust practice, died yesterday at his home in San Francisco. He was 81 and had prostate cancer, but family members said he died of pneumonia.
Even in a city that prides itself on its colorful citizenry, Joseph Lawrence Alioto stood out, from his childhood as the son of a Sicilian immigrant working on his father's boats at Fisherman's Wharf to his law school days as a scholarship student and on through his rough-and-tumble political and legal careers. 
 Those careers brought him great rewards but they also eventually contributed to his estrangement from some of his children, the bitter breakup of his family law firm and a divorce from his first wife, who disappeared for a time in 1974 and returned to complain that she had been taken for granted as a political wife. It was the dark side of what in many ways is a classic story of immigrant success in America. Mr. Alioto's father, Giuseppe, had sailed from Palermo at the age of 9 and later found work on fishing boats in San Francisco Bay. As a young man, he married Domenica Lazio, the daughter of Sicilian immigrants. In fact, he was one of three Alioto brothers who married three Lazio sisters, and they and their many children lived in the same three-story apartment building, making it almost impossible for neighbors to sort out which child went with which couple.
Giuseppe Alioto next started his own wholesale fish business and his brothers opened restaurants. Joseph Alioto went on to graduate magna cum laude from St. Mary's College in Moraga, Calif., in 1937 and was awarded a scholarship to law school at Catholic University in Washington.
After graduating in 1940, he became an antitrust lawyer for the Government and then, when the United States entered World War II, he went to the Board of Economic Warfare, where he studied German, Italian and Japanese cartels to help determine which factories to bomb.
After the war, Mr. Alioto used his antitrust experience to represent movie producers Samuel Goldwyn, Walt Disney and Walter Wanger in suits against the studios and theaters that charged them with monopolistic practices.
From 1964 to 1966, he won more than $61 million in damages, mostly for clients challenging big companies in price-fixing cases. The fees made him wealthy and he invested in businesses through his company, Alioto Enterprises. Until Mr. Alioto came along, antitrust cases generally were brought by Government agencies. "We established the nation's laws that protect private entrepreneurs from monopolistic practices," Mr. Alioto told The San Francisco Examiner.
Mr. Alioto married the former Angelina Genaro of Dallas in 1941 and they had six children. He was little known as a candidate when he entered the 1967 race for mayor of San Francisco but he staged a whirlwind 56-day campaign to become only the third Democratic mayor of the city in 60 years.
He was elected largely with the support of labor unions and minorities, though he managed to draw the votes of many Republican middle-class homeowners.
Angela Alioto, who remained devoted to her father in the face of family turmoil and who followed him into politics as a member of the Board of Supervisors, remembered Mr. Alioto's entrance into politics in a recent interview. Her family would spend eight weeks every summer in Italy; her five brothers studied on their own in Perugia and, as the only daughter, she attended school in Florence under her father's watchful eye.
"I came home from the Dante Alighieri School one day in 1967," Ms. Alioto said, "and Dad called me over and said we are going back to San Francisco so he can run for Mayor."
The candidate Mr. Alioto was backing had died and his fallback candidate dropped out just before the deadline because of ill health. "I was the sucker of last resort," Mr. Alioto said.
Mr. Alioto won in a large field, getting 43 percent of the vote. In his first term he was a dynamo, working to improve race relations and embarking on an ambitious and controversial downtown building program that was to result in the construction of more than 100 high-rises in the city. Among the projects started during his administration were the Transamerica Pyramid and the Embarcadero Center.
In 1968, Mr. Alioto was regarded as a bright newcomer to the Democratic Party and he was chosen to nominate Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey that year at the Democratic Party Convention in Chicago; there was even talk of a Vice Presidential nomination. Though that never happened, Mr. Alioto was sufficiently encouraged to plan a 1970 race against the incumbent Ronald Reagan for Governor of California. But his hopes were dashed when he became the target of accusations.
In 1969, Mr. Alioto was described by Look magazine as "enmeshed in a web of alliances with at least six leaders of La Cosa Nostra." He denied the charges, dropped his plans to run for Governor and brought a $12.5 million libel suit against Look. After four trials he was awarded $350,000, which Ms. Alioto said contributed to Look's demise.
In 1971, Attorney General John Mitchell announced Mayor Alioto's indictment by a Federal grand jury in Seattle on nine counts of bribery, conspiracy and mail fraud. The charges dated to 1962 when Mr. Alioto was retained by the Attorney General of the State of Washington. Mr. Alioto denied any wrongdoing and in 1972 a Federal judge in Tacoma announced a directed order of acquittal for Mayor Alioto and the Washington officials.
Mr. Alioto was re-elected Mayor with a reduced vote in 1971.
His daughter said he would be remembered as a coalition builder. "He appointed the most minorities to all positions -- the first Asian, the first Latino, the first Filipino and the second African-American to the Board of Supervisors," she said. On Jan. 18, 1974, when Mayor Alioto was campaigning again for Governor, his wife, Angelina, became angered when he forgot to introduce her at a function in Palm Springs. She drove away and dropped from sight for three weeks. It turned out that she was touring the California missions while the police were searching for her.
At a news conference later at their 15-room mansion, Mrs. Alioto said, "I was frustrated over being used." She added, "I have to be here alone in this place with my housekeeper 27 nights a month and I feel neglected."
Mr. Alioto lost the Democratic nomination for Governor to Jerry Brown. He also lost his wife. The couple were divorced in 1977. Two years earlier, barred by law from seeking a third term as Mayor, Mr. Alioto returned to his family law practice at Alioto & Alioto. In 1978 he married the former Kathleen Sullivan, an unsuccessful Senate candidate in Massachusetts and a daughter of William H. Sullivan Jr., the then owner of the New England Patriots football team and one of Mr. Alioto's clients.
His sons John and Joseph left the family law firm in the early 1990's in but the children reconciled with their father as he neared death. In addition to his wife, Kathleen, his daughter, Angela, his sons John and Joseph, Mr. Alioto is survived by three other sons from his first marriage, Lawrence, Thomas and Michael; two children from his second marriage, Patrick and Domenica, and 11 grandchildren.

HEADLINE: THE GIULIANI BUDGET: THE BUDGET;
Giuliani Demands Community Colleges Drop Remedial Help

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani called yesterday for a drastic overhaul of New York City's six community colleges, declaring that they should shift the responsibility for teaching remedial courses to other institutions, a policy he said could essentially reduce the number of students in the system by at least 75 percent. He backed his proposal with a threat: If the colleges balked, he might withhold their city financing.
Mr. Giuliani said a vast majority of the students in the two-year colleges, which are part of the City University of New York, should not have been admitted because they were unprepared for college work. Renewing his attack on the standards at CUNY, he said the system should focus on only those who were ready for community college. 
 "There comes a point, after 15 years of tragically plummeting graduation rates and a total evisceration of standards, that somebody has to say: 'This isn't working,' " he said.
The Mayor, who prides himself on his bare-knuckled challenges to institutions that he does not control, appeared to relish picking a fight with the CUNY board, joking that its members might faint when they heard his plan.
Mr. Giuliani's proposal represented the latest salvo he has fired at CUNY, a few weeks after he said the system should end its longstanding policy of automatically accepting any city resident with a high school diploma and adopt an admissions examination instead.
Mr. Giuliani issued the proposal as he announced his preliminary budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1. The $34.3 billion spending plan hews to a cautious course, featuring relatively modest proposals for new programs, spending reductions and tax cuts.
The budget reflects the strong growth in profits on Wall Street, which has helped generate a $1.2 billion surplus in the current fiscal year that the Mayor wants to use to reduce shortfalls in the next two years.
Mr. Giuliani repeated his plan to eliminate the sales tax on clothing and footwear, which would require state approval; unveiled a new proposal to do away with the tax on commercial rents in Manhattan south of 96th Street, and said he would consider a plan from the Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, to eliminate a surcharge on the city's personal income tax.
The Mayor also called for $429 million in budget cuts, including reductions in spending on cultural organizations and libraries, though if recent history is any guide, some of those will be restored in negotiations with the City Council, whose approval is required for the budget to become law.
While the Mayor can urge changes at the CUNY community colleges, he does not have much authority to have them adopted, because CUNY is run by the state, which provides about half of the system's budget. Mr. Giuliani can seek to exert leverage over the CUNY board, which is controlled by appointees of the Governor, mostly by trying to withhold the city's contribution to the system's budget.
Depending on the calculation method, the city pays 20 to 30 percent of the budget of the six community colleges, which serve 37 percent of the students in the CUNY system. State aid and tuition payments make up the rest of the budget.
CUNY reacted cautiously yesterday, saying in a statement that it favored raising standards but declining to directly address the Mayor's proposal. On a visit to Brooklyn, Gov. George E. Pataki said he had not yet seen the proposal, and offered no opinion on it.
Mr. Giuliani said the city should continue its current level of financing but divide the money between CUNY and other educational institutions that would teach remedial courses. He declined to give examples of what types of institutions might want to play such a role, or to say whether he was talking about private colleges or the kind of companies that prepare high school students for standardized tests.
"I don't have anyone in mind," he said. "I just think about all of the great schools that the city has. And maybe some of them would be interested in running some of these programs." He added: "This is going to take a year or two to really work out. I mean, it's an enormously complex thing."
Asked whether he would refuse to finance CUNY if it did not adopt his proposal, Mr. Giuliani said, "It may come down to that."
This is not the first time that the Mayor has threatened to withhold money from a state-controlled institution in an effort to push a new policy. Early in his first term, Mr. Giuliani withheld a city contribution to the budget of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, seeking to compel the authority to agree to a merger of the transit police and the city's Police Department, something that other mayors had favored but had been unable to accomplish.
Mr. Giuliani ultimately won that skirmish with the M.T.A.
Herman Badillo, the vice chairman of the CUNY board and an informal mayoral adviser, said yesterday that Mr. Giuliani had grown increasingly frustrated in recent months with the CUNY board's response to his proposals for toughening standards.
"What is going on here is that the Mayor has gotten impatient with the pace of what is happening," said Mr. Badillo, who supports the Mayor's position.
"The moment you hit someone in the budget, you are really forcing them to move," he added.
The Mayor, in presenting his overall budget proposals yesterday, pointed proudly to the spending figures, saying that excluding state and Federal aid, spending was increasing by only six-tenths of 1 percent on average, less than the local inflation rate of 2 percent to 2.5 percent.
He also said that because of his prudent fiscal policies, he expected the city would face smaller shortfalls over the next four years than he had originally anticipated.
"We're now going through some of the best times," Mr. Giuliani proclaimed, drawing a comparison between the city's current financial standing and the dire situation he said he inherited when he took office in 1994.
But some figures in the budget painted a somewhat different picture from the one the Mayor highlighted, particularly when the surplus was taken into account. Under the city's accounting rules, the surplus is tallied as being spent in the current fiscal year, even though the Mayor is using it to cover next year's expenses. As a result, the spending figure for next year is depressed.
When that accounting maneuver is corrected for purposes of comparison, the city's spending is expected to grow by 3 to 4 percent in the next fiscal year, which is not a sharp rise but is more than the one Mr. Giuliani emphasized.
The projected growth in spending is still less than the one in the current budget, which showcased large election-year increases approved by Mr. Giuliani and the City Council. The current, or 1998, budget, has an 8.8 percent increase in spending from city revenues, not including debt payments, according to figures provided by the Mayor's office.
The budget for the next fiscal year, which begins on July 1, includes a rise of 3.3 percent.
In another area, the Giuliani administration's projections for future budget gaps may underestimate their size, because they do not include the cost of wage increases that would be counted in new labor agreements with the municipal unions.
Sketching his plans for the surplus, Mr. Giuliani said he wanted to reserve 73 percent for reducing projected shortfalls in the next two years; 19 percent for new spending, mostly for educational and anti-drug programs, and 8 percent to make up for revenues lost to new tax cuts.
The Mayor had at least two other options.
He could have proposed spending the surplus on reducing the city's large long-term debt, which some independent budget experts said would be a judicious move. He also could have taken a path that the experts called riskier: funneling all the money to new programs. That would saddle the city with financing those programs annually, which would have increased the future shortfalls.
The experts did praise Mr. Giuliani for reserving most of the money for deficit reduction and not proposing many new programs.

Mixed Signals on Economy

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
The rate of business activity in the New York metropolitan region slowed suddenly and sharply in January after a strong performance in 1997, a national business group said yesterday.
But the report, from the National Association of Purchasing Management, which surveys its members each month about corporate spending on goods and services, said the drop may turn out to be a fluke because the outlook for future activity took a sharp jump upward. 
 The report said the index of current business conditions fell to 50.4 percent in January, its lowest level in nearly two years and down from 62.1 percent in December. A reading of more than 50 percent indicates an expanding economy; below that suggests a contraction. The index tracks what purchasing managers said their companies spend on goods and services and their spending plans.
But when the purchasing managers were asked about their companies' outlook for business activity, all the indicators pointed toward an expansion. The association said the index of future activity was 78.9 percent, its highest level since January 1994, when the region was just climbing out of a deep recession. The organization had no explanation for the conflicting data, though one of the purchasing managers in the survey likened the January results to simply an "air pocket" of turbulence for the economy.

HEADLINE: W. Wood Prince, 83, of Chicago; Businessman Adopted by Cousin

 BODY:
William Wood Prince, a prominent Chicago businessman and philanthropist, died on Jan. 22 at his home in Chicago. He was 83.
Mr. Wood Prince, who was born in St. Louis as William Henry Wood, was a distant cousin of Frederick H. Prince, whose Prince Trust controlled the Union Stockyards and Transit Company and Armour & Company, among others. With no heir to his fortune, Frederick Prince legally adopted his cousin, who then took the Prince name. 
 After graduation from Groton and Princeton University, Mr. Wood Prince began his career as a clerk at the First National Bank of Chicago and worked his way up to bank officer in 1942. It was while serving as a captain in the Army in World War II that he was adopted. Upon his return to Chicago, he became a trustee of the Central Manufacturing District, which included the Union Stockyards, then the largest livestock market in the world.
At the stockyards, Mr. Wood Prince adapted new technology such as electronic weighing devices and air-conditioning in the huge International Amphitheater.
Mr. Wood Prince became president, chief executive and chairman of Armour & Company, the meatpacking and processing company that is now a part of Conagra Inc. He oversaw the replacement of hand ledgers with personal computers and doubled the research budget.
He left Armour in 1969 to oversee F. H. Prince & Company, a private holding company for his family's vast corporate and real estate interests. He was also a member of several corporate boards, including the First National Bank of Chicago, Commonwealth Edison and W. R. Grace & Company.
Mr. Wood Prince was a former world champion in squash and frequent golfer. He also loved art and was responsible for persuading his close friend Marc Chagall to create the Chagall mosaic, a landmark in a plaza outside the First National Bank of Chicago. He was also a trustee of the Art Institute of Chicago.
In addition to his keen business sense, Mr. Wood Prince was equally well known for his philanthropic activities. As a trustee of the Prince Charitable Trusts, he donated widely to many cultural, educational and environmental organizations.
Mr. Wood Prince was involved in several projects that sought to advance innovative technologies. He tried to develop technology that would allow new food products to be produced from a plant grown using sea water, and he initiated a cattle breeding project in the Bahamas in the hopes of introducing European cattle into the United States. In 1995 he co-founded Sky Station International, which hopes to use a stationary suborbital platform to handle broad-band wireless communication.
He received numerous awards, including the Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur, in recognition of his contributions to the French economy.
Mr. Wood Prince is survived by his wife, Eleanor; three sons, William and Alex, of Chicago, and Alain, of Lake Forest, Ill.; six grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 7, 1998, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Jan. 30 about William Wood Prince, a prominent Chicago businessman and philanthropist, referred imprecisely to the way in which he became heir to Frederick H. Prince, a distant cousin who legally adopted him. Frederick Prince indeed had offspring, but one son, Frederick H. Prince, was not interested in the family business and the other, Norman Prince, died in World War I. A reader's letter postmarked Feb. 25 pointed out the error.

HEADLINE: 4.3% Growth In 4th Quarter While Inflation Stayed Tame

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Economic growth accelerated in the fourth quarter of 1997 while inflation remained subdued, the Government said yesterday, capping a year full of statistical superlatives.
"All told, the economy is in the best shape it has seen since the early 1960's," said David Wyss, chief economist at DRI/ McGraw Hill. 
 Mr. Wyss and other analysts expect this year to be a good but not great one for the economy. Inflation will likely remain low, but Asia's financial turmoil is widely expected to be felt in this country, dragging down corporate profitability and economic growth.
From October through December, the nation's gross domestic product -- all goods and services produced in the United States -- expanded at a 4.3 percent annual rate, adjusted for inflation, the Commerce Department reported, up from the 3.1 percent rate recorded in the third quarter.
For the year, the economy grew by 3.8 percent, the fastest pace since 1988, when it expanded by an identical amount.
Inflation, meanwhile, remained in check, despite tight labor market conditions that many economists have predicted will put considerable upward pressure on prices. At 4.7 percent, the unemployment rate is at its lowest level since 1973.
In the fourth quarter, the Government said a price measure linked to gross domestic product rose by 1.5 percent, only marginally higher than the 1.4 percent rate recorded in the July-September quarter. For all of 1997, this inflation measure, the price deflator, rose by just 2 percent, the smallest increase in more than 30 years.
Analysts inside and out of Government had been expecting good news, but the report exceeded expectations.
"We have had an extremely strong performance," said Janet L. Yellen, chairwoman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. "We have an expansion that is still going strong and one where there is no end in sight. But will this year match 1997's performance? My guess is not."
Indeed, expectation of a coming slowdown is so widespread that participants in financial markets largely shrugged off the stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter growth figures.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 66.52 points yesterday, after three days of strong advances. But in the bond market, highly attuned to the threat that strong growth breeds higher inflation, prices rose and interest rates moved lower.
Expectations that the economy will cool a bit in coming months were reinforced on Thursday when Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, told members of the Senate Budget Committee that the economic drag attendant to Asia's financial crisis would probably not be felt in this country until spring.
With the economy firing on so many cylinders currently, an Asian-induced slowing "would probably be helpful at this juncture," Mr. Greenspan added.
"The economy has enough momentum to offset many of the negatives that will be coming from Asia," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. "There are a lot of positives that will continue to lift growth in the first half of the year, including low mortgage interest rates and continued low inflation. That means we are likely to continue to have good consumer spending activity and a healthy housing market."
For the year, most analysts are expecting growth of around 2.5 percent, a slowing that Federal Reserve policy makers would welcome.
Still, in the fourth quarter, slowing export growth and a surge in imports -- two important byproducts of the Asian crisis -- were not in evidence,
In fact, to the surprise of many analysts, exports rose strongly and import growth fell sharply during the final three months of the year.
"The sharp slowdown in imports is a puzzle," Mr. Wyss said. "We may have gotten a break because of the drop in oil prices and warm weather."
The rise in exports, which increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 11.3 percent, was also a bit quirky, Mr. Wyss said, because much of the increase was a result of a surge in aircraft shipments to foreign purchasers by the Boeing Company.
For the year, export sales jumped by 12.5 percent despite a strong dollar, the biggest gain in nine years. But imports rose 13.9 percent, the biggest increase in 13 years.
With the dollar remaining strong and demand in Asian markets likely to deteriorate, if not crumble, analysts expect a sharp increase in the trade deficit this year.
"It isn't showing up in the data yet, and won't for a few months," said Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting center at Georgia State University. "But talk to people who are running ships out of the ports of Los Angeles or San Francisco. They will tell you that loads coming into the country are almost three times bigger than the ones going out."
Mr. Ratajczak projects that the trade deficit will deteriorate by about $30 billion this year. A jump in lower-priced imports will likely help to lower inflation even further, he said. But he is forecasting that it will also contribute to a slowing in the overall growth rate, to 2.7 percent for the year.
Aside from a big increase in exports, technology-driven business investment and healthy consumer spending were the linchpins of the economy's performance last year.
Investment in equipment from computers to turbines soared by more than 12 percent in 1997, despite a 3.6 percent decline in the fourth quarter. It was the biggest annual increase since 1984. Analysts expect further gains this year.
Consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of all economic activity, rose 3.3 percent last year, the biggest increase since 1994.
"Conditions for consumers are excellent right now," said James F. O'Sullivan, an economist at J. P. Morgan & Company. Coupled with wage gains, the steady decline in inflation has produced "faster real wage growth than at any time in a quarter century," Mr. O'Sullivan said.

HEADLINE: Austin Rides a Winner: Technology

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Jan. 30

 BODY:
When cotton and cattle were king in Texas, Austin was never really part of the action. And when oil was the economy's linchpin, the deals were done in Houston and Dallas while this city basically remained, and proudly so, a laid-back college town on the edge of the pretty Hill Country.
But with high technology having officially passed energy as the state's biggest employer, Texas's capital city and its suburbs, home to more than 900 software companies and the largest concentration of microchip plants outside Silicon Valley, have been transformed in recent years. The region is growing faster than any other metropolitan area in the nation outside Las Vegas, and the city itself recently passed Seattle to become the 22d largest in the nation, with a population of 540,000. By the end of the year, census figures show, Austin should pass Boston and Washington in population. 
 And if the archetypal big-rich Texan of a generation ago was an oilman in his Cadillac, today it is arguably one of the "Dellionaires," the 20- and 30-something employees of the Dell Computer Corporation who got in on the ground floor of the concern, in the Austin suburb of Round Rock. The company's 32-year-old chairman, Michael Dell, who recently built what people call a "techno-palace" home in the hills west of Austin that some have compared to that of Microsoft's Bill Gates on Lake Washington in Seattle, is now the wealthiest Texan. With holdings valued at more than $4 billion, Mr. Dell is officially richer than Ross Perot.
Texas's latest boom is certainly not confined to Austin. Houston is the home town of the computer giant Compaq, which announced this week that it planned to buy the Digital Equipment Corporation for $9.6 billion in the largest acquisition ever in the computer industry. But nowhere in Texas is high technology fueling economic expansion more intensely than in the Austin area.
Here, though, in marked contrast to Texas's other big cities, there is decided ambivalence about the growth. Evidence of the boom times is almost everywhere, from the stalled traffic on Interstate 35 to the malls and office buildings sprouting north of town to the new houses that have given a Southern California feel to the western hills.
In elections last spring, a "pro-green" slate of candidates won the Mayor's office and all races for City Council seats, with an advertising campaign featuring banners that read: "Austin or L.A? Our City. Our Choice."
"Ten years ago, Austin made fun of Houston," Mayor Kirk Watson said, "and when people came here, one of the things they loved was, you could get anywhere you want" without hassles.
"Now we worry about the Houstonization of our traffic," said Mr. Watson, who served as chairman of the state air quality board under former Gov. Ann W. Richards.
Still, the city keeps growing, and for now at least, its overall quality of life -- the climate, the greenery, its growing reputation as "the live music capital of the world," as the city officially calls itself, because of all the night spots offering entertainment -- remains its great allure. Paradoxically, the qualities many Austinites are clamoring to preserve are precisely what are fueling the area's boom.
"What drove cities' growth in the industrial era was access to rivers and water and railroad lines and so forth," said Robert Barnstone, a real estate developer and former City Council member. "That was what a city needed to muscle its way to growth. But in the technological age, what matters is what's in people's brains, and a lot of the brightest people come here because they want the life style. Austin doesn't have a great river or a harbor or even a decent airport, but it has a great life style. And that is a commodity of the information age."
 
Interstate Traffic Turns Back Time
Austin actually is getting a big new airport, scheduled to open in the spring of 1999. Traffic is a more vexing problem, especially on Interstate 35, the main highway through town, which also happens to be the main highway carrying goods between the United States and Mexico in an era of expanding trade.
Traffic has more than doubled in the past decade over the Austin-to-San Antonio stretch of I-35, making that section the highway's most congested and accident-prone part from Mexico to Canada. Traffic on that corridor is slated to increase another 75 percent by 2010, and one state study concluded that if nothing is done, the typical travel time from San Antonio to Dallas would eventually take longer than it did 30 years ago, before there was an Interstate.
State highway planners are studying the feasibility of building a highway loop to bypass I-35 in the Austin area, and a regional coalition is advocating a passenger rail system that would ease commuter tie-ups by linking communities from well north of Austin to San Antonio.
Many things besides computer companies are responsible for Austin's boom, including the fact that the city has become a mini-Hollywood of sorts. In 1996, 34 films, 6 television movies and 25 television shows were produced in Texas, many of them in Austin and the surrounding Hill Country, according to the state film commission. The capital city is the setting for MTV's "Slacker" comedy hit series "Austin Stories."
Hollywood stars like Sandra Bullock and Madeleine Stowe have bought residential property in the area, and some filmmakers have managed to bypass Hollywood and make Austin their base of operations. These include Robert Rodriguez ("El Mariachi" and "Desperado") and Richard Linklater ("Slacker," "Dazed and Confused" and "SubUrbia."
"The very same qualities that allow us to brag that this is the live music capital of the world," said Mayor Watson, "are the qualities that have made us a focal point of the knowledge economy of the 21st century. It's that same kind of free-spirit, entrepreneurial, whatever-it-takes attitude, and a kind of live-and-let-live feeling as well. Whatever you're big enough to do, do it."
In truth, Austin's environmental and business communities have been at odds with each other many times in past years over what shape the city should take. But if the battle has been between pro-growth and no-growth forces, no one questions the outcome: growth won.
These days, there are certainly indications of growing cooperation. One is the election of Mr. Watson, who managed to run with the support of both environmentalists and many business groups, and who promised to act as a bridge between the two.
 
City's Environment As Economic Asset
And just this month, the Chamber of Commerce released a study of the region's economy that described a healthy environment as one of the area's prime economic assets, one whose preservation should be a paramount concern.
"I think that's the first time they've seen such clear proof that protecting the environment is in their economic self-interest," said Brigid Shea, executive director of the Save Our Springs Alliance, a seven-year-old environmental group formed out of an effort to protect Barton Springs, the magnificent 1,000-foot-long clear natural pool near downtown that is often described as the emotional soul of Austin.
Ms. Shea, a former Councilwoman, said she was optimistic that Austin's special character could be maintained in the face of rampant growth.
"What's happening right now is, we're trying to see if we can't marshal the intellectual resources of the high-tech community," she said, "the economic self-interest of the business community and the preservation instincts and the passion of the environmental community to grow smarter, to grow so that we don't foul our nest. I really think it can be done."
That sentiment is echoed by Daryl Slusher, a former political columnist and city-hall reporter for The Austin Chronicle, an alternative weekly newspaper, who last year ran for a City Council seat and won.
"There's been an impulse on the part of a lot of people over the years, including myself, a sort of grumpiness about all the new folks moving in, all the changes," Mr. Slusher said. "But I've come to accept that we're going to be a big city, and now I just want it to be the best, greatest city possible."
But many longtime Austinites say such optimism is delusional. Bud Shrake, the novelist and sportswriter, said the city had been all but ruined by growth, and compared the city's civic boosters to frogs stuck in a pot of water who simply do not notice as the temperature slowly heats toward the boiling point.
"Austin used to be a paradise," Mr. Shrake said. "But I've been saying for 30 years that every year it's gotten a little worse. People don't notice it, but we're just about dead here. We're becoming L.A."
Still others say that while growth has changed the city, it remains special.
"I think it stinks, but I'm still here," said Ray Benson, leader of the popular Western swing band Asleep at the Wheel. "It's still the best place in the world to live."
To be sure, it is not just recently that people in Austin have been wringing their hands over the changing city.
Nearly a decade ago, in an article about efforts to ward off development near Barton Springs, the executive editor of Texas Monthly magazine, Paul Burka, wrote: "Almost everyone in Austin remembers when it used to be a better place to live. The pangs of loss are not, as in Dallas and Houston, for the days when the sky was full of construction cranes and everybody had a deal working, but for things that are irretrievably gone: the view west from Mount Bonnell of pristine hills, now carved into subdivisions; the low-water crossings of a country lane, now turned into an outer loop; the prominence of the Capitol, now obscured by nondescript office buildings; the steep hill on the edge of town, now bulldozed into a stubby mesa topped by a graceless shopping mall."
The area is still beautiful in many ways, and that remains a huge drawing card, for corporate executives thinking about relocating their companies as well as people looking for a good place to live.
"You put people in helicopters and go out west over the water, the green and the lakes, and it's just a stunning sight," said Pike Powers, a local lawyer who has served in the State Legislature and as chief of staff to former Gov. Mark White.
Mr. Powers was instrumental in many of Austin's biggest economic-development projects, including its successful bid to become the home of two major computer industry consortiums, the Microelectronic and Computer Technology Corporation, known as MCC, and the Semiconductor Manufacturing and Technology Institute, or Sematech.
 
Without Aspiration, It Is Happening
A Dell computer advertisement boasts of its Austin base: "Could it be that Austin's laid-back life style and Hill Country vistas help us to see the world more clearly? Certainly our people think so."
The area keeps growing, too. The five-county Austin region's population is now about 1,050,000, more than double what it was 20 years ago.
Asked whether growth had been properly managed, Mayor Watson paused and offered a diplomatic answer: "It has not been managed so poorly that we are now in a position where we can't get a handle on the next 10, 15, 20 years. But it we don't do it right, we're in big trouble."
In any event, like it or not, this is no quiet college town.
"Austin is being dragged into being a big city, in some cases kicking and screaming," said Mr. Barnstone, the developer and former Councilman. "It does not have an image of itself as a great metropolis, or even the aspiration of a great metropolis. And yet it's happening, and you can see it all around."

HEADLINE: Inflation Whimpers. What's Next for Fed?;
New Stresses at Home and Abroad

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
When the Soviet Union collapsed, the makers of American foreign policy lost their lodestar. Similarly, the prospect of Federal budget surpluses after decades of deficits has transformed the debate over taxes and spending.
Now, Alan Greenspan and his colleagues at the Federal Reserve seem to have reached a turning point of their own for monetary policy. 
 Having been driven since the late 1970's by a single-minded determination to squeeze inflation out of the economy, the central bank is now confronting the possibility that it has won -- at least for now -- its battle for price stability.
But if the Fed and Mr. Greenspan, its chairman, no longer have to worry about bringing inflation down sharply, they face a formidable challenge in keeping it down and in keeping the economy on track amid powerful crosscurrents.
The Government's report today that the economy grew at a real 4.3 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter was just the latest evidence that the domestic expansion continues to be so buoyant that it threatens to reignite big wage increases. Yet the Asian financial crisis seems certain to dampen American exports and bring a flood of cheaper imports, forcing many companies to hold down prices. That global pressure would tend to restrain inflation and even -- in the view of at least some analysts -- put the world in danger of deflation.
"For most of the past 20 years, the challenges confronting monetary policy makers centered on addressing the question of how inflation could be brought down with as little economic disruption as possible," Mr. Greenspan said in a speech in Chicago this month. "Given the progress that has been made in reducing inflation, and the very solid economic performance that this low-inflation environment has helped to promote, a new set of issues is now emerging on the policy agenda."
Indeed, Mr. Greenspan has had to shift his sights from a single big target -- completing the process begun under his predecessor, Paul A. Volcker, of bringing inflation from double digits down to almost nothing -- to a welter of conflicting and often confusing pressures that could threaten a remarkable period of prosperity and stability.
"The sense in which it is harder," said Alan S. Blinder, a former Fed vice chairman who is a professor at Princeton University, "is that you now have a much more subtle task of fine-tuning, which Alan Greenspan is very good at."
Perhaps the clearest sign of how deep the uncertainties run even in Mr. Greenspan's mind came in a single sentence during his testimony to the Senate Budget Committee on Thursday. Stressing the need to "be vigilant to the re-emergence of destabilizing influences" on an economy he characterized as exceptionally healthy, Mr. Greenspan cited a very broad spectrum of possibilities. From one side, he fretted about higher inflation; from the other, he was clearly just as worried about the risk of pressing "the disinflation process too far, too fast."
Despite heady rates of growth -- the 4.3 percent fourth-quarter growth rate reported by the Government today was nearly twice what the Fed believes is sustainable without ultimately generating significantly higher inflation -- there is still almost no sign of widespread price increases.
The measure of inflation contained within the report on the gross domestic product today found that prices rose just 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, leaving the figure for all of 1997 at 2 percent, the lowest since 1965. The more widely quoted Consumer Price Index, excluding volatile food and energy prices, registered a rise of just 2.2 percent last year, also the smallest increase in 32 years.
There is considerable debate among economists and even within the Fed about how much credit the central bank deserves for reducing the inflation rate. There is also widespread disagreement about whether prices are being held down only by a confluence of temporary factors such as intense competition in the computer industry, the cap on health care costs from the rise of managed care and the decline of import prices because of the strong dollar.
But now the talk has turned from whether the Fed should take advantage of any economic downturn to push the inflation rate lower -- so-called opportunistic disinflation -- to whether inflation has already been essentially eradicated.
A few economists are even worried about a deflation -- the broad decline in the prices of goods, services and assets -- that could make it extraordinarily difficult for some otherwise healthy businesses to meet their obligations and for many borrowers to pay their debts.
"We're now getting to a point where a relevant question becomes whether the Fed wants inflation to go higher or lower," Mr. Blinder said. "Relatively few people right now would say we want inflation higher, but if the C.P.I. were to drop another notch, to 1 percent, the question would become a very live one."
Given the imprecision of inflation gauges, the Fed must be very careful about any move to raise or lower interest rates, economists said.
"It is quite possible that the actual inflation rate is near zero or even below zero because inflation estimates are not foolproof," said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at the Norwest Corporation. "If they were to respond to the rising wage pressures by raising rates, there's a possibility the Fed could push the economy into deflation if it were already at zero inflation."
As a result, Mr. Sohn said, Mr. Greenspan is faced with a delicate balancing act.
"To some extent it's easier to slaughter inflation, as chairman Volcker did in the 1980's," he said. "You clearly know the direction you're going, and you have lots of room to maneuver if you make a mistake. That is no longer the case."
In many ways, the case for concern about resurgent inflation is clear cut. Unemployment, at 4.7 percent, is near a 25-year low. As employers struggle to find enough workers to help them meet strong demand, wage gains are starting to edge up, often the first step toward rising prices.
But consumer prices have hardly budged, largely because companies have been able to offset rising costs through productivity gains from heavy investments in new equipment and technology. Intense competition in many industries has also restrained price increases.
Although consumer confidence has fallen somewhat in the last month, it remains at historically high levels, suggesting that people remain willing to spend.
The Fed has responded by keeping the short-term interest rates it controls steady for nearly a year. Mr. Greenspan said on Thursday that in keeping the Federal funds rate steady at 5.5 percent even as inflation has declined, the Fed has consciously been allowing the inflation-adjusted, or real, rate to drift up.
But he acknowledged that strategy had had no significant restrictive impact on the economy because long-term interest rates have been falling.
Indeed, lower long-term rates may well be stimulating economic activity. They make it cheaper for people to buy homes and cars and provide an incentive to refinance existing mortgages, which allows homeowners to lower their monthly payments or take out cash to spend elsewhere. As a result, key interest-sensitive sectors of the economy like housing have remained robust.
Long-term rates have been falling in part because of declining inflationary expectations and in part because investors around the world have plowed money into United States Treasury securities as a haven during the Asian crisis.
The Fed and most private economists are now counting on the Asia crisis to slow the economy sufficiently to avoid a continuing buildup in inflationary pressures.
Many economists think the Asian crisis will slow the economy substantially this year, probably to around a 2.5 percent annual growth rate. "Such a moderation would appear helpful at this juncture," Mr. Greenspan said.
But in testimony today before the House Banking Committee, Mr. Greenspan raised a more worrisome specter, suggesting that growth might slow too much if the Asia financial crisis spreads.
There is "a small but not negligible probability," he said, "that the upset in East Asia could have unexpectedly negative effects on Japan, Latin America and Eastern and Central Europe that in turn could have repercussions elsewhere, including the United States."

GRAPHIC: Charts: "Economic Ups and Downs"
There are signs that the American economy is growing too fast, posing a threat of inflation. But the Asian financial crisis is acting as a brake on growth and even raising fears of deflation. This has left Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, with a quandary: Which way should interest rates go?

HEADLINE: Ex-Chief Sues Federated: $16 Million Not Enough

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
When he retired as chairman and chief executive of the parent company of Macy's and Bloomingdale's last May, Allen I. Questrom received a $16 million thank-you from the board for a job well done. But like a disappointed paramour who expected diamonds and got chocolates instead, Mr. Questrom has sniffed at the payment and taken his affront to court.
In a lawsuit filed yesterday in Federal District Court in Manhattan, Mr. Questrom said that his former employer, Federated Department Stores, owed him $47 million more in bonus pay for taking the retailer from bankruptcy to profitability in his seven-year stint. 
 Mr. Questrom argues that an investment bank hired by Federated undervalued the company in 1995, thereby shortchanging him millions of dollars that he had been promised for leaving his job as chief executive of Neiman Marcus to join the ailing retail chain.
The $16 million he did receive in May came on top of roughly $2 million he made in 1996 in straight pay. The previous year, Mr. Questrom received $13.2 million, which included an $11 million bonus, making him the highest-paid retailing executive at the time.
According to the lawsuit, when Mr. Questrom renegotiated his contract in 1995, he was promised that when he left Federated he would receive an incentive payment based on a valuation prepared by J. P. Morgan aimed at capturing how well the company was doing under his management. Morgan valued the company at $4 billion. The Seneca Financial Group, hired by Mr. Questrom to provide a second opinion, came up with $6 billion. And his suit contends that other investment banks came up with valuations similar to Seneca's.
At first blush, both valuations seem generous, given that the company's market capitalization was only about $2.4 billion in early 1995. But the complaint argues that the valuation was meant to be forward-looking and thus should have discounted some lingering costs from the acquisition of Macy's, among other things.
"All C.E.O.'s think their stock is underpriced when it suits them," said Graef Crystal, the San Diego-based compensation expert. "But economic theory says the market is the market."
A Morgan spokesman refused to comment yesterday, as did Mr. Questrom.
In the 1990's, Federated was practically synonymous with Mr. Questrom. He was thought by some to have waited a few months to file his suit to give his successor, James M. Zimmerman, time to settle in.
Still, the delay did little to lessen the lawsuit's sting. In a statement yesterday, the company said: "It was disappointing Mr. Questrom chose to take this action. The company contends his compensation, including $16 million in value-added incentives as determined by a third-party investment banking firm, was paid in accordance with his contract with the company. Federated will defend its position vigorously in court."

HEADLINE: Lionel Wilson, 82, a Mayor Of Oakland for Three Terms

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Lionel Wilson, who presided over a racial, cultural, economic and political revolution during three terms as the first black mayor of Oakland, Calif., then suffered shattering defeat when he sought another four-year term in 1990, died on Jan. 23 at his home in Oakland. He was 82.
His family said the cause was cancer. 
 When he stepped down as a judge in Alameda County Superior Court in 1977 to run for the part-time office of mayor, Oakland seemed to be a city ready for the revolution the 62-year-old Mr. Wilson had spent a lifetime preparing himself to lead.
As it had been even when his parents took him to Oakland from his native New Orleans when he was 3, the dingy city of some 350,000 across the bay from the gleaming spires of San Francisco was ruled by a tight-knit clique of moderate white Republicans and their downtown business allies.
But after a decade of white flight, declining population and urban decay, black leaders, emboldened by gun-toting militants in the radical Black Panther Party, had begun clamoring for change.
Four years earlier, the Black Panther leader Bobby Seale had shown such surprising strength in finishing second in the 1973 mayor's race that the three-term incumbent, John Reading, decided not to seek a fourth term in 1977, throwing his support to the Oakland school board president, Dave Tucker.
With the almost unanimous support of labor, the Black Panthers, other minorities, liberal Democrats and visiting celebrities, including Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., Reggie Jackson and Jane Fonda, Mr. Wilson won a narrow victory in a run-off election.
For Mr. Wilson, who had become the first black judge in Alameda County when he was named to a municipal court in 1960, becoming Oakland's first black mayor was not the only noteworthy distinction of his election. As he liked to recall it, he was also the first person to win a mayor's election without the endorsement of The Oakland Tribune.
But then Mr. Wilson had been bucking trends all his life. At 5-foot-5 and 130 pounds, for example, he was small for competitive sports, but he had such drive, determination and natural ability that he became a fine basketball player and so accomplished at baseball that he played high-level semiprofessional ball before turning to a law career.
After graduating with honors from a predominantly white vocational high school, Mr. Wilson worked his way through the University of California at Berkeley as an economics major, then spent four years with the Army in Europe in World War II before earning a degree at the Hastings School of Law in San Francisco in 1949.
With only a handful of other black lawyers in Oakland, Mr. Wilson specialized in civil rights cases, provided free legal services to the poor and won a reputation for compassion and even-handedness that continued during his years as a judge.
If the city's white leadership had been alarmed by Mr. Wilson's election as mayor, he soon put it at ease. A fiscal conservative who made economic development a priority, over the next decade he stimulated a $1 billion downtown building boom that changed the face of Oakland's skyline even as he was changing the complexion of the city government, filling top posts with black, Hispanic and Asian officials, many of them women.
In a weak-mayor system, where the mayor has only one of nine City Council votes, Mr. Wilson was a master mediator who proved quietly persuasive in one-on-one meetings and was able to put together a working majority that enhanced his power.
Mr. Wilson became something of a folk hero to Oakland's poor black population, but as an epidemic of drugs and violence plagued Oakland's poor neighborhoods, his emphasis on downtown economic development became a political liability and he was criticized for neglecting impoverished neighborhoods.
By the time he ran for re-election in 1990, Mr. Wilson, whose third term had been extended 18 months by a charter change in the election cycle, was seen as an increasingly remote figure.
When he gave his reluctant endorsement to an abortive $500 million plan to lure the National Football League Raiders back to Oakland from Los Angeles, the issue became a symbol of his support of business. Mr. Wilson argued in vain that bolstering neighborhoods would be the next item on his agenda.
He finished third in the 1990 election, polling only 17 percent of the vote.
Mr. Wilson is survived by his second wife, Dorothy, three sons from his first marriage, Lionel and Steven, of Oakland, and Robin, of Sacramento; four brothers, Harold, Kermit and Warren, of Oakland, and Julius, of Castro Valley, Calif.; a sister, Marie Anderson of San Leandro, Calif., and several grandchildren.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Dow Loses Ground in January for First Time Since 1990

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
As January goes, so goes the year.
By that admittedly superstitious Wall Street dictum, the stock market is not in for an auspicious 1998. 
 After seven years of largely blissful beginnings, the Dow Jones industrial average recorded its first January loss, one that some market prognosticators believe may augur poorly for investors.
Yesterday, the Dow fell 66.52 points, to 7,906.50, closing just slightly below the level it began the year. The last time the Dow lost ground in January was 1990, a year when the blue-chip average slid 4.3 percent.
While the monthly loss was minuscule, less than two one-hundredths of a percentage point, it does represent a negative start to a year when many investors are already worried that economic turmoil in Asia could upset what has been one of the greatest bull markets in history.
"This was not a good month," said Byron R. Wien, the United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley. "It was a bad month for Bill Clinton; it was a bad month for Asia, and it was a bad month for the stock market."
Of course, many dismiss what some traders call the "January effect" as nonsense. But in the last quarter-century, the blue-chip average has fallen seven times in January. On six of those occasions, the Dow ended the year with a loss.
If it's any consolation, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index -- which is considered a much broader barometer of stock prices -- ended the month with a gain of 1 percent.
Regardless what barometer is used, most Wall Street strategists agree the stock market has weathered a trying and volatile month.
In terms of trading activity, the month just ended was the second busiest in history, as more than 12.5 billion shares traded hands. In October -- when the Dow plummeted 554 points one day and gained 337 points the next -- more than 14 billion shares were traded.
It has been that kind of period for the market. Until this week, stock prices had been moving sharply lower on fears that the Asian crisis would erode corporate profits. But a batch of solid fourth-quarter earnings reports this week helped lift investor confidence.
"We started off the year with a big decline, and then we had a big rally," said Gail Dudack, chief investment officer at UBS Securities. "We were just pretty much flat in January. And that may be indicative of the kind of year we're going to have."
Ms. Dudack and many other strategists have reduced expectations for 1998, projecting corporate profits may grow by 5 to 8 percent in 1998 versus 11 percent in 1997.
Such a slowdown can already be glimpsed in fourth-quarter profits. With about 64 percent of the companies that make up the S.& P 500 reporting, profits are up about 10 percent, according to First Call Inc., which tracks corporate earnings. In addition, more companies are warning that first-quarter profits could be hurt.
"The question is: does the fourth quarter represent a trend downward and does that mean we'll suffer in the first quarter?" said Charles Hill, First Call's director of research. "We don't know."
Still, some point out that stock prices have held steady despite a flurry of troubling news from a White House scandal to economic turmoil in South Korea and Japan.
"The market's failing to proceed, but it's not breaking down," said Laszlo Birinyi, head of Birinyi Associates, a market research firm in Greenwich, Conn. "A lot of investors are just switching back and forth trying to find the next horse to ride."
Besides the January effect, there are other signs of a downturn, however unscientific they may be. The Denver Broncos' Super Bowl victory, for example, is viewed with dismay by some investors because the team is in the American Conference of the National Football League, and "American Conference victories almost invariably portend a difficult year for the U.S. equity market," Mr. Wien said.
Yale Hirsch, the publisher of the Stock Trader's Almanac, however, says it's more important to heed the message of the S.& P. 500's January performance, which has an 89 percent accuracy rate for how the year will go.
"I watch the S.& P. 500," he said. "So I can't change horses midstream."
Besides, when indicators are just slightly off -- or contradictory -- they may have less meaning.
After all, Mr. Hirsch said, "I don't think kicking a field goal in the last minute is going to send our economy into a tailspin."

HEADLINE: As Newark Bounces Back, So Does Mayor

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Jan. 28

 BODY:
This time a year ago the political fortunes of Newark's Mayor, Sharpe James, were bleak.
His police director had just been convicted of stealing money. His chief of staff was on trial on bribery and corruption charges, and was subsequently convicted. Elected and appointed officials in the city were the objects of streams of subpoenas for their financial records, and the United States Attorney in Newark, Faith S. Hochberg, was talking openly of her suspicions of corruption in the "highest levels of city government." 
 What is more, the city was coming up on the 30th anniversary of the 1967 riots, whose legacy of hopelessness was obvious in the vacant lots and boarded-up buildings dotting the city.
What a difference a year makes.
As Mr. James prepares for an expected announcement next month that he will seek a fourth term, Newark is suddenly seen as a reviving city. Exhibit A is the Performing Arts Center downtown, which opened last fall to rave reviews. And although the city continues its struggle to rebuild its economy and stem the flight of its residents to the suburbs, the lavish praise for the arts center has, at least for now, taken the spotlight off those problems.
The man who has been Mayor for 12 years, and for 16 years before that a major figure in the political ascendancy of blacks in the city, seems to be benefiting from this new positive feeling.
If Mr. James seemed subdued, even cloistered, amid the troubles of a year ago, the 61-year-old veteran politician is clearly his old, ebullient self today, one part cheerleader, one part real estate salesman and one part evangelist bending any ear he can to tell the good news of Newark.
And while many mayors seeking re-election favor appearances at ribbon cuttings, Mr. James has been a constant at the dynamiting of some of the city's long-vacant, high-rise public housing behemoths. It is typical of his ability to make a virtue out of necessity that he uses the occasions to tout city plans for a new wave of low- to moderate-income town house developments.
"I've changed Newark from a city you couldn't give away to a city that everybody wants," Mr. James said in a recent interview, leaving no doubt about who should get credit. "I think the voters will recognize the good work that I have done."
So far, two people have announced that they are running against Mr. James -- Ronald Rice, a veteran West Ward Councilman and State Senator, and Mildred Crump, a Councilwoman at large. Both seem somewhat torn between demanding that the Mayor share the credit with them for the good news about the city and highlighting Newark's myriad troubles, from its many vacant lots to its unemployment rate -- three times the state rate -- to its continued population declines.
Mr. Rice suggests that Newark's story is "a tale of two cities" in which the good news of downtown development exists alongside still depressed conditions in some neighborhoods. And he is quick to point out that the same analogy was used by Mr. James 12 years ago when, as an outspoken Councilman, he ran against and defeated Kenneth Gibson, the city's first black Mayor, who was seeking a fifth term.
"I supported him back then, but the old Sharpe James is gone," he said. "Ron Rice is more like the old Sharpe James."
The opening of the Performing Arts Center heads Mr. James's -- and everyone else's -- litany of signs of Newark's renaissance. He championed the project 10 years ago, when it seemed almost laughable to suggest that the city should be the site of the state's premiere cultural center. On opening night, there he sat, next to Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, drawing applause and appreciation from a capacity crowd.
Nor is the arts center the only sign of Newark's revival. There is a planned Science Park with research and high technology laboratories, a new science high school, and housing centered around Essex County Community College, Rutgers University, the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey and the New Jersey Institute of Technology.
There is also a proposed industrial park on the city's southern end, the quiet success of a middle-income town house development in the Central Ward and the popularity and profitability of the new movie theater complex, which Mr. James promised he would bring to the city when he first ran 12 years ago. That was the year the city's last two downtown movie houses went dark.
"Time on task is the key," said Saul Fenster, the president of the New Jersey Institute of Technology. "What happens is that you build and build and you reach a critical mass, and one day the perception hits that it is a beautiful town. That's just beginning to happen now for Newark, so I'm very positive about the city."
And as for those whispers of corruption that dogged Mr. James a year ago, few people mention that now. The United States Attorney's office would not comment on any continuing investigations, but privately some familiar with the office's workings, said the inquiries are continuing. Still, the fact that no charges against the Mayor have emerged is viewed by those in the corporate suites and those involved in local affairs as the equivalent of exoneration.
Donald Karp, the chairman and chief executive of the Newark-based Broad National Bank, put it this way, "I believe people feel that there has been an investigation of everything and everybody in the city," he said. "There have been some indictments and convictions but that all seems to be over."
Joseph P. Yeadon, the owner of an accounting firm in the city who is active in civic affairs, said that many blacks in the city saw the rumors as part of an effort to discredit a popular black politician.
"It was apparent that they were trying to get him," Mr. Yeadon said. "But nothing happened, and that has to translate into the view that he is clean."
Still there are those who see Mr. James as vulnerable on this point, among them his opponents who say, nevertheless, that they have no plans to focus their campaigns on the corruption investigations.
"But if he tries to bite me, I'll bite back," said Mrs. Crump.
Mr. Rice said, "If he gets ugly, I will take the gloves off."
While Mr. James says he is taking nothing for granted as he approaches the mayoral campaign, he does exude a certain serenity. In a recent interview, he marshaled copious statistics on the drop in crime in Newark (it fell 25 percent over last year), the number of new jobs (25,000 in 1997) and the number of new or rehabilitated housing units (3,000, in all five wards of the city, over the last four years). In addition, he says, the city has held property tax increases to just 6.4 percent over the last three years.
In a recent interview, he derided his opponents for criticizing his accomplishments as inadequate, "as if they had the cure for cancer and sickle cell anemia".
Such carefully constructed hyperbole has been Mr. James's trademark over the years, said Clement A. Price, a professor of history at Rutgers University.
"He is a cheerleader mayor who has perfected the rhetoric of optimism and boosterism as he has articulated the good news about Newark," Dr. Price said. "Once so many American cities have become poor and black, it has become hard historically to advertise their virtues to some. So his is a defensible strategy, because either a city aggressively articulates its own self image or it will be doomed to be given an image by others."
The Mayor has been careful to maintain support among the city's Hispanic and remaining white ethnic enclaves. He has an alliance with Steve Addabato, the powerful North Ward political leader, and has carefully supported Puerto Ricans like Councilman Luis Quintana, and appointed as his deputy mayor August Amador, who is of Portuguese descent.
Thomas Giblin, the Essex County Democratic chairman, as well as the New Jersey Democratic chairman, said that all the likely candidates are strong, black Democratic Party loyalists with good name recognition in a city where the black vote is crucial.
"And that vote will be pretty well split among them, and whoever can get the Hispanics and white ethnics probably has the edge," he said. "Mildred Crump could give him some problems because she hasn't been in office long enough to develop negatives, and sometimes that can be an advantage. Plus, she is a woman, and our statistics show that there is a 55 percent female vote in Newark."
Mr. James, ever the booster, walked along Elizabeth Avenue the other day, eager to point at the once grand apartment buildings plucked from near oblivion and drug dealers. In the last six years, the buildings have been limping back as developers, some with city tax breaks and some without, have been investing money and returning buildings to the tax rolls.
He rattled off the positives -- the clean, graffiti-free hallways, the security cameras, the pristine laundry rooms and the new day care centers. In one building's lobby, he suddenly stopped and, with mock drama, urged a visitor to stop a minute and look about. After a pause worthy of a canny pitchman, he spoke.
"You notice it is the middle of the day and the halls are empty," he said, a smile beginning to spread over his face. "This building is full of working people who are off at work now. All of this shows that if you do quality rehabilitation, you will attract middle class and working people who will take care of it."

HEADLINE: Pataki Seeks a New Waiver Of Federal Food Stamp Limits

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 30

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki today sought another waiver of Federal welfare rules passed last year that require able-bodied adults to work for food stamps, virtually guaranteeing that tens of thousands of needy New Yorkers will keep their benefits.
A similar waiver that the Pataki administration received a year ago expires at the end of next month. 
 The new eligibility rules for food stamps were enacted last year as part of the overhaul of the Federal welfare program. Those changes limit food stamp benefits to a maximum of three months a year for able-bodied, childless adults under age 50 who are not working at least 20 hours a week. But the law also allows a governor to apply for a waiver of the rule for local economies that do not have sufficient jobs to absorb the welfare recipients.
Mr. Pataki said that he was initially reluctant to seek a waiver because he felt that a combination of enticements and sanctions was necessary to nudge food stamp recipients into taking jobs. But, under pressure from Democratic lawmakers and advocates for the poor, he eventually sought the waiver.
The waiver would exempt food stamp recipients living in 37 localities across the state -- including entire counties, cities and villages, from rural upstate to the Bronx -- where the labor market is considered too weak to absorb welfare recipients. Those areas have an unemployment rate that is at least 20 percent above the national average of 5.6 percent for 1995 and 1996.
The Governor's decision to seek a renewal of the waiver drew praise today from advocates for the poor who have long asserted that there are not enough low-skilled jobs for welfare recipients. They estimate that 95,000 able-bodied adults receive food stamps now and that many of them will lose the benefits if the new waiver is not granted.
They also contend that poor communities would be hurt economically because thousands of "mom and pop" groceries depend heavily on food stamp business.
"We're happy that he is renewing what he did last year," said Mark A. Dunlea, executive director of Hunger Action Network of New York State. "We fought very hard for the original waiver."
But Mr. Pataki's decision did not sit well with some fiscal conservatives, key supporters of his within the Republican Party. Many of them are already disenchanted over the Governor's recent $71.9 billion budget proposal for the coming fiscal year because they say it abandons the fiscal conservatism that marked the first half of his term.
Tom Carroll, the president of Change New York, an anti-tax group that was one of the Governor's earliest supporters, said he grudgingly accepted Mr. Pataki's decision to seek the waiver last year, given that counties apparently needed more time to place recipients into jobs or publicly run workfare assignments.
But, he said, there is no longer any reason to waive the work requirements.
"There is no justification for giving people a second free pass on this," Mr. Carroll said. "These people have an obligation to give something back to society, either in work or community service."

HEADLINE: Black Art Show's Goals: Recognition and Buyers

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE 

 BODY:
One part black art survey and one part eclectic art bazaar, the National Black Fine Art Show returned to the Puck Building in SoHo yesterday for its second annual show.
The fair bills itself as the first major black art fair in the United States, and last year, its sponsors said, it attracted 10,000 people. This year there are 41 booths representing galleries from the United States, Africa, the Caribbean and Canada. Each booth exhibits from a handful of artists to about 15. 
 Many kinds of art are for sale, from Haitian primitives to sophisticated sculptures to landscapes to photographs to traditional African works. There are the contemporary masters of many mediums, including Faith Ringgold's narrative quilts, Benny Andrews's oil-and-collage figurative works and the African diaspora photographs of Chester Higgins Jr., a photographer for The New York Times. There are also esteemed names from the past, including Horace Pippin, Romare Bearden and Henry Owassa Tanner.
In between are many more artists who are less well known. Indeed, the wide range of art at the show led a critic to say in The New York Times that "the ratio of kitsch to real art is far too high."
But the very range of work appeared to appeal to the variety of tastes among those in attendance yesterday. And the fair has attained a word-of-mouth status as a mandatory event among devotees of black art.
"It's wonderful," said Donita Hood, who described herself as a beginning collector from Baltimore. "I'm enjoying all the stimulus. They have high-end all the way down to $500 pieces. There's quality here. You just have to know what you're looking for."
Ronald Ollie, an avid collector who also attended last year's show, called the fair "very impressive." Mr. Ollie, a resident of Fort Greene, Brooklyn, said the the diversity of the fair was typical of most art fairs and made it attractive.
There are two driving ideas behind the fair, said its organizer, Joscelyn Wainwright of Wainwright/Smith Associates, a producer of cultural events. One is to educate the public about the large amount and diversity of black art and to introduce it to a wider audience. The other is to present a venue in which artists can sell their work.
"We have a whole group of artists -- contemporary and historic -- who are doing work of extremely high quality, not just in Afro-centric imagery but in landscapes and photographs, and not getting recognition for various social and economic reasons," Mr. Wainwright said. "White America, for the most part, when they think of black art they think of Afro-centric images, things they wouldn't necessarily feel comfortable with in their homes and offices. "There is black art, however, that is not even readily identifiable as black."
"People in African-American communities are the least aware of work coming out of their communities," he added.
Mr. Wainwright said there had been an almost "complete absence in major venues" of black artists, although one occasionally sees an artist of the stature of, say, Bearden.
While there have been many museum shows and special exhibitions featuring black artists, Mr. Wainwright said, there have been far fewer opportunities to sell their work.
Last year's fair was profitable, Mr. Wainwright said, but he declined to name figures. He said some major galleries that had taken a "wait-and-see" attitude about the inaugural show were eager to particpate this year after watching the show become a marquee event, attracting celebrities like Oprah Winfrey and Ed Bradley.
The fair is sponsored by Graham Gregory Bozell, a company that works with corporations seeking to market to African-Americans.
Essie Green, owner of the Essie Green Galley in Harlem, said the fair allowed her to show the uninitiated her gallery, in a Sugar Hill town house, and to meet with other art dealers.
"This gives me a chance to see and dialogue and move among other dealers of fine art in a way that I can't do unless I travel around the country," Ms. Green said. "There's no medium for that for the black dealer."
On Thursday night, the fair began with a three-hour preview that attracted 600 art collectors who paid $45 to browse and sip champagne.
"A lot of us didn't expect this to work this well," said an excited Benny Andrews, an artist who said there were six galleries representing his work. "I've met a lot of collectors."
Arlene Case, whose paintings were shown by the Sepia Gallery of Quebec, said: "The time has definitely come. Shows like this are the way black artists will be recognized." She said she sold several pieces to Ms. Winfrey last year.
Constance Brown, an owner of the 22-year-old Wendell Street Gallery in Cambridge, Mass., said the fair was evidence that black artists were moving into the mainstream. "In magazines there are more articles about African-American painters and their importance to the art scene," Ms. Brown said. "When we first started, we had to drag people in to see Bearden and Andrews."
In addition to the exhibition, which continues through Sunday, the Museum of African Art plans to hold a lecture series today on topics that include collecting African art, the importance of framing and negotiating prices. The proceeds from each $20 seminar are to benefit the Boys and Girls Clubs of America.
The show runs until 8 tonight and is open from 11 A.M. to 7 P.M. tomorrow. Admission is $10 and children under 16 are free when accompanied by an adult.

America's Multiple-Choice Quiz

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: ZURICH

 BODY:
The U.S. faces a Hamletesque choice in dealing with Iraq today. It comes down to this: 2-b or not 2-b, that is the question. Does the Clinton Administration have an option 2-b? Everything hinges on that.
Let me explain. The Administration has three basic options in dealing with Iraq: Option 1 is to finish the 1991 gulf war, which stopped short of removing Saddam Hussein. In this option, the U.S. would invade Iraq, occupy Baghdad, unseat Saddam, establish a new Iraqi regime and rid Iraq of all its weapons of mass destruction and the equipment for rebuilding them. This is the most sure-fire way to eliminate the threat posed by Saddam to his neighbors and his own people. Option 1 is also the most costly way. The U.S. would have few allies for such an invasion, although the Iraqi people would probably hail it as a liberation. For now, there is no support in the Administration or Congress for Option 1. 
 Option 3 (we'll save Option 2 for last) is to go to the other extreme. That is, acknowledge that neither the U.S. nor its allies have the stomach for any occupation of Iraq, but also acknowledge that the U.N. weapons monitoring regime in Iraq now has gaping holes in it. With all of the palaces and special sites being unilaterally declared off limits to the U.N. by Saddam, no one can be sure anymore that the U.N. inspectors are preventing Iraq from building weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them.
Therefore, Option 3 is: When you've got lemons, make lemonade. Approach Russia and France and tell them that the U.S. is ready to lift all economic sanctions on Iraq immediately if the two of them can persuade Saddam to accept a total, and permanent, weapons inspection regime. And if that doesn't work then simply lift the economic sanctions on Iraq anyway (they're only hurting the Iraqi people, so the argument goes), accept that the U.N. weapons monitoring regime is over and deal with Saddam henceforth through conventional deterrence. That is, make clear to him that any use of weapons of mass destruction would result in Iraq being vaporized. Deterrence did manage to keep the Soviet Union at bay for 45 years of cold war, and Moscow had 30,000 nukes. The risk in this strategy is that a rearmed Saddam, who managed to make the world blink, would be a highly destabilizing force in the region, even if he was deterred from using his worst weapons.
In any event, it seems that the U.S. doesn't have the military will for Option 1 -- occupying Iraq -- and it doesn't have the political will for Option 3 -- which would require a huge climb-down from all of the Administration's rhetoric that Saddam must go before sanctions are lifted. So we are left with Option 2 -- bombing Iraq in order to knock out as much of Saddam's weapons-making capability as possible, and, if lucky, also getting him.
The problem with Option 2 is that, if he survives, Saddam will respond by ordering the U.N. weapons inspectors permanently out of Iraq, and Russia and the Arabs could announce that since the U.S. has unilaterally bombed Iraq, outside the U.N. consensus, they will unilaterally reopen their economic ties with Baghdad. It would just be a matter of time then before Saddam was back building new weapons -- only without the nosy U.N. inspectors around, and with fresh money pouring in from a breakdown of sanctions.
Then what does the U.S. do? Does Washington have an Option 2-b? Does it have any way to insure that after a massive bombing of Iraq it can maintain its strategic objective of preventing Saddam from acquiring weapons of mass destruction -- without having to bomb him again and again, which would have serious diplomatic risks for U.S. diplomacy in the Middle East and at the U.N.? Some U.S. officials talk about making all of Iraq a no-fly zone as Option 2-b. That might hurt Saddam. But what if France and Russia don't play along?
I don't believe there is an Option 2-b. There is only Option 2 -- bombing Iraq, over and over and over again, until either Saddam says uncle, and agrees to let the U.N. back in on U.S. terms, or the Iraqi people eliminate him.
So, 2-b or not 2-b? There is no question. There is no 2-b. There is only Option 2, over and over and over again until Saddam relents. Given the problems with the other options, we may have no choice but to go down this road. Once we do, however, we better have the stomach to stay the course.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT UNDER FIRE;
Chelsea Clinton Returns For Weekend With Father

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
Chelsea Clinton flew home from college on Thursday night to spend the weekend with her father, the President, while her mother, Hillary Rodham Clinton, is in Switzerland to attend an economic conference.
Miss Clinton, a 17-year-old freshman at Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif., plans to stay in Washington for several days, said Marsha Berry, the First Lady's press secretary. Classes are in session at Stanford, and Miss Clinton will probably miss a few days of schoolwork, Ms. Berry said. 
 "They have been looking at this weekend as a chance to spend some time with her dad for several weeks now," Ms. Berry said. "I wouldn't read anything into it."
Mr. Clinton, his daughter and several of her friends from high school plan to spend the weekend at the Presidential retreat at Camp David in Maryland.
Mrs. Clinton said earlier this week in a television interview that she had spoken with her daughter several times since the accusations that Mr. Clinton had an affair with a White House intern broke 10 days ago.
"I have told her that this was the kind of thing that would happen," Mrs. Clinton said on the NBC "Today" show on Wednesday. "And she has seen many, many examples of it in her very short life. So it's not a pleasant experience. But it's given her sort of the grounding to be able to see what this is and get through it."

HEADLINE: Poking Education's Sore Spot

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's threat to withdraw the city's contribution to remedial education at the community colleges of the City University of New York touches a sensitive area that is emerging as one of the biggest issues in higher education in the United States: what to do with the millions of students who enter college each year unprepared for college-level work.
The issue is particularly critical in New York City because CUNY has a much higher proportion of students who need remedial classes than most institutions around the country. About 87 percent of the students entering CUNY's six community colleges in the fall of 1996 failed at least one of the university's placement exams in reading, writing or mathematics and had to take high school-level remedial classes. Nationally, 41 percent of freshmen at public two-year colleges took at least one remedial course in 1995. 
 Though the problem is greatest at two-year community colleges, a national survey by the United States Department of Education in 1995 found that nearly a third of all college freshmen were required to take at least one remedial course in reading, writing or mathematics. The same study also found that more than three-quarters of colleges and universities nationwide offered remedial courses.
"The education of the so-called remedial student is the most important educational problem in America today," Alexander W. Astin, director of the Higher Education Research Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, said at a conference on college remediation at Stanford University earlier this week. "Providing effective remedial education would do more to alleviate our most serious social and economic problems than almost any other action we could take."
Twenty or 30 years ago, many of these students simply would not have gone to college. But the pressures of the economy and the job market mean that workers today need better credentials and more skills to hold decent-paying jobs. So these new students have flooded into colleges, helped, in New York City, by the open admissions policy that allows anyone with a high school diploma or the equivalent to attend community colleges.
To Mr. Giuliani and other critics, such remedial work represents a distraction for colleges. On Thursday, the Mayor proposed removing remedial work from CUNY's community colleges, leaving them to focus their resources "on a community college education that is a really good one." He has also argued for more stringent standards in the high schools.
But experts in educational policy see the remediation as a necessity, a fundamental means of improving student skills. As an urban university in New York City, CUNY's six community colleges, with 65,000 students attract a large number of immigrants, many of whom are not yet proficient in English.
Half of the students come directly from city high schools, where they may have been poorly prepared. The other half includes new immigrants, older graduates of city high schools or high school graduates from schools in other cities.
"It's easy to say these students have been educated once, and should just go away," said David Pierce, president of the American Association of Community Colleges, based in Washington. "But to say that doesn't change the fact that they still have deficiencies that need to be addressed. Community colleges pride themselves in being instruction and learning focused, and the remedial courses are done with the same quality as other courses."
Some critics contend that Mr. Giuliani is more interested in politics than in the education of disadvantaged students and sees CUNY as a handy punching bag, in part because he does not control it. He names only 5 of the university's 17 trustees; the Governor names 10, and the students and faculty each have 1 representative.
"He doesn't care about education; he wants control," said Edith Everett, a CUNY trustee who was not one of the Mayor's appointees. "If there are problems here -- and we know there are -- the way to improve things is not to take pot shots, but to sit down and talk."
CUNY officials themselves concede that their system is not perfect, and they have been seeking ways to improve it. CUNY's senior colleges, for example, at the direction of the trustees, have been raising their own admissions standards and directing students who need more than one or two terms of remedial work to go to the community colleges, instead.
Last year, the trustees set up a committee headed by Herman Badillo, the Mayor's chief education adviser, to recommend ways to improve remedial education. But the committee, to meet soon, has been largely inactive.
Faculty members from both Herbert H. Lehman College and Bronx Community College attended the Stanford conference on remediation this week, to talk about their approaches and to examine others. The meeting, which was financed by the United States Department of Education and the Ford Foundation, examined five successful programs, including a writing program at the University of California at Berkeley and a course in critical thinking at CUNY's Fiorello H. La Guardia Community College.
A common theme at the conference and in the field is the difficulty in providing remedial education: in motivating students, in teaching skills that many students failed to learn in their high school years, in teaching students how to think.
For CUNY, as well as for many colleges in Texas, California and other states with large immigrant populations, the effort consists largely of teaching English to adults, which some say should not be counted as remedial but is typically lumped in with other remedial efforts.
But even as they seek to improve the results, education experts caution that the success of remedial programs cannot be judged by simple measures like the college graduation rates that Mr. Giuliani cited. He noted earlier this week that only 1 percent of the students in CUNY's community colleges graduated in two years, and only 16 percent in four years.
Those figures are accurate. But supporters of community college education point out that graduating in two or even four years is not the goal of many community college students. Some enroll to take a course or two. Others progress slowly while they work or raise families.
Still others attend community colleges for fewer than two years, often to perfect their English, and then move on to senior colleges; those who transfer to four-year colleges in fewer than two years are not included in the community college's graduation rates.
"Degree completion is not the sole reason people go to community colleges," said Clifford Adelman, a senior research analyst at the Department of Education.
"They are extraordinarily flexible institutions and they do a good job," Mr. Adelman said.
Even within CUNY, the graduation rates vary considerably, depending both on the students who attend the college and on the programs they are offered. The Mayor, for example, pointed yesterday to the Borough of Manhattan Community College, where fewer than 1 percent of the students graduate in two years.
By comparison, at CUNY's Kingsborough Community College in Brooklyn, the two-year graduation rate in recent years ranged from 5 to 10 percent, and the three-year graduation rate 17 to 24 percent.
Nationally, 23 percent of two-year college students who started in 1989 received either a community college degree or a bachelor's degree within five years.
Whether the system can do better by turning to private companies and other colleges to run remedial programs, as the Mayor has suggested, is an open question.
Some educators are skeptical, contending that students do better if they attend both remedial and mainstream classes at the same time. Others, including private companies that teach remedial classes, say their early work at a handful of colleges is showing good results but acknowledge that so far the data is limited.

Support for Hussein Is Said to Deepen in Iraq
Many diplomats, business executives and residents of Baghdad say that despite the hardships imposed by the embargo, political support for President Saddam Hussein is growing. A1 

France moved closer to acceptance of military action unless Iraq allowed inspections of suspected chemical and biological weapons sites to resume. A6
 
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright expressed skepticism about a diplomatic solution, but her Russian counterpart asserted after their meeting in Madrid that the negotiating process was just beginning. At the United Nations, China called for a peaceful solution. A6
 
Pacific Skies May Open
The United States and Japan agreed to remove most restrictions on air traffic between the two countries, ending one of their largest trade disputes. Some airlines will see their restrictions removed, and airlines from any nation will be allowed to team up and offer the same flights. But the pact did not set aside more landing slots for the new flights at Narita airport, outside Tokyo. A1
 
The Party Grows in China
As China shifts toward market economics and flirts with consumerism, university students are flocking to join the governing Communist Party. Whether seeking power and personal gain or drawn by the party's philosophy, they have helped to raise party membership to an historic high of 58 million, 10 million more than in 1989, the year of the massacre at Tiananmen Square. A1
 
The State Department reported that China took "positive steps on human rights" in the last year. The department's previous annual report on human rights found that all dissent against the Government had been "effectively silenced." A5
 
New Clashes in Kenya
A new round of tribal clashes has broken out in Kenya's Rift Valley, claiming at least 80 lives in the last two weeks. The police said the killings were the work of cattle rustlers. But opposition leaders and clerics said the violence was part of a drive to force Kikuyu people out of the fertile Rift Valley, which is a political stronghold of President Daniel arap Moi. Most Kikuyu voted against Mr. Moi in last month's election. A3
 
Drug Link in Mexican Inquest
The gangland-style execution of a federal police commander in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, across from El Paso, Tex., has upset a Government inquiry into the disappearance of scores of people. The police officer had ties to narcotics traffickers, according to Attorney General Jorge Madrazo Cuellar. He said he intended to appoint new prosecutors and detectives to carry out the sensitive investigation. At least 90 people, including several Americans, have vanished in the border city since early 1994. A3

Ex-White House Worker Defends Her Credibility
Linda R. Tripp, the former White House worker who secretly taped some of her conversations with the former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky, issued a statement defending her credibility and accusing the White House of a "smear" campaign. She also asserted that she had witnessed Ms. Lewinsky receiving an early-morning phone call from Mr. Clinton. The grand jury heard testimony from Evelyn Lieberman, the former White House deputy chief of staff who had Ms. Lewinsky transferred to the Pentagon, and from Bob Weiner of the President's drug control policy office, who had called Maryland Democratic officials concerning the legality of Ms. Tripp's taping. A1
 
Lawyers for Paula Corbin Jones have been unable to find credible new witnesses willing to swear that they had a sexual relationship with President Clinton, witnesses and lawyers say. In pretrial depositions, at least five women have denied rumors of such a relationship. Only two women have described affairs with Mr. Clinton, and their accounts were known before the Jones lawsuit was filed. Two other women have provided sworn depositions describing encounters that echo aspects of Ms. Jones's claims. A1
 
Gambling, On Line
Bookmakers have set up operations in Central America and West Indies countries like Antigua, where they have created jobs for local residents, and, often using the Internet, have rapidly built an offshore sports book industry that gaming analysts say is taking in 1 to 5 percent of the $100 billion that is illegally bet on sports each year in the United States. A1
 
Abortion Clinic Blast
More than 100 investigators in Birmingham, Ala., interviewed witnesses and searched a four-block area for clues in the bombing of an abortion clinic on Thursday that killed an off-duty police officer. The clinic's head nurse was in critical condition with with wounds to her face, abdomen and legs. Investigators were considering the possibility that the bombing might be linked to explosions in Atlanta over the past two years. A7
 
Tax Credits for Efficient Cars
The Clinton Administration is proposing generous tax credits for consumers who buy advanced cars that use emerging technologies to go two or three times as far on a gallon of gas as today's models. The credits would lower an auto buyer's Federal income tax bill by $3,000 to $4,000, substantially cutting the net cost of vehicles that are likely, at first, to be more expensive than today's models. The subsidies, which would begin in 2000, are at the center of a $6.3 billion package to fight the threat of global warming caused by emissions from burning fossil fuels. A11

HEADLINE: With Technology, Island Bookies Skirt U.S. Law

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

DATELINE: ST. JOHN'S, Antigua, Jan. 26

 BODY:
The reggae bands were warming up on Sunday evening for their daily ritual of entertaining the American tourists who line the beaches of this Caribbean island. But in the cozy back room of a modern house that once served as the Chinese embassy, past the lazy dogs in the yard and the bicycles in the driveway, Bob Eremian was entertaining Americans in a different way.
It was two hours before the start of Sunday's Super Bowl game in San Diego, and Mr. Eremian, in short pants and bare feet, was sitting in front of three computer screens, overseeing a sports betting operation that would take more than 10,000 bets on the game before the day was over. "They're calling from all over the U.S. today," he said, as the 25 telephone operators seated in front of him quickly logged bets into their computers. "That's what people want to do," Mr. Eremian said. "Bet on sports." 
 Wagering on sports is illegal everywhere in the United States, except for Nevada and Oregon. But over the past two years, a small number of bookmakers have packed up their lists of customers and traveled south, along with some first-time bookies, to take refuge in tiny West Indies countries like this one. Licensed by the local government and using advanced technology to communicate, set odds on games and record wagers, they have created hundreds of jobs for local residents and rapidly built an offshore sports book industry that gaming analysts say is taking in1 to 5 percent of the $100 billion that is bet illegally on sports each year in the United States.
Of the approximately 60 offshore sports books in operation throughout the Caribbean and Central America, 25 are based in Antigua, according to local officials, who in 1994 created a free trade zone where the bookies can operate without paying corporate taxes. The gambling operations are spread around the region. Just off the northern coast of Venezuela, in Curacao, several sports books operate within a block of each other.
"They've grown like wildfire," said Jeff Brown, a co-owner of Bettorsworld.com, a Connecticut-based company that tracks and rates the offshore sports books. A few of the offshore bookies operated in the Caribbean for several years without any local sanction, but the Internet and the willingness of local governments to license them have given rise to a new, competitive breed of bookies. They once were rude and nasty, "just like the local bookie," Mr. Brown said. "But now they're becoming a real customer-service business."
Many of the sports books and other offshore companies also operate on-line casinos, which allow customers to bet on interactive games, like slot machines, blackjack and poker. The sudden growth of the offshore sports books and on-line casinos has exposed a nebulous area in the Federal law against using telephone lines for gambling, and caused a host of opponents to push for new laws banning Internet casinos and offshore sports books from doing business in the United States.
Critics include the operators of casinos in the United States, who loathe the thought of gambling dollars leaving the country, and the heads of professional and college sports leagues, who fear that further legitimizing of sports betting will undermine the integrity of their games. Opponents of both types of offshore gambling say the on-line casinos pose a greater threat to consumers than the sports books because it is too difficult to regulate or gauge the fairness of interactive casino games.
"We need a new tool to prosecute the same old activity," said Senator John Kyl, Republican of Arizona. Mr. Kyl introduced legislation last year that would expand the current laws to include Internet gambling, and implement fines and jail terms for bookies and their customers. The bill passed the Senate Judiciary Committee and is expected to be heard by the full Senate early this year. The House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to consider similar legislation next week.
Several state attorney generals, meanwhile, have also begun to attack sports betting and on-line casinos on the basis that while it may be legal to bet on sports in the country where the bookies are located, it is not legal in the states where the bets originate. Despite requests from state attorney generals to put an end to the offshore betting operations, the Department of Justice so far has not acted.
"We have no jurisdiction," said John Russell, a Justice Department spokesman. "The offense has not been made on U.S. soil."
In recent weeks, Florida's attorney general, Bob Butterworth, reached an agreement with Western Union to stop wiring money for the offshore companies, which have used the wire service as one of their primary means of receiving betting money from gamblers and disbursing winnings. The bookies say the Western Union ban has only inconvenienced them, and now they have to depend more on bank wires, cashier's checks and overnight mail. Mr. Butterworth has also appealed to publications to stop accepting advertisements from the bookies.
The offshore operators contend that existing Federal law does not apply to the Internet, and that while accepting bets is illegal in the United States, they are accepting bets from their base outside the country. "It's a gray area," Mr. Brown said. "That's why they've all set up offshore."
While most of the sports book operators, like Mr. Eremian, were bookmakers long before they left the U.S., some entrepreneurs moved here to start booking bets for the first time.
Many of them use World Wide Web sites to take wagers. Customers must first set up an account by transferring money through a wire, cashier's check or credit card debit. The telephone operations give their customers toll-free numbers and personal identification numbers to access their accounts and place bets. Those who access their account on-line use a password.
All of the sports books insist they operate with total legitimacy. They advertise in major publications like Pro Football Weekly, on the Internet and on sports radio stations. They subscribe to electronic information services provided by major American companies that provide the latest point spreads on games via satellite. And they try incessantly to overcome the long-held notion that sports bookies are mob-tainted and as crooked as the roads that wind through the mountains of their adopted homeland.
"We are not a bunch of scam artists," said Jay Cohen, who in 1996 left his job as a stock trader on the Pacific Stock Exchange in San Francisco to move here and open World Sports Exchange, an on-line sports betting company. Since last March, his list of customers, people who have opened a gambling account with an average deposit of $1,000, has grown from 30 to 2,000, he said. "We're licensed down here and we have a good reputation with our customers," Mr. Cohen said. "People are more comfortable with us than with the illegal bookmakers. They know that when they win, we pay."
The bookies have begun to mount their own lobbying effort in Washington, and are currently searching for a sponsor of legislation that would legalize and regulate their industry. "We are more than willing to pay taxes and do everything by the book if the Government would just let us do it," said Christine Walton, a spokeswoman for Global Sports Connection, a sports book based in Costa Rica. "People are going to bet on sports no matter what, and as long as the government keeps us offshore and operating in this gray area, they won't see any tax revenues."
Officials with the sports books note that they do encourage their customers to pay taxes on their winnings to the United States Government, but the companies themselves are currently under no obligation to report customers' winnings to the Internal Revenue Service.
The mounting opposition in the United States did not appear to dissuade bettors on Sunday, when most bookies here were boasting of record-setting business. Forty-five minutes before the kickoff for the Super Bowl, at World Wide Telesports, one of the largest sports books on the island, Anique Goodwin paced back and forth from her bank of computer screens to the screens of the 38 phone clerks, or "sports consultants," as the company calls them, seated throughout the room. At a rate of nearly 4,000 calls per hour, gamblers from all over the world, but mostly from the United States, were lighting up the telephone lines and wagering as much as $25,000 on the game. "This is it," Ms. Goodwin said. "The biggest day ever."
Ms. Goodwin should know. She started with the company three years ago when it first opened with just 50 customers. She is now the director of operations, in charge of setting the odds on games for 2,000 customers, and hiring and training the phone staff. In other words, Ms. Goodwin is the chief bookie, a most unlikely role for a 21-year-old Antiguan who knew nothing of football when she took the job. "When I started I didn't know a single team," she said. Now, she handles the calls from the company's biggest and shrewdest bettors. "I take all the wise guys," she boasted.
Started by Billy Scott of Toledo, Ohio, World Wide Telesports has become what Antiguan officials said they hope all of the sports books become: a major employer. Located inside a sprawling office on the fifth and top floor of the island's tallest office building, the company has 85 employees, including marketing, accounting, and systems departments. All of the department heads are Antiguans, and the all-female staff of phone clerks start at $5 per hour, comparable to the wages paid in the island's predominant industry, tourism.
"These girls are intelligent and knowledgeable," said Jessica Davis, a 27-year-old native of North Dakota and the president of World Wide Telesports. "We call them sports consultants because they can tell you anything you need to know about betting on a sport. And most of them have never even seen a live football game."
All of the sports book operators refuse to discuss their corporate structures and revenues, but Mr. Scott, 56, said he has earned enough to recently relinquish his stake in World Wide Telesports and retire to the nearby island of St. Martin. Some of his "close family members," he said, have retained a share of the equity in the company, and the rest has been divided among a group of local directors. "We're very comfortable," Mr. Scott said.
To receive a license, applicants must pay the government $75,000 for telephone gambling operations and $100,000 for on-line companies. (The fee for telephone operations is lower because they employ more Antiguans.) Charles Fernandez, chairman of Antigua's free trade zone where the bookies operate, said that over 200 local residents work at the sports books and the funds from licenses have enabled the government to open a computer training school that currently has 180 students enrolled. The presence of the Americans has also stimulated the economy, he said, helping to reduce unemployment to the single digits.
Still, there are some Antiguans who bemoan the proliferation of the betting parlors. "Take that stuff back to the U.S.," suggested a 40-year-old gift shop owner, who requested anonymity.
A member of the British Commonwealth, Antigua has a population of 70,000, barely enough to fill most professional football stadiums in the United States. Over 95 percent of the natives are black, and most white residents work either at the hotels or the sports books. Although many of the bookies and their families have found that life as expatriates here is hardly paradise -- there are hurricanes, frequent water shortages and power outages -- the idea of booking sports without being harassed keeps them here for now.
"The reason I'm here in this country is because I can't do what I want to do in the U.S.," said Mr. Eremian, 45, who worked for 11 years as a bookie in Boston before moving his wife and four children here in 1996. "It feels great. I don't have to worry about the police coming and breaking the door down."
Still, Antigua is remote and underdeveloped, and bookies work long hours in front of their computer screens protecting themselves against wily bettors. "My wife hates me," Mr. Eremian said. "And my children complain that they never see me, even though we live right across the street."

HEADLINE: Monitors Praise Giuliani's Spending Plan

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
A day after Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani presented a preliminary $34.3 billion city budget, most outside monitors who watch the city's finances reacted positively to his proposals, saying they struck a prudent balance between spending and revenues.
Some advocates for social programs, however, questioned Mr. Giuliani's handling of the city's $1.2 billion surplus and said that the Republican Mayor continued to favor the city's wealthy at the expense of its poorest. 
 Most independent analysts also raised doubts about a central claim in the budget: That it would keep city spending below the rate of inflation by increasing expenditures by just sixth-tenths of a percent. The actual growth would be 3 to 4 percent, the analysts said.
The Mayor's budget for the fiscal year beginning on July 1 was received more favorably than were the budgets during his first term, which many independent experts criticized for relying heavily on fiscal gimmicks. This week's proposal was a departure both from Mr. Giuliani's austere budgets in the first three years of his first term and from the increased spending in the 1997 election-year budget.
"It's a fairly restrained budget," said Richard J. Raphael, executive managing director at Fitch IBCA Inc., a bond rating firm.
Some analysts, including the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group, criticized the Mayor for not using the surplus to retire long-term debt, instead earmarking about three-quarters to help close projected budget gaps in the next two years and the rest to pay for new spending and tax cuts. Yesterday, though, others said that while chipping away at the city's heavy long-term debt might be fiscally ideal, it was politically impractical.
"That was actually a very reasonable balance between political reality and good fiscal management," said Ester R. Fuchs, the director of the Barnard-Columbia Center for Urban Policy, who was an adviser to Mayor David N. Dinkins in the 1993 mayoral campaign.
Some advocates, however, questioned Mr. Giuliani's priorities. Among his tax cuts, the Mayor trumpeted the elimination of the tax on clothing as benefiting low-income New Yorkers who spend a disproportionate amount of their earnings on clothes. But Glenn Pasanen, associate director of City Project, a coalition of social-service groups that monitors the budget, said the other big tax cuts, on commercial rent on buildings in Manhattan below 96th Street and on co-ops and condominiums, favored the wealthy.
"With this surplus, why not use some of it for a job-creation program to match the Mayor's rhetoric of getting people off welfare?" Mr. Pasanen said. "You could do a one-year program so that it would not become a recurring expense."
On one issue, though, almost all analysts agreed. Mr. Giuliani, who has often boasted that he has kept increases in city spending below the rate of inflation and described it as one of his most important fiscal achievements, said that spending for the next fiscal year would rise by only six-tenths of 1 percent. But analysts said that the increase was actually between 3 and 4 percent. The higher figures can hardly be described as profligacy, but they do exceed the rate of inflation, which now hovers locally from 2 to 2.5 percent.
At the heart of the issue is how the city handles its current $1.2 billion surplus. Mr. Giuliani wants to use it to close projected deficits during the next two years. But under the accounting rules that the city follows, it must spend all the money it receives in a given year by the end of that year. So the Mayor's office registers that spending as part of the current fiscal year, but most analysts say for purposes of comparison it should be counted as spending in the new fiscal year to reflect growth in spending accurately. The accounting rules, they say, artificially depress next year's spending.
"He's not lying," said Douglas A. Criscitello, director of the city's Independent Budget Office, which the Mayor wants abolished. "But the devil's in the details. You can see how you can manipulate numbers in different ways to serve your purpose. In our analysis, we won't be showing a 0.6 percent increase. Maybe we'll make some reference to it to show that it's misleading."
Yesterday, in a news conference following Ramadan services at the Malcolm Shabazz mosque in Harlem, Mr. Giuliani bristled at criticism of his plan. "Garbage," he said, waving his hand to chase the thought.

HEADLINE: STANDOFF WITH IRAQ: SPLENDOR AND RUIN -- A special report.;
As Hussein Builds, His People Struggle to Live

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Jan. 29

 BODY:
On a small hill overlooking Baghdad's zoo, where most of the animals have perished from hunger, a stupendous new palace is rising. It is a massive, brooding, domed extravaganza, the latest and perhaps grandest of the monuments that are steadily remaking the city's skyline to the glory of Saddam Hussein.
Bricks at archeological reconstruction sites bear inscriptions hailing him as a new Al Mansur, the Caliph who founded Baghdad in the eighth century. A recent arts festival in Babylon was subtitled "From Nebuchadnezzar to Sadaam Hussein." Portraits of the two hang together in Babylon, where Nebuchadnezzar, one of the greatest of ancient Babylonians, ruled in the sixth century B.C. 
 To burnish his reputation as a leader of Muslims everywhere, Mr. Hussein has just broken ground for the largest mosque in the world.
No one knows how Mr. Hussein can pay for these projects, after seven years of crippling economic sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. Even as he builds his imperial Baghdad, there is another Baghdad, where people plot how to pay the next grocery bill.
Ahmad Adnan, a 10-year-old suffering from diabetes, was in Saddam Central Children's Hospital for treatment. He was too shy to tell a reporter what he would like from the vendor's stall outside that was crowded with teddy bears, toys, cookies and candy that no one was buying.
Dr. Kasim al-Taai leaned down and asked Ahmad to tell him what he really wanted.
"One egg, please," Ahmad whispered in the doctor's ear.
Despite the oil embargo, Mr. Hussein seems stronger than ever. In two weeks of interviews here with Iraqis, United Nations officials, diplomats and Asian and European business executives, many say they believe that he may even be picking up political support in this period of unaccustomed hardships, especially among the young who have been well indoctrinated in the schools. Mr. Hussein has been in full control for nearly 20 years, and for a decade before that was a rising star in the Arab Baath Socialist Party, which came to power in 1968.
Many Iraqis, publicly at least, direct their anger at the United States, rather than at their President.
"Do you think we wanted to invade Kuwait?" one unusually outspoken Iraqi remarked. Then he added, "But was that enough that our children should be dying even now?"
It is all but impossible to gauge public opinion, though, because Iraqis seem to be under scrutiny at all times by a vast network of security agencies with outposts in most neighborhoods. "Please don't take pictures here," a taxi driver begged a reporter who was dropped off at a well-known restaurant. "They will take down my number and come to my house tonight to ask what I am doing with a foreigner in my car."
By many accounts, Mr. Hussein rules by a potent combination of terror and secrecy. He and his party apparatus permit no dissent. In 1995, he held a referendum on his presidency. Those who watched the process say that before the vote, Baath Party workers combed every neighborhood, going door to door to ask if the household had ration cards, a subtle message that the family's subsidized food might be in jeopardy if adults failed to vote. Rumors were deliberately circulated about the sophisticated methods the Government had for detecting negative ballots, even if cast in secret.
As television cameras moved in on the day of the vote, people were seen holding their ballots aloft and chanting, "Naam, naam, Saddam!" or, 'Yes, yes, for Saddam!" The President won 99.96 percent of the vote.
Mr. Hussein is rarely seen in public. Most of his appearances are on government television, and no opposing view comes from satellite television, which is forbidden. It is said that probably no more than a dozen people know where he is at any time. United Nations weapons inspectors have been told that he moves from palace to palace from night to night.
Ambassadors based in Baghdad never meet the President -- with the exception of Russians. Envoys present their credentials to a vice president or other official. Neither Richard Butler, the chief United Nations arms inspector, nor his predecessor, Rolf Ekeus, a Swedish diplomat who is now Ambassador to Washington, were ever given the opportunity to talk directly with Mr. Hussein.
 
The Economy
Signs of Hardship Are Everywhere
The economic collapse of Iraq has gutted the intelligentsia, once one of the most highly respected in the Arab world. If any sector of society outside the military might have formed a political opposition, the Iraqi middle class would have been the only hope, a diplomat said.
"It has now been totally destroyed," this envoy said of the middle class. It is a sentiment heard everywhere in Iraq.
An Iraqi professional now earns a base pay of 3,000 dinars a month, or about $2 at the unofficial exchange rate, for government work, which includes hospitals and universities. Just over two pounds of chicken cost 1,100 dinars. Eggs are about 1,200 dinars a dozen and sugar 500 dinars for a kilogram or 2.2 pounds. Fresh fruit and vegetables, now arriving with greater frequency in the markets, are priced beyond the reach of most families.
Iraq's supply of drugs ran out in 1994, and doctors at Saddam Children's Hospital tell of children who die of curable diseases because, they say, the United Nations Security Council sanctions committee has refused to allow them to import some of the crucial medicine they need. Already-malnourished children are vulnerable to infection, yet the hospital cannot maintain sterile isolation wards.
The signs of hardship are clear everywhere in Baghdad. What is less clear is to what extent Mr. Hussein is compounding the suffering created by the embargo, either through his grandiose palace-building, weapons programs and other government projects or for propaganda purposes, to try to convince the world to ease up on the sanctions.
Years before the embargo was even imposed, though, Mr. Hussein's Government had made economic policy choices that have now come back to haunt the 22 million Iraqis. From 1968 until the late 1980's, his Baath Party gave government a large role in the economy and relegated the private sector largely to minor industries, crafts and petty trade. Some experts believe that Mr. Hussein was ambivalent about letting a strong economic middle class develop in the private sector.
What is now Iraq was part of the ancient Fertile Crescent, but despite the fact that the country still has some of the best land in the region, little effort was made over the last few decades to develop agriculture.
Instead, Iraq relied on oil wealth. "We became oil junkies," an Iraqi intellectual said. Need something? Just pick up the phone and call Switzerland for watches, Paris for cosmetics and a score of countries for processed foods or even fresh produce that could have been grown locally.
"Energy is still used with great abandon," said Denis J. Halliday, the United Nations official in charge of distributing food and medicine under the "oil for food" program. Like Americans, Iraqis leave on lights and air conditioners and, in the cold of winter, turn on several electric heaters in a room.
Iraq's eight-year war with Iran also drained the treasury, leading to heavy borrowing. A quarrel over Iraqi debt to Kuwait was one of the reasons Mr. Hussein annexed it, prompting the Security Council to impose the sanctions.
With oil sales banned, the per capita gross domestic product of Iraqis plunged from more than $2,900 to about $60 annually. The value of the Iraqi currency, the dinar, worth more than $3 in 1989, dropped sharply. Now $1 buys 1,500 dinars at the bazaar money-changers' rates of exchange, or 450 dinars at the official rate.
Mr. Hussein has compounded currency problems by printing money without adequate backing, causing inflation to soar. This has hit those with fixed incomes hardest. Among the victims are government employees, the majority of salaried workers in Iraq.
Once the hard currency stopped flowing in, foreigners who had worked in jobs ranging from nursing to sanitation and who had been paid with hard currency from oil vanished, leaving Iraqis seemingly incapable or unwilling to do these jobs themselves.
Garbage is piling up in many neighborhoods, on vacant lots and streets, worsening health problems caused by the lack of medicine -- Iraq ran out of its stores of drugs in 1994 -- and by a breakdown in water and sanitation systems.
 
The People
Selling, Emigrating Or Just Surviving
At the Department of Antiquities and Heritage, custodian of Iraq's extraordinary ancient Mesopotamian sites and the priceless artifacts they contain, Mouad Said, the director general, is dangerously short-staffed.
"Many of my employees prefer to work in the bazaar," he said. "A lot of our brains are also emigrating out of Iraq, to teach or work in other Arab countries, in Europe, the U.S., Australia, New Zealand -- everywhere."
Buying and selling, mostly selling, is the only money-earning pastime now left to many Iraqis who remain. Antique stores have become pawn shops full of family treasures: watches, jewelry, cameras, silverware, china, even souvenirs from trips abroad. Along the roadsides, impromptu markets have sprung up where people trying to maintain their dignity come to sell their clothes, a chandelier, the furniture.
The Iraqi middle class, large and well educated by the standards of most of the developing world, has fallen in recent years, and fallen hard.
"Ten years ago I did whatever I wanted," said Baydaa Ihsaan, who is in charge of international relations -- or what is left of them -- for the General Federation of Iraqi Women. "I realized my dreams. I got my degree."
"Now you can't do what you want." she said. "There will always be a block in your way. You can almost not survive. The embargo has stopped almost everything in my life."
"Just catching a cold or the flu now are things that terrify me," she continued. "Life is like a nightmare. One day you have everything in your life, and the next day you open your eyes and there is darkness."
Ms. Ihsaan, 29, and other women her age said they are unable to think of marriage and a family, and are forced by circumstances to stay in their parents' homes to contribute to earnings and to share in what resources they can muster.
"The whole world is to blame," she said, echoing other youthful voices, some too young to remember how Iraq got itself into this predicament.
At the University of Baghdad's College of Arts, Lena Ali, a lecturer in English, said many people were "going back to religion" in a society that is socially conservative but was never militantly Islamic. Christian churches are strong here, and Iraqi Christians of various rites are among the better off and sometimes most influential people. Tariq Aziz, the Deputy Prime Minister and Mr. Hussein's liaison with the outside world, is a Christian.
The search for solace in Islam is being encouraged by the Government, Iraqis say. It is beginning to cause some concern in Christian families, a number of which have left the country. And it is undermining Iraq's once-promising potential to be a center for modernizing, reformist Islamic studies, a scholar said.
Scholarship in all fields has suffered from a lack of books and contacts with the world of learning. The Security Council sanctions committee has not allowed universities to import teaching materials, said Abdul Latif al-Jumaily, head of the English literature department and Ms. Ali's boss at the College of Arts.
Iraqi scholars and medical specialists, considered among the best in the Arab world, once attended seminars and professional meetings around the globe. Now they cannot afford to travel or are forbidden to do so. Too many intellectuals joined the brain drain by going to conferences and never returning, a writer said. Iraq has apparently computerized a list of scholars with higher degrees who are barred from travel as a result. In the hospitals, doctors are not permitted to resign.
To leave Iraq costs hundreds of dollars in exit fees. But growing numbers of people are selling everything they own to move. Universities in Yemen, Malaysia and North African countries including Libya bid for their services and offer salaries in the thousands of dollars a month.
Those who stay make do with second-hand clothes and two or three jobs just to support their families. Cars with cracked windows and threadbare tires are the norm for many; they are used judiciously so that they will not collapse completely. During the boom years, Iraq built highways all over the country as good as those in the United States, and many Iraqi families bought cars or pickup trucks.
"We have to lead a dog's life," said Professor Jumaily, who teaches day and night courses, including basic English-language courses for which there is a skyrocketing demand. "We don't have time for research. With our noses to the grindstone, who can think?"
His colleague, Saad Hasani, a popular literature professor, is more bitter.
"I fail to see why literary works are being denied to us," he said. "Books are not the tools of war. This is not a matter of war; it's a matter of malice."
 
The Well-Off Few
Petty Mafias Are Getting Rich
Diplomats and other foreigners who have known Iraq over several decades say the society has experienced a total inversion of values with the impoverishment of the professional middle classes. The people who matter now are the buyers and sellers of prohibited goods -- the smugglers and business tycoons with connections to the President or, increasingly, one of his two sons, Uday and Qusay.
Some people are getting very rich in Iraq. Their spacious homes are being built in prime land along the banks of the Tigris, which runs through this sprawling city. They have expensive imported cars and no shortage of food or medicine. They travel back and forth to Jordan pretty much at will. Some also have lavish houses in Amman, Jordan, where a leading Iraqi trader was recently assassinated in his home along with the second-ranking diplomat at Iraq's Embassy and half a dozen other people.
At every level in Iraq, petty mafias are consolidating their power over monopolies of one kind or another. At the last major hotel still functioning with any semblance of international service standards, one clan has cornered the car-service market and shakes down or physically threatens any other driver who tries to do business with hotel guests. All such mafias are assumed to have connections in the President's family or the state security services.
"We are returning to tribalism, violent tribalism," an Iraqi said. All around, added a foreigner, "there is a sense of decay."
At the Saddam Central Children's Hospital, Dr. Dhia al-Obaidi, a pediatrician, has not recovered from the shock of seeing his once-comfortable world collapse around him, though he is politically powerless to do anything about it. Proud Iraqis dread slipping backward into a third world existence. Children begging on the streets are a sign that this is already happening, other Iraqis said.
"We feel like they put you first into a big castle, then all of a sudden you are in a small cottage," Dr. Obaidi said. "Imagine a child of 4 years or 5 years or 7 years -- he has never seen an airplane in the sky."
"We have two big rivers," he said. "We have oil. It should not be like this. We ourselves cannot live like in India, between two trees or along the side of the road."

HEADLINE: Food Aid for Cubans Backed by Helms

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
Senator Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, endorsed a legislative proposal today to provide increased food and medicine to needy Cubans.
The proposal, announced in Miami on Thursday by the Cuban-American National Foundation, could provide $100 million worth of goods if Havana promises that the aid will not be diverted to Government stores or Communist Party officials. Some aid could be provided under Washington's assistance programs. 
 "This is a worthy proposal based on sound principles," Senator Helms said. He was one of the authors of legislation approved in 1996 to deter foreign investment in Cuba.

HEADLINE: At China's Colleges, a Rush To Party, as in Communist

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
In an era of business deals and fervent consumerism, when the M.B.A. is hot among graduating seniors, why do more and more of the better college students yearn to join a seemingly outdated club -- the Communist Party?
At Beijing University, the country's most eminent school, which draws an elite student body from around the country, 10 percent of the 8,733 undergraduates are now party members. That proportion is up from 5 percent in 1991, when the party was in low repute after the violent crackdown on students demonstrating in favor of democracy in Tiananmen Square in 1989. 
 More than 20 percent of the Beijing University students have sought to join, and applications are increasing each year, party officials say. But it is not easy to get into this exclusive club.
The numbers of applicants and members are also climbing at other leading universities, the officials say. Nationally, the Communist Party's total membership has grown to a historic high of 58 million, up from 48 million in 1989 and 4.5 million back in 1949, when the People's Republic of China was founded.
There are two explanations for the party's continuing growth.
One is offered by Wang Dang, 20, a junior at Beijing University who had started his quest for membership while still in high school in the southern coastal province of Zhejiang.
Bright-eyed, brimming with enthusiasm, he said: "This is an outstanding party with an outstanding purpose, to change society for the better. It's attractive to anyone who is searching for higher ideals in life."
The other explanation is offered by a longtime party member now in his 60's, a disaffected "liberal" who spoke on condition of anonymity: "People my age joined the party for ideals. Now, most of them are joining because they want power and seek personal gain."
The elder's view is shared by many students who tend to be openly skeptical of the motives of those who join the party, noting, among other things, that a party card helps graduates from the provinces get jobs that allow them to live in Beijing.
What is certain is that even today, membership in the all-powerful party can bring enormous advantages. For those who seek a career in government, it is indispensable. For the large numbers who will end up working in state-owned companies, a party card is required for advancement to senior management positions.
Even many leading private businessmen join because membership can open doors with government and party officials who control vital information and authority.
"The Chinese Communist Party has become a network of bureaucratic elites," said Suisheng Zhao, a professor of politics at Colby College in Maine and editor of the Journal of Contemporary China. Young people are joining, he said, because of "the power of party membership to enhance their career in the bureaucratic system."
The party itself is less monolithic and demanding of its members than it used to be, noted Kenneth Lieberthal, a professor of politics and business at the University of Michigan, "and therefore it can actually be attractive for people who want to bring about better governance."
But he added: "A substantial portion of the most exciting and potentially lucrative positions in China's marketizing economy are disproportionately available to those who are party members. The party has become the establishment of the most rapidly growing -- and perhaps the most rapidly changing -- country on earth."
Whether a growing share of less-than-committed cadres will help the party keep its monopoly on political power is also a matter of debate.
The party elder said that with so many people falsely claiming to believe, "it creates an environment of lies, and this will eventually erode the power of the party."
Roderick MacFarquhar, an expert on Chinese politics at Harvard University, said it was clear that most new members mainly want to further their careers. "Recruits of this type only further adulterate the ideological nature and esprit de corps of the party, and indeed are a symptom of how far that degeneration has already gone," he said.
But Dr. Zhao of Colby noted that rising party membership reflects the pragmatism prevailing in China today. "This pragmatism could help the party hold its power as long as it does not worry about ideological correctness or grass-roots discipline."
Illustrating the advantages of membership, a woman in her 30's who did not join the party, and works in the state-run broadcast industry, said party members in the radio and television networks get first shot at foreign assignments and covering big stories like the return of Hong Kong to China. A capable non-member could become a senior editor, she said, but could never reach senior management of the work unit.
Another woman in her 30's who joined the party at her first job, with a government company, said her reasons were as much psychological as practical. "You have to be an outstanding worker," the woman said. "And it is the only thing you can join to get any recognition."
The party has for years had a public goal of attracting younger and better-educated members. In pursuit of that aim Hou Xuezhong, who is vice director of the Organizing Department of the Beijing University Party Committee and also director of the university's party school, has been one very successful cadre.
He took over university-wide recruiting in 1991, when, as he recalled in an interview, "there was much confusion of minds, so fewer students applied." He had previously served in the party committee of the university's physics department. (All the academic departments have their own party committees or divisions).
The party does not just accept anyone, Mr. Hou said, and it usually takes applicants more than a year and a half of meetings, study of the elusive Deng Xiaoping Theory, self-criticism, essays, group outings and closely scrutinized behavior to get in. He rattled off the qualifications:
"You have to believe the final state of society will be Communism, that's the most important thing. You have to study hard and work hard. You must believe that the Communist Party can lead China toward reform and opening up. You must be willing to follow the party rules: the individual must follow the collective, the minority must follow the majority, the lower level must follow the upper level. You must care about the masses, and serve the people."
Mr. Hou acknowledged that some applicants had less than pure motives, but he insisted that intense education, and a close watch on the students' behavior among their peers, helped to insure that opportunists were weeded out.
The students joining today have only known the party of the Deng Xiaoping era of loosening economic controls. They were grade-school students in the year of Tiananmen Square. The two students introduced by the university as showcase examples of young Communists, at least, seem to be bubbling with idealism.
Mr. Wang said he had become an admirer of the party when he witnessed the benefits of economic reforms for his own family. With the opportunity to rent land and pursue rural enterprises, he said, his father and grandfather, longtime farmers, were able to break their bonds to the earth and escape poverty. Mr. Wang is majoring in international relations and wants to go to graduate school but is not sure whether he will pursue business, government or academia.
The second student, Yu Huaidong, also a 20-year-old junior, is a sociology major from Shandong Province, in eastern China. He says he joined because he wants to do something for society and after graduation he hopes to work in poverty-stricken areas of central or western China.
Further explaining his aims, Mr. Yu cited a saying of Confucius: "First you perfect yourself, then you perfect your family, then you perfect society, then you perfect the world."
Asked whether he realized that until recently the party condemned Confucian thought, Mr. Yu said: "I'm not worried that the Communist Party will return to the old times. China was backward, and they were feeling their way. Now, after the reforms and opening up, the Communist Party knows how to seek the socialist goal."
Asked about 1989, when many Beijing University students were embroiled in the pro-democracy demonstrations that were crushed by the Communist Party, the two young members shifted uneasily. Finally Mr. Wang said he felt that while many of the students were probably acting out of good intentions, the problem had been with the student leaders, who had hidden objectives and were not truly democratic.
"I believe that the actions of the Government were basically correct," he said, and without the actions taken, "we could not have had the progress we have had in the last 10 years."

HEADLINE: Pact on Air Traffic By U.S. and Japan To Lift Restrictions

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
The United States and Japan ended one of their largest outstanding trade disputes today by agreeing to remove most restrictions on air traffic between the two countries.
The framework agreement will add service between more cities in both countries, remove restrictions on five carriers -- United; Northwest; FDX Corporation, formerly Fedex; Japan Air Lines, and All Nippon Airways -- and loosen restrictions on other American carriers as well as allow new American airlines into the market. 
 The pact may also push down fares, Administration officials say, but it is unclear by how much.
Under the agreement, allied airlines will be allowed to jointly offer the same flights, known in the industry as code sharing, whether the carriers are American, Japanese or from third countries. The accord also confirms the rights of cargo carriers to transport freight through Japan to other destinations.
Absent from the agreement, however, is any plan for increasing the number of landing slots for the new flights at Narita international airport outside Tokyo.
The dispute that ended today goes back to the last days of the American occupation of Japan, when the two countries reached an air agreement. Japan has complained that, because the country was so weak at the time, the agreement was negotiated unfairly. The United States, for its part, has insisted that Japan remove barriers to air service passing through the country en route to other Asian destinations before any broader agreement could be reached.
Today's accord comes at a time of relative calm over trade issues with Japan. It is also a time of growing tension over Japan's economic strategy in the Asian crisis.
Clinton Administration officials described the agreement, which has been under negotiation for 12 months, in expansive terms. Daniel Tarullo, the Deputy Assistant to the President for International Economic Policy, said this was "an agreement that will change the face of trans-Pacific air travel."
Among the results, he said, would be "a dramatic increase in air services, both passenger and cargo, across the Pacific" and job growth in the aviation industry and in other industries in cities around the United States that would gain service to Japan for the first time. The United States and Japan are the world's No. 1 and No. 2 economies, Administration officials pointed out.
But some airlines were not so sure. At Northwest, which enjoys limited rights now and would gain more, Michael E. Levine, the executive vice president for marketing, said that in the current economic environment, with a soft economy in Japan and a crisis in much of the rest of Asia, the effect of the agreement would be "relatively little."
"Because there are no net new slots, there is not going to be a lot of net new service," he said, referring to landing spots at Narita, where the international Japanese aviation market is highly concentrated. Administration officials countered that FDX Corporation has unused slots at Narita, and said the airline could sell them to other American carriers.
And, they said, the Japanese agreed to allow the slots to change hands among American companies as a commercial transaction. Northwest complained, however, that most of the landing slots occur very early in the morning, which would require departures from American cities after midnight, and are too early to appeal to travelers in Japan.
Mr. Levine called the agremeent "a set of mercantilist adjustments that obviously favors some carriers and doesn't favor other carriers, creates a few new opportunities but doesn't fundamentally change the marketplace."
The agreement will allow Delta, American and Continental the right to fly 90 more round-trip flights a week to Japan, nearly tripling the number of flights they can send, and will allow the United States to let one more American carrier into the market now, and another in two years.
Those three carriers are now limited to 46 flights a week among them; the new agreement gives them an additional 90, not counting service between Japan and two popular American tourist destinations, Guam and Saipan. The carriers with the oldest access rights -- United, Northwest and FDX, operating under an agreement signed in 1952 -- have almost all restrictions lifted. Charter flights will also increase.
The Clinton Administration contends that the additional capacity will push down fares, but Mr. Tarullo and others would not say by how much. They said, however, that the benefit to American passengers would be about $300 million a year, because of lower fares and better service, and that American carriers would see an additional $1 billion in revenues. And the balance of trade on aviation, already $5 billion annually in favor of the American companies, would rise by $1 billion, the Administration said.
About 80 percent of the passenger traffic between the United States and Japan is Japanese. American carriers handle about two-thirds of the flights.
Service between Japan and the United States mainland is now limited to 12 cities, but that will probably increase. Besides Tokyo and Osaka, however, it is not clear how many Japanese cities will become popular destinations for flights from the United States.
Another step intended to make travel easier is code sharing, in which two airlines match up their schedules and list each others' planes in their computers, allowing a passenger to buy a ticket on a single flight that may be operated by one carrier for part of the way and another carrier for the remainder. For example, an American carrier could strike a deal with an airline in Japan or in China, allowing the American carrier to sell a ticket from the mainland United States to a city in China, with a stop in Japan and a change of planes there to an aircraft operated by a different carrier. Code sharing among American carriers would simplify travel from smaller cities in the United States to Japan.
The Japanese Government is considering partial deregulation of fares for its domestic airline industry, and under the agreement today will consider deregulating the fares for international flights. The agreement also allows United States airlines to own travel agencies and other ticket distribution companies in Japan, which are a traditional method of discounting there.
If the agreement brings more Japanese tourists to the the United States, the economic effects could extend well beyond the aviation industry. Japanese tourists spent more than $19 billion in this country in 1996, more than twice the amount of tourists from any other country, according to Government figures.
United Airlines said it would more than double its six flights a week from Chicago to Tokyo after the new agreement. And FDX will be able to fly cargo through Japan to points beyond. American negotiators maintain that FDX already had that right, under the old rules, but Japan had disputed it. Two other American cargo carriers, Polar Air Cargo and UPS, would also gain such rights.
The agreement will last for four years. But the newer airlines would receive permission for another 35 flights, if the agreement is not supplanted by a further loosening of restrictions. The Transportation Department will choose the additional carriers. Trans World Airlines and USAirways are likely candidates.
The pact could result in international realignments. In an era of code sharing, experts on the airline industry say American Airlines is likely to pair up with Japan Air Lines. All Nippon Airlines may end its agreement with Delta and sign on with United instead. Northwest, which just bought a big part of Continental, will be able to funnel more passengers into its trans-Pacific flights.
A big question is how landing rights at Narita will change hands. FDX, people familiar with the talks say, has been asking a high price for its slots, but other airlines say that if FDX is not using them, they will revert to the Japanese Government and that FDX should therefore lease them for small sums.

HEADLINE: Senate Candidates Flaunt Campaign Bank Accounts

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
The clamor over the financing of Federal elections may have left the impression that politicians would recoil at being linked to aggressive fund-raising. But the pronouncements yesterday by the rival camps in the New York Senate race showed once again that candidates would rather be perceived as harvesting bushels of contributions than as having a sparse crop.
The campaigns of the Republican incumbent, Alfonse M. D'Amato, and two Democratic contenders went out of their way yesterday to promote their latest fund-raising totals, maintaining that the figures demonstrated the strengths of their candidacies and evincing little fear that voters would tie them to the campaign finance inquiries in Washington. 
 "Campaign has over $9 million on hand," read the headline on the news release issued by Mr. D'Amato's aides. The release from the campaign of Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat, announced, "Schumer reports close to $8.5 million in the bank." And the campaign of another Democrat, Mark Green, sought to put the best face on its far lower totals, noting that Mr. Green had already spent $2 million last year in winning re-election as New York City's Public Advocate.
The braggadocio underscored how, with Election Day still nine months away, the campaigns are focused on establishing their credibility with the political cognoscenti, and one of the clearest ways of doing that is by flaunting their treasuries.
"In modern American political campaigns, particularly in New York, economic viability precedes political viability," said Jeffrey B. Plaut, a partner at Global Strategy Group, a political consulting firm not involved in the Senate race. "Voters don't pay attention to this or care about this. But the people who fund campaigns and support them, the institutional players, look for a certain amount of money, given the candidates' profiles, in order to make judgments about how the campaign is going."
According to fund-raising statistics released yesterday in the race, which could be the most expensive Senate contest in the country this year, Mr. D'Amato continued to lead all candidates in collecting money. He has raised a total of more than $14.5 million, including $3.3 million in the second half of 1997. Mr. Schumer has collected a total of more than $10 million, including $2.7 million in the second half of 1997.
Mr. Green trailed far behind, having raised a total of $1.55 million, with $600,000 coming in the second half of 1997. Mr. Green has $700,000 in the bank, his campaign said. The other Democrat, Geraldine A. Ferraro, entered the race earlier this month so she did not have to file disclosure records due today at the Federal Election Commission.
The records filed by the D'Amato campaign showed that he had spent $3 million in the second half of 1997, mostly on television commercials, fund-raising and direct mail efforts -- an unusually high total so early in the race. In that same period, Mr. Schumer's campaign spent $875,000, although it purchased a spate of commercials this month that are not reflected in the figures.
Asked about their efforts to promote their fund-raising, advisers to the candidates said that they were merely interested in letting the public know about their achievements.
"Chuck is running a grass-roots campaign, and his war chest comes from literally 50,000 individuals who think it's time to retire Al D'Amato," said Hank Morris, Mr. Schumer's consultant.
The D'Amato campaign appeared so intent on demonstrating the Senator's financial strength that it noted in its news release that at this point in the 1992 contest, he had collected far less -- a total of $5.8 million, with $3.1 million in the bank.
"We believe that the people support Senator D'Amato's campaign because of his hard work on behalf of middle-class New Yorkers, and are proud of the support that we have received," said Kieran Mahoney, a D'Amato campaign consultant.
Part of what is happening is a bit of gamesmanship. The Schumer campaign, for example, hopes that potential donors, realizing that the Green and Ferraro campaigns lag in fund-raising, will conclude that the two do not have a chance of winning the Democratic nomination, so they will back Mr. Schumer.
The Green and Ferraro campaigns tell potential donors that their standard bearers may not be able to raise as much money as Mr. Schumer, but that they are better known and will thus prevail. "His record of service and accomplishments for New Yorkers is worth millions of dollars," said John Siegal, counsel to the Green campaign.
Ms. Ferraro's aides declined yesterday to say how much she has collected so far, but said that the response to her candidacy had been overwhelming, seeking to allay doubts about whether she can raise enough to be a viable candidate. "Things are going great," said David Eichenbaum, Ms. Ferraro's campaign manager.
All the talk of fund-raising bothers advocacy groups that want to reduce the role of money in elections by overhauling the campaign finance system. "It's a sad testament to what elections are about these days," said Rachel Leon, executive director of Common Cause New York. "It's something that they should be ashamed of, rather than proud of."

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases;
This Year, a Record-Setting Sum Is Within Reach

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
As The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund enters the final month of its annual appeal, the tally of donations points to what could be the most successful drive ever.
By yesterday, the fund had received $4,830,466, compared with $4,171,567 at the same time last year. That puts this year's donations about $660,000 ahead of last year's. With 28 days until the end of the appeal, at least $253,086 more must be received to surpass the record total of $5,083,551 that was collected during the 1991-92 drive. 
 "The seven charitable agencies receiving funds for the neediest cases all over the city have asked me to express their gratitude to Times readers for making the campaign so far this year such an extraordinary success," said Arthur Gelb, president of The New York Times Company Foundation, which administers the fund.
"The agencies point out that thousands of impoverished New Yorkers -- especially the working poor -- have been sinking into hopelessness, and contributions from readers have been helping them stay above the poverty line," Mr. Gelb said. "Our wish now is that the contributions will come in at the same pace so that we can make this a banner year."
This is the 86th year in which readers of The Times have contributed in response to daily articles about orphaned children, homeless immigrants and hungry New Yorkers who have nowhere else to turn. It was an encounter with a homeless immigrant at Christmas in 1911 that convinced Adolph S. Ochs, then the publisher of The Times, that people would give money to help ease the suffering of others if they knew about their struggles.
When the man, an unemployed Dane, told Mr. Ochs his story, the publisher handed him a few dollars for lodging, and his card. A few days later, the man showed up at The Times and Mr. Ochs gave him a job in the circulation department. "I would like to say he became an executive," Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, Mr. Ochs's daughter, said in a 1986 interview, "but unfortunately he died young." The publisher never told anyone the man's name, but from then on, he became known as "the Christmas Night man."
Inspired by the experience, Mr. Ochs asked a reporter to delve into the files of the city's largest charities and write unsentimentalized accounts of the 100 most compelling cases. On Christmas Day in 1912, The Times published "The 100 Neediest Cases"; in response, 117 donors gave a total of $3,630.
Last year, 12,518 donors gave $4,921,909, and because The Times pays all administrative costs for the fund, every dollar reached those in need.
Many of those who have responded are first-time contributors like Margaret Sedilis of East End Avenue in Manhattan, who sent $100 to honor her mother, Cynthia. "I do not remember a time that my mother did not send a check to the Neediest Cases," she wrote.
Others are like Kathy Porder of the Upper West Side, who sent $150 that would otherwise have been spent on Christmas presents.
Gregory Simon of Chappaqua, N.Y., decided to send in $550 -- one-tenth of the jackpot he won in an office football pool.
Werner and Erika Bloomfield of Kew Gardens, Queens, were moved by the accounts of people not so different from themselves. "As immigrants who came here more than 50 years ago, we would appreciate if you could use this money to help struggling immigrants," wrote Mrs. Bloomfield, who sent $100.

HEADLINE: STANDOFF WITH IRAQ: IN PARIS;
Backing U.S., France Warns Iraqis to Yield on Arms Inspections

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 30

 BODY:
Reinforcing American threats of military action, France warned Iraq tonight that it faced "very grave consequences" unless President Saddam Hussein allowed United Nations inspections of suspected chemical and biological weapons sites to resume.
French officials said that after a half-hour telephone conversation with President Clinton tonight, President Jacques Chirac agreed to use his own channels to convey the seriousness of the situation to Iraq. They also said he would use French influence with Russia and China to seek support for a strong United Nations resolution that would urge Iraq to cooperate with the inspections. 
 Mr. Chirac's spokeswoman, Catherine Colonna, said that the French objective remained "finding a diplomatic solution to the crisis by trying for unanimity in the Security Council," and that France still preferred diplomacy to the use of force.
But Mr. Chirac and other officials have shifted France's position close to acceptance of military action against Iraq if Mr. Hussein continues the confrontation. "We prefer diplomacy, but there are other options," a diplomat said this afternoon.
Another French official said, "We have always believed that a military operation carries many risks, but the ball is in Saddam Hussein's court, and we still think that intensified diplomatic efforts could get him to change his position."
According to Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman, Mr. Clinton told the French leader that "the time for diplomatic solutions was quickly running out."
"The two Presidents agreed that the situation with respect to the status of U.N. mandates in Iraq is a serious one now and they needed to continue to consult closely as we continue to contemplate additional steps," Mr. McCurry said in Washington.
The French Foreign Minister, Hubert Vedrine, said after meeting on Thursday night with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, "I understand that all options are open, and this is why it is necessary to intensify the search for a diplomatic solution."
Yves Doutriaux, a spokesman for Mr. Vedrine, said before the conversation between the two Presidents today that "there has been no change in France's position." But American officials said France had now made clear that it is willing to be closely associated with American warnings to Iraq, even while hoping that force would not have to be used.
"The French have said what they have to say in a more helpful way than ever before," an American official said. "They are also aware of the value of unanimity in the Security Council." Russia, which has a permanent seat in the Council, said again today that it was opposed to the use of force in the current crisis, as is China.
In October, France, Russia and three other nations abstained from a United States-supported Security Council resolution threatening new international sanctions if Iraq did not cooperate more fully with inspections to insure that it stopped making or trying to make nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and destroyed all stocks and factories. These would be in addition to the economic sanctions imposed after the war in the Persian Gulf in 1991.
Iraq then tried to bar Americans from the inspection teams, and American officials said the split in the Security Council had encouraged the confrontation.
France, siding with Russia, argued then that American implacability toward Mr. Hussein was driving him to defy the United Nations resolutions. If Iraq knew that complying would get the economic sanctions lifted, the French argued, it might have a reason to cooperate.
That remains France's position today, with Mr. Hussein again defying the inspection process. But French officials now say they share American irritation with his behavior.
"We don't understand what he thinks he is doing," an official in the decision-making process said. "We believe the Security Council should show great firmness and make clear to the Iraqis that they can't dictate to the international community."
After talks with Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations in Paris on Tuesday, Mr. Chirac said he supported doubling the amount of oil Iraq is allowed to sell, now $2 billion worth every six months, to pay for food, medicine and civilian needs. Officials said he mentioned this proposal to Mr. Clinton in the telephone conversation tonight.

HEADLINE: Clinton Seeks Tax Credits for Fuel Savings

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration is proposing generous new tax credits for consumers who buy advanced automobiles that use emerging technologies to go two or three times as far on a gallon of gas as today's models.
The credits would lower an auto buyer's Federal income tax bill by $3,000 to $4,000, substantially cutting the net cost of vehicles that are likely, at first, to be more expensive than today's models. The subsidy, which would start in the year 2000, is meant to jump-start the mass production of exotic cars, trucks, vans and sport utility vehicles using novel technologies that are still on manufacturers' drawing boards. 
 The subsidies are the centerpiece of a $6.3 billion package of tax credits and research subsidies intended to fight the threat of global warming caused by emissions from burning fossil fuels. The package is part of President Clinton's budget request for the 1999 fiscal year.
Other parts of the tax proposal are intended to encourage owners of homes, factories, power plants and others to adopt solar power and other energy-efficiency technologies. One provision would give a $2,000 tax credit for the purchase of an energy-efficient new home.
The President is to submit his budget proposal to Congress on Monday, and he will discuss the energy-related tax incentives in his Saturday morning radio address, White House officials said today.
If Congress approves the tax subsidies -- which is by no means assured -- the measures could help make the new types of cars more affordable and help halt the recent American trend away from fuel-efficient vehicles.
Auto makers have already been tinkering with vehicles that would use hybrid gas-and-electric engines or even more efficient fuel cells instead of ordinary internal combustion engines, and several makers have said that such cars could become available in the next few years. Toyota has already introduced one model, the Prius, in Japan.
The $3,000 tax credit would begin in 2000 and would apply to any car that gets double the mileage of the average car of similar size. The $4,000 credit would begin in 2003, and would go to those who buy cars with triple the normal mileage. Both credits would phase out in later years, giving the most incentive to the earliest buyers.
To qualify for the proposed $3,000 tax credit, a midsized car would have to get about 45 miles a gallon.
Ari Fleischer, the spokesman for Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, responded skeptically to the President's proposal.
"As worthy as it sounds and may be, it is terribly complicated," Mr. Fleischer said of tax credits to stimulate specific economic activities. He said Mr. Archer was committed to steps that would simplify, not further complicate, the tax code.
The automotive tax credits would cost about $660 million over the next five years, officials said.
A spokesman for the American Automobile Manufacturers Association declined to comment on the plan, saying the car makers had not had a chance to examine its details.
Environmental advocates welcomed the proposals.
"We call on the Congress to recognize the broad economic and environmental benefits," said Howard Geller, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.
Mr. Geller also urged Congress to finance the research and development initiatives and approve the tax incentives.
The package also includes research subsidies to spur innovations in solar power, energy efficiency, and alternative fuels that give off less carbon dioxide than oil and coal.
A Clinton Administration official said that among the tax credits would be significant subsidies for owners of homes and businesses who install solar systems on their roofs, either to heat water or to generate electricity.
In another incentive for businesses, the Administration will propose investment tax credits to reward companies that install highly efficient equipment that generates electricity as well as capturing heat for industrial processes.
And it will propose expanding a tax benefit through which employers can subsidize workers' commuting expenses by paying mass transit fares, just as many workers receive free parking as a tax-free benefit.
The Administration will also propose extending an existing tax credit for electric utilities that generate power with windmills. The subsidy is due to expire.
In all, the tax credits would amount to an estimated $3.6 billion in lost revenues over the five years beginning in October. In addition, the Administration is calling for $2.7 billion in new Federal spending on energy conservation and related research over the five-year period.
The research subsidies would be focused on about five areas, an Administration official said.
These include efficient technologies for heating and cooling buildings, including advanced household appliances; further research into advanced automobile technologies; other transportation-related research, like fuel efficient heavy trucks and transit programs; conservation technologies for energy-intensive industries like steel, paper, and chemicals; and technologies involving renewable energy sources.

HEADLINE: With Freedom, Cairo Intellectuals Find New Stress;
Pressures Squeeze Islamic Scholars As Well as Leftists and Liberals

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

DATELINE: CAIRO

 BODY:
For Arab intellectuals here, this is a time of opportunity, danger and above all, change. While many say that never have they known such freedom of thought as in Egypt today, they also complain that threats from militant Islamists as well as official, collegial and economic pressures have silenced independent voices and weakened what was once the Arabs' most luminous intelligentsia.
"There is a vast amount of commotion and ferment amid utter stagnation," said Tahseen Bashir, a scholar and former diplomat. "Arab leftist thought has reached a cul-de-sac and so has that of the Islamists. There is now a deep void in Egyptian intellectual life," and because of Egypt's central role in Arab political and cultural life, he says, "a vacuum in intellectual life throughout the Arab world." 
 Under President Hosni Mubarak, privatization and globalization have spurred economic growth and opened up Egyptian society. But with that, intellectuals have a less prominent role, Mr. Bashir said. What he calls the bureaucracy's "Mameluk mentality," referring to the military oligarchs who ruled between the 13th and 16th centuries, and Egypt's corrupt "moneyed culture" impede modern intellectual as well as economic development.
Despite economic reforms, Egypt's continuing poverty, too, has taken a toll. University professors now earn less than servants, about $300 a month. Whereas at the dawn of independence, in the 1920's, thousands of books were published in Cairo, along with 200 newspapers and journals, 60 of them in foreign languages, only 375 books were published last year in a country of 63 million people. Mohammed Sid Ahmed, a leading leftist thinker, said intellectuals now read Al Ahram, once Egypt's most important newspaper, "mainly to see who died."
Egyptian Islamists, too, have found themselves shipwrecked. Once courted by the Government or used to counter leftist critics, Islamists are now increasingly on the defensive. "The Islamists themselves are split over such key issues as the use of violence, how an Islamic state should be governed and the treatment of women," Mr. Bashir said. The massacre of more than 60 Western tourists in December at Luxor by young Islamists, some of whom turned out to be middle-class university students, shocked peaceable Egyptians who abhor brutality and worsened an existing split in the militants' ranks.
Many Egyptian-based members of the Gamaa Islamiya, or the Islamic Group, intensified their call for a truce with President Mubarak, while adherents abroad rejected compromise. (From his American prison cell where he is serving a life sentence for his role in the World Trade Center bombing plots, Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman, the Islamic Group's spiritual leader, endorsed a cease-fire.)
The massacre, or "accident," as it is often called, also drove intellectuals more firmly into the Government's fold.
"It was a dreadful tactical error" for the Islamists, said Lutfi Kholi, a prominent leftist thinker, "in that it united the masses and intellectuals with a state that has occasionally oppressed them both."
 
Competing Trends, Both Exhausted
 As Mr. Bashir sees it, the current intellectual void, or "suspended animation," reflects the exhaustion of two intellectual trends that have competed throughout much of Egypt's modern history: liberal thinkers represented by the late Taha Hussein, the Arabs' most articulate champion of a modern secular future, who argued in the mid-1920's that Eygpt, the world's oldest nation-state, was an integral part of Mediterranean culture, or the West, and those who followed Hassan al-Banna, the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, established in Egypt in 1928 and today the world's largest Islamist network.
Banna's Muslim Brotherhood sought political salvation not through the West, whose institutions and laws Egypt's 19th-century ruler Mohammed Ali had imported to Egyptian society, but through a return to the laws and precepts of Islam.
For Islamists, as they later came to be called, Arab greatness could be reclaimed only through a return to and revival of Islam and its caliphate, whose rulers presided over the medieval world's most vibrant empires and innovative cultures.
After Gamal Abdel Nasser's 1952 military coup, the Islamists were crushed and the liberals withered. Arab nationalism and socialism became much of the Arab world's secular religion. Leftists had their heyday under Nasser, the embodiment of pan-Arabism, who gave intellectuals a designated role as the explainers of the new faith.
But the 1967 military defeat by Israel, Anwar el-Sadat's lonely peace with the Jews and finally, the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran all weakened the left. "The death knell," Mr. Bashir said, "was the Soviet Union's collapse and the 1991 gulf war, which pitted Egypt, pan-Arabism's standard-bearer, against fellow Arab nationalist Iraq."
After Nasser, Sadat, who had once been editor of Al Ahram, had little use for the men of letters, especially those who opposed him. There was no room for them in Sadat's Infitah, or economic liberalization. Intellectuals, proselytizers of the discredited pan-Arab nationalist faith, no longer had a function. Said Mr. Bashir, "The government no longer provides intellectual dynamism and sense of mission as Nasser did."
Meanwhile, the siege of Egypt's secularists, which began in 1992 with the assassination of Farag Foda, a writer and human rights activist, and nearly claimed the life of Naguib Mahfouz, a cultural icon and the only Arabic writer to win the Nobel Prize in Literature, has continued despite a drop in the number of terrorist attacks. Religious extremists who advocate violence still try to punish those who deviate from Islam's "straight path," as they define it, with charges of heresy and apostasy, crimes punishable by death under sharia, or Muslim holy law, which since the mid-1980's has been the main source of Egyptian law.
A group of self-appointed guardians of the faith, the Islamic Research Center of Al Azhar, a branch of the Government's seat of Islamic learning, which is empowered to judge the merits of works that concern religion, has targeted Sayed al-Qimany, a 50-year-old secularist who has written 10 books on Islamic history "as it actually is," he said in an interview, "as opposed to what the Islamists would like it to be."
In August the Government's arts police removed Mr. Qimany's latest book, "Rabb Al Zaman," or "God of Time," from bookshelves after the clerics charged that the book violated Egyptian law by defaming Islam. What he wrote, Mr. Qimany says, is that Islam's third caliph, Othman, "was a weak, unpopular ruler who let his brother brutalize Egyptians" in the seventh century. Citing sources also used by Al Azhar, he also wrote that Othman had issued his own, self-serving version of the Koran, which Muslims believe contain the actual words of God.
 
A Secular Author Wins in Court
 While western scholars have analyzed religious texts as historical documents for more than a century, similar efforts in many Arab countries are still considered heretical and punishable by law. But Mr. Qimany contested the issue in Egyptian court and won.
In September, a high court ruled that the book did not insult or mock Islam and ordered it returned to bookstores. But the Islamists responded by issuing their own books, one of which denounces Mr. Qimany as "more dangerous than Salman Rushdie," the writer who faces constant death threats for his work. So Mr. Qimany is now constantly guarded by the Egyptian police and lives apart from his wife and children to protect them.
But he vows to continue challenging the Islamic orthodoxy. "The Islamists will not ultimately win here, but to stop them we may need 1,000 Farag Fodas," he said."I'm ready to pay that price."
Last summer, Article 19, the London-based anti-censorship group, accused the Egyptian Government of encouraging Egypt's intolerant militant trend by competing for legitimacy "on the Islamists' terms" and trying to co-opt Establishment clerics by letting them "ban books and censor films and endorse violent attacks on secularist writers." But Mr. Kholi argues that Egypt has recently taken a "much firmer stand" against Islamic literalism and intolerance.
Mr. Kholi, however, has his own problems, which reflect another source of pressure facing intellectuals who depart from received political wisdom. In January 1997, he was among nine well-connected Egyptian intellectuals who met in Copenhagen with 42 Palestinian, Jordanian and Israeli counterparts to push for cultural exchanges among those who favor territorial concessions by Israel in exchange for peace with the Arabs. But this leftist-led effort to establish normalization of discourse infuriated not only Egyptian Islamists opposed to peace with Israel but also pan-Arabists on the left who remain bitterly opposed to Sadat's peace. Their insistence on boycotting Israel is often the sole remnant of pan-Arabism, an ideology that some liberal Egyptian intellectuals say evolved into a cover for despotism at home.
Among the most stinging of critiques came in the pages of Al Ahram from Mr. Kholi's close friend and once leftist ally, Mohammed Sid Ahmed. Mr. Sid Ahmed said he denounced the Copenhagen group not because he opposed peace with Israel or cultural normalization in principle, but because President Mubarak was using the intellectuals to placate an Israel whose new leaders seemed intent on sabotaging peace and humiliating the Arabs. "This is not cultural exchange," Mr. Sid Ahmed said. "It is a state game."
Because Mr. Sid Ahmed wrote a book in the early 1970's, "After the Guns Fall Silent," which envisaged what peace could mean for Arabs and Israelis, Mr. Kholi does not question his friend's motives.
But he has been stunned by the relentless savageness of the attacks; there were three in a single day in Cairo newspapers in January.
Saad Eddin Ibrahim, a university professor and human rights activist, notes that despite their troubles, Egyptian thinkers are better off than their colleagues in, say, Algeria, where intellectuals are targeted for throat slittings by Islamists and figure disproportionately among the estimated 70,000 Algerians killed in the civil war between religious extremists and the autocratic, military-backed Government.
Indeed, the campaign against secularists, along with wars and political oppression, have driven many of the finest Arab minds not only from Cairo but also from Beirut, Baghdad and Damascus to the West, leading Abdelrahman Munif, a Saudi novelist who found shelter in Syria, of all places, to describe Paris as the "capital of the Arabs."
Mr. Ibrahim says the location of intellectuals no longer matters as much as it once did. "Satellites cross national borders and every point of view can now be heard on them," even, he asserted, on those owned by conservative Saudis and other wealthy gulf Arabs.
With such changes, some now argue that the problems of Egypt's intellectuals are peculiarly Egyptian. Still, intellectuals such as Mr. Bashir insist that what happens in the self-professed "mother of the world" resonates as strongly as ever in other Arab capitals.
