HEADLINE: A Soft Landing and a Push on Global Warming

BYLINE: By MARK A. STEIN

 BODY:
BUOYED by encouraging economic news, the stock market bobbed near a record high this week. Congress acted to rein in oil drillers' subsidies, and some of the country's biggest companies joined traditional foes to address some of the country's thorniest problems.
 The frothy mergers-and-acquisition market bubbled along, with bids, battles and, well, one bomb.

TOUCH AND GO -- The American economy seems to have made a so-called soft landing after the housing market peaked last year, and appears to be taking off again, the latest economic data suggested. 
A tight labor market is pushing up many workers' wages, consumers are spending more at shopping malls and the skid in the housing market is easing in some areas of the country.
 A survey of industrial production showed unexpected growth last month, and the Consumer Price Index, the nation's best-known inflation gauge, rose at its fastest pace in eight months -- on the surface, at least, an indication of robust demand.
 The numbers suggest the Federal Reserve will not lower interest rates when it meets at the end of this month, and may actually have to raise rates later in the year.

ROLLING BACK BREAKS -- House Democrats passed legislation to rescind $14 billion in tax breaks and subsidies for domestic oil producers and use the money for alternative energy and conservation technologies.
 The bill would rescind $7.6 billion in tax breaks for oil companies that Congress passed in 2004 and 2005 and add $6.3 billion in royalties from companies that pump oil and gas in publicly owned waters of the Gulf of Mexico and off Alaska.
 It would also correct errors in drilling leases signed by the Interior Department in the late 1990s that will let oil companies avoid paying billions of dollars in royalties over the next decade.
 Senate leaders say they have the votes to send the bill to President Bush. The president opposes the measure, but is not expected to veto it.

STRANGE BEDFELLOWS -- General Electric, DuPont, Alcoa and seven other major companies joined with leading environmental groups to call for a firm nationwide limit on carbon dioxide emissions that would lead to reductions of 10 to 30 percent over the next 15 years.
 Members of the group -- which also includes the utilities Duke Energy in North Carolina, PG&E in California, the FPL Group in Florida and PNM Resources in New Mexico -- have expressed concern that the absence of a national policy could lead to a scattershot system of state-by-state regulation or to even harsher measures, like a stiff tax on fossil fuels.
 Earlier, a coalition of 16 business, medical and consumer groups -- including AARP, the American Medical Association, Pfizer and the Chamber of Commerce of the United States -- proposed to extend health coverage to people now uninsured by expanding federal benefit programs and offering new tax credits to individuals and families. 
 The environmental group's formal announcement is scheduled for Monday, a day before President Bush is to deliver his State of the Union address.

BURST OF BUYING -- General Electric announced a pair of big acquisitions, agreeing to pay $8.13 billion for two Abbott Laboratories' diagnostics units and $4.8 billion for Smiths Aerospace, an aviation electronics maker in London.
 Including its offer earlier in the month to buy Vetco Gray, an oil and gas drilling services company in Houston, G.E. has committed itself to almost $15 billion worth of takeovers in January alone.
 The New York Times reported on Jan. 9 that G.E. was in talks to sell its plastics unit, a slow-growing business that could nonetheless sell for as much as $10 billion.
 Additional deals may have to wait for a decision on the plastics business because G.E.'s chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, said last month that G.E. had $7 billion in cash on hand for industrial acquisitions this year.

JUST SAY NO -- In a rare example of a board denying a request by a controlling shareholder, the directors of Cablevision Systems rejected an $8.9 billion buyout offer from its founding family, the Dolans.
 The board said in a letter to the family that the offer ''does not represent fair value for the company's public shareholders nor does it contemplate a transaction that is in their best interest.''
 Cablevision remains publicly owned, but the Dolans, who own 20 percent of its equity but control 70 percent of its votes, have said they will not sell the company to anyone besides themselves.

TRIBUNE BIDS -- Two firm bidders stepped up with offers to buy the Tribune Company, a media company with television stations and newspapers in the nation's biggest media markets, but neither offered much of a premium over the company's flagging stock price.
 One bid came from Eli Broad and Ronald W. Burkle, two billionaires in Los Angeles, where the Tribune Company owns The Los Angeles Times and KTTV. The other came from the Chandler family, which sold the Los Angeles paper and several others to Tribune in 2000.
 A private equity firm, the Carlyle Group, offered to buy only the TV stations.
 Tribune directors will review the situation this weekend and may ask for new bids.

RAISING THE STAKES -- Express Scripts began a $24.8 billion hostile takeover attempt for a rival pharmacy benefits manager, Caremark Rx, prompting a competing bidder, the CVS Corporation, to raise its offer.
 Caremark rebuffed Express Scripts in favor of CVS's lower offer. Some shareholders sued Caremark's board, saying the directors put their financial interests ahead of shareholder interests.
 CVS, the drugstore chain, said it intended to conclude the takeover by April.

STIFF SENTENCE -- A federal judge in Bridgeport, Conn., sentenced Walter A. Forbes, the former chairman of the Cendant Corporation, to 12 years and 7 months in prison and ordered him to pay $3.275 billion in restitution for leading the largest accounting fraud of the 1990s.
 A jury convicted Mr. Forbes in October of conspiracy and making false statements in a fraud that cost Cendant and its investors $3 billion.
 Mr. Forbes has asked to serve his time at a minimum-security federal prison camp in Otisville, N.Y.

HEADLINE: Consumer Sentiment Reaches 3-Year High

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Consumer sentiment improved more than expected to a three-year high in January, propelled by falling gasoline prices and a favorable view of personal finances and the economy, a survey showed yesterday. 
 The preliminary January reading of sentiment by the Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers rose to 98.0, from 91.7 at the end of December.
It was the highest since 103.80 in January 2004 and well above the 92.5 forecast by analysts polled by Reuters.
 ''This was a nice upside surprise that continues the run of generally favorable U.S. data that have tempered concerns about the health of the economy,'' said Alex Beuzelin, senior market analyst at Ruesch International in Washington. ''This will further put to rest the notion of an early Fed rate cut.'' 
 The survey's gauge of current consumer conditions was 112.5, against a final December reading of 108.1, while its measure of consumer expectations was 88.7, versus 81.2.
 Consumers, while generally upbeat, remain worried about inflation. The survey's one-year inflation index edged up to 3 percent, from 2.9 in late December, and its five-year index stood at 3 percent for a third consecutive month.

HEADLINE: New Haven Arena to Fall, Taking Grand-Scale Vision With It 

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
There are rooftop soirees and a city-sponsored official watching spot. One art gallery has scheduled an open-microphone night to encourage people to share their memories. People from near and far are making plans to witness the implosion, though the whole spectacle is expected to last less than 20 seconds. 
 Saturday morning at 7:30 a.m., the New Haven Veterans Memorial Coliseum -- host to Van Halen, Bob Hope, monster truck shows, wrestling matches and countless minor-league hockey games -- is scheduled to be put to rest. 
From the time it was built in 1972, the Coliseum towered over the city with high hopes of downtown renewal. But for the last 10 years, it has run a deficit as big-name acts skipped over New Haven to play in Connecticut's casinos or other, newer venues.
 Now, after decades of debate over its potential as a tool for urban renewal, the crumbling giant will come tumbling down, even as other midsize cities nearby, such as Yonkers and Bridgeport, are banking on similar stadiums to revive their own downtowns. 
 The decision to destroy the Coliseum reflects a shift in philosophy on urban planning, with Mayor John DeStefano Jr. choosing to focus on arts, education and small retail buildings rather than on large-scale public spaces. 
 ''I think we are taking an approach that is smarter about what works in building a city,'' Mr. DeStefano said. Some people still like the idea of big projects, he said, ''but successful urban life gets woven from lots of small things, not one grand gesture.'' 
 Talking about the Coliseum, he added, ''This was a particularly grand gesture for its time.'' 
 When city officials first made plans for a downtown arena in the 1960s, they believed it would draw a huge number of people, who would in turn bring thousands of dollars with them. At the time, the city had grand plans to remake itself and thought the hulking building would be the ideal ''front gate'' to grab the attention of drivers along the highway. 
 But as early as 1987, officials and residents began debating the possibility of tearing down the 10,000-seat stadium and putting a shopping mall in its place. By then, the Coliseum was already losing money -- about $54,000 that year. It stopped operating in 2002.
 ''There was no chance to make the kind of money that made it worth it,'' Mr. DeStefano said. 
 While New Haven is scrapping its stadium, Yonkers is taking the opposite approach, planning to be the host of a minor league baseball team at a 6,500-seat stadium that city officials envision as the centerpiece of a $150 million development that will likely include several big-box stores. The mayor of Yonkers, Philip A. Amicone, said he hoped the plan, designed for a vacant parking lot in the center of downtown, would bring much needed revenue to his struggling city. 
 Bridgeport built its 10,000-seat stadium in 2001. While performers like James Taylor and Andrea Bocelli have drawn large crowds, there is little evidence that the stadium has boosted other downtown business. 
 New Haven's plans for the Coliseum's space are less grandiose this time around. After the rubble is cleared this summer, the area will be used for parking near Union Station, where Metro-North and Amtrak trains stop. By 2011, city officials said they expected to move the Long Wharf Theater from its current spot on the harbor to the site on Orange Street and also to open a new community college, called Gateway, there. City officials also hope to build several stores and housing units adjacent to the existing retail area across the street. 
 New Haven's new $230 million plans to redevelop the Coliseum site have not attracted much attention -- the real fanfare is about the implosion, which has been delayed for the last two years. It might lack the significance of other famous demolitions -- say the Berlin Wall or the London Bridge -- but residents here were preparing for the Saturday morning destruction of the building with a similar kind of nostalgic excitement. 
 Traffic along Interstates 95 and 91 is to be stopped Saturday morning from 7:15 to 7:45. Some 15,000 tires will be placed around the Coliseum to absorb the impact of more than 2,200 pounds of explosives. City planners said that the rubble could be about 50 feet high, though it is impossible to predict exactly what the destroyed building will look like. 
 And that, of course, is part of the draw. 
 City officials are expecting hundreds of people to show up for a view from the top of the Temple Street parking garage, the city's official observation spot. Tower One, a senior citizen housing complex that, at 20 stories, is one of the largest buildings downtown, is expecting dozens of visitors. Other event-watching plans include more than a few illicit rooftop parties. 
 At Artspace art gallery, a few miles from the Coliseum, plans were to stay open all night Friday and offer an open microphone and free hot chocolate to anyone who comes by. ''We'll be a refuge for a lot of onlookers, I think, but I have no idea how many,'' said Helen Kauder, the executive director. ''We just thought why not be a part of history?''
 Onlookers were encouraged to gather early and be ready at precisely 7:30 a.m. And to try not to blink. 
 ''Whatever will happen, it will take place very quickly,'' said Stephen Goldblum, the owner of Stamford Wrecking Company, which is overseeing the demolition. ''Gravity doesn't take very long.''

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Stubbornly Defies the Dollar's Slide

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER and MARK LANDLER; Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Hong Kong, and Martin Fackler from Tokyo.

 BODY:
Jessica Heyman's breakfast in Paris last month was nothing out of the ordinary: a modest repast of eggs, coffee and a side salad with her husband, Jonathan Podwil, at the popular Cafe de Flore. But the bill was memorable -- 46 euros, or about $60, at the current exchange rate. Five years ago, when the dollar was strong, the same bill would have amounted to $42. 
 The sticker shock provided a powerful incentive to remain frugal the rest of the vacation. ''We ate a lot of bread,'' Ms. Heyman said.
Shocking tourists into counting every penny, and getting Americans back home to spend less on costly imports, is part of what a weaker dollar is supposed to do to help pare America's outsize trade deficit, according to economic textbooks. 
 But, so far, the dollar's slide has not helped enough. Although the dollar has lost a lot of ground against many of the world's major currencies -- including the euro, the British pound and the Canadian dollar -- the nation's trade imbalance with the world has continued to rise, reaching $702 billion in the first 11 months of 2006, on track to easily outstrip the $717 billion of 2005 and set another record.
 Officially, the United States government does not welcome the dollar's weakness. ''A strong dollar is clearly in our interest,'' the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., said last month. 
 But many economists say that the Bush administration is satisfied with the dollar's fall against the euro and some other currencies, counting on the decline to help improve the competitiveness of American manufacturers in global markets.
 For several reasons, however, that may not happen anytime soon -- even if the dollar continues to weaken against European currencies. For one thing, the dollar has not fallen much against the currencies of some crucial trading partners, including China and Japan. Critically, the value of China's yuan against the dollar has been carefully managed by Beijing so that it does not increase much more than 5 percent annually against the dollar. That is a reason China alone ran up a $214 billion surplus in its trade of goods with the United States from January to November last year.
 Many foreign suppliers, moreover, are willing to absorb the impact of a declining dollar on their profit margins rather than pass it on to consumers as higher prices. That gives Americans less of an incentive to shift away from imports.
 In the end, for the United States to begin to balance its trade, American consumers must spend less, while foreign consumers would have to buy a lot more. 
 ''My U.S. colleagues tend to believe that exchange rates can carry out this adjustment painlessly which I, looking from the outside, find hard to believe,'' said Thomas Mayer, chief European economist at Deutsche Bank in London. ''You would need to have unrealistically large changes in exchange rates to overcome that gap.''
 Free market economists argue that the deficit does not really matter -- it is mostly a benign side effect of America's faster economic growth and its appeal as a destination for foreign investment. Trade imbalances are nothing to worry about, these economists say, reflecting private transactions that just happen to occur across borders.
 Still, with the deficit now in excess of 5 percent of the nation's gross domestic product, many other economists worry that the foreign debt needed to finance the growing imbalance is accumulating at an unsustainable pace.
 To some extent, a weaker dollar has bolstered American exports to strong-currency nations. America's inflation-adjusted deficit in trading goods and services with the European Union declined by about 1 percent in the first three quarters of last year compared with the 2005 period, to about $84 billion. 
 And American producers are seeing some benefits. California wineries, for example, have shown double-digit sales growth in Canada every year since 2002, when the dollar started its fall against the Canadian dollar. 
 ''There's a real price threshold of 10 Canadian dollars a bottle,'' said Joseph Rollo, director of the international department at the Wine Institute, the lobby group for California wineries. ''A few years ago it was very difficult for California wineries to make that level. Now it's a lot easier.'' 
 The cheap dollar is also allowing some American companies to enter foreign markets for the first time. Phoenix Closures, a manufacturer of bottle caps in Naperville, Ill., exports very few of its caps to Europe. But a few months ago, it unexpectedly picked up a German client. ''I assume these guys are getting a fairly large price reduction coming to us,'' said Bert Miller, president of the company. 
 The opposite side of Ms. Heyman's expensive breakfast in Paris is that America is now a bargain destination for Europeans.
 ''It was always too expensive for me to go to the States, but now it's a good time,'' said Sotirios Polytimis, 29, an architecture student in Berlin. ''With the same money, I can do more in New York: buy drinks, see the night life, go shopping.'' 
 Some American companies that compete with foreign suppliers domestically have also benefited. ''We are gobbling up market share,'' said Marty Staff, chief executive of JA Apparel, which makes Joseph Abboud suits and sports jackets at a plant in New Bedford, Mass. ''Our products are as good as the European products, but for a lot less money.''
 Still, the shifting currency has moved far too little to alter entrenched habits.
 ''The intractability of consumer behavior is the key to the mystery,'' said Cliff Waldman, economist at the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a research group for American producers. ''About half of the United States' deficit problem with Europe is the difference between the behavior of the European consumer, which is moribund, and the behavior of the American consumer, who never stops.''
 These days, a lot of foreign things do look ridiculously expensive to American eyes: the $4.15 Big Mac in Paris; the $16.50 ticket to see a movie at the multiplex in Leicester Square in London; $5.89 for a heavily taxed gallon of gas in Frankfurt. 
 But Europe remains irresistible. American purchases of travel services from European Union countries totaled $17.7 billion in the first three quarters of last year, almost 1 percent more than in the period in 2005, after inflation, and about 20 percent more than in the period in 2003.
 The number of German tourists visiting the United States this winter is down approximately 20 percent compared with last year, according to TUI, the largest European tour operator. Robin Zimmermann, a spokesman for TUI, said Germans were favoring destinations in Southeast Asia, where currencies had also fallen against the euro.
 Martin N. Baily, former chief economic adviser to President Bill Clinton, remains optimistic that the decline in the dollar will ultimately turn the United States' current-account deficit around. ''I think we are poised for a gradual reduction,'' Mr. Baily said. ''We are at a point where exports are starting to grow faster than imports.''
 Currency adjustments can take time to feed through into trade patterns. In fact, a slide in the dollar could initially worsen the nation's trade balance, as the price in dollars of imports would increase immediately while it could take time for American consumers to switch to domestic products.
 But new factors arising from the increased globalization of production seem to be making the trade adjustment particularly slow. For instance, by moving more production out of Europe, into dollar-pegged regions like China and elsewhere in Asia, European companies have created natural hedges against a strong euro.
 ''With globalization, we now have a large network of plants all over the world,'' said Anton Borner, president of BFA, an association of German wholesalers and exporters based in Berlin. ''So we are not as affected by changes in a single currency.''
 Hugo Boss, one of Joseph Abboud's main competitors, is based in the southern German town of Metzingen. But it also stitches garments at a factory in Cleveland and buys raw materials from Asia, where most of its transactions are in dollars or dollar-linked currencies. 
 Sales of Boss suits and accessories rose 14 percent in Europe in the third quarter of 2006, but 17 percent in the United States, in volume terms. The company said it had not felt much of an impact from the strong euro.
 ''If the dollar stays in a reasonable range, say between $1.10 and $1.50, it will not affect us that much,'' said Bruno E. Salzer, the chairman of Boss. ''If it were to go to $1.60 or $1.70, that would mean there are bigger economic problems than just the exchange rate.''
 With Asian production now a big part of the equation for manufacturers all over the world, even big increases in the yuan and other Asian currencies would probably do little to shift output without causing major economic disruptions.
 The People's Bank of China is holding about $1.01 trillion in reserves, the vast majority in dollars, which it has amassed as part of its strategy to keep the yuan from appreciating against the American currency to ensure Chinese products remain competitive in the United States market.
 But even though Asian central banks are diversifying their holdings slightly, any big withdrawal from the Treasury market that slowed the flood of credit that has helped keep American interest rates low could harm the Chinese as well as Americans.
 ''With China,'' said Mr. Waldman, the manufacturing economist, ''the capacity for trade imbalances to adjust is minimal.''

HEADLINE: The Quicksand of Debt

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Banks Gone Wild,'' by Joe Lee and Thomas Parrish (Op-Ed, Jan. 13): 
A dictionary definition of usury is: ''The illegal action or practice of lending money at unreasonably high rates of interest.''
 Is 29.99 percent -- the rate paid by ''T. P.,'' a credit-card holder mentioned by Mr. Lee and Mr. Parrish -- usurious?
 It's a simple question. A Congressional committee could call in the heads of the banks and credit-card companies who charge such rates and ask them to respond to this and other simple questions, for example:
 At what point does an interest rate become usurious? Forty percent? Fifty percent?
 According to a personal-finance columnist cited in the article, ''If T. P. continued to pay little more than the monthly minimum, it could take him more than 30 years to pay off his balance -- even if he never went shopping again.'' 
 Is T. P. a customer or an indentured servant?

HEADLINE: The Marriage Ideal And Unwedded Bliss

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''The Elusive Altar'' (column, Jan. 18):
David Brooks keenly observes two very different pictures of life for unmarried women, largely determined by socioeconomic status. But I take issue with his proposed remedy for folks down the social scale: to view marriage ''more as a social machine'' that ''can be useful for achieving practical ends,'' instead of as an unreachable ''state of sacred bliss.'' 
 Mr. Brooks has got it backward. Successful marriages indeed start out as a state of ''sacred bliss,'' and their practical achievements and social benefits flow from the mutual love, respect and fidelity spurred by that commitment. 
 In my Roman Catholic faith, that's why we deem matrimony a sacrament -- an outward sign of God's grace to the entire community. (Of course, the trick is sustaining the bliss long enough to reap the benefits.)

To the Editor:
 David Brooks prefers to shame and stigmatize, rather than help real individuals, relationships and families to thrive. 
 Being unmarried is not being ''trapped in a no man's land between solitude and marriage.'' It is often a smart, life-affirming choice. Using marriage as ''a social machine'' penalizes the unmarried. 
 Government policies reward marriage by withholding benefits from unmarried people. Given that one-third of children live in unmarried households, better policy would offer all parents the relationship skills, economic opportunities, health insurance and so on they need to succeed. 
 Three cheers for unmarried people who ''don't want to marry until they are financially secure and emotionally mature.'' Ideally, people should be secure and mature when they have children, too. 
 But pushing marriage on unprepared parents simply increases the chances that children will live through divorce. It makes more sense to help single parents succeed as parents than to push them into risky marriages.

Brooklyn, Jan. 18, 2007

To the Editor:
 David Brooks recommends that we strengthen marriage by encouraging people to value it less and engage in it more. But he doesn't discuss the ''except gay people'' clause.
 In our country, children of gay couples are deprived of the same civil rights and protections afforded to my child by the legal institution of marriage. They are a nebulous population, governed by no consistent legal policy by the family court system if their parents' relationship fails. It's bad for those kids, and it's bad for our country.
 Either the social fabric matters, or it doesn't. Either marriage is good for our social fabric, or it's not.

HEADLINE: Election Could Decide Serbia's Role in Europe 

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS WOOD

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
While six years of democracy in Serbia have given its people ample opportunities to vote -- in four presidential elections, two parliamentary elections and a nationwide referendum -- many complain that the country has seen little change. 
 Serbia remains isolated from the European Union while most of its former Eastern bloc neighbors -- Hungary to the north and most recently Romania and Bulgaria to the east -- have become members.
 Western governments are hoping, though, that parliamentary elections to be held Sunday will make a difference by uniting Serbia's notoriously divided democratic bloc and by preventing the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party from consolidating its position as the largest group in Parliament.
 The election's timing is particularly crucial. The parties that form the next government will be faced with the possible loss of Kosovo, the province that has been controlled by the United Nations since 1999 and whose Albanian majority is seeking independence. 
 Martti Ahtisaari, a former president of Finland who is overseeing talks on the future of Kosovo, is expected to unveil his proposals for a settlement soon after the election.
 Since the fall of Slobodan Milosevic in 2000, successive governments have failed to substantially improve Serbia's ties with the West. The stumbling block has remained the surrender of war crimes suspects to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague.
 Last May, talks that were supposed to help forge closer ties with the European Union were suspended after the government of the Serbian prime minister, Vojislav Kostunica, a moderate nationalist, failed to locate Gen. Ratko Mladic -- the former commander of the Bosnian Serb Army and one of the most notorious of the fugitives -- after repeated deadlines set by the regional organization.
 The ultranationalists are widely expected to receive the largest number of votes over all, but the outcome of the election will probably depend on the success of the party led by Boris Tadic, the Serbian president and a supporter of closer ties with Europe.
 In recent polls, Mr. Tadic's Democratic Party narrowly trails the Radical Party. Behind them is Mr. Kostunica's coalition, led by the Serbian Democratic Party.
 There has been a substantial amount of diplomatic and political pressure from abroad to encourage the Democratic Party and the Serbian Democratic Party to work together and seriously consider forming a coalition government.
 On Thursday, Gerhard Schroder, the former German chancellor, appeared at a Democratic Party rally alongside Mr. Tadic, calling him ''the one who can ensure a European future for Serbia.''
 On Wednesday, the United States Senate passed a resolution expressing its support for Serbia's democratic forces.
 ''This is really a turning point,'' said Pierre Mirel, a European Commission envoy who visited Belgrade this week. ''The time has come to embark the country on a different relationship with the E.U.''

HEADLINE: Warm Days and Hard Times in Snowmobile Land

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

DATELINE: CHESTER, Vt., Jan. 18 

 BODY:
For 24 winters, Bev and Butch Jelley, owners of the B&B Mobil station here, have provided legions of snowmobilers with fuel and chili. But this year the kitchen is quiet, and the snowmobiles are nowhere to be found.
 Snowmobile clubs and the businesses that cater to them are having their second bad year in a row in many parts of New England, as warm weather has turned flakes to wet blobs and left trails a grassy, rocky mess. 
 Conditions are improving for clubs in Northern Maine, which received a foot of snow this week, and are getting better in parts of the Northeast Kingdom in Vermont and the North Country of New Hampshire, both of which received snow this week.
 But elsewhere, snowmobile clubs are seeing memberships decline, meaning a drop in the dues used for trail maintenance. The lack of riders is severely affecting restaurants and gas stations like the Jelleys', which laid off much of its winter staff and is closing on Sundays to save money.
 ''It's horrible. We've been here 24 years and have never closed on a Sunday,'' Mr. Jelley said. ''We need snow for snowmobilers. That's what we depend on in the winter; it's 99 percent of our business.''
 Pat Budnick, owner of the Motel in the Meadow, has a sign saying ''Think Snow'' in the reception area.
 ''I'm down $3,000 from last year in January, and so far that's just 18 days,'' Ms. Budnick said. ''We haven't had one snowmobiler, because the trails aren't open.''
 Ann Shangraw, president of the Vermont Association of Snow Travelers, which oversees local clubs and distributes money for grooming trails, said fewer than 5,000 memberships had been sold so far this season. The association, known as VAST, normally sells about 30,000 memberships annually, Ms. Shangraw said.
 ''Our budget is membership-driven,'' she said, adding that the association distributes about $800,000 annually to clubs. ''We are a wealthy association until the end of this year. We are by no means folding, but at the end of this season we will be thinking about programs and services to cut.''
 Ms. Shangraw said snowmobiling brought $553 million annually to Vermont, according to the association's last economic impact study.
 Local associations are also trimming their budgets. Dick Jewett, president of the Chester Snowmobile Club, said that all of the club's trails had closed and that he had not had occasion to use its snow-grooming machine, which sits in his garage. The club, he said, gets $10 from VAST for every mile of trail it grooms.
 Mr. Jewett said that the club had 489 members last year, and that as of Sunday, only 110 riders had joined so far this year. Because of budget concerns, the club will probably do away with two scholarships it gives out, he said, and look for other ways to trim its budget.
 ''It's the second year with light snowfall,'' Mr. Jewett said. ''In order to survive, we'll have to make cuts.'' 
 In Maine, registrations were down by a quarter, said Bob Myers, executive director of the Maine Snowmobile Association, but the state just received snow, and people plan to snowmobile this weekend, Mr. Myers said.
 Bill Cost, owner of Inn by the River in The Forks, Me., said he and other business owners were trying to salvage the season. Mr. Cost, who helps maintain trails, said the region recently got about a foot of snow, roughly one-third of what it takes for good snowmobiling conditions. He expects heavy use this weekend.
 ''It's been devastating, absolutely devastating. It has a huge trickledown effect,'' said Mr. Cost, who had to lay off four employees because business was slow this year and last. ''We're holding our breath, hoping the cold and snow continue.''
 Here in Chester, Benny's Power, which services cars and sells snowmobiles, has three years of unsold stock out back.
 Chris Gansz of Full Throttle Motor Sports in Warren, N.H., and a member of the Asquamchumauke Snowmobile Club, said he could not get rid of his inventory of used snowmobiles.
 ''No one is buying sleds. I couldn't sell a used sled to save my life right now,'' Mr. Gansz said. The club, he said, is worrying about money.
 ''We're all scratching our heads wondering how we're going to pay for the groomer this year,'' he said. ''Our checkbook is taking a pretty good hit right now.''
 John Plante, president of the Sno-Bees Snowmobile Club in Barre, Vt., has not given up hope.
 ''We're waiting, praying, for snow,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A New Player at Star Wars: China Shows Assertiveness In Reported Weapons Test

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: BEIJING, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
China's apparent success in destroying one of its own orbiting satellites with a ballistic missile signals that its rising military intends to contest American supremacy in space, a realm many here consider increasingly crucial to national security.
 The test of an antisatellite weapon last week, which Beijing declined to confirm or deny Friday despite widespread news coverage and diplomatic inquiries, was perceived by East Asia experts as China's most provocative military action since it testfired missiles off the coast of Taiwan more than a decade ago.
Unlike in the Taiwan exercise, the message this time was directed mainly at the United States, the sole superpower in space.
 With lengthy white papers, energetic diplomacy and generous aid policies, Chinese officials have taken pains in recent years to present their country as a new kind of global power that, unlike the United States, has only good will toward other nations. 
 But some analysts say the test shows that the reality is more complex. China has surging national wealth, legitimate security concerns and an opaque military bureaucracy that may belie the government's promise of a ''peaceful rise.''
 ''This is the other face of China, the hard power side that they usually keep well hidden,'' said Chong-Pin Lin, an expert on China's military in Taiwan. ''They talk more about peace and diplomacy, but the push to develop lethal, high-tech capabilities has not slowed down at all.''
 Japan, South Korea and Australia are among the countries in the region that pressed China to explain the test, which if real would make it the third power, after the United States and the Soviet Union, to shoot down an object in space.
 China's Foreign and Defense Ministries declined to comment on reports of the test, which were based on United States intelligence data. Liu Jianchao, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, would say only that China opposed using weapons in space. ''China will not participate in any kind of arms race in outer space,'' he told Reuters.
 China's silence on the test underscores how much its rapidly modernizing military -- perhaps especially the Second Artillery forces, in charge of its ballistic missile program -- remains isolated and secretive, answering only to President Hu Jintao, who heads the military as well as the ruling Communist Party.
 Having a weapon that can disable or destroy satellites is considered a component of China's unofficial doctrine of asymmetrical warfare. China's army strategists have written that the military intends to use relatively inexpensive but highly disruptive technologies to impede the better-equipped and better-trained American forces in the event of an armed conflict -- over Taiwan, for example.
 The Pentagon makes extensive use of satellites for military communications, intelligence and missile guidance, and some Chinese experts have argued that damaging its space-based satellite infrastructure could hobble American forces.
 Yet while China's research and development of such weapons has been well known, the apparent decision to test-fire an antisatellite weapon came as a surprise to many analysts.
 ''If this is fully corroborated, it is a very significant event that is likely to recast relations between the United States and China,'' said Allan Behm, a former official in Australia's Defense Ministry. ''This was a very sophisticated thing to do, and the willingness to do it means that we're seeing a different level of threat.''
 China's military expenditures have been growing at nearly a double-digit pace, even after adjusting for inflation, for 15 years. China has begun to deploy sophisticated submarines, aircraft and antiship missiles that the Pentagon says could have offensive uses.
 Yet with a few notable exceptions, Beijing has avoided sharp provocations that could prompt the United States or Japan to focus more on what some officials in each country regard as a potential threat. 
 Chinese leaders emphasize that they are preoccupied with domestic challenges and intend to focus their energy and resources on economic development, a policy they say depends heavily on cross-border investment, open trade and friendly foreign relations.
 The country has denied that it intends to develop space weapons and sharply criticized the United States for experimenting with a space-based missile defense system. It forged a coalition of Asian countries to jointly develop peaceful space-based technologies.
 Last month it published and heavily promoted a white paper on military strategy that emphasized its view that space must remain weapon-free. ''China is unflinching in taking the road of peaceful development and always maintains that outer space is the common wealth of mankind,'' the paper said. 
 Some of such talk amounts to little more than propaganda. But Jonathan Pollack, a China specialist at the Naval War College in Newport, R.I., says the Chinese military does in fact act cautiously when it comes to improving its strategic capabilities, like long-range missiles and nuclear weapons, to avoid causing alarm in the United States.
 ''They have talked about antisatellite weapons,'' he said. ''But we have always thought that the threat was ambiguous and that China probably wanted it that way. So what was the calculation to go ahead with an actual test?''
 Some analysts suggested that one possible motivation was to prod the Bush administration to negotiate a treaty to ban space weapons. Russia and China have advocated such a treaty, but President Bush rejected those calls when he authorized a policy that seeks to preserve ''freedom of action'' in space.
 Chinese officials have warned that an arms race could ensue if Washington did not change course.
 At a United Nations conference in Vienna last June on uses of space, a Chinese Foreign Ministry official, Tang Guoqiang, called the policies of ''certain nations'' disconcerting.
 ''Outer space is the common heritage of mankind, and weaponization of outer space is bound to trigger off an arms race, thus rendering outer space a new arena for military confrontation,'' he said, according to an official transcript of his remarks.
 Even so, Mr. Pollack, of the Naval War College, said that if China hoped that demonstrating a new weapon of this kind would prompt a positive response in Washington, they most likely miscalculated.
 ''Very frankly, many people in Washington will find that this validates the view of a China threat,'' Mr. Pollack said. ''It could well end up backfiring and forcing the U.S. to take new steps to counter China.''
 Other analysts said the test might have more to do with proving a technology under development for many years than a cold-war-style negotiating tactic. 
 China maintains a minimal nuclear arsenal that could inflict enough damage on an enemy to guard against any pre-emptive strike, these analysts said. But the increasing sophistication of American missile interceptors, which are linked to satellite surveillance, threatens the viability of China's limited nuclear arsenal, some in Beijing have argued.
 That may have prompted the Second Artillery to show that it had the means to protect fixed missile sites and ensure China's retaliatory capacity by showing that it could take out American satellites.
 At the annual military fair in Zhuhai, held in November, the Guangdong-based newspaper Information Times and several other state-run media outlets carried a short interview with an unidentified military official boasting that China had ''already completely ensured that it has second-strike capability.'' The analyst said China could protect its retaliatory forces because it could destroy satellites in space.
 American officials have also noted the development. This month, Lt. Gen. Michael Mapes of the Army testified before Congress that China and Russia were working on systems to hit American satellites with lasers or missiles. And over the summer, the director of the National Reconnaissance Office, Donald M. Kerr, told reporters that the Chinese had used a ground-based laser to ''paint,'' or illuminate, an American satellite, a possible first step to using lasers to destroy satellites.
 ''China is becoming more assertive in just about every military field,'' said Mr. Behm, the Australian expert. ''It is not going to concede that the U.S. can be the hegemon in space forever.''

HEADLINE: Shares Close Mixed as Earnings Reports Fail to Inspire

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Shares closed narrowly mixed yesterday after profit reports and forecasts from companies like I.B.M. and General Electric left investors unimpressed.
 Profit concerns have unnerved investors who are already skittish about whether stocks will continue the upward movement from last year.
 ''I think we're at an extremely pivotal psychological level,'' said T. J. Marta, economic strategist at RBC Capital Markets. 
 Earnings and economic figures support the Federal Reserve's notion that any decline in the economy will be soft and gradual, although Mr. Marta contended that a ''fly-by'' was a possibility.
 The Fed is unlikely to lower short-term interest rates if the economy continues at a steady clip or if it begins to accelerate again. The central bank has left interest rates unchanged at its last four meetings after a string of 17 consecutive increases that began in 2004.
 Last year, investors propelled stocks sharply higher partly on the widely held view that the Fed would cut rates perhaps as early as the first half of 2007.
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 2.40 points, at 12,565.53. Broader stock indicators were higher. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.13 points, to 1,430.50, and the Nasdaq was up 8.10 points, at 2,451.31.
 For the week, the Dow industrials rose 0.08 percent, while the S.& P. fell 0.02 percent, and the Nasdaq lost 2.1 percent.
 Bonds fell as stocks tried to further their gains. The benchmark 10-year Treasury bonds was down 8/32, to 98 26/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 4.78 percent, from 4.74 percent.
 Oil settled up $1.51 at $51.99 a barrel. The increase follows sharp declines in recent sessions and could signal that investors are eager to buy oil to cover previous commitments as they head into the weekend. 
 Though the mood on Wall Street might have soured somewhat in the new year, consumers appear to have remained decidedly upbeat. Consumer sentiment, as tracked by the University of Michigan's survey, showed a preliminary reading of 98.0 for January compared with 91.7 in December. It is the highest showing since January 2004.
 Since the start of this year, investors have been looking for reasons for a continuation of last year's sharp gains in stock prices.
 The tepid gains this year reflect concerns over interest rates and the Fed's next move as well as whether profit growth will remain strong enough to push stocks upward.
 Yesterday, I.B.M. fell $3.28, to $96.17 after the company's better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit met with little enthusiasm from investors. Part of the profit increase was a result of changes in the company's tax rates. 
 Alcoa helped offset some of the weakness in the Dow industrials. Alcoa, the world's largest aluminum maker, rose $1.10, or 3.6 percent, to $31.40, after it said it would repurchase up to 10 percent of outstanding shares and increased its annual dividend to 68 cents from 60 cents.
 General Electric slid $1.05, or 2.8 percent, to $36.95 after its first-quarter forecast disappointed some investors. G.E. also said it planned to restate financial results from 2001 through 2005 and the first three quarters of 2006 to adjust its accounting for some debt.
 Citigroup , the investment bank, rose 11 cents, to $54.50, after posting a 26 percent drop in its fourth-quarter profit. 

Fortress Sets Range for I.P.O.
 WASHINGTON, Jan. 19 (Dow Jones/AP) -- Underwriters on Friday set the terms for the initial public offering of the Fortress Investment Group at 34.29 million Class A common shares with an estimated price range of $16.50 to $18.50 each.
 In early November, Fortress Investment filed for an offering of up to $750 million in Class A stock but did not detail the terms.
 Fortress said it would be the first global alternative asset manager listed on the New York Stock Exchange. It has about $29.7 billion in assets under management.
 All of the shares will be offered by the company, and none of the company's five principals will sell shares in the offering, according to the prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 After the offering, the principals -- Wesley Edens, Peter Briger, Robert Kauffman, Randal Nardone and Michael Novograwill -- will hold 77.7 percent of the voting power of the stock, according to the S.E.C. filing.

HEADLINE: Student-Loan Company Is Allowed to Keep Subsidy

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
The Bush administration reached an accord with a student loan company that will let it keep $278 million in subsidies that the inspector general of the Education Department found improper, the department said yesterday.
 Under the agreement, the department will suspend future payments of more than $800 million, in addition to the $278 million paid to the company, Nelnet, until an audit determines whether the company was eligible for the money.
The inspector general's office said Nelnet billing practices could lead to its receiving that much in overpayments. 
 Under Secretary of Education Sara Martinez Tucker said the department had decided not to recover past payments because such a precedent might require it to pursue other loan companies, too, possibly driving smaller ones out of business and reducing borrowing options.
 ''We were trying to make the best decision for the taxpayer and the student,'' Ms. Tucker said in a conference call with reporters. 
 The settlement drew criticism from Democrats in Congress days after the House approved a bill to cut interest rates on some new federal student loans and reduce lenders' guaranteed profits. 
 ''The administration should have settled for nothing less than the full recovery of Nelnet's ill-gotten proceeds from these loans,'' said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. ''The Department of Education's settlement is a loss for students and taxpayers, who are the victims of Nelnet's greed.''
 Representative George Miller, Democrat of California and chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor, said his panel would investigate the accord. ''We will ensure that taxpayer dollars are used properly,'' Mr. Miller said in a statement.
 Mike Dunlap, chairman and co-chief executive of Nelnet, of Lincoln, Neb., said the company had done nothing wrong. 
 ''We are pleased to have reached a resolution that allows us to avoid costly litigation to demonstrate the merits of our position,'' Mr. Dunlap said.
 The audit by the inspector general found that Nelnet had improperly exploited a subsidy program that guaranteed it 9.5 percent interest on loans. The guarantee was established in the 1980s, when interest rates were high, to keep lenders in the college-loan business. 
 Congress tried to rein in the program in 1993, but the loans ballooned as lenders found ways to increase their portfolios of loans that they said were eligible for the guarantee.
 In September, the office of the Education Department inspector general said Nelnet, acting when interest rates were low, enlarged its portfolio of eligible loans to nearly $3.7 billion in June 2004, from $551 million in March 2003. The report found that the increased amount ''was ineligible to be billed under the 9.5 percent floor.''
 As of Dec. 31, Nelnet said it had $3 billion in loans it considered eligible for the 9.5 percent payments. 
 Nelnet is not the sole lender accused of using such techniques. The Education Department said it would stop paying claims from other lenders seeking subsidy payments until those claims had been audited.
 In 2005, the inspector general found that a nonprofit loan company in New Mexico improperly exploited the subsidy program to obtain millions of dollars in overpayments. That lender, the New Mexico Education Assistance Foundation, was also allowed to keep the subsidy it had received.
 The issue is politically charged. Democrats have in the past accused the Education Department of being lax in preventing lenders from exploiting the program, in part because of the administration's connections with lenders. Nelnet officers and its political action committee have been major donors to Republicans.
 The Education Department had said it was following policies that the Clinton administration established. 
 Democrats have made the loans a prime issue, focusing on soaring costs of higher education and college graduates' increasing debt burdens.

HEADLINE: Pennsylvania Governor Pushes Health Plan

BYLINE: By SEAN D. HAMILL

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
Gov. Edward G. Rendell arrived here Friday to rally support for his plan not only to extend health insurance coverage to the state's 760,000 uninsured adults, but also to cut billions of dollars in heath care costs and ban smoking in restaurants, bars and workplaces. 
 Mr. Rendell said the plan would require 47 changes to state law and regulations. It follows efforts in several other states to offer some version of universal health coverage.
 Though Pennsylvania has one of the lowest uninsured rates in the nation -- about 7 percent, compared with 20 percent in California -- Mr. Rendell said the proposal was crucial because ''the system is near collapse.''
 At a meeting with business and civic leaders at the private Duquesne Club downtown, Mr. Rendell pointed to a chart indicating that health care costs grew 75 percent in the state over the past seven years, while wages rose 13 percent and inflation increased 17 percent.
 ''We can't go through another seven years of that,'' he said.
 Mr. Rendell did not provide any cost estimates for the plan, but said that it relied on federal money, some redirected state money and a group of new taxes, including a 10-cent-per-pack increase in the cigarette tax and a fee on businesses that do not offer insurance to their employees. (A law approved last year is intended to extend health insurance to the state's 150,000 uninsured children.)
 The governor's proposal also contains measures intended to make health care more efficient. One is an effort to reduce hospital-acquired infections, estimated to cost billions of dollars every year.
 Though Mr. Rendell had previously said he would sign a bill authorizing a ''single-payer system'' whereby the state would be the insurer for the uninsured, nothing like that is in his proposal.
 During his other stop Friday, at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, he said such a plan would be ''inordinately expensive'' and ultimately ''untenable to the legislature.''
 Mr. Rendell's proposal differs in significant ways from recent state-sponsored health care packages in California and Massachusetts.
 Both those states require individual participation, but, under Mr. Rendell's plan, Pennsylvania would not. 
 In California, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, wants the Legislature to approve health insurance coverage for illegal immigrants. But Mr. Rendell, a Democrat, said he did not try to provide coverage for Pennsylvania's estimated 150,000 illegal immigrants because Republicans in the legislature had said they would not back it.
 Lawmakers of both parties have expressed support for some parts of Mr. Rendell's proposal, but passage of the entire plan is likely to be difficult. Among the reasons are that Republicans control the State Senate.

HEADLINE: U.N. to Audit Its Activities After Reports on North Korea Program

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
Ban Ki-moon, the new secretary general, called Friday for outside examination of all United Nations activities after a published report that the United Nations Development Program in North Korea was making unaccountable payments in hard currency to local staff members and the North Korean government.
 Mr. Ban sought ''an urgent, systemwide and external inquiry into all activities done around the globe by the U.N. funds and programs.'' 
 His prompt action, taken after a morning meeting with the program's associate administrator, Ad Melkert, appeared to be an effort to head off the kind of problems that his predecessor, Kofi Annan, faced after muddled United Nations responses to reports of scandals.
 ''We are very pleased with the new team's reaction,'' said Richard A. Grenell, the spokesman for the American Mission. Mr. Ban, the former foreign minister of South Korea, began his five-year term on Jan. 1.
 Complaints about the United Nations activities in North Korea were raised over the past month by the United States Mission in a series of letters to directors of the program and were made public on Friday on the op-ed page of The Wall Street Journal.
 In the latest letter, dated Tuesday, Mark D. Wallace, the deputy United States ambassador for management, said that the United Nations Development Program's operation had been ''systematically perverted for the benefit of the Kim Jong Il regime rather than the people of North Korea.''
 Mr. Wallace said that the local staff of the development program was dominated by employees of the repressive government, that the United Nations had failed to conduct proper on-site audits and depended instead on ''sham'' ones by the North Korean government, and that all payments were made at the government's demand in hard currency -- dollars or euros -- rather than the won, the national currency.
 ''Simply put,'' Mr. Wallace wrote, ''in the absence of real audits and site visits, it is impossible for U.N.D.P. to verify whether or not any of the funds paid to the D.P.R.K. for supposed use in U.N.D.P. programs have actually been used for bona fide development purposes or if the D.P.R.K. has converted such funds for its own illicit purposes.'' North Korea is officially called the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and sometimes referred to by its initials.
 Mr. Melkert, the associate administrator, said that the program had spent $2 million to $3 million in North Korea annually in the past two years.
 He said it would cease making hard currency payments to the government, local vendors and individuals as of March 1 and would also start hiring local staff members in North Korea the way it does elsewhere, by its own choice and on merit. 
 Even making payments in the won currency will not stop a flow of hard currency to the government, however, because the United Nations will have to buy the won from the central bank, he noted.
 ''The question -- and it is an entirely legitimate one -- comes down to whether you want to operate as the U.N. in a country like North Korea,'' Mr. Melkert said.
 He said that he welcomed the call for external auditing of his agency's activities. Currently they are examined in internal audits, which are then given to the United Nations auditing board, which decides what to transmit to the General Assembly.
 Asked about the American charge that funds might have been diverted to illicit ends, he said, ''The audits have not given any reason for suspicion about money not being used for the purposes meant. Still, in order to make sure that there are no misperceptions or unintended consequences, we are supportive of an external independent audit.''
 It was not clear how quickly or effectively Mr. Ban could impose his order across the range of United Nations agencies, many of which have differing auditing procedures and over which he does not have direct budget authority.
 ''It's worldwide; it's not going to be done overnight,'' said Michele Montas, his spokeswoman.

HEADLINE: Low Prices Abound on the High Seas

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
LOOKING for a cheap Caribbean getaway? With bookings up at many resorts, deep discounts are hard to find on land -- but there are plenty out at sea. Weak demand for Caribbean sailings is leading many cruise lines to slash prices -- as low as $189 for some three-night cruises -- in an effort to spur sales. 
 Celebrity Cruises has been advertising four-night Caribbean sailings from Miami for as low as $249 a person under ''special promotions'' on its Web site, www.celebritycruises.com. Royal Caribbean, www.royalcaribbean.com, was offering a five-night western Caribbean cruise on Splendour of the Seas, departing Feb. 3, for $297 a person. Carnival Cruise Lines, www.carnival.com, has been offering weeklong Caribbean cruises from Florida and San Juan starting at $499 a person. On top of that, the company is offering a two-category upgrade for many bookings through Feb. 15. 
During the first 10 days of January, prices for more than 460 Caribbean cruises were reduced, according to SureCruise.com. Savings averaged about $74 a person, with some cutting rates by thousands of dollars. 
 The best bargains are for short itineraries. A recent search on Expedia.com turned up a four-night Royal Caribbean cruise to the Bahamas starting at $189 a person for an inside cabin or $239 a person for an ocean-view room. Prices are typically 10 percent less than they were last year for three- and four-night Caribbean cruises, according to Expedia, with a few as much as 30 percent off. 
 And because many cruise lines have been introducing new ships or refurbishing aging vessels, ''you're getting a better selection at better prices,'' said Mark Kammerer, Expedia's cruise expert.
 The weak demand and subsequent discounts are being driven, in part, by reductions in disposable income for some less affluent cruise passengers and by lingering confusion over new passport rules that take effect this week. Prices for summer cruises to Alaska and Europe are about the same as last year's. 
 ''It's a bit of a dichotomy,'' said Tim Conder, a leisure analyst at A. G. Edwards & Sons. The Caribbean cruise market, he said, consists mostly of first-time cruise passengers, who typically have lower incomes than the more experienced travelers who tend to sail outside the Caribbean.
 The more affluent customers have generally felt less impact from rising interest rates on adjustable mortgages and home equity loans, while many Caribbean cruise passengers are being pinched. ''They don't have as much left over in their wallets,'' Mr. Conder said.
 On Tuesday, new security rules go into effect that require Americans returning by plane from Mexico, Panama, the Caribbean and Canada to carry passports. An early draft of the rules would have required Caribbean cruise passengers to carry passports too, but after heavy lobbying by the travel industry, Congress voted to postpone the deadline for travel by sea. Before that decision was made, however, many would-be travelers who didn't have passports made other plans. 
 An increase in outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness -- including two recent occurrences during Caribbean sailings on the world's largest cruise ship, Royal Caribbean's Freedom of the Seas -- hasn't helped demand, either. There were 33 outbreaks aboard cruise ships last year, more than in any other year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which tracks outbreaks that affect 3 percent or more of either passengers or crew members. And norovirus, the highly contagious group of viruses that can cause a miserable one- or two-day bout of vomiting, diarrhea and cramping, was either confirmed or suspected in nearly every case.
 Though often associated with cruise ships because it thrives in close quarters and because cruise lines are required by law to report all gastrointestinal illnesses onboard, the risk of contracting norovirus is hardly confined to ships. It is the most common cause of such illness in North America, sickening an estimated 23 million Americans each year. The rise in shipboard outbreaks is associated with the rise in passengers sailing on more ships at sea, which increases the risk for spread of illness between passengers, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.
 Cruise companies say they clean ''high-touch'' areas of ships like banisters and elevator buttons several times a day if there is an outbreak and offer sick passengers rebates if they promise to stay in their rooms. Some cruise lines even question passengers before boarding to see if they have any symptoms. 
 But such measures can't prevent a sick passenger from knowingly or unknowingly coming aboard and infecting others. After more than 380 people on the Freedom of the Seas were sickened by norovirus during a Caribbean cruise Nov. 26 to Dec. 3, the ship was cleaned and subsequently inspected by the Centers for Disease Control. Even so, more passengers and crew members fell ill on the next trip, the following week. (The best defense against catching a stomach bug aboard ship is simple: keep washing your hands.) 
 Thinking of booking? Don't wait too long. While cruise deals to the Caribbean could linger, planes that carry passengers to the port cities are filling up quickly, pushing air fares higher. Average January air fares to and from many big ports are up compared with those a year earlier, according to Sabre Airline Solutions -- by 3 percent to Tampa and Orlando, Fla., 9 percent to Miami, and 10 percent to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where many Caribbean cruises depart.
 ''The earlier you book, the easier it is to get all the accommodations you want,'' said Mark Kammerer of Expedia. ''People who wait until the last minute typically ''don't get the flexibility on dates of departures, itinerary, ships or cabin that meet all their needs.''
 Among the most coveted are rooms with balconies, Mr. Kammerer said, which allow passengers to sit outside their own rooms and ''have the sea go by.''

I have noticed that children are receiving more and more gift cards for birthdays (Freakonomics, Stephen J. Dubner and Steven D. Levitt, Jan. 7). It's fun for my son to pick out a gift, but I'm the one who has to take him to Borders or Toys ''R'' Us. And the item he decides on may cost more than the amount on the card. I see this as an unfortunate off-loading of the gift-buying process to the parent of the recipient. Isn't it enough that I give the party?

HEADLINE: How Long Can the Hotel Industry Stay in High Gear? 

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
THE hotel industry has made a stellar comeback since bottoming out about five years ago, with occupancy and room rates rising sharply nationwide. Analysts expect another strong year in 2007, though they caution that the opening of hotels planned when the industry began its expansion may cool off the market. 
 ''What we've had the past three years were really exceptional levels of growth that we haven't seen since the early 1980s,'' said Bjorn Hanson, a principal at PricewaterhouseCoopers, which tracks the hotel industry.
''This year we may not see the increasing pricing power that we had in 2006, but it's still a very impressive forecast,'' Mr. Hanson said. He predicted that revenue earned per hotel room would increase 5.9 percent this year, compared with about 8 percent annually from 2004 through 2006. 
 Revenue gains have been driven largely by rising room rates, which reached a national average of $97.35 a night from January to November 2006, up 7 percent from $90.95 in the comparable period of 2005, according to the most recent data from PricewaterhouseCoopers. In Manhattan, the average room rate climbed to $256.21 a night, also through November 2006, up 12.9 percent from $226.84 in the same period in 2005.
 Consumer demand for hotels should stay robust in 2007, analysts say, as long as the economy and corporate profits remain strong. A weak dollar is also helping to attract foreign travelers, while prompting more Americans to travel domestically instead of abroad, they added. 
 But rising room rates may not be helping some luxury hotels. ''High pricing has caused some trading down,'' Mr. Hanson said, noting that, nationwide, some of the less expensive upscale brands like Courtyard by Marriott have managed to attract more guests. ''It isn't that the luxury segments lost business,'' he said. ''But due to large rate increases, they just didn't gain some of the business anticipated.''
 Some hotel analysts said they feared that pricing in New York City, in particular, where room rates soared almost 30 percent in 2005 and 2006, may begin to drive away some customers.
 ''When you talk to meeting planners and business travel coordinators, there really is a perception out there that New York has gotten to be, in some cases, prohibitively expensive,'' said John A. Fox, a senior vice president at PKF Consulting, which specializes in hotels. 
 The lodging industry in New York City, though, has been remarkably resilient since 2001, when the market was weakened by the dot-com bust and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. Some hotels went out of business, while others converted to residential condominiums, taking an estimated 4,000 rooms off the market and leading to the run-up in room prices. 
 At the same time, high prices for land and surging construction costs have thwarted hotel development, making existing hotels more valuable, analysts added. 
 As a result, the pace of hotel sales has risen sharply. ''In 2002, I could count on one hand how many hotel sales there were in Manhattan,'' said Dan Fasulo, director of market analysis for Real Capital Analytics, which follows the commercial real estate market. 
 Last year, 19 hotels changed hands, representing about $2.9 billion in sales volume and more than 4,800 units, Mr. Fasulo said.
 Istithmar Hotels, which is controlled by the royal family of Dubai, was the largest buyer of commercial real estate in Manhattan last year, with $2.1 billion worth of acquisitions, according to Real Capital Analytics. The transactions included the purchase of the 270-room W New York Union Square for $285 million and a 73 percent interest in the 248-room Mandarin Oriental, New York, said Istithmar, which put the Mandarin's value at $340 million.
 Nolan Hecht, director of the hospitality transactions group at Cushman & Wakefield, the commercial real estate brokerage firm, said the fast pace of sales should continue in 2007.
 ''I expect even Manhattan hotel owners, who were typically long-term generational holders, to be tempted by the current valuations, which make it an overwhelmingly compelling time to liquidate,'' he said.
 An estimated 3,500 hotel rooms are proposed for development in 2007 in New York City, about two-thirds of them in Manhattan, which has a total of about 65,000, Mr. Fox said.
 Dean Schwanke, a senior vice president at the Urban Land Institute, said that conversions into condominiums had significantly reduced the number of full-service hotels, leaving the sector ripe for developers. ''There will be more full-service development planned for prime locations in 2007,'' he said.
 The hotels scheduled to open this year in New York City are relatively small, Mr. Hanson said, the largest being the 282-room Plaza, which will reopen after being shut in 2005 to convert much of the structure into condos. Though the city is seeking a developer to build a hotel for the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, it is not anticipated to open until 2010; it would have about 1,500 rooms.
 Some analysts say there may be overbuilding of limited-service and condo-hotels in some parts of the country. But small, independent properties called boutique hotels, which offer specially designed rooms and upscale amenities, remain popular in major cities that attract international travelers, noted Daniel H. Lesser, a senior managing director with the hospitality group at CB Richard Ellis, the commercial real estate brokerage firm. ''They've become very much an accepted hotel product that travelers feel comfortable with,'' he said.
 The Hotel 373 Fifth Avenue, at 35th Street in Manhattan, is a boutique property that is opening this month. The hotel, with 70 rooms and a coveted main entrance on Fifth Avenue, will be managed by the Magna Hospitality Group and was created by Sam Chang, a property developer who has been looking to create midmarket, budget and limited-service hotels in the city.
 With free wireless Internet, iPod docking stations and flat-screen televisions, the hotel aims to attract professionals, said Peter Bode, the director of sales. Rooms are priced at $189 to $299 a night. 
 ''We thought there was strong potential for a midmarket, nonbranded boutique hotel in that neighborhood,'' Mr. Bode said.
 Already open in Manhattan is the Pod Hotel, a 347-room property developed by BD Hotels, the boutique specialist. The hotel, a redesign of the former Pickwick Arms at 230 East 51st Street between Second and Third Avenues, is larger than most boutiques but shares many of their features. It is aiming to lure travelers ages 20 to 35 with rates starting at $89 a night. There are bunk beds and shared baths for some units, as well as iPod docking stations, free wireless Internet and flat-screen TVs. 
 New hotel brands, many created to attract young guests, have been proliferating, Mr. Hanson said. About two dozen hotel brands have been proposed for the United States in the last two years, including Hyatt Place, introduced by the Hyatt Corporation, and Element, owned by Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide. 
 ''There are so many of these start-up brands that there will be some consolidation,'' he said. ''The good news is that these brands are being introduced at a time when there's accelerating construction.''

HEADLINE: How to Corral an Index Fund (With a New Rope)

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM

 BODY:
INDEX funds used to be simple. In fact, ever since indexing rose to prominence as an investment strategy in the late 1990s, simplicity has been a big selling point.
 Traditional index funds remove much of the emotion and ego from investing. You buy and hold all the stocks that make up a market benchmark and achieve average returns, rather than trying to beat the market through active stock picking. There's not much to it -- and that's been indexing's strength.
But a group of market theorists have emerged recently with a take on indexing that complicates matters considerably. These so-called fundamental indexers say they can beat the market, not just match it, a core assertion that certainly seems to inject some ego back into the process. 
 Fundamental indexers say it's not a matter of being smarter than the market, but of using common sense. They say it is possible to outperform traditional yardsticks like the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index simply by reconstructing the benchmarks that the funds mimic -- by reweighting an existing index or building a new one. 
 To followers of traditional indexing, the very notion of trying to beat the market by indexing the market is heresy -- not to mention illogical. ''It just doesn't make sense,'' said John C. Bogle, founder of the Vanguard Group, which started the first retail index fund, the Vanguard 500 Index, 30 years ago.
 And to many investors, the distinctions between fundamental and traditional indexing may seem arcane. Both broad strategies call for buying and holding a diversified basket of stocks for the long run. And both try to keep costs down by avoiding active stock picking.
 But traditional index funds tend to mimic indexes weighted by market capitalization, such as the S.& P. 500 or the Russell 1000 index of large stocks. In a cap-weighted index, stocks with greater market values have greater sway over the index's performance. As the price of a stock rises, a traditional index fund reflects that rising value. Conversely, if a stock's price drops, the value of the holding in a traditional cap-weighted fund will also fall. 
 What's wrong with this approach? Well, what if the market isn't always right -- and misprices stocks from time to time? 
 Jeremy J. Siegel, a finance professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said the bubble that formed in technology stocks in the late '90s ''really began to show how far stocks can be pushed away from their fundamental value.''
 ''We saw the biggest mispricing of equities in stock market history,'' he said. Yet cap-weighted index funds put investors at risk by building their technology positions as the market became frothier and frothier. Then, when the Internet bubble burst, those investors saw those huge tech stakes get slammed.
 That's just the nature of the beast, said Robert D. Arnott, chairman of Research Affiliates, an investment management firm based in Pasadena, Calif., that is a major proponent of fundamental indexing. ''With cap weighting, anything that is overvalued is overweighted by the index, and anything that's undervalued is underweighted.''
 Mr. Siegel and Mr. Arnott say they believe that there is a better way. They suggest that instead of building an index based on market capitalization, it is better to use fundamental factors such as earnings, dividends or cash flow to determine how much of a security the index fund should own.
 In a momentum-driven market like that of the late 90s, such a strategy could lag, fundamental indexers say, because investors wouldn't be riding the wave. Conversely, the strategy should hold up better in a falling market, because fundamental indexes were not as likely to be caught up in market hysteria.
 ''In a fundamentally weighted index, you don't become a speculator,'' said Bruce Bond, chief executive at PowerShares Capital Management, which recently opened several exchange-traded funds based on fundamental indexes created by Mr. Arnott's firm, Research Affiliates. Over the last year, the number of exchange-traded index funds that adhere to this new approach has risen to around 50 from just 7, according to State Street Global Advisors. 
 But there is no denying that this new approach forces investors to make several layers of decisions. 
 For example, after deciding that indexing -- and not active stock-picking -- is the best way to go, you must decide which type of indexing to choose -- fundamental or traditional. If the choice is fundamental indexing, you must decide which fundamental factors -- earnings, sales, dividends or cash flow, for instance -- are most important. Then comes another decision: Which recipe for a fundamentally weighted index is best, based on those variables? 
 There are already squabbles forming about whose theories of alternative indexing are superior. Wilmington Trust recently opened two retail mutual funds that tracked fundamentally weighted indexes. The indexes rely on three variables: dividends, free cash flow and net income. 
 By contrast, Mr. Siegel -- who serves as senior investment strategy adviser to WisdomTree Investments, which has started 30 fundamental index funds -- prefers to focus on dividends. Why dividends? They are ''just about the only valuation metric where there is no dispute -- where there's no management manipulation,'' he said. Mr. Siegel added that not only do dividend-paying stocks perform better than nonpayers over the long run, they also tend to fare better in bear markets. 
 BUT Mr. Siegel's competitors point out that WisdomTree recently filed to register a new set of fundamentally oriented E.T.F.'s that weight stocks based on earnings. This would imply that WisdomTree doesn't believe that dividends are the best way to weight an index in all circumstances. And Mr. Siegel agreed in a recent interview that ''it's wrong for me to say blanketly that it's the best for everyone at all times.''
 For his part, Mr. Arnott said he thought that a dividend-only model, while potentially effective in beating the S.& P. over the long term, could create portfolios that were not as broadly diversified as other funds. As an alternative, Research Affiliates has constructed several fundamentally weighted indexes using a combination of sales, cash flow, dividends and book value. Based on records from the last four decades, Mr. Arnott said, the Research Affiliates Fundamental Index 1000, a large-cap index, would have handily beaten the S.& P. 500. From 1962 to 2006, the RAFI 1000 would have generated an average annual return of 12.5 percent, versus 10.4 percent for the S.& P. 
 But Mr. Bogle said that ''these are hypothetical returns for the underlying indexes that don't take into account fees, costs and taxes'' that would be associated with running an actual index fund. What's more, he said, many fundamental index funds charge more in fees and have higher turnover rates than traditional index funds like the Vanguard 500. 
 Some critics say that the fundamentals approach isn't really indexing at all. After all, they contend, a fundamental index provider has to select a method for weighting stocks that it thinks is superior to the collective wisdom of the market.
 ''What they're doing is active management,'' said Clifford S. Asness, managing principal at AQR Capital Management in Greenwich, Conn. 
 And because of the emphasis on fundamental factors rather than market capitalization, he said, it is a form of active management that tends to favor value-oriented stocks and smaller stocks.
 Mr. Arnott argues that fundamental indexing is a form of passive investing -- that it simply ranks stocks based on their ''economic footprint'' rather than market capitalization.
 Dodd F. Kittsley, director of E.T.F. research at State Street Global Advisors, said that while there were certain ''active components'' to this strategy, it remains a version of indexing. But he wonders how recent market trends may have affected the results of the approach. 
 ''I don't think it's ironic,'' he said, ''that a lot of these fundamental index funds with a value and small tilt have come out at a time when value and small stocks have been doing extremely well.'' 
 At the very least, it may be too early to tell how good these fundamental index funds are, especially because many lack even a one-year track record. ''I'm holding off to see if these funds perform all that differently at the end of the day relative to traditional cap-weighted funds,'' said Sonya Morris, editor of the Morningstar ETF Investor.
 David R. Kotok, chairman and chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors in Vineland, N.J., has begun investing some of his clients' money in fundamentally weighted index funds. 
 But he has refrained from shifting his entire strategy to them, he said. 
 ''These are new vehicles,'' he said. ''We just don't know for certain how they'll perform.''

HEADLINE: Is Greed Good? 

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 In his review of P. J. O'Rourke's ''On 'The Wealth of Nations' '' (Jan. 7), Allan Sloan apparently endorses O'Rourke's claim that Smith's view of the merits of unregulated free markets and free trade apply anywhere and everywhere. 
But Smith's model requires markets in which many sellers offer interchangeable products to many informed buyers, and that there be no government grants of monopolies like patents, copyrights, licenses and trademarks. These conditions apply in our present economy in only some transactions -- like used cars, yard sales, the nails in Sloan's example and most wages. They do not apply to prescription drugs, the services of physicians, lawyers and hospitals, Pentagon contracts, Windows software, DVDs or local utilities, among many other sectors.
 Smith's model depends on the greed of sellers to offer more goods when profit margins are high. The increased supply in a free market (like the one for nails) drives down prices and margins, and therefore greed serves the general interest. In the absence of all the conditions of a free market, greed becomes rapacity.

HEADLINE: Does Owning Guns Prevent Crime?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''A Rifle in Every Pot'' (Op-Ed, Jan. 16):
 Glenn Reynolds may be right in his contention that mandatory firearm ownership helps maintain lower crime rates in some communities, yet the resolution of the question of gun control is not furthered by simply tallying the benefits that accrue to specific groups as a result of ready access to these weapons.
The widespread availability of guns in this country brings with it benefits to some and costs to others. Because the commerce in firearms is hardly impeded by state boundaries, lowered crimes rates in towns like Greenleaf, Idaho, have to be considered with respect to increased homicide rates in cities like Atlanta. 
 This weighing of the pluses and minuses of an activity and determining an appropriate level of regulation is a legitimate role for government. Gun control is no exception. 

Marc Merlin
Atlanta, Jan. 16, 2007

To the Editor:
 Glenn Reynolds argues that America's relatively high rate of gun ownership compared with that of other developed countries leads us to have a lower rate of ''hot'' burglaries (burglaries of occupied homes). 
 This claim rests on very fragile evidence, as Prof. Philip J. Cook of Duke University and I demonstrated in a 2003 study published by the Brookings Institution. In fact, we show that within the United States, counties with higher rates of household gun ownership may, if anything, have higher burglary rates.
 Around 500,000 guns are stolen each year in America. Another two million or three million used guns change hands in ''secondary market'' sales that are almost entirely unregulated. 
 Gun ownership may well exert some deterrent effect on criminals, but these benefits seem to be outweighed by the costs to society. In a 2006 study Professor Cook and I published in The Journal of Public Economics, we estimate that the net social cost of household gun ownership is somewhere in the range of $100 to $1,800 per year. 
 Society might be better off taxing, rather than encouraging, private gun ownership.

To the Editor:
 Here in rural Kentucky, no one would plan a burglary around the idea of finding the victims unarmed.
 My own arsenal -- inherited from my grandfather -- consists of a well-worn single-barrel shotgun, last fired in the 1970s. I've never purchased shells for it, but in a pinch I could wield it as a club.
 Notwithstanding my dubious qualifications as a gun owner, I still benefit from the effect of widespread gun ownership. It gives potential wrongdoers a lot to think about. 

Michael Smith
Cynthiana, Ky., Jan. 16, 2007

To the Editor:
 In expressing support for a recent ordinance in Greenleaf, Idaho, that encourages residents to own guns, Glenn Reynolds argues that a heavily armed citizenry benefits society.
 The evidence Mr. Reynolds cites in support of his contention is selective and doesn't take into account the association between household firearm ownership and lethal violence in the United States. 
 Mr. Reynolds claims that a 1982 ordinance in Kennesaw, Ga., that was similar to the one in Greenleaf resulted in a sharp decline in burglaries. But the most thorough examination of this issue found a small, statistically insignificant increase in burglaries after the law was passed. 
 Mr. Reynolds doesn't mention the only well-controlled study linking firearm prevalence to burglary, which found that counties with higher rates of household gun ownership have higher, not lower, burglary rates.
 In concluding that a heavily armed citizenry ''may not be a bad idea,'' Mr. Reynolds dismisses the preponderance of empirical evidence from studies in the United States linking the presence of a gun in the home to an increased risk of homicide, suicide and unintentional firearm deaths.

Matthew Miller, M.D.
Boston, Jan. 16, 2007

The writer is the deputy director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center.

To the Editor:
 Glenn Reynolds overstates the benefits of armed citizens' acting as agents independent of law enforcement. Yes, armed citizens ''can play an important role in stanching crime,'' but they can play an even greater role in fomenting it because, as numerous studies conclude, more guns equal more -- not less -- mayhem.
 And the ''armed populace'' mandated in the Militia Act of 1792 and other early laws ''requiring adult male citizens to own guns'' did so because they were, according to the law, to ''be enrolled in the militia'' controlled by the government -- the opposite of the vigilantism Mr. Reynolds extols.

HEADLINE: Blinding Ourselves in Space

 BODY:
You don't have to be a space or climate expert to recognize that this country's ability to track climate and environmental changes from space is heading in the wrong direction. At a time when concerns about global warming are rising, the Bush administration is sharply reducing the number of satellites that can measure the impact of rising temperatures and a host of other environmental trends. 
 The administration's hypocrisy is stunning. For years, the president and top officials have justified their refusal to grapple seriously with global warming by insisting that more research is needed. Now, after pledging that such research would be the centerpiece of a new climate change strategy, the administration is underfinancing some of the most important efforts to gather data.
A report issued last week by the National Academy of Sciences projected an alarming decline in vital studies and monitoring. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration currently has a sizable number of Earth-observing satellites and instruments in orbit, but since 2000 its budget for earth sciences has decreased over 30 percent when adjusted for inflation. 
 By 2010, the number of operating sensors and instruments on NASA satellites that observe the Earth is likely to drop by 40 percent as old equipment fails and is not promptly replaced. Meanwhile, at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, huge cost overruns and technical problems have delayed planned launchings of key climate and weather-monitoring satellites and forced the elimination of instruments essential for climate science. 
 The setbacks are bound to hobble efforts to understand whether hurricanes and heat waves are becoming more frequent and intense, whether ice sheets will collapse and drive sea levels dangerously high, and how fish stocks, deforestation, drinking water supplies and air pollution are affected as populations grow and economies take off. We clearly need more data in coming years, not less. 
 The academy's panel estimates that some $7.5 billion in new money is needed through 2020, mostly at NASA, to conduct high-priority observational missions. NASA's resources are already grievously overextended. It must finish building the international space station, keep flying the rickety shuttle fleet and start developing a follow-on spacecraft to explore the Moon and get ready to travel to Mars. 
 With little new money to carry out these costly tasks, the agency has been forced to rein in other parts of its budget, including earth science studies. Unless Congress gives NASA more funds, the agency should shift money internally to give Earth observations higher priority. Studies that could affect the livability of the planet seem vastly more consequential than completing a space station or returning to the Moon by an arbitrary date.

34,000 DEATHS

The News -- More than 34,000 Iraqi civilians were killed in violence last year, according to a United Nations report released on Tuesday.

Behind the News -- The first comprehensive annual count of civilian deaths provided a vivid measure of the chaos there. The Iraqi government called the figure exaggerated; the United Nations says it relied on official sources. If anything, the figure of 34,452 deaths -- about 94 a day -- may be lower than the true number, since it did not include the December totals from all provinces. And some deaths go unreported. 


830,000 BIRTHS

The News -- France announced that 830,000 babies were born there last year, the most in a quarter century.

Behind the News -- French officials said the rising birth rate was a victory for government policies promoting inexpensive day care and generous parental leave. The baby boom coincides with a continuing decline in the number of French marriages as couples opt to form civil unions. The increase also comes as other European countries, worried about economic growth, look to reverse a decades-long decline in fertility rates. A glass of red wine, perhaps?

$50 A BARREL

The News -- Oil prices dropped briefly below $50 a barrel for the first time since May 2005 after the United States reported larger-than-expected oil and gas reserves.

Behind the News -- The drop in prices has been gaining speed since the beginning of the year. Supplies are ample, warm weather in the Northeast has kept down demand and producing countries can't agree on production cuts. The government's energy forecasters say the price of regular gasoline could drop to close to $2 a gallon. Others expect oil prices to rise, pulling up gasoline prices. Might want to fill 'er up now.

$1 MILLION CAP

The News -- Democrats in the United States Senate took aim at the multimillion-dollar pay packages awarded to corporate executives.

Behind the News -- $213 million. $210 million. $95 million. Those are some of the recent exit packages for departing executives. The deals often include millions paid out over time to limit the tax hit. Now Democrats want to limit deferred compensation to $1 million -- which could raise $800 million in taxes over 10 years. The Senate Finance Committee approved the limit last week.

THE NEW NO.2

The News -- The Yorkshire terrier has passed the German shepherd and golden retriever to become the second most popular purebred dog in the nation.

Behind the News -- It was no surprise that the Labrador retriever ranked No. 1 on the American Kennel Club list, having held that spot since 1991. But it was the first time in nearly 70 years that a small breed reached No. 2. And that says something about the way we live, said Lisa Peterson, a club spokeswoman: ''Many modern dog owners prefer a portable, pint-size pet that fits their modern, fast-paced lifestyle.''

HEADLINE: Why Are There So Many Single Americans?

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
THE news that 51 percent of all women live without a spouse might be enough to make you invest in cat futures.
 But consider, too, the flip side: about half of all men find themselves in the same situation. As the number of people marrying has dropped off in the last 45 years, the marriage rate has declined equally for men and for women.
The stereotype has been cemented in the popular culture: the hard-charging career girl who gets her comeuppance, either violently or dying a slow death by late-night memo and Chinese takeout. Think Glenn Close in ''Fatal Attraction'' and Sigourney Weaver in ''Working Girl,'' two enduring icons. In last year's model, Meryl Streep in ''The Devil Wears Prada'' ends up single, if still singularly successful.
 But when it comes to marriage, the two Americas aren't divided by gender. And it's not the career girls on the losing end. It's their less educated manicurists or housekeepers, women who might arguably be less able to live on their own. 
 The emerging gulf is instead one of class -- what demographers, sociologists and those who study the often depressing statistics about the wedded state call a ''marriage gap'' between the well-off and the less so.
 Statistics show that college educated women are more likely to marry than non-college educated women -- although they marry, on average, two years later. The popular image might have been true even 20 years ago -- though generally speaking, most women probably didn't boil the bunny rabbit the way Ms. Close's character did in 1987. In the past, less educated women often ''married up.'' In ''Working Girl,'' Melanie Griffith triumphs. Now, marriage has become more one of equals; when more highly educated men marry, it tends to be more highly educated women. Today, Harrison Ford and Sigourney Weaver would live happily ever after. 
 Women with more education also are becoming less likely to divorce, or inclined to divorce, than those with less education. They are even less likely to be widowed all in all, less likely to end up alone.
 ''Educated women used to have a difficult time,'' said David Popenoe, co-director of the National Marriage Project at Rutgers University. ''Now they're the most desired.'' In Princeton, where he lives, men used to marry ''way down the line,'' Mr. Popenoe said. No more. 
 The difference extends across race lines: black women are significantly less likely to marry than white women, but among blacks, women with a college education are more likely to marry than those who do not.
 Among women ages 25-34, 59 percent of college graduates are married, compared with 51 percent of non-college graduates, according to an analysis of the Census Bureau's June 2006 Current Population Survey by Steven P. Martin, a sociologist at the University of Maryland. The same is true at older age groups: the difference is 75 percent to 62 percent for those ages 35-44, and 50 percent to 41 percent among those 65 and older.
 The difference is smaller between men and women. According to the census, 55 percent of men are married, down from 69.3 percent in 1960, and 51.5 percent of women are, down from 65.9 percent in 1960.
 The number of women living without a spouse is greater largely because women live longer, leaving them more likely to be widowed. Older men are also more likely to remarry. To control for these variables, consider 35-44 year olds. In 2005, according to the census, 66.2 percent of men in this age group were married, down from 88 percent in 1960; 67.2 percent of women were married, down from 87.4 percent.
 The marriage gap exists for men, too. But particularly at younger ages, it is not nearly as wide as it is among women. 
 Commitment-averse men in their 20's and 30's, it turns out, look the same whether or not they have a college degree. In surveys and focus groups, they fit depressingly well into the old stereotypes: they fear marriage means a loss of liberty; they worry a wife will want to change them. They don't trust women to tell the truth about past relationships, or they are waiting for the soul mate who hasn't appeared. With the rising frequency of cohabitation, they can get sex without marriage, and they might lose their hard-earned money in a divorce, so what's the rush? 
 As a Marriage Project report concluded, with no biological or sociological clock ticking, ''boys can remain boys indefinitely.''
 But that gap widens among older men. Among men ages 25 to 34, 50 percent of college graduates are married, compared to 47 percent of those who did not graduate from college. In older age brackets, there is a difference of 12 percentage points.
 The class gap happens in large part because, as Christopher Jencks, a professor of social policy at Harvard, said, ''like marries like.''
 ''If you wanted to predict the characteristics of who I would marry,'' he said, ''knowing my education, the strongest correlation you could observe is that someone who is educated is more likely to marry someone who is educated, and someone who is not educated is more likely to marry someone who is not educated.''
 Why have things changed so much for women who don't have the choices that educated women have? While marriage used to be something you did before launching a life or career, now it is seen as something you do after you're financially stable -- when you can buy a house, say. The same is true for all classes. But the less educated may not get there.
 ''Women are saying, 'I'm not ready, I want to work for a while, the guys I hang around with don't make enough money and they don't want a commitment,' '' Mr. Jencks said. ''It's the same thing a lot of African-American women in poor neighborhoods are saying. But there's the difference that they're having children.''
 Women of all education levels figure their earning power will flatten out after they have children, he said. ''The longer you wait, the higher the level it flattens out at,'' he said. ''That's a good argument to wait. For the less educated, there isn't a steep increase in salary, so there's less incentive to wait.''
 Maybe in the past, a man with little education nevertheless had a good-paying manufacturing job, with a health care and pension plan. He was a catch and represented stability. 
 Today, it may be hyperbolic to talk about the emasculation of the blue-collar man. But it is not only liberals concerned with the wealth gap who are watching these national trends with alarm. Social and religious conservatives have called on society to do more to address economic strains faced by this class. 
 ''Marriage is more difficult today than it was in the past,'' Mr. Popenoe said. ''The people who excel in one area probably excel in that area, too. And people who are high school dropouts probably have a higher propensity to drop out of marriage.'' 
 The last 30 years have seen a huge shift in educated women's attitudes about divorce. Mr. Martin, who has written about women and divorce, said that three decades ago, about 30 percent of women who had graduated from college said it should be harder to get a divorce. Now, about 65 percent say so, he said. 
 But for less educated women and for men, the numbers have not changed; only 40 percent -- a minority -- say it should be harder to get a divorce.
 ''The way we used to look at marriage was that if women were highly educated, they had higher earning power, they were more culturally liberal and people might have predicted less marriage among them,'' Mr. Martin said. ''What's becoming more powerful is the idea that economic resources are conducive to stable marriages. Women who have more money or the potential for more money are married to men who have more stable income.''
 All this leads to a happiness gap, too. According to the Marriage Project, the percentage of spouses who rate their marriage as ''very happy'' has dropped among those without a college education, while it has risen or held steady among those better educated.
 The better educated husbands and wives tend to share intellectual interests and economic backgrounds, as well as ideas about the division of household roles. They also have more earning power. And as in so many other things, in marriage, money helps ease the way.

HEADLINE: Helping Small Businesses Get Bigger

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED. 
This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
MITCHELL GOSS is a very busy businessman. So busy running his small but growing digital-age business that he did not have time to hunt for the loan he needed to continue expanding.
 ''I'm running the day-to-day aspects, and it's very time-consuming to go out and find the right financial institution,'' he said.
So Mr. Goss sought help from an organization that he had heard about: the Small Business Development Center at Pace University in Lower Manhattan. His move paid off; an adviser at the center narrowed the list of potential lenders to half a dozen ''that she really felt would sit down with me and listen to my story and take me seriously,'' he said. One agreed to provide the money. 
 Mr. Goss, 30, is the founder and owner of ZeroIn Media, a three-year-old New York company that installs and manages digital-screen signs. The screens carry general advertising in heavily trafficked public spaces, or, in locations like supermarkets and banks, convey information to patrons about products, prices and services.
 In going to the Pace center for help, Mr. Goss tapped into a network of more than 1,100 locations across the country where an owner of a small business, or someone wanting to start such a business, can receive free planning, management and technical assistance as well as help in the search for financing. 
 The sites are part of the Small Business Development Center Program, a national effort that is financed by the federal Small Business Administration, the states and co-sponsors like universities and colleges, where many of the centers and their satellite and outreach offices are located.
 New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have a total of 35 centers as well as additional branch offices where centers cover large geographical areas. There are seven centers in New York City, including the Pace operation.
 Although the national program has grown steadily since 1980, when it was established to help spur economic and job growth, and the centers have assisted many entrepreneurs and business owners, many are still unfamiliar with them, economic development experts say. 
 This is especially true in immigrant communities, they say, even though many centers are seeking to make themselves better known. (Locations are available through the locator link at sba.gov/sbdc or from the Small Business Administration at 1-800-827-5722.)
 Moreover, some businesspeople who do hear about the centers ''think that we can't be good because we're free, and they will go to their accountants for advice,'' said Ira Davidson, director of the Pace center. 
 But most accountants focus on tax-related matters, like maximizing revenue by reducing tax liabilities, he said, while the basic challenges in starting or enlarging a business -- or simply avoiding red ink -- are broader, involving issues like the soundness of the business plan and marketing strategies. The individual counseling offered at the centers is meant to help develop such plans and strategies. 
 The Pace center says that since its start in 1986, it has been consulted by about 12,000 business owners and would-be owners. Mr. Davidson, the director since 1992, said recently that he did not know how many of those hoping to start or expand businesses actually did so, but that more than $120 million had been invested in the area's economy through start-ups or expansions by clients the center knew about.
 Mr. Goss said he went to the center last year because he needed money for additional operating capital and to add staff members to the dozen he now has.
 He said his company had installed and operates a network of several hundred digital signs around the country, generally ranging in size from 42 inches to 8 feet. Among those that carry general advertising in New York are four in the Pier 17 mall building at the South Street Seaport and about a dozen in the Empire State Building.
 Catalina Castano, an adviser at the Pace center who helped Mr. Goss search for a loan (they both declined to disclose the amount), said, ''We looked at his business's financial situation and his financial situation, and I knew he had a strong case.''

HEADLINE: The Sound And The Fury

BYLINE: By NOAH MARCEL SUDARSKY

 BODY:
HEATHER MILLSTONE had a bucolic childhood, living with her parents in suburban Rockville, Md., in a peaceful home that bordered a farm. That idyllic setting, however, didn't last. 
 ''We had woods right near the house, where I would go deer-spotting with my father,'' recalled Ms. Millstone, an impish 32-year-old with curly brown hair. ''And all of a sudden, we were straddling a highway.'' Transportation officials, it turned out, had decided that the area needed a major thoroughfare. Ms. Millstone was bereft; she had lost her stamping grounds.
If competition over space pops up occasionally in open areas like Ms. Millstone's Maryland neighborhood, it does so continuously in places like New York, where people live not only cheek by jowl, but even stacked up on top of one another. Unfortunately, though, the upset and rancor that New Yorkers feel in such collisions are no less intense. The hubbub of the city, it seems, does not thicken anyone's skin. 
 Just ask Ms. Millstone, or her neighbors, or local officials, or anyone else involved with Heathers, the bar in the East Village that Ms. Millstone opened in the fall of 2005. It is a case study in hurt feelings and hard choices. 
 Ms. Millstone, for example, said she believed she had built an impenetrable acoustic defense between her bar and the apartments above -- an issue she said she was sensitive to in light of the noisy road built near her Maryland home. The anti-noise barrier at Heathers seems impressive: The tin ceiling tiles encapsulate a total of 14 inches of fiberglass wool insulation, two fire-coated layers of plasterboard and two suspended layers of heavy-duty soundboard. 
 But Frank Hartin does not have high regard for the soundproofing. He lives directly above Heathers, and in just the bar's first nine months, he said, he called 311 to complain about the noise ''probably about 50 times.'' He also has kept a detailed log of his attempts to seek relief from Ms. Millstone, the police and various city officials -- a practice that illustrates the frustrations and all-consuming nature of these disputes. 
 And as in other bar fights, the discontent over Heathers has broadened to include analyses of ambient sound and decibel meters, jurisdictional issues, licensing laws, tavern economics and much more. 
 Night life and noise are always a fraught topic in the city, but they are particularly so now. An overhaul of the city's noise code, the first in more than 30 years, will take effect on July 1. Moreover, in light of the growth of bars in gentrifying areas and the spillover of smoking patrons onto sidewalks because of the no-smoking laws, officials are taking a close look at night-life regulation. 
 Late last month, for instance, the City Council made public a report on New York night life that among other things, calls for creating a special body to rule in cases involving ''problem'' bars and clubs, and even a citywide Office of Nightlife to oversee the industry. Two days earlier, the State Liquor Authority published the findings of its licensing task force, which recommended ways to tighten up licensing. 
 If the case of Heathers demonstrates anything, it is that the Council and the Liquor Authority will have their hands full. Perhaps it is inevitable given the ethereal, fleeting nature of noise, but complexity seems to be a hallmark of such disputes, as is the principle that what you see -- or hear -- depends very much on where you sit. 

'A Glorified Watchdog'
 The entrance to Heathers, which is on 13th Street between Avenues A and B, is a discreet, understated affair, though not quite as discreet as that of its predecessor, Brownie's, the last of the old-school Alphabet City after-hours joints. The bar has no bouncer, only a few panels of obscured industrial glass and a heavy, dull black steel door. Ms. Millstone jokes that there is a ''Please Don't Notice Me'' sign outside, and the same could almost be said of Ms. Millstone herself, who has a small-town, dressed-down look. 
 Despite her low-key demeanor, though, Ms. Millstone has drive. When she created Heathers, taking out a mortgage on her Alphabet City co-op, her ambition was nothing less than to plant the seeds of an artistic resurgence. 
 ''I've tried to have an avant-garde element,'' said Ms. Millstone, who holds a master's degree from the School of Visual Arts. ''I was nostalgic for a period I never actually experienced, the early '80s, when there was a thriving art scene in the East Village.'' 
 Toward that end, Heathers holds regular video screenings, and brunches that double as auctions for original art. Adjoining the bar is a large window display devoted to curated artwork; currently featured is a series of photographs by Manuel Sander, great-grandson of the German photographer August Sander. 
 Beer and vodka free of glutens, which are proteins often found in wheat and other grains, are served at Heathers, because ''many artists have dietary issues,'' Ms. Millstone said. She says that she suffers from gluten intolerance, which can set the stage for an illness known as celiac disease.
 But Heathers is no quiet museum. It is a bar, and it is a bar that plays music, unapologetically, and can accommodate 60 or so chattering patrons. 
 Ms. Millstone notes that she has taken steps to avoid disturbing local residents. Besides the multiple layers of soundproofing, for example, she has placed about the bar a variety of neat little placards telling patrons to be respectful of the neighbors and not to congregate outside the premises. Also, Heathers employees monitor patrons on the sidewalk to keep them from disturbing the neighbors. 
 Nevertheless, Ms. Millstone said, she has been forced into battle mode by the local community board and an active minority of residents.
 ''They want to shut me down,'' she said. ''I'm a casualty of the blanket opposition to new establishments. It doesn't matter what you do. First they tried to get my commercial status revoked. I had to hire a zoning lawyer, which cost me $10,000 and left me broke. Now they'd like to take away my liquor license.'' 
 Last June, Heathers was raided by a multiagency task force that included representatives of the city's Buildings, Health, Sanitation, Fire and Environmental Protection Departments, all under the command of the Ninth Precinct's Cabaret Unit. 
 ''They unleashed the cavalry,'' Ms. Millstone said with a nervous smile. Ultimately, some citations were issued concerning fruit flies and the absence of a notice with the owner's name outside the bar. Ms. Millstone paid a fine to the Health Department for the fruit flies, but she has been cleared of all other violations, including a noise citation issued last October. 
 Whatever the outcome of such enforcement actions, however, Ms. Millstone said the stress of continually dealing with the police and hostile neighbors had made her resentful and disenchanted. 
 ''I can relate to people who are bothered by loud music or a noisy clientele,'' she said. ''But I'm operating a perfectly legal, respectful establishment. We shouldn't have to live in a bubble.'' Her dream for Heathers as a center of an East Village artistic revival, she said, is getting lost. ''Instead of basking in a kind of creative effervescence,'' she lamented, ''I've become a glorified watchdog. I talk to the Cabaret Unit all the time.'' 

'Loud Music Is Loud Music'
 ''Bars have taken a heavy toll on the community,'' said Alexandra Militano, chairwoman of the subcommittee of Community Board 3 that oversees applications for liquor, beer and wine licenses in the bustling East Village and Lower East Side. ''We are oversaturated. A lot of residents in this community are subjected to really horrible conditions.'' 
 But the board strives for fairness and neutrality, she said. ''We get materials and we review the materials and we try to make the best decision for the community, the most informed decision, and take the interests of the person who's applying into account,'' she said, speaking at the board office on East Fourth Street in October. ''I think we do a fairly good job.''
 In the case of Heathers, Ms. Militano draws a conclusion very different from Ms. Millstone's concerning her request for board support in her license application in the summer of 2005. ''She came before my committee,'' Ms. Militano said, ''and was completely heard.'' 
 ''And denied,'' interjected Susan Stetzer, the Board 3 district manager. 
 ''And denied,'' Ms. Militano confirmed. 
 One issue that the board considered was a State Liquor Authority rule that if a Manhattan bar is within 500 feet of three other such premises, it can be licensed only if it confers a public benefit. 
 ''Her rationale for being a public benefit to the community,'' Ms. Militano said, ''was that she had a gluten intolerance and was going to open a business, albeit a bar, that was 20 or 30 percent, a small percentage, gluten-free.'' 
 Board 3 was not persuaded. The State Liquor Authority nevertheless ruled in Ms. Millstone's favor -- but she will have to appear before Ms. Militano's committee again this September when her liquor license comes up for renewal. Although the community boards are only advisory, they are not toothless. An active board -- and Board 3 is an active board -- can successfully lobby the agency against particular establishments. 
 Ms. Stetzer does not think her board's effort to deny Heathers its license was off the mark. ''There's a difference between a bar on Second Avenue and a bar on a small, narrow side street,'' she said. ''Those side streets were always intended to be residential, but for various reasons they ended up with storefronts, and most of that is now grandfathered. It was an original misuse of the space.'' 
 Asked about the stated artistic intentions of Heathers, Ms. Militano smiled. ''You'll have to forgive my skepticism,'' she said, ''but a third of the people who come before me say they're trying to create something cultural, in addition to being open until 4 a.m., serving all sorts of alcohol, you know.''
 Ms. Stetzer added: ''Loud music is loud music, and I think the main issue at Heathers is loud music. Maybe Heathers patrons don't go out on the street and start screaming and yelling, but the loud music does not allow people in that building to sleep.'' 
 Ms. Militano said she is not ''anti-bar,'' however, and Ms. Stetzer said, ''We wouldn't like it if there were no bars around.''

'We Are More or Less Ignored'
 Frank Hartin, a retired publisher of academic books, is a slender man with an endearing smile. He has been living directly above what is today Heathers for 35 years, 16 of those with his partner, Wai-Shing Lee. 
 The two men say noise from the bar has been an unprecedented, frequent irritant. He and his partner voiced their displeasure regularly both to Ms. Millstone and to the employee working the door outside. ''I get so upset I yell at them sometimes,'' Mr. Lee said. 
 But the two men's frequent trips downstairs have since stopped, on the advice of the Cabaret Unit, and their only recourse is calling 311. In response, police officers and agents from the Department of Environmental Protection regularly go to the men's apartment to take stock of the noise. 
 The city agency follows a complex formula to determine excessive noise, one that takes into account ambient noise levels, but Mr. Hartin has not been impressed by its workings. Referring to the fact that no violations have been issued to Heathers from the couple's complaints, he said, ''So the floor shaking and being unable to think isn't sufficient grounds for a violation from their perspective.'' 
 The log that Mr. Hartin maintains of his quest for quiet from Heathers is, at points, a touching mix of hopeful insights and heartfelt frustrations. In one entry, for instance, Mr. Hartin related part of a phone conversation with a member of the Cabaret Unit: ''Asked if we spent $1,100 for a decibel meter, and we got readings in excess of code, if he would send someone over to take official readings. He suggested a new floor and a rug would be a better use of the money.''
 Mr. Hartin and Mr. Lee bought the sound meter anyway, which they now use to determine when to make a complaint call. 
 One Monday evening in early fall, Mr. Hartin conducted a demonstration in the apartment. ''It's not a very loud night, but it will give you some idea of a typically bad situation,'' he said. 
 The floor of his apartment is baseboard, and the exposed lengths of plywood are painted blue. Ms. Millstone has argued that it is unfair to make her put more money into soundproofing until Mr. Hartin or his landlord makes some effort to put in a new floor. 
 ''Where would we go?'' Mr. Lee asked in response to the suggestion. 
 On one wall of the apartment, there is a Sharper Image weather station indicating moon cycles, temperature, humidity and atmospheric pressure. But the reading that most interests the two men is the one on their sound meter. 
 The meter was teetering around 50 decibels, with the music from Heathers sounding more like a murmur than anything else. That makes sense, for casual conversation generally measures upward of 60 decibels. And yet the drone was constant. While Mr. Hartin was almost apologetic about the absence of deafening noise, Mr. Lee seemed jittery.
 Despite all their efforts, the two men feel frustrated. ''We are more or less ignored,'' Mr. Hartin said. They sound much like Ms. Millstone. 
 Detective Jaime Hernandez, who is in charge of community affairs for the Ninth Precinct, said that noise-related issues are particularly problematic and that new laws and regulations are no cure-all. Communication, he maintained, is the key thing.
 ''Will you be able to correct the situation 100 percent?'' he asked. ''No. But if you have communication, you can understand the frustration.''

Neighbors at Odds
 At 1 a.m. on a Saturday in October, Amber Ibarreche, a Heathers employee, was stationed outside the door, checking IDs and asking patrons to keep their voices down. 
 David Sagadi, 30, was on his way home from a party in Brooklyn. He has lived on the block for 10 years and doesn't think Heathers should be here. ''Once upon a time it was very residential here,'' he said. ''It's a quiet street except for this doorway.'' 
 Dwayne Gross, a 25-year resident of 13th Street who was walking his dog, said he had had serious concerns about the bar at first, especially as he lives only two doors away. But he said Ms. Millstone had done her part to address the concerns of the community. 
 ''Heather is a standup person,'' he said. ''She's met us more than halfway; in fact, she's done more than any bar owner I've ever seen. Most of them won't give you the time of day.'' 
 Like Ms. Millstone and Mr. Hartin, the inhabitants of 13th Street seem divided over Heathers. 
 Nevertheless, the participants in this long-running problem forge on. 
 In that vein, Ms. Millstone, Mr. Hartin and Mr. Lee attended a meeting of the Ninth Precinct Community Council on Dec. 19 -- more than a year after Ms. Millstone opened her doors. Mr. Hartin spoke of new windows and a new interior wall that the landlord has installed, but he is very unsure if they will improve matters. For her part, Ms. Millstone spoke of a recent visit to the bar and the apartment by an audio engineer, and promised to send a copy of the report to the police.
 On the advice of the Cabaret Unit, Ms. Millstone has installed ropes to contain her patrons when they go outside to smoke. Characteristically, she has used the opportunity to create some pointed artisanship. 
 ''I hate the pretension of ropes,'' she said, ''so I figured if I was going to do something it had to be relevant to the bar.'' 
 Ms. Millstone asked Ms. Ibarreche, who is also a textile artist, to do the job. The ropes she fashioned are made of antique nautical twine, and wrapped in an array of delicate, multitextured fabrics. 
 ''I keep trying,'' Ms. Millstone said. ''I poured everything I had into this place.''

HEADLINE: On Renewing New Haven 

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN 

 BODY:
THE downtown residential market here has long catered to a reliable legion of college students who swarm the city every fall. Yale University alone is the source of several thousand graduate students who live in and around downtown, typically as renters.
 Downtown living is also gaining new allure among young professionals and suburban refugees, however, as the city's ongoing efforts to revitalize the blocks around the historic town green yield airy lofts and stylish restaurants serving exotic cuisine. In one of the surest signs of the central business district's resurgence, more developers are proposing to build ownership housing, a relatively scarce commodity that could help expand and stabilize the downtown population. 
Over the past few years, officials have tried to lure the upwardly mobile into the city by encouraging the conversion of underused retail and office buildings into residential units, and nurturing an emerging funky arts district. Some $180 million in state bond financing is being used to relocate a commuter college and the Long Wharf Theater downtown.
 And in perhaps the most dramatic demonstration of the business district's makeover, the Veterans Memorial Coliseum, a 35-year-old downtown institution, is being imploded this weekend, to be replaced eventually by a mixed-use development. 
 Yale-New Haven Hospital is augmenting the city's efforts with construction of a 500,000-square-foot cancer hospital at its campus at the edge of downtown along Route 34. Behind that structure will be a 200,000-square-foot medical office and laboratory facility to be developed by the Fusco Corporation, city officials said. 
 All of this activity has private developers ''chomping at the bit,'' said Kelly Murphy, the city's economic development administrator. Nine developers submitted proposals for a 1.5-acre city-owned lot at a vacant corner of State and Chapel Streets. While the pending proposals varied widely -- from a hotel-centered project that emulates the historic sections of downtown to a New Urbanism-inspired neighborhood -- all involved a significant housing component. 
 One of the most important residential projects approved to date is College Square, a 272-unit luxury condominium high-rise to be built at the corner of College and George Streets. The developer, Robert Landino, says market studies indicate that a wave of people nearing retirement will roll into the city from the surrounding suburbs. 
 ''New Haven's time has come as the baby boomers get older,'' said Mr. Landino, who grew up in New Haven and has worked on numerous projects here as the former president of the Meriden-based BL Companies, an architecture and engineering firm. These ''move down'' buyers will be looking for the kind of energetic ''self-contained environment'' that a walkable city like New Haven can provide, he said. 
 Scheduled to begin construction next fall for completion in the summer of 2009, the $115 million College Square will have about 50,000 square feet of street-level retailing, secured on-site parking and a 24-hour concierge. Condominiums will be priced in the mid-$500,000 to low-$600,000 range on average, Mr. Landino said; penthouse units will be closer to $1 million. 
 College Square holds particular significance for city economic development officials because it is the largest development to date of new apartments for sale. Though some 1,000 units have been added to the downtown over the past five years, the vast majority were rentals, Ms. Murphy said. 
 Another local developer, David Nyberg, has proposed about 100 condominiums in the Ninth Square district at the corner of downtown, according to Tony Bialecki, the city's deputy directory of economic development. 
 That project calls for converting two older buildings, as well as constructing a building on what is now a vacant lot. Mr. Nyberg, whose company is College Street Management L.L.C., has developed several other residential projects downtown, including the conversion of 900 Chapel Street, a former mall and office tower that now houses a mix of stores, apartments and offices.
 The Long Wharf Theater is working on plans to move from its current location on Sargent Drive along New Haven Harbor to the former Coliseum site, along Route 34. City economic development officials are trying to link the theater with a major developer who will integrate the new facility into a large development blending retailing, office space and housing on the 6.5-acre site. 
 These large-scale developments were preceded by smaller-scale conversions throughout the downtown area. The market's ability to absorb the new residences has been aided by the slow and steady pace of development, and the wide range of choices, Ms. Murphy said. 
 On Church Street, cater-corner to the New Haven Green, the Christie Wareck Company converted two early 1900s retail buildings into 13 SoHo-style lofts priced at $525,000 to $849,000. The primary lookers so far have been young physicians and professionals who work in the biotech industry, said Timothy Serpe, a listing agent for the properties at the H. Pearce Real Estate Company. 
 A block away on Temple Street, the Manhattan-based Bow Tie Partners converted the long-vacant United Illuminating building, a brick neo-Classical-style structure topped by a clock tower, into 44 luxury rental apartments; a seven-screen art cinema, the Criterion, is on the ground floor. New Haven represented a prime opportunity for this ''adaptive reuse'' project because of the ''paucity of high-end residential'' properties downtown and a highly educated population, said Charley Moss, a partner in the company. 
 All but one of the units are rented. Rents start at $1,600 for a one-bedroom, $2,200 for a two-bedroom, and $3,000 for a three-bedroom.
 The area still lacks the range of retailing needed to fully support walkable living -- there is no supermarket, for instance.
 But with more than 3,700 units downtown now, and another 350 to 500 likely to be created in the next two years, the population density is close to reaching the critical mass needed to support more major retailers, Ms. Murphy said. 
 ''We're at the cusp where they're ready to take our calls,'' she said.

HEADLINE: The Town That Would Be Hot

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

DATELINE: KEANSBURG 

 BODY:
IT'S January, and not a bit too soon to think about property on the Jersey Shore. For those seeking beachfront bargains, after all, opportunity can be fleeting. 
 In Long Branch two years ago, prices seemed to rise almost instantly amid a wave of redevelopment. Asbury Park is still a work in progress, but housing prices haven't waited for the makeover of a derelict boardwalk neighborhood to be completed. Typical condominiums in the redevelopment area there are already priced well over $500,000; the choicest units go for $1 million and up.
Even with an overall housing market gone soft, prices in waterfront communities where prices have risen sharply are unlikely to sink back down, according to real estate agents who specialize in such properties. 
 The trick, of course, is to find the spot where prices will rise next. Now comes a bid from the little borough of Keansburg to be seen as that about-to-be-discovered place.
 Keansburg, home to 11,000 year-round residents, a small amusement park and a boardwalk beach on Raritan Bay, has tumbled into a fairly sorry state, even its partisans acknowledge.
 It was established as a shoreline getaway even before the Garden State Parkway was built in 1957, and some Jerseyans, and even New Yorkers, still visit Keansburg and nearby Sandy Hook out of longstanding tradition.
 But with its beachfront area now populated mainly by fish-fry places, arcades, billiard parlors and a group of run-down apartment buildings, the median house value in Keansburg was put below $100,000 in the most recent census. The median household income was $36,383 in 2000 -- and probably has not risen substantially since then, according to local officials.
 A large majority of the housing stock -- primarily small wood-frame homes -- is more than 50 years old.
 Several years ago, borough officials took stock and decided all that had to change, according to Terence Wall, who was appointed borough manager in 2005. 
 ''The borough has embarked on a campaign to bulldoze blight,'' said Mr. Wall, who is beginning a speaking tour at area Chambers of Commerce to publicize Keansburg's intention to metamorphose and attract new businesses.
 ''We are a borough pulling itself up by its bootstraps,'' Mr. Wall added, with gusto. ''If Horatio Alger was the name of a town, it would be Keansburg.''
 Mr. Wall suggested that Keansburg offers ''a place near New York City, with bus, train and ferry service nearby, a major revitalization program under way, and the ability to buy beside the water for those who may have been priced out elsewhere.'' 
 He said he had already started to get calls from large developers expressing interest in the idea of a Long Branch/Asbury Park-style total makeover. But he also said borough officials were determined not to use the eminent domain power to condemn and clear a large swath of land along the shore for redevelopment.
 ''We are committed to the scalpel approach,'' Mr. Wall explained, ''in which we carve out specific parcels for redevelopment, but pursue overall revitalization by including the existing property owners, and providing them the opportunity to propose their own ideas for rehab and upgrade.''
 This is true for both commercial and residential property, according to the manager. So far, several very small condominium buildings have been built along the beachfront road; a block of storefront space is being rehabbed; and groundbreaking is planned within the next several weeks for a 48-unit condo project.
 A sales trailer is already set up on the beach for the project, to be called Harbor Lights on the Bayshore, a three-building complex to be built by the Kalian Companies of Red Bank. The project is designed to introduce a new elegance to Keansburg, according to Alton Evans, Kalian's vice president for sales and marketing, with sophisticated architecture and an array of upscale amenities, including an outdoor pool with cabana.
 Prices for 1,773-square-foot two-bedroom units at Harbor Lights will start in the low to mid-$400,000s. Twelve penthouses, occupying the fourth floors of the buildings, and offering 1,940 square feet with an upper loft and roof terrace, are priced in the high $500,000s.
 All units above the first floor will have views of Raritan Bay across to Staten Island and the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, Mr. Evans noted. 
 Promotional material for the project notes the attractions of nearby shore towns like Red Bank and Holmdel: chic clubs, shopping, seafood and specialty restaurants, live music at Count Basie Theater in Red Bank, well-known entertainers at the PNC Arts Center in Holmdel. It also proclaims nearby ferry service to Manhattan, which is only 20 miles away; quick access to the Garden State Parkway; and train, light rail and bus service.
 The borough is also formulating plans for a new marina, which would give residents the added amenity of pleasure boating.
 Meanwhile, it is continuing with a beefed-up housing code enforcement program to rid the borough of ''deadbeat and absentee'' landlords, he said.
 It has also been awarded state financing for a pilot program aimed at desalination. Saltwater intrusion into freshwater systems is a common problem in shoreline towns, he said, and only Keansburg and Cape May are currently part of a program aimed at addressing it.
 ''Whatever avenue to revitalization makes sense,'' the manager said, ''we will pursue.''

HEADLINE: Residential Conversions Revitalize River Town

BYLINE: By NANCY BETH JACKSON

DATELINE: ALTON, Ill. 

 BODY:
AFTER a half century, Tony and Edie Vetimiglia are moving back downtown, but this time they will be living in a loft with river views and custom-made brick Roman arches instead of in an apartment above the family restaurant.
 In 1954, the Vetimiglias sold their suburban home to buy a bar in this historic river town, which was said to have the best steamboat landing on the east bank of the Mississippi. They opened a restaurant called Tony's and moved upstairs with their two young sons.
Downtown Alton then bustled with commercial life, including three five-and-dimes, two jewelers, a haberdashery, a fabric shop, three locally owned department stores and two women's dress shops that could compete with the offerings in downtown St. Louis, 25 miles away. On Friday nights, when the stores stayed open late, parking spots along Third Street filled up as families sat in their cars watching the crowds stroll by.
 ''There wasn't anything you couldn't buy in downtown Alton,'' said Mrs. Vetimiglia, 81, who lived there for three years. 
 Urban blight long ago descended on Alton, as shops and factories closed. But the downtown experienced new activity in the 1970s, when dozens of antique shops opened in historic buildings, and again in the 1990s, when a casino was tied up to the riverbank, spurring more bars and restaurants. Most visitors today are day-trippers or come for the nightlife and gambling. The upstairs apartment at Tony's has been converted to a banquet room, and the restaurant has expanded into the old Young's Department Store.
 Now people like the Vetimiglias are betting residential conversions will pump new life into old buildings in Alton, which is home to about 30,000 people. This spring they will move into Mississippi Landing, a 10-loft complex in the 1921 Mississippi Lime building, formerly the Illinois Terminal Railroad Building; one of their sons is buying a loft next door.
 Darius Bryjka, a project designer with the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, calls them pioneers. ''They are coming back to reclaim what they remember as the vibrancy of downtown.'' Similar developments are happening in other Illinois towns, encouraged by state and local initiatives that provide financial incentives.
 ''You get people living there and people will come back,'' said Duane Randall, 60, one of three partners in the Mississippi Landing project. The lofts are priced from $175,000 to $350,000 and have 12-foot-plus ceilings, exposed brick and steel beams along with river views.
 Mr. Randall and his wife, Nancy, whose families have been in Alton for over 100 years, already live downtown, having traded their home upriver at the local country club for a loft penthouse at the 1846 Laura Building, which housed a pool hall most of the last century. 
 Penelope Schmidt, 49, a second partner, who sold her Manhattan art gallery after Sept. 11, 2001, to return to the area where she grew up, will live at Mississippi Landing. The third partner, Daniel Warren, helped jump-start loft development in 2001 when he began renovating the Laura Building, which now has four loft-style condominiums as well as a children's shop run by his wife and her sister.
 The partnership is already negotiating for other downtown properties, but the city has enough lofts to warrant last fall's sold-out loft tour, sponsored by the Alton Marketplace Association, a not-for-profit organization formed to revitalize the river city. ''We hoped that by having such an event, we can stir up interest in the economic development of our downtown,'' said Nancy Elson of the Loft Tour Committee.
 An easy commute to St. Louis across a dramatic modern bridge, Alton has long been considered an ideal satellite city, more convenient than some of the western St. Louis suburbs, but much of the residential activity is being fueled by local residents, who like the idea of walking instead of driving everywhere. Mississippi Landing has had inquiries from as far away as Florida, though mostly from people wanting to come home again.
 Rob Hellrung, 63, who commuted 45 minutes for 10-hour shifts at the St. Louis Ford plant for 30 years, considered buying a loft in St. Louis when he retired, but he considered it to be too gritty. Instead, he moved from his cedar-sided home with a workshop in an Alton suburb to a Laura Building loft where he can watch the barges go by from his balcony or his bed.
 ''I had always looked for this kind of structure, a loft structure,'' he said. ''I liked what I saw in the movies and in the magazines.''
 Besides, he can walk everywhere -- to the library, restaurants, bars -- cutting his fuel consumption by two-thirds.
 Judy Hoffman, 65, an Alton historian, is selling her home to move into Mississippi Landing because she's tired of yard work and steps. She's looking for an adventure downtown. ''This is as urban as you're going to get in this area,'' she said.
 It's not only the condo market moving into downtown. Julie Harper, a local lawyer, and her husband, Jason, a stockbroker, rescued a mid-19th-century Georgian home, renovating it into their offices and two rental apartments four years ago. Now they're tackling the decrepit Franklin House, where Abraham Lincoln is said to have stayed when he debated Stephen A. Douglas in the 1858 Senate race. Life-sized bronze statues mark the debate spot in a park opposite the Argosy Casino.
 ''The pigeons deterred other buyers,'' Mrs. Harper said, even as she shooed away birds on third-floor rafters. The Harpers plan to convert the structure into Lincoln Lofts, about a dozen rental units on the top three floors with commercial space at street level. ''There's nothing like this in Alton; it's a niche that needs filling,'' she said.
 Mike Kelly, 44, a former Marine pilot, lives on the top floor of an 1866 cracker factory with three of the original five oven vaults still evident in the basement. At least three antique dealers have lived on the property, including Sam Thames, who was credited with creating the Alton Antique District. Mr. Kelly has moved into Mr. Thames's old space, which includes a raised stage where either a church or a fraternal society held services. He plans to develop the building commercially.
 Most real estate incentives have been for commercial development, but the city says it supports downtown residential development as well. Philip S. Roggio, director of the Department of Development and Housing, says the city's future lies in the ''marrying of public and private sectors.'' One local initiative seeks to transform downtown Alton into an artist colony, similar to a program that has revitalized Paducah, Ky., in the last five years.
 ''That's my next big project,'' said Ms. Schmidt, who was part of a delegation that visited Paducah recently.
 Ms. Schmidt, the daughter of James K. Schmidt, a local painter who was once chairman of the studio art department at nearby Principia College, said she had no plans to recreate her New York City gallery on the Mississippi. ''I'm too happy with my second chance at creativity,'' she said.

HEADLINE: More Doors for the Great Outdoors

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER JENSEN

DATELINE: Dalton, N.H. 

 BODY:
SOME thoughtful people say there is wisdom in introspection, but I think a good nap is more rewarding. Still, self-examination is wise when considering whether to buy the 2007 Jeep Wrangler.
 The Wrangler has always been the few-frills Jeep, a role it literally wallowed in, given its serious off-road abilities. So when engineering the first all-new Wrangler in a decade, Jim Issner, the chief engineer, said the idea was to maintain that off-pavement prowess while adding room and comfort.
The company has succeeded, up to a point, producing a Wrangler with more room inside. But this is still a vehicle that is at its best off road, and it remains a rough customer in everyday use. So buyers need to reflect on how they're going to use the Jeep -- as a serious tool, or a fashion accessory? -- before they commit. 
 The conventional two-door has been joined by the first four-door Wrangler, called the Unlimited (which should not be confused with the 2006 Unlimited, a stretched two-door). Base prices begin at $18,765 for a Wrangler X with four-wheel drive and run to $28,895 for the Unlimited Rubicon. I tested both versions. 
 The Rubicon label signals that this is the most capable Wrangler off pavement; the Rubicon has several standard features intended to improve off-road performance. One is a button to disconnect the front stabilizer bar. During normal driving, the stabilizer bar controls body lean on corners, but off pavement the bar can hamper movement over wildly uneven surfaces.
 Still, the Unlimited comes up short on a few standard features. Power windows and power door locks, for example, are part of an $800 package. 
 One interesting option on my Rubicon test vehicle was the $1,585 Freedom Top, which allowed either a snug-and-dry hardtop or open-air motoring if any or all of three roof panels were removed. When all the options were added up -- including $825 for an automatic transmission -- my Unlimited Rubicon test vehicle was $33,505. The Wrangler X two-door was a relative bargain at $22,005, including options like a $1,240 comfort package (the main features of which were air-conditioning and a height-adjustable driver's seat) and an automatic transmission ($825).
 The Wrangler X has a standard soft top that can also be folded back, which seemed like a good idea on a lovely, 51-degree fall day in northern New Hampshire. Unfortunately, the instructions on how to lower the ''easy folding soft top'' were long enough to be a novella. I gave up and went inside to take a nap.
 The big advantage of the Unlimited is its extra interior room; finally, here is a Wrangler that can serve as a practical everyday vehicle. At 173.4 inches, the Unlimited is 20.6 inches longer than the two-door X. 
 While the front legroom is the same in each model, the Unlimited has 37.2 inches in the rear, a meaningful advantage of 1.6 inches that allows a 6-foot adult to sit there.
 Just getting to the back seat in the two-door was a gymnastic challenge, despite a humorously named, totally inadequate ''easy access'' feature that moves the front seat forward. 
 If six-foot adults reach the back seat, they will find barely enough room, making it best suited for small children. For adults, the problem is escaping. It took me two tries.
 The four door's cargo capacity is greater. Jeep says there is 46.4 cubic feet of space with the back seat upright, compared with about 17 cubic feet on the two-door.
 The interior of either model has a basic-functional look with lots of plastic. The X even has plastic, zip-down windows, which are not only inconvenient, but they make ferocious noise at highway speeds.
 And despite the Wrangler's theme of unadorned practicality, there is a puzzling lack of compartments to store the everyday junk of motoring.
 All Wranglers now have electronic stability control as standard equipment. If it senses that the Jeep is sliding sideways, it tries to correct the skid by selectively applying individual brakes and cutting the power.
 I took the Wranglers off road at the Team O'Neil Rally School here in the North Woods outside Littleton. With little effort the Unlimited Rubicon eased down a gooey bank and up a muddy rise, and it crossed a large, wet and incredibly slippery log. Then it worked through more muck to terra firma several hundred feet away.
 The Wrangler X comes with mud-and-snow tires not nearly as aggressive as the knobby mud-terrain tires on the Rubicon. Looking at the muddy trail I had just navigated in the Rubicon, I wimped out. Maybe the X could have made it, but with those tires it was begging for the kind of trouble that involves a tow rope, a lot of work and some bad words.
 Later, the X easily followed a series of steep, narrow trails through the woods. Its off-pavement performance would be improved considerably with more aggressive tires.
 The switch from two-wheel to four-wheel drive can be made while moving, but the part-time four-wheel-drive system is for use only on a slippery surface. Using it on dry pavement is likely to damage the system. 
 All Wranglers move along nicely with a 3.8-liter V-6 rated at 202 horsepower and 237 pound-feet of torque. That is up from 190 horsepower in the ancient 4-liter in-line 6 that the Wrangler previously used.
 The standard transmission is a six-speed manual, but the test Wranglers had the optional automatic. 
 The gear ratios were chosen thoughtfully, and the relatively large V-6 has enough torque for good response on or off the road. The government estimates fuel economy with the automatic at 16 m.p.g. in town and 19 on the highway.
 The Wrangler continues its classic body-on-frame truck construction, but Jeep says the structure is much stronger, helping to improve the ride and handling on pavement.
 Nevertheless, on anything but a smooth surface the two-door's ride is choppy and rough. The Unlimited rides more comfortably because of its much longer wheelbase, although its occupants still take some licks. 
 Unlike most modern passenger cars, the Wrangler does not have an independent suspension. Instead, Jeep kept solid axles in the front and rear, a robust design favored by off-roaders. But those solid axles mean that when one side hits a bump, the unpleasantness is shared all round. 
 The on-pavement handling is competent -- in other words, a lot better than it used to be -- and the Wranglers are reasonably friendly to drive with a few sacrifices. But it is clear that pounding the pavement is not their primary purpose.
 Understanding that primary purpose is the key to happiness. Unlike many vehicles that handle a wide variety of tasks with overall competence, the Wrangler remains a specialist aimed at backwoods trails. Its on-pavement performance, while improved, could easily become aggravating without a consolation prize -- like finding yourself in places where no cars have gone before.

INSIDE TRACK: Dirty fun at a price.

HEADLINE: Look Up! It's No Meteor, It's an Arms Race

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
THE nation's star warriors, frustrated that their plans to arm the heavens went nowhere for two decades despite more than $100 billion in blue-sky research, felt a shiver of hope last week with news that China had conducted its first successful test of an antisatellite weapon.
 Having long warned of the Chinese threat, they now said their fears were vindicated and expressed optimism for their own projects, which range from new kinds of defensive satellites to flotillas of space weapons and orbital battle stations able to shatter all kinds of enemy arms. 
China, a group of 26 ''Star Wars'' supporters warned in a recent report, has ''begun to erode American space dominance'' and will accelerate that slide with ''both lasers and missiles capable of destroying satellites.''
 H. Baker Spring of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group in Washington, said in an interview that the cost to the United States of new arms and defensive measures would most likely run to ''billions or tens of billions of dollars a year, pretty much year in and year out,'' and added, ''I don't think that's excessive.''
 But the prospect of a new arms race in space is also energizing an opposition, including arms control supporters and fiscal conservatives alarmed at the rising costs of the Iraq war. Treaties could short-circuit the costly game of measure-countermeasure on the high frontier before it expands any further, they say. Currently, no international treaty or domestic law forbids such developments.
 An unfettered arms race could hurt the United States more than any other nation, arms control advocates argue. The United States owns or operates 443 of the 845 active satellites that now orbit the planet, or 53 percent. By contrast, China owns just 4 percent.
 ''We not only have the most satellites but they are more integrated into our economy and our way of making war than any other country,'' said Laura Grego, a staff scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a private group in Cambridge, Mass., that takes liberal positions on arms issues and environmental issues. ''We have the most to lose in an unrestrained arms race.'' 
 But that logic has not persuaded the Star Wars advocates, who say the United States needs to protect its huge investment in space satellites by being ahead of anyone else in shooting such devices out of the sky.
 Diplomats from around the globe have gathered in Geneva for many years to hammer out a treaty on the ''Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space,'' which would ban space weapons. Arms control supporters say China and Russia have backed the process, while the United States has dragged its feet.
 Last year, John Mohanco, a State Department official, told the diplomats in Geneva that as long as attacks on satellites remained a threat, ''our government will continue to consider the possible role that space-related weapons may play in protecting our assets.''
 A Heritage Foundation analysis of such diplomacy says China is charging ahead to build space arms while ''seeking to block the United States from developing its own anti-satellite weapons and space-based ballistic missile defense systems.''
 China's strategy, the analysis says, is clear: ''Work on public opinion in the United States to make moral arguments against weapons in space, develop international coalitions to limit the way that the United States can use space, and develop China's own weapons systems and tactics to destroy American satellites and space-based weapons.''
 But Theresa Hitchens, a critic of the administration's space arms research who is director of the Center for Defense Information, a private group in Washington that tracks military programs, said that China's antisatellite test might be ''a shot across the bow'' meant to prod the Bush administration into serious negotiations. In the test, a Chinese missile pulverized an aging Chinese weather satellite more than 500 miles above Earth on Jan. 11.
 Ms. Hitchens warned that an arms race in space could easily spin out of control, noting that India has been ''rattling its sword'' and some experts in that country are openly calling for antisatellite arms. A global competition that produced armadas of space weapons, she added, could raise the risk of accidental nuclear war if, for instance, a whirling piece of space junk knocked out a spy satellite.
 ''How do you know it's not a precursor to a nuclear attack?'' she asked. ''Do you have an itchy trigger finger? If you've got a lot of satellites out there, you probably do.''
 The Bush administration has conducted secret research that critics say could produce a powerful ground-based laser meant to shatter enemy satellites. The project, parts of which were made public through Air Force budget documents submitted to Congress last year, appears to be part of a wide-ranging administration effort to develop space weapons, both defensive and offensive.
 John E. Pike, who is the director of GlobalSecurity.org, a group in Washington that conducts research on military and space topics, said that treaties and defensive measures were the smart, cheap way to counter antisatellite threats, and that the star warriors in the wake of the Chinese tests were playing a false card.
 ''They're trying to piggyback on a totally unrelated topic,'' he said. ''This says nothing about space-based weapons, star wars or any of that.''
 But a report, ''Missile Defense, the Space Relationship and the 21st Century,'' researched by a group of organizations that focus on national security issues and published late last year by the Institute for Foreign Policy Analysis, called the military development of the high frontier vital to the nation's protection from a wide variety of threats -- including Chinese arms.
 ''Without the means to dissuade, deter and defeat the growing number of strategic adversaries now arrayed against it,'' the group warned, ''the United States will be unable to maintain its status of global leadership.''

HEADLINE: The Orange Meets Economics 101

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
At one bodega in Brooklyn on Friday, a big, thick-skinned navel orange cost 99 cents. In other parts of the country, that price might seem steep. But within a couple of weeks, it could be a bargain. The culprit: a citrus-killing freeze that hit California, which supplies 95 percent of the nation's navel oranges in the winter. 
 How high can navel orange prices go? It's a simple matter of supply and demand.
The navel orange is one of the few remaining staples in the produce bins that remains untouched by globalization -- at least in the winter. 
 In the summer, when the American crop isn't in season, the nation eats navels from Australia and South America. But it's not yet navel season in the Southern Hemisphere. And don't expect the American South to come to the rescue. The navel crops in Louisiana and Texas are too small, and most of the oranges grown in Florida are turned into juice. 
 So that leaves only the portion of the California crop that survived temperatures in the 20s and lower last week. 
 About 30 percent of the winter fruit was picked before the freeze, enough to keep the United States eating navels for almost two weeks. Once the threat of frost is over and citrus ranchers can take a good look at the trees, they might find enough fruit to keep shipping at least a small supply out of state through February. But with an estimated $610 million in navel oranges lost to ice, the price will jump. 
 Already, prices have almost doubled, said Bill Taubenfeld of B. T. Produce, one of the largest wholesalers in the Northeast. A case of small navels that he sold for $13 earlier in the month is now $24. He and other produce wholesalers say prices might triple on oranges that have already been picked. 
 All of which might make a $3 navel orange a very real possibility, at least in Brooklyn. KIM SEVERSON

HEADLINE: Connecticut's Diaspora

 BODY:
The young are leaving Connecticut in droves. According to the Connecticut Economic Resource Center, between 1990 and 2000, we lost a larger percentage of 18- to 34-year-olds than any other state, 23 percent, or more than 200,000 people. 
 One big reason is that it is becoming difficult for any person, particularly a young person, to buy a home here without having a very high salary. Rents, too, are exorbitant. The median price of a single-family home in Fairfield County was more than a half-million dollars in 2005, and monthly rents for two-bedroom apartments in the Stamford-Norwalk area on average were around $1,500.
 The lack of affordable housing has created a huge problem for businesses who are finding fewer bright applicants. The high price of homes not only turns people away but also forces those who have jobs to live further and further from their workplace, contributing to highway gridlock and adding to Connecticut's considerable traffic woes. 
 Transportation and housing are linked. How the state handles these two issues will determine the health of the economy. The state has made a good start with transportation, earmarking billions of dollars for more trains and revamped highways. But affordable housing is a more difficult issue. 
 The state has had an affordable housing law for nearly 20 years that allows developers, under certain conditions, to bypass zoning laws to build housing without the blessing of town hall, as long as a percentage of units are low cost. But the law has largely been a failure because it infuriates local governments, enables development to take place on unsuitable sites and creates litigation. As it stands, in only 30 towns and cities does affordable housing make up 10 percent or more of existing homes. In most of the other 139 towns, affordable housing makes up 5 percent or less of housing units. 
 The nonprofit Partnership for Strong Communities, a housing advocacy group, suggests scrapping the law. It also suggests that the state help communities pay the cost of affordable housing with subsidies for infrastructure, giving communities some say in where the housing is built.
 Proponents of a new law suggest that the state should pick up the costs of educating any additional schoolchildren as an incentive to communities that resist affordable housing because they feel it would overburden their school systems. But asking the state to entice already-wealthy towns to build housing they should have welcomed years ago seems contradictory at a time when the state can't seem to find the money to help genuinely needy communities struggling with high special education costs.
 That said, the state cannot afford to ignore the astronomical cost of housing here and pretend that the problem will fix itself. The state needs an improved housing law, without which it faces continued economic stagnation, traffic gridlock and the loss of Connecticut's young.

HEADLINE: Commuter Group Says Improvements Are on the Way 

BYLINE: By JEFF HOLTZ

 BODY:
Crowded, aging and dirty passenger cars, as well as disrepair and a parking shortage at some stations, were among the concerns cited in a report on the Metro-North and Shore Line East lines released last week by the Connecticut Rail Commuter Council, a riders' advocacy group.
 James Cameron, the council's chairman, said some of the problems would not be solved until 2009, when the first of a batch of new rail cars purchased by the state are scheduled to be put into service. 
 ''All we can do is ask the commuters to be patient and know that help is coming down the track,'' he said. ''It just hasn't pulled into the station yet.''
 Judd Everhart, a spokesman for the State Department of Transportation, which runs Metro-North with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said in a statement that some of the problems were being addressed.
 ''We know our commuters face challenges every day, and we are doing something about it,'' he said.
 In the past two years, Mr. Everhart said, Gov. M. Jodi Rell and the General Assembly committed more than $3 billion to transportation improvements throughout the state. ''The funding is in place and the work is under way,'' he said. 
 The report said the quality of service of the Shore Line East commuter railroad, which runs weekdays between New London and New Haven and is operated by Amtrak and the State Transportation Department, was good but that the service should be expanded to seven days a week.
 The report did, however, praise Metro-North for a 97 percent on-time rate last year. 
 The annual report, which is mandated by the legislation that created the commuter council in 1985, is available at trainweb.org/ct.

Arena and Jai Alai Fronton Meeting the Wrecking Ball
 During their heydays in the 1970s and '80s, they were filled to the rafters with thousands of cheering spectators. But last week, only the sound of demolition equipment and walls coming down could be heard at the New Haven Coliseum and Milford Jai Alai.
 The coliseum was scheduled for implosion on Jan. 20. The demolition of the fronton, or jai alai court, began in earnest last week and was scheduled to last until the spring.
 The coliseum, which opened in 1972 and closed in 2002, was known for its rock concerts and for being the home of the New Haven Nighthawks, an American Hockey League team that is defunct.
 The city said the Long Wharf Theater would move to the four-acre property being vacated by the coliseum. It said the site would include an expansion of the nearby Knights of Columbus headquarters, as well as retail space and housing.
 Mayor John DeStefano Jr. of New Haven said the coliseum had outlived it usefulness. ''It was once state of the art in the marketplace, and was the only venue in the marketplace, but economic models change,'' he said.
 Mayor James L. Richetelli Jr. of Milford said the fronton, which from 1977 to 2001 featured parimutuel betting on jai alai, a speedy handball-like game, had put the city ''on the map.'' In just six months in 1988, it had revenues of $100 million. 
 ''In the early years, people came from all over and filled up our restaurants and hotels,'' he said. ''It's going to be strange to not see it there anymore.''
 Mr. Richetelli said that in November, the city sold the 25-acre jai alai property to Starwood Ceruzzi, a development company, for $14 million, after having bought it from the owners for $12.6 million in 2004. He said the company planned to build a Lowe's home improvement store, a hotel and other retail space there.

HEADLINE: Blue Jays Try to Stay With the Big Boys

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
By slipping ahead of Boston in last season's final week, Toronto enjoyed its best division finish since winning successive World Series in 1992 and '93. For a dozen years the Blue Jays had finished no better than third in the American League East. Now only the Yankees finished ahead of them. Where do they go from here?
 Last year the Mets ended the Atlanta Braves' unparalleled run of 14 consecutive division championships. Can the Blue Jays terminate the Yankees' nine-year reign as A.L. East champions?
Not even the Blue Jays would be so bold to predict that, but they are intent on continuing their ascent, if not in the standings, at least in the victory column. ''I just would like to see us keep improving,'' Toronto General Manager J. P. Ricciardi said. ''Maybe 87 games gets you into the playoffs. I don't think so, but if we could up the 87, maybe we can get there.'' 
 The St. Louis Cardinals won 83 games last season, got into the playoffs as the National League Central champions and won the World Series. That sort of development is less likely in the American League. The last time an A.L. East first- or second-place team won fewer than 87 games was in 2001, when the Red Sox won 82 and didn't make the playoffs.
 The Blue Jays will be hard pressed to repeat their second-place finish, let alone topple the Yankees. As usual, they are at an economic disadvantage. Their 2007 payroll is projected to be $90 million, while the Yankees are expected to be at $197 million and the Red Sox at $152 million.
 The Boston figure doesn't include any portion of the $51 million it spent to get the negotiating rights to Daisuke Matsuzaka of Japan, whom the team then signed to a $52 million contract, making a total expenditure of $103 million to bolster the starting rotation. The Red Sox have also been trying for seven weeks to complete a $70 million contract with right fielder J. D. Drew. 
 The Yankees have, in effect, swapped Randy Johnson for Andy Pettitte in their starting rotation and have shed Gary Sheffield, but they had Sheffield for only 39 games last season, and Hideki Matsui for only 51, and still led the league in scoring.
 The Blue Jays have fortified their offense with the addition of Frank Thomas (two years, $18 million), whose comeback with Oakland last season was impressive. With 39 home runs and 114 runs batted in, Thomas had his best season in three years. He replaces Frank Catalanotto (7 homers, 56 R.B.I.).
 ''We like Catalanotto,'' Ricciardi said. ''He did a lot of good things for us. But we've upgraded in power. One through eight we're very strong. We added a guy who would have led our team in home runs last year.''
 Troy Glaus led the Blue Jays with 38 home runs last year, and Vernon Wells hit 32. Adding Thomas to those two gives the Blue Jays as potent a middle of the lineup as the league has. ''From an offensive standpoint,'' Ricciardi said, ''we think we're even with the Yankees and the Red Sox, though we're not going to match Boston's 3-4.''
 That would be Manny Ramirez and David Ortiz, but the Red Sox scored only 11 more runs than the Blue Jays last season. The Red Sox gave up five more runs than they scored while the Blue Jays scored 55 more runs than they allowed.
 With their offense expected to be potent again, the Blue Jays will need their pitchers to stay healthy and to upgrade their performances. Roy Halladay, the staff leader, had late-season problems with his forearm. Elbow problems limited A. J. Burnett to 21 starts, and Gustavo Chacin started only 17 games because of elbow and forearm ailments.
 Those three pitchers will make up the core of the rotation. Shaun Marcum, who made 14 starts last season, and John Thomson, who had a 2-7 record for Atlanta and has a history of injuries, will join them. Missing will be Ted Lilly, who defected to the Cubs for $40 million. 
 Ricciardi won't let himself roam into the realm of unrealistic expectations. ''We know what we're up against,'' he said. ''We like competing against the Yankees and the Red Sox, but if you look at the American League, it's a league where everybody beats up on everybody else. In the A.L. East, everybody beats up on the other teams and pounds each other and it makes it tough.''

Nationals Shift After Soriano
 In December 2005, the Washington Nationals acquired Alfonso Soriano from Texas. In December 2006, the Nationals traded Jose Vidro to Seattle. The first trade gave the Nationals too many second basemen. The second trade left them without a second baseman.
 The Nationals obtained Soriano without knowing if he would or could play the outfield. He balked at going to left field, then consented to the move, had a terrifically diverse offensive season (46 home runs, 41 stolen bases) and has now moved on to the Cubs with a $136 million contract, one of the richest in baseball history.
 Vidro, whose presence at second prompted Soriano's move to left, was traded to the Mariners to shed the $16 million left in his contract.
 With a hole at second, the Nationals have shifted shortstop Felipe Lopez there even though he has played only 12 of his 572 major league games at the position. The designated left fielder is Kory Casto, who in his four-year minor league career has moved from the outfield to third base and back to the outfield.

Pierre's Negative Numbers
 Juan Pierre had an enigmatic year in his single-season tenure with the Cubs. He stroked 200 hits for the third time in four seasons and led the National League in hits, but he led the major leagues by making 528 outs, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. He made 20 of those outs when he was caught stealing a major-league-high 20 times.
 Jimmy Rollins of Philadelphia was second in outs made with 512.
 Pierre played all 162 games, and his 699 times at bat were the most in the majors. A center fielder who has moved on to the Dodgers, Pierre does not walk often; his 32 walks tied for 198th among 975 batters. So despite his .292 batting average, he had a .330 on-base percentage, which was 351st in the majors. 
 His .388 slugging percentage was 397th, but he had the lowest strikeout ratio: once every 19.7 times at bat. The Dodgers did not dwell on the negative numbers. They liked the positives and gave him $44 million.

Kicking About the Evil Empire
 A report here last week about Devern Hansack, a Nicaraguan pitcher for the Red Sox, prompted an e-mail message from Sergio Maltez of Managua in which he recalled the head-to-head competition the Red Sox and the Yankees waged for Jose Contreras four years ago. Contreras had defected from Cuba and had established residence in Nicaragua so he could be a free agent.
 The Yankees won the bidding, prompting severe vocal reaction from Larry Lucchino, the Red Sox' chief executive, and severe physical reaction from Theo Epstein, the Red Sox' general manager. Lucchino called the Yankees the evil empire. Epstein chose a different response.
 ''It was true,'' Maltez wrote, ''that Theo Epstein broke the door of the hotel with a kick when the Yankees signed Contreras and not the Red Sox.''

Union Weighs Appeal Options
 The players union continues to reviews its options on the appellate court decision that enables the government to retain the results and identities of the 104 players who tested positive for steroids use in 2003.
 ''We still have time to make a decision; we're still doing research,'' said Donald Fehr, the union chief. 
 The union primarily has two avenues of appeal of the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco. It can ask the court to rehear the case before a 15-judge panel, or it can appeal directly to the Supreme Court. Fehr didn't say if the union was leaning in either direction, but the feeling here is it will go back to the Ninth Circuit and ask for a rehearing.
 The court has 26 judges, 2 short of a full house, and 14 of the judges would have to vote to accept the case for rehearing by 15 judges. A 2-to-1 decision last month overturned three lower-court decisions that went in the union's favor.

HEADLINE: Hong Kong Tries to Stop Its Mainlander Baby Boom 

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
The plaintive cries of newborns never stop in the special care infant ward at Hong Kong's Queen Elizabeth Hospital -- a ward designed for 30 babies but that has had as many as 60 at a time in recent weeks.
 The crowding is not a result of a baby boom among Hong Kong women, who have the world's lowest birthrate. Instead, the rows of bassinets are full because of an influx of mainland Chinese women who go to great lengths to make sure that their babies are born in Hong Kong.
The Hong Kong government wants to discourage them. Starting Feb. 1, pregnant women from the mainland will have to pay $5,000 for their hospital care before they are even allowed to enter Hong Kong, which has been a semiautonomous Chinese territory since Britain returned it in 1997. 
 Under rules the government announced Tuesday evening, immigration officers will be instructed to turn back any mainlander who appears to be at least seven months pregnant and has not paid. 
 The policy is expected to produce tearful showdowns at border points, and is already provoking an acrimonious debate in Hong Kong over what it means to be a citizen of this cosmopolitan metropolis on the South China Sea.
 Just as many women from Mexico struggle to make sure their babies are born in the United States and are entitled to American citizenship, thousands of women from the mainland come to Hong Kong to give birth because it entitles their babies to permanent residency here. The benefits include a free education and subsidized health care as part of Hong Kong's British-inspired welfare policies. Hong Kong residents pay as little as $12.80 to give birth at a hospital because of extensive government subsidies.
 The issue has divided the democracy movement here. Some, like Martin Lee, the founding chairman of the Democratic Party, agree with the city's Beijing-appointed leaders that Hong Kong needs more citizens because of its low birthrate -- 0.9 per woman of child-bearing age, far below the replacement rate of 2.1. If the babies grow up and come live here, Hong Kong will have young people to care for an aging population. By having babies here, the mainland women ''do what we cannot do ourselves,'' Mr. Lee said.
 But others in the democracy movement, like Dr. Kwok Ka-ki, a surgeon who represents the medical profession in the legislature, say permanent residency should be restricted to babies born to Hong Kong parents.
 ''How could we stand the impact if huge numbers of mainland women come here to have babies?'' he asked.
 The number of babies born in Hong Kong to mainland mothers surged to 15,000 last year from several hundred a year in the late 1990s. Before the new restrictions were adopted, the number was poised to rise even more, as the Year of the Pig, which Chinese tradition holds to be an auspicious time for adding to a family, begins on Feb. 4 or Feb. 18, depending on which Chinese tradition is followed. 
 Every fifth Year of the Pig, falling once every 60 years, is considered especially auspicious and is known as a Year of the Golden Pig. The coming year is a Year of the Golden Pig, and is expected to produce an increase in births because marriage and birth statistics across China continue to show clear influences from such traditional beliefs, despite strong efforts by the Chinese Communist Party to dismiss them as superstitions.
 Having a baby in Hong Kong, a city of 6.9 million people, can also help a family evade the mainland's one-child policy, although enforcement of that policy has been less stringent in recent years. Most of the women giving birth here return to the mainland initially to raise their babies because the mothers do not have the right to live here. The babies frequently have Hong Kong fathers, because Hong Kong companies now employ an estimated 11 million people on the mainland and send tens of thousands of Hong Kong citizens, mostly men, to manage them. 
 After marrying a Hong Kong man, a mainland woman can wait as long as seven years for the legal right to live here. 
 Beijing officials made it much easier in 2003 for mainlanders to visit Hong Kong, in a bid to help Hong Kong's struggling economy recover from SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and thereby reduce pressures in Hong Kong for more democratic local rule. 
 Greater access has produced a tourism boom and throngs at shopping malls, but it has also made it much easier for pregnant women from the mainland to reach here.
 Queen Elizabeth Hospital is on Kowloon Peninsula close to the train station where mainland Chinese arrive. It has been receiving a steady flow of women, many of whom show up in labor and with minimal medical records, making it hard to provide proper care.
 ''We have to be very cautious, very careful, because they've got complications as well'' in some cases, said Dr. Cecilia Cheon, a consulting obstetrician at the hospital.
 The special care infant ward handles babies born with jaundice and other problems not severe enough to require that they be placed in intensive care. The ward was so busy on Wednesday that the regular nurses were joined by retired pediatric nurses who had been called in to help give the babies bottles, burp them and change their diapers.
 Dr. Terence Lao, an obstetrician at Queen Mary Hospital on Hong Kong Island, said the unexpected arrival of women in labor with few health records posed several risks. The women may be infected with influenza, asymptomatic tuberculosis or even H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.
 ''Even if we are suspecting something, we cannot get the tests back in time,'' Dr. Lao said.
 It is also harder to treat a baby at birth for possible health problems if no ultrasound tests have been done in advance to determine the health of the fetus.
 Dr. Anthony Hedley, a former chairman of the department of community medicine at Hong Kong University and a frequent critic of government health policies, said that discouraging pregnant women from the mainland from traveling to Hong Kong was a prudent health measure. ''It's not good for mothers or infants to be shuttling long distances,'' he said.
 But Dr. Kwok said that the new rules might prompt mainland women to enter the territory before their pregnancies show, and then to overstay their visas to give birth here. 
 Beijing officials have been quiet on Hong Kong's new restrictions. Mainland leaders seldom comment publicly on issues involving Hong Kong, to avoid being accused of interfering with the city's autonomy, but they wield enormous influence on a wide range of issues.
 The new policy has attracted its share of jokes. A cartoon in the South China Morning Post on Wednesday showed a large-bellied woman walking past two immigration officers.
 ''You're letting her in?'' one of the officers asked. 
 The other replied, ''Apparently it's only heroin, which is a customs problem.''

DATELINE: CLARKSTON, Ga., Jan. 20 

 BODY:
Early last summer the mayor of this small town east of Atlanta issued a decree: no more soccer in the town park.
 ''There will be nothing but baseball and football down there as long as I am mayor,'' Lee Swaney, a retired owner of a heating and air-conditioning business, told the local paper. ''Those fields weren't made for soccer.''
In Clarkston, soccer means something different than in most places. As many as half the residents are refugees from war-torn countries around the world. Placed by resettlement agencies in a once mostly white town, they receive 90 days of assistance from the government and then are left to fend for themselves. Soccer is their game.
 But to many longtime residents, soccer is a sign of unwanted change, as unfamiliar and threatening as the hijabs worn by the Muslim women in town. It's not football. It's not baseball. The fields weren't made for it. Mayor Swaney even has a name for the sort of folks who play the game: the soccer people. 
 Caught in the middle is a boys soccer program called the Fugees -- short for refugees, though most opponents guess the name refers to the hip-hop band.
 The Fugees are indeed all refugees, from the most troubled corners -- Afghanistan, Bosnia, Burundi, Congo, Gambia, Iraq, Kosovo, Liberia, Somalia and Sudan. Some have endured unimaginable hardship to get here: squalor in refugee camps, separation from siblings and parents. One saw his father killed in their home. 
 The Fugees, 9 to 17 years old, play on three teams divided by age. Their story is about children with miserable pasts trying to make good with strangers in a very different and sometimes hostile place. But as a season with the youngest of the three teams revealed, it is also a story about the challenges facing resettled refugees in this country. More than 900,000 have been admitted to the United States since 1993, and their presence seems to bring out the best in some people and the worst in others. 
 The Fugees' coach exemplifies the best. A woman volunteering in a league where all the other coaches are men, some of them paid former professionals from Europe, she spends as much time helping her players' families make new lives here as coaching soccer.
 At the other extreme are some town residents, opposing players and even the parents of those players, at their worst hurling racial epithets and making it clear they resent the mostly African team. In a region where passions run high on the subject of illegal immigration, many are unaware or unconcerned that, as refugees, the Fugees are here legally.
 ''There are no gray areas with the Fugees,'' said the coach, Luma Mufleh. ''They trigger people's reactions on class, on race. They speak with accents and don't seem American. A lot of people get shaken up by that.''

Lots of Running, Many Rules
 The mayor's soccer ban has everything to do with why, on a scorching August afternoon, Ms. Mufleh -- or Coach Luma, as she is known in the refugee community -- is holding tryouts for her under-13 team on a rutted, sand-scarred field behind an elementary school.
 The boys at the tryouts wear none of the shiny apparel or expensive cleats common in American youth soccer. One plays in ankle-high hiking boots, some in baggy jeans, another in his socks. On the barren lot, every footfall and pivot produces a puff of chalky dust that hangs in the air like fog.
 Across town, the lush field in Milam Park sits empty.
 Ms. Mufleh blows her whistle.
 ''Listen up,'' she tells the panting and dusty boys. ''I don't care how well you play. I care how hard you work. Every Monday and Wednesday, I'm going to have you from 5 to 8.'' The first half will be for homework and tutoring. Ms. Mufleh has arranged volunteers for that. The second half will be for soccer, and for running. Lots of running.
 ''If you miss a practice, you miss the next game,'' she tells the boys. ''If you miss two games, you're off the team.''
 The final roster will be posted on the bulletin board at the public library by 10 Friday morning, she says. Don't bother to call.
 And one more thing. She holds up a stack of paper, contracts she expects her players to sign. ''If you can't live with this,'' she says, ''I don't want you on this team.''
 Hands -- black, brown, white -- reach for the paper. As the boys read, eyes widen:
 I will have good behavior on and off the field.
 I will not smoke.
 I will not do drugs.
 I will not drink alcohol.
 I will not get anyone pregnant.
 I will not use bad language.
 My hair will be shorter than Coach's.
 I will be on time.
 I will listen to Coach.
 I will try hard.
 I will ask for help.
 I want to be part of the Fugees!

A Town Transformed
 Until the refugees began arriving, the mayor likes to say, Clarkston ''was just a sleepy little town by the railroad tracks.''
 Since then, this town of 7,100 has become one of the most diverse communities in America.
 Clarkston High School now has students from more than 50 countries. The local mosque draws more than 800 to Friday prayers. There is a Hindu temple, and there are congregations of Vietnamese, Sudanese and Liberian Christians.
 At the shopping center, American stores have been displaced by Vietnamese, Ethiopian and Eritrean restaurants and a halal butcher. The only hamburger joint in town, City Burger, is run by an Iraqi.
 The transformation began in the late 1980s, when resettlement agencies, private groups that contract with the federal government, decided Clarkston was perfect for refugees to begin new lives. The town had an abundance of inexpensive apartments, vacated by middle-class whites who left for more affluent suburbs. It had public transportation; the town was the easternmost stop on the Atlanta rail system. And it was within commuting distance of downtown Atlanta's booming economy, offering new arrivals at least the prospect of employment.
 At first the refugees -- most from Southeast Asia -- arrived so slowly that residents barely noticed. But as word got out about Clarkston's suitability, more agencies began placing refugees here. From 1996 to 2001, more than 19,000 refugees from around the world resettled in Georgia, many in Clarkston and surrounding DeKalb County, to the dismay of many longtime residents.
 Many of those residents simply left. Others stayed but remained resentful, keeping score of the ways they thought the refugees were altering their lives. There were events that reinforced fears that Clarkston was becoming unsafe: a mentally ill Sudanese boy beheaded his 5-year-old cousin in their Clarkston apartment; a fire in a crowded apartment in town claimed the lives of four Liberian refugee children.
 At a town meeting in 2003 meant to foster understanding between the refugees and residents, the first question, submitted on an index card, was, ''What can we do to keep the refugees from coming to Clarkston?''

A Coach With a Passion
 Luma Mufleh, 31, says she was born to coach. She grew up in Amman, Jordan, in a Westernized family, and attended the American Community School, for American and European expatriates and a few well-to-do Jordanians. There, Muslim girls were free to play sports as boys did, and women were permitted to coach.
 Her mentor was an American volleyball coach who demanded extreme loyalty and commitment. Ms. Mufleh picked up on a paradox. Though she claimed to dislike her coach, she wanted to play well for her.
 ''For the majority of the time she coached me, I hated her,'' Ms. Mufleh said. ''But she had our respect. Until then, I'd always played for me. I'd never played for a coach.''
 Ms. Mufleh attended college in the United States, in part because she felt women here had more opportunities. She went to Smith College, and after graduation moved to Atlanta. She soon found her first coaching job, as head of a 12-and-under girls soccer team through the local Y.M.C.A.
 On the field, Ms. Mufleh emulated her volleyball coach, an approach that did not always sit well with American parents. When she ordered her players to practice barefoot, to get a better feel for the soccer ball, a player's mother objected on the grounds that her daughter could injure her toes.
 ''This is how I run my practice,'' Ms. Mufleh told her. ''If she's not going to do it, she's not going to play.''
 Ms. Mufleh's first team lost every game. But over time her methods paid off. Her players returned. They got better. In her third season, her team was undefeated.
 When Ms. Mufleh learned about the growing refugee community in Clarkston, she floated the idea of starting a soccer program. The Y.M.C.A. offered to back her with uniforms and equipment. So in the summer of 2004, Ms. Mufleh made fliers announcing tryouts in Arabic, English, French and Vietnamese and distributed them around apartment complexes where the refugees lived. 
 For a coach hoping to build a soccer program in Clarkston, the biggest challenge was not finding talented players. There were plenty of those, boys who had learned the game in refugee camps in Africa and in parking lots around town. The difficulty was finding players who would show up.
 Many of the players come from single-parent families, with mothers or fathers who work hours that do not sync with sports schedules. Few refugee families own cars. Players would have to be self-sufficient.
 On a June afternoon, 23 boys showed up for the tryouts. 
 From the beginning, the players were wary. A local church offered a free basketball program for refugee children largely as a cover for missionary work. 
 Others simply doubted that a woman could coach soccer.
 ''She's a girl -- she doesn't know what she's talking about,'' Ms. Mufleh overheard a Sudanese boy say at an early practice. 
 She ordered him to stand in the goal. As the team watched, she blasted a shot directly at the boy, who dove out of the way.
 ''Anybody else?'' she asked.

In Brutal Pasts, a Bond
 Jeremiah Ziaty, one of those early players, is a typical member of the Fugees. 
 In 1997, in the midst of Liberia's 14 years of civil war, rebels led by Charles Taylor showed up one night at the Ziatys' house in Monrovia. Jeremiah's father was a low-level worker in a government payroll office. The rebels thought he had money. When they learned he did not, they killed him in the family's living room.
 Beatrice Ziaty, Jeremiah's mother, grabbed her sons and fled out the back door. The Ziatys trekked through the bush for a week until they reached a refugee camp in the Ivory Coast. There, they lived in a mud hut and scavenged for food. After five years in the camp, Ms. Ziaty learned her family had been accepted for resettlement in Clarkston, a town she had never heard of.
 The United States Committee for Refugees and Immigrants in Washington estimates that there are now more than 12 million refugees worldwide and more than 20 million people displaced within their own nations' borders. In 2005, only 80,800 were accepted by other nations for resettlement, according to the United Nations. 
 The Ziatys' resettlement followed a familiar script. The family was lent $3,016 for one-way airline tickets to the United States, which they repaid in three years. After a two-day journey from Abidjan, they were greeted in Atlanta by a case worker from the International Rescue Committee, a resettlement organization. She took them to an apartment in Clarkston where the cupboard had been stocked with canned goods.
 The case worker helped Ms. Ziaty find a job, as a maid at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in the affluent Buckhead section of Atlanta, one that required an hour commute by bus. While walking home from the bus stop after her first day, Ms. Ziaty was mugged and her purse stolen.
 Terrified of her new surroundings, Ms. Ziaty told her son Jeremiah never to leave the house. Like any 8-year-old, Jeremiah bristled. He especially wanted to play soccer. Through friends in the neighborhood, he heard about tryouts for the Fugees.
 ''When he tell me, 'Mom, I go play soccer,' I tell him he's too small, don't go out of the house,'' Ms. Ziaty recalled. ''Then he would start crying.'' 
 Ms. Ziaty relaxed her rule when she met Ms. Mufleh, who promised to take care of her son. 
 That was three years ago. At age 11, Jeremiah is a leader of the 13-and-under Fugees, shifting among sweeper, center midfielder and center forward. 
 Other members of the Fugees also have harrowing stories. Qendrim Bushi's Muslim family fled Kosovo when Serbian soldiers torched his father's grocery store and threatened to kill them. Eldin Subasic's uncle was shot in Bosnia. And so on.
 The Fugees, Ms. Mufleh believed, shared something intense. They knew trauma. They knew the fear and loneliness of the newcomer. This was their bond.
 ''In order to get a group to work together, to be effective together, you have to find what is common,'' she said. ''The refugee experience is pretty powerful.''
 Ms. Mufleh made a point never to ask her players about their pasts. On the soccer field, she felt, refugees should leave that behind. 
 Occasionally, though, a boy would reveal a horrific memory. One reported that he had been a child soldier. When she expressed frustration that a Liberian player tuned out during practice, another Liberian told her she didn't understand: the boy had been forced by soldiers to shoot his best friend.
 ''It was learning to not react,'' Ms. Mufleh said. ''I just wanted to listen. How do you respond when a kid says, 'I saw my dad shot in front of me'? I didn't know.''
 As a Jordanian in the Deep South, Ms. Mufleh identified in some ways with the refugees. A legal resident awaiting a green card, she often felt an outsider herself, and knew what it was like to be far from home.
 She also found she was needed. Her fluent Arabic and conversational French came in handy for players' mothers who needed to translate a never-ending flow of government paperwork. Teachers learned to call her when her players' parents could not be located. Families began to invite her to dinner, platters of rice and bowls of leafy African stews. The Ziatys cut back on the peppers when Coach Luma came over; they learned she couldn't handle them.
 Upon hearing of the low wages the refugee women were earning, Ms. Mufleh thought she could do better. She started a house and office cleaning company called Fresh Start, to employ refugee women. The starting salary is $10 an hour, nearly double the minimum wage and more than the women were earning as maids in downtown hotels. She guarantees a 50-cent raise every year, and now employs six refugee women.
 Ms. Mufleh said that when she started the soccer program, she was hopelessly naive about how it would change her life.
 ''I thought I would coach twice a week and on weekends -- like coaching other kids,'' she said. ''It's 40 or 60 hours a week -- coaching, finding jobs, taking people to the hospital. You start off on your own, and you suddenly have a family of 120.''

Off to a Rough Start
 On a Friday morning in August, the boys come one by one to look for their names on the roster at the public library. Many go away disappointed, but six do not. 
 The new players are:
 Mohammed Mohammed, 12, a bright-eyed Iraqi Kurd whose family fled Saddam Hussein for Turkey five years ago and who speaks only a few words of English.
 Idwar and Robin Dikori, two rocket-fast Sudanese brothers, 12 and 10, who lost their mother, sister and two younger brothers in a car crash after arriving in Clarkston.
 Shahir Anwar, 13, an Afghan whose parents fled the Taliban and whose father suffered a debilitating stroke soon after arriving in this country.
 Santino Jerke, a shy 11-year-old Sudanese who has just arrived after three years as a refugee in Cairo. 
 Mafoday Jawneh, a heavyset boy of 12 whose family fell out of favor after a coup in Gambia, and who has a sensitive side; his older brother ribs him for tearing up during ''The Oprah Winfrey Show.''
 Ms. Mufleh is uncertain of her team's prospects. She will have to teach the new players the basics of organized soccer. There are no throw-ins or corner kicks in the street game they have been playing. 
 In her occasional moments of self-doubt, Ms. Mufleh asks herself: Can I really get these boys to play together? Can I really get them to win?
 The Fugees' first practice this season is on a sultry August afternoon, with thunderclouds looming in the distance. After 90 minutes of studying, the team runs for half an hour and groans through situps, push-ups and leg lifts.
 But the Fugees have no soccer goals. The Y.M.C.A., which sponsors the team, did not place the order, despite a $2,000 grant for the purpose. Ms. Mufleh quietly seethes that a team of wealthy children would probably not have to wait for soccer goals. She likens practice to ''playing basketball without a hoop.''
 The team's first games portend a long season. The Fugees tie their first game, 4-4. In their next game, they surrender a lead and lose, 3-1. The team isn't passing well. Players aren't holding their positions.
 On a sweltering afternoon in early September, the Fugees prepare to take the field against the Triumph, a team from nearby Tucker. Even before the game, there is a glaring difference between the Fugees and their competition. The Triumph have brought perhaps 40 parents, siblings and friends, who spread out with folding chairs and picnic blankets and are loaded down with enough energy bars and brightly colored sports drinks for an N.B.A. team. 
 Though this is technically a home game, no one is on the Fugees' side. During the course of the season, only one Fugees parent will make a game.
 The Fugees lead, 2-0, at halftime. In the second half, they put on a show: firing headers, bicycle kicks and a gorgeous arcing shot from 30 yards out. Even the parents of the Triumph gasp and clap in appreciation. At the final whistle, the Fugees have won, 5-1.
 ''Not bad,'' Ms. Mufleh tells her team. ''But next week will be a much better game, O.K.?'' 

A Call for Change
 Ms. Mufleh has a list of complaints about the Fugees' practice field: little grass, no goals. Neighborhood children regularly wander through the scrimmages, disrupting play. 
 But after a gang shooting in an apartment complex behind the field in late September, she concludes that the field is not safe. She cancels practice for two days. Fed up, she storms into Mayor Swaney's office, demanding use of the empty field in Milam Park.
 When Lee Swaney first ran for City Council in Clarkston more than 15 years ago, he did so as an unabashed representative of ''Old Clarkston'' -- Clarkston before the refugees. It was certainly the more politically viable stance. Because few of the refugees have been in the country long enough to become citizens and vote, political power resides with longtime residents. The 2005 election that gave Mr. Swaney a second four-year term as mayor of this town of 7,100 was determined by just 390 voters.
 As mayor, Mr. Swaney has frequently found himself caught between these voters and the thousands of newcomers. But he has also taken potentially unpopular steps on behalf of the refugees. In 2006 he forced the resignation of the town's longtime police chief, in part because of complaints from refugees that Clarkston police officers were harassing them. Mr. Swaney gave the new chief a mandate to purge the Police Department of rogue officers.
 Within three months, the chief, a black man of Trinidadian descent named Tony J. Scipio, fired or accepted the resignations of one-third of the force. 
 Soccer is another matter. Mr. Swaney does not relish his reputation as the mayor who banned soccer. But he must please constituents who complain that refugees are overrunning the town's parks and community center -- people like Emanuel Ransom, a black man who moved to Clarkston in the late 1960s. 
 ''A lot of our Clarkston residents are being left out totally,'' Mr. Ransom says. ''Nobody wants to help,'' he says of the refugees. ''It's just, 'Give me, give me, give me.' ''
 Mr. Swaney encourages Ms. Mufleh to make her case at the next City Council meeting. So in early October she addresses a packed room at City Hall, explaining the team's origins and purpose and promising to pick up trash in the park after practice. 
 Mr. Swaney takes the floor. He admits concerns about ''grown soccer people'' who might tear up the field. But these are kids, he says, and ''kids are our future.''
 He announces his support of a six-month trial for the Fugees' use of the field in Milam Park.
 The proposal passes unanimously. At least for six months, the Fugees can play on grass.

Getting Back in the Game
 Early on the morning of Oct. 14, Jeremiah Ziaty is nowhere to be seen. The Fugees have a 9 a.m. game an hour from Clarkston, against the Bluesprings Liberty Fire, one of the top teams. Ms. Mufleh had told her players to meet at the library by 7. 
 Ms. Mufleh usually leaves players behind if they aren't on time. But she knows Jeremiah's mother is now working nights at a packaging factory; she gets home at 3 a.m. and won't be up to wake Jeremiah. So the coach orders the bus driver to the Ziatys' apartment. Jeremiah is sound asleep. Awakened, he grabs his uniform and fumbles toward the bus.
 From the outset of the game, the Fugees, and especially Jeremiah, seem groggy. They fall behind, 1-0. But in the second half, they tie the score, fall behind, and tie it again, 2-2. Jeremiah is now playing fearsome defense. With minutes to go, the Fugees score. They win, 3-2.
 ''We played as a team,'' says Qendrim Bushi, the boy from Kosovo. ''We didn't yell at each other. Last game, when they scored, all of us were yelling at each other. And Coach made us do a lot of stuff at practice. That's why we win. Only because of Coach.'' 
 As the Fugees leave the field, a man on the Bluesprings sideline yells to them, ''I'd have paid money to watch that game!''
 The Fugees have a knack for inspiring such strong reactions, both positive and negative. After one game Ms. Mufleh thought for a moment she was being chased by a rival parent. 
 ''We've heard about your team,'' the man said when he caught up with her. ''We want to know what we can do to help.''
 The rival team donated cleats, balls and jerseys. 
 Then there was the game in rural Clarkesville last season at which rival players and even some parents shouted a racial epithet at some of the African players on the Fugees. 
 After being ejected from a game against the Fugees in November, a rival player made an obscene gesture to nearly every player on the Fugees before heading to his bench. And opponents sometimes mocked the Fugees when they spoke to each other in Swahili, or when Ms. Mufleh shouted instructions in Arabic.
 There were even incidents involving referees. Two linesmen were reprimanded by a head referee during a pregame lineup in October for snickering when the name Mohammed Mohammed was called.
 Ms. Mufleh tells her players to try their best to ignore these slights. When the other side loses its cool, she tells them, it is a sign of weakness. 
 Ms. Mufleh is just as fatalistic about bad calls. In her entire coaching career, she tells her players, she has never seen a call reversed because of arguing.
 The Fugees are perhaps better equipped to accept this advice than most. Their lives, after all, have been defined by bad calls. On the field, they seem to have a higher threshold for anger than the American players, who often respond to borderline calls as if they are catastrophic injustices. Bad calls, Ms. Mufleh teaches her players, are part of the game. You have to accept them, and move on. 
 On Oct. 21, Ms. Mufleh is forced to put this theory to the test. The Fugees are on their way to Athens, an hour's drive, for their biggest game, against the undefeated United Gold Valiants. A win will put them in contention for the top spot in their division. Ms. Mufleh sets out in her yellow Volkswagen Beetle, the back seat crammed with balls and cleats. Her team follows in a white Y.M.C.A. bus.
 Just outside Monroe, Ms. Mufleh looks to her left and sees a Georgia State Patrol car parallel to her. She looks at her speedometer. She isn't speeding.
 The brake light, she thinks.
 Ms. Mufleh noticed it early in the week, but between practices, work and evenings shuttling among her players' apartments, she neglected to get it fixed. The trooper turns on his flashing lights. Ms. Mufleh eases to the side and looks at her watch. If this doesn't take too long, the team will make the field in time to warm up.
 It isn't so simple. Because of a clerical error, a ticket Ms. Mufleh paid a year before appears unpaid. Her license is suspended. The trooper orders her from her car. In full view of her team, he arrests her. 
 In the bus, the Fugees become unglued. Santino Jerke, in the country only a few months, begins to weep, violating the unwritten team rule that Fugees don't cry. Several of the Fugees have had family members snatched by uniformed men, just like this. They have been in the United States too little time to understand court dates or bail.
 Ms. Mufleh tells the team's manager and bus driver, Tracy Ediger, to take the team to Athens. They know what to do. They can play without her.
 Coachless, though, the Fugees are lost. Athens scores within minutes. And scores again. And again. The final score is 5-0.
 After the game, Ms. Ediger drives the team back to Monroe. She puts together the $800 bail for Ms. Mufleh and signs some papers. In a few moments, the coach appears. Later, Ms. Mufleh says she thought at that moment about all the times she had told the Fugees to shake off bad calls, to get back in the game, to take responsibility. She walks straight to the bus and her players. 
 ''This was my fault, and I had no excuse for not being there,'' she tells them. ''I should have been there and I wasn't, and the way it happened probably messed you guys up.''
 Ms. Mufleh asks about the score.
 ''It was a really hard team, Coach,'' says Idwar Dikori, the Sudanese speedster.
 ''Were they better than you?''
 ''No!'' the Fugees shout in unison.
 ''Come on, guys -- were they?''
 ''No, Coach,'' Robin Dikori says. ''If you were there, we were going to beat them.'' Back in Clarkston that night, Ms. Mufleh takes some sweet rolls to the family of Grace Balegamire, a Congolese player. Grace's 9-year-old brother has heard about the arrest, but doesn't believe it.
 ''If you were in jail,'' the boy says, ''you wouldn't be here.''
 Ms. Mufleh explains that she gave the people at the jail some money and promised to come back later, so they let her out.
 ''How much money?'' he asks.
 ''Enough for 500 ice creams.''
 ''If you pay 500 ice creams you can come out of jail?'' he asks.
 Ms. Mufleh grasps the boy's confusion. The boys' father is a political prisoner, in jail in Kinshasa, under circumstances that have drawn condemnation from Amnesty International and the Red Cross. The government there has issued no word on when, or if, he will be released. 
 At the Ziatys' home, the arrest has a similarly jarring effect. Jeremiah locks himself in his room and cries himself to sleep.

Battling to the End
 It's late October, and with just two weeks left in the season, a minor miracle occurs in the arrival of two 10-foot-long cardboard boxes: portable soccer goals for the Fugees. The administrator at the Y.M.C.A. finally put in the order. Ms. Mufleh and Ms. Ediger assemble the goals in Milam Park.
 The goals and the new field offer Ms. Mufleh new opportunities to coach. On grass, players can slide-tackle during scrimmages, a danger on the old, gravelly field. A lined field makes it easier to practice throw-ins and corner kicks. And goals: well, they provide a chance for the Fugees to practice shooting. 
 A disturbing trend has emerged in recent games. The Fugees move the ball down the field at will, but their shots are wild. They tie two games despite dominating play.
 Perhaps the Fugees are missing shots for the reason other teams miss shots: because scoring in soccer, under the best conditions, is deceptively difficult. But Ms. Mufleh also wonders if the absence of goals for most of a season doesn't have something to do with it.
 Even so, the Fugees end the regular season on a misty Saturday with a 2-1 victory, to finish third in their division with a record of 5-2-3, behind undefeated Athens and the Dacula Danger, a team the Fugees tied. The season finale will be a tournament called the Tornado Cup. To a player, the Fugees think they can win.
 ''What makes us work as a team is we all want to win bad -- we want to be the best team around,'' Qendrim says. ''It's like they're all from my own country,'' he adds of his teammates. ''They're my brothers.''
 The Tornado Cup comes down to a game between the Fugees and the Concorde Fire, perhaps Atlanta's most elite -- and expensive -- soccer academy. The Fugees need to win to advance to the finals. 
 Standing on the sideline in a sweatshirt with ''Soccer Mom'' on the back, Nancy Daffner, team mother for the Fire, describes her son's teammates as ''overachievers.'' One is a cellist who has played with the Atlanta Symphony. Her son wakes up an hour early every day to do a morning radio broadcast at his school. 
 The Fire are mostly from the well-to-do Atlanta suburb of Alpharetta. They have played together under the same coach for five years. They practice twice a week under lights, and have sessions for speed and agility training. 
 Over the years, the parents have grown close. During practice, Ms. Daffner says, she and the other mothers often meet for margaritas while the fathers watch their sons play. The team has pool parties and players spend weekends at one another's lake houses. In the summer, most of the players attend soccer camp at Clemson University. Ms. Daffner estimates that the cost of playing for the Fire exceeds $5,000 a year per player, which includes fees, travel to tournaments and, of course, gear. Each player has an Adidas soccer bag embroidered with his jersey number.
 There is one other expenditure. The parents of the Fire collectively finance the play of Jorge Pinzon, a Colombian immigrant and the son of a single working mother. He isn't from Alpharetta, but from East Gwinnett County, a largely Latino area outside Atlanta. Fire parents go to great lengths to get Jorge to games, arranging to meet him at gas stations around his home, landmarks they can find in his out-of-the-way neighborhood. Jorge is the best player on the team. 
 Ms. Mufleh gathers the Fugees before warm-ups. 
 ''Play to the whistle,'' she tells them. ''If the ref makes a bad call, you keep playing. O.K.? You focus on the game and how you're going to win it. Because if you don't, we're going to lose your last game of the season, and you're going home early.''
 Just before the opening whistle, some of the Fugees see a strange sight on the sideline. A teacher from the school of Josiah Saydee, a Liberian forward, has come to see him play. Some older refugee children from the complexes in Clarkston have managed rides to the game, an hour from home. Several volunteers from resettlement agencies show up. For the first time all year, the Fugees have fans.
 The Fugees come out shooting -- and missing -- frequently. They lead, 1-0, at the half. In the second half, it's as if a force field protects the Fire's goal. After a half-dozen misses, the Fugees score again midway through the second half, to lead by 2-1. 
 Then, with just minutes to go, Jorge Pinzon of the Fire gets free about 25 yards from the Fugees' goal. He squares his shoulders and leans into a shot that arcs beautifully over the players' heads. Eldin Subasic, the Fugees' Bosnian goalie, leaps. The ball brushes his hands and deflects just under the bar, tying the game. 
 The final whistle blows moments later. The Fugees' season is over.
 ''You had them,'' Ms. Mufleh tells her team after the game. ''You had them at 2 to 1, and you wouldn't finish it.''
 The Fugees are crushed.
 ''We lost, I mean, we tied our game,'' says Mafoday Jawneh, the sensitive newcomer to the team. ''It was so. '' His voice trails off. ''I don't know what it was.''

An Unpleasant Holiday Gift
 The holidays are a festive time in Clarkston. Santa Claus arrives by helicopter at City Hall. The mayor is there to greet him, as are some of the Fugees.
 They have other concerns besides Christmas. The Fugees have held two carwashes in town, to raise $1,000 to go to a tournament in Savannah in late January. They have come up $130 short, and Ms. Mufleh tells them that unless they raise the money, they are not going. When one player suggests asking their parents, Ms. Mufleh says that any player who asks a parent for tournament money will be kicked off the team.
 She tells them, ''You need to ask yourselves what you need to do for your team.''
 ''You need to ask yourself what you need to do for your team,'' Jeremiah Ziaty says. 
 He is at home in his kitchen, talking with Prince Tarlue, a teammate from Liberia, making a case for a team project. Some of the boys are to meet at Eldin Subasic's apartment. They can knock on doors in town and offer to rake leaves to raise the money to get to Savannah. No need telling Coach, unless they raise enough cash. Prince says he is in. Grace is in, too. Some older boys in the refugee community offer to help out as well. Late on a Sunday morning, they set out. 
 That afternoon, Ms. Mufleh's cellphone rings. It's Eldin, who asks if she will pick up Grace and take him home. They have been raking leaves all day, he says, and Grace does not want to walk home in the dark. Oh, Eldin adds, he wants to give her the money.
 ''What money?'' she asks.
 ''You said we needed $130,'' he tells her. ''So we got $130.''
 Ms. Mufleh and Ms. Ediger, the team manager, spend the holiday vacation visiting the players' families. On Dec. 26, Ms. Mufleh receives a fax on Town of Clarkston letterhead. 
 Effectively immediately, the fax informs her, the Fugees soccer team is no longer welcome to play at Milam Park. The city is handing the field to a youth sports coordinator who plans to run a youth baseball and football program.
 Questioned by this reporter, Mayor Swaney says he has forgotten that in October the City Council gave the Fugees six months. A few days later, he tells Ms. Mufleh the team can stay through March.
 In early January, Ms. Mufleh logs on to Google Earth, and scans satellite images of Clarkston. There are green patches on the campuses of Georgia Perimeter College, and at the Atlanta Area School for the Deaf, around the corner from City Hall. She hopes to find the Fugees a permanent home.


CORRECTION-DATE: March 4, 2007

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Jan. 21 about a soccer program for refugee boys in Clarkston, Ga., rendered incorrectly a quotation from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in which Mayor Lee Swaney of Clarkston commented on the use of a town park. He said, ''There will be nothing but baseball down there as long as I am mayor.'' He did not say ''baseball and football.''
A front-page article on Jan. 21 reported on a soccer program for refugee boys in Clarkston, Ga., and how it has come to symbolize the passions that run high in the area over the issue of immigration. The article included a statement that Clarkston's mayor, Lee Swaney, had forced the resignation of the town's longtime police chief, in part because of complaints from refugees that police officers were harassing them.
 The former police chief, Charles Nelson -- who was not identified by name in the article -- called The Times on Feb. 5 to say that he had resigned voluntarily. Mayor Swaney says that Mr. Nelson left on his own accord.
 The Times tried several times to contact Mr. Nelson for comment before publication. The article should have said that he could not be reached, and it should have attributed the information about the circumstances of his resignation to those who provided it.
 This editors' note was delayed for research.

HEADLINE: Colombian Government Is Ensnared in a Paramilitary Scandal

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
The government of President Alvaro Uribe, the largest recipient of American aid outside the Middle East, has found itself ensnared in a widening scandal as revelations surface of a secret alliance between some of the president's most prominent political supporters and paramilitary death squads. 
 Testimony this week from Salvatore Mancuso, a former paramilitary commander who admitted to orchestrating the killing of more than 300 people, as well as a document made public on Friday implicating more than a dozen politicians in the pact with paramilitaries, have injected fresh detail into a slow-burning scandal that has caused Colombia's elite political class to shudder in recent weeks. 
 Senior members of Mr. Uribe's government and Mr. Uribe himself have said that anyone shown to have had illegal ties to the paramilitaries, which terrorized Colombian cities and the countryside in the nation's internal war, which has gone on for decades, and made fortunes in cocaine trafficking, should be prosecuted in courts of law.
 The scandal has already touched Mr. Uribe's cabinet, with Senator Alvaro Araujo, the brother of Foreign Minister Maria Consuelo Araujo, under investigation for collaborating with militias. 
 ''If there's someone involved at the highest level, they will be fired,'' Francisco Santos, Colombia's vice president, said in an interview. ''Scrutiny is fine for us,'' Mr. Santos said. ''This country needs to know the whole truth.'' 
 Some of the details coming to light about the breadth of paramilitary activities are the result of a process set in motion by Mr. Uribe's own government, which has allowed paramilitary leaders to confess their crimes and pay reparations in exchange for reduced sentences of no more than eight years in prison. 
 Though some militia leaders have balked at the deal, much of Colombia has been gripped by the first such confession, that of Mr. Mancuso, a cattleman who helped found the paramilitary movement in the 1980s in an effort to combat leftist guerrillas. 
 Mr. Mancuso, 48, who studied English at the University of Pittsburgh, wept during the first days of his testimony at a special hearing in Medellin last month. This week, however, he simply read from a statement describing how he oversaw the assassinations of hundreds of people, with some operations made possible with information from military intelligence. 
 Mr. Mancuso also put Mr. Uribe in the spotlight by saying that militias pressured people to vote for the president in 2002, when Mr. Uribe was first elected. Mr. Uribe responded quickly by going on a national radio network to say he had never sent any emissaries to strike deals with the paramilitaries. 
 On the heels of Mr. Mancuso's testimony, a document rumored to exist in recent weeks was published in the daily newspaper El Tiempo on Friday. It describes a secret pact in 2001 between Mr. Mancuso, other paramilitary leaders and 11 congressmen, two governors and five mayors, in which those present agreed to work together to forge ''a new social contract,'' largely in order to protect private property rights.
 Senator Miguel de la Espriella, one of the signatories to the pact, helped bring the scandal to light last year by disclosing the ties between politicians and paramilitaries. Like other officials implicated in the pact, he said he was forced to sign, raising doubts as what type of legal punishment, if any, they might receive. 
 ''At first we declined to sign, but when they put a man with a rifle next to the document we understood we had no choice,'' Mr. de la Espriella, a member of the Democratic Colombia party, said in an e-mail interview. 
 Asked why he was the only politician to come forward with details of the secret agreement, Mr. de la Espriella, alluding to widespread suspicions that legislators and government officials had for years worked in tandem with the paramilitaries, responded, ''I told myself that a half-truth doesn't serve anybody, and we should all contribute to the enlightenment of the truth during so many years of war.'' 
 Those who signed the document included not only supporters of Mr. Uribe but also high-ranking officials in the political opposition, pointing to how a growing portion of the political establishment could be tarnished by the scandal. 
 Some 30,000 paramilitary members have been demobilized during Mr. Uribe's government in recent years. Colombia's military still receives more than $700 million a year in aid from the United States to combat drug trafficking and armed insurgencies. 
 Two guerrilla groups, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the National Liberation Army, still operate in the country. A truck carrying more than 600 pounds of explosives this week destroyed a dairy plant in southern Colombia owned by Nestle, the Swiss food company, an act that the police attributed to the rebels. 
 Although the scandal has emerged as the most pressing political challenge to Mr. Uribe's presidency, his approval ratings remain high, at above 60 percent, after five years of rule and a re-election victory last year. Many Colombians credit Mr. Uribe for declining levels of murders and kidnappings and robust economic growth. 
 However, political analysts here say a steady stream of disclosures related to the paramilitary scandal could diminish Mr. Uribe's credibility, particularly if implicated officials are perceived to have close ties to the president. The scandal has already entangled a former ambassador to Chile and a former head of the intelligence service. 
 Equally pressing for Mr. Uribe's government could be the scandal's influence on discussions in the United States Congress of aid to Colombia and a trade agreement awaiting Congressional approval that has been signed by Mr. Uribe and President Bush. Political analysts say the Democratic-led Congress is expected to add greater scrutiny of human rights issues in Colombia.

HEADLINE: New Orleans of Future May Stay Half Its Old Size

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
The empty streets, deserted avenues and abandoned houses prompt a gnawing question, nearly 17 months after Hurricane Katrina: Is this what New Orleans has come to -- a city half its old size?
 Over and over, the city's leaders reassure citizens that better days and, above all, more people are in the future. Their destiny will not merely be to reside in a smaller city with a few good restaurants and curious local customs, the citizens are told.
But some economists and demographers are beginning to wonder whether New Orleans will top out at about half its prestorm population of about 444,000, already in a steep decline from its peak of 627,525 in the 1960 Census. At the moment, the population is well below half, and future gains are likely to be small.
 ''It will be a trickle based on what we know now,'' said Elliott Stonecipher, a consultant and demographer based in Shreveport, La. ''Low tens of thousands, over three or four or five years, something in that range. I would say we could start losing people, especially if the crime problem doesn't get high visibility.'' 
 The new doubts, surprisingly, are largely not based on the widespread damage caused by the flood. Rather, crippling problems that existed long before Hurricane Katrina are mostly being blamed for the city's failure to thrive. 
 In this view, the storm was merely a grim exclamation point to conditions decades in the making. Before the storm, some economists say, New Orleans may have had more people than its economy could support, and the stalled repopulation is merely reflecting that. 
 Hurricane Katrina may have brutally recalibrated the city's demographics, setting New Orleans firmly on the path its underlying characteristics had already been leading it down: a city losing people at the rate of perhaps 1.5 percent a year before Hurricane Katrina, with a stagnant economy, more than a quarter of the population living in poverty, and a staggeringly high rate of unemployment, in which as many as one in five were jobless or not seeking work. 
 Political leaders, worried about the loss of clout and a Congressional seat, press for people to return, but a smaller New Orleans may not be bad, some economists say. Most of those who have not returned -- 175,000, by Mr. Stonecipher's count -- are very poor, and can be more easily absorbed in places with vibrant job markets, they say. 
 Large-scale concentrations of deep poverty -- as was the case in New Orleans before the storm -- are inherently harmful to cities. The smaller New Orleans is almost certain to wind up with a far higher percentage of its population working than before Hurricane Katrina. 
 ''Where there are high concentrations of poverty, people can't see a way out,'' said William Oakland, a retired economist from Tulane University who has studied the city's economy for decades. ''Maybe the diaspora is a blessing.''
 Others, however, worry that permanently losing so many people threatens the city's culture -- its unique way of talking, parading and eating. 
 ''Culture is people,'' said Richard Campanella, a Tulane geographer who has written extensively about the city's neighborhoods. ''If half the local people are dispersed and no longer living cohesively in those social networks, then half of local culture is gone.''
 The new doubts also take into account the current barriers to repopulation, including the well-documented failure of the state's Road Home aid program for homeowners, the loss of tens of thousands of jobs since the storm, the crime problem and delays in rebuilding moderately priced housing. Official efforts -- local, state and federal -- to rebuild the network of hospitals, schools and public housing projects that once served the city's huge poor population have been faltering. But they also look at what New Orleans was before the storm. 
 The low population figure, 191,000, which was reported by the Louisiana Recovery Authority in November last year in the most credible survey to date, was about half the 444,000 count in a Census estimate before Hurricane Katrina. The number was surprising, dashing expectations of a ''big return,'' as one economist put it, and was hotly disputed by local officials. Still, upticks, if there are any, are imperceptible: the percentage of prehurricane gas and electric users who were getting service, for instance, remained the same between April and November 2006, the Brookings Institution reported last month.
 ''Our expectations were just wrong,'' said James A. Richardson, an economist who directs the Public Administration Institute at Louisiana State University. ''I don't believe it will ever be 450,000 again. I think New Orleans did not need 450,000 people to support the economy you had at that time.'' 
 With no real place for the poorest of the evacuees in the economy before the storm, New Orleans may have permanently lost that part of its population. Supporting that notion is an unpublished analysis by Mr. Oakland, the former Tulane economist, which shows unusually low rates of participation in the labor force before Hurricane Katrina. 
 Thus, a frequent impression of prehurricane travelers to New Orleans -- that there were ''a lot of people hanging around, going nowhere,'' as the Nobel-winning Columbia University economist Edmund S. Phelps, a sometime-visitor, puts it -- turns out to have a statistical basis. 
 The statistics, which compare the number of people actually working with the total working-age population, suggest ''there are a lot of people out there not working,'' said Mr. Oakland, referring to the period before Hurricane Katrina. Or, he said, they were working in an underground economy, not measured by statistics. If not actually illegal, he said, it was not very profitable. 
 In New Orleans, before the storm, about 4 out of 10 men in the working-age population were out of a job or not looking for one, compared with less than 3 in 10 nationally. 
 Employment had dropped sharply in the city from 1969 to 1999, Mr. Oakland writes. More than half of young black men ages 16 to 24 were not in the labor force. Unemployment rates among young blacks were above 25 percent. ''The data is showing New Orleans is really a basket case,'' Mr. Oakland said. 
 In the city's poorest areas, the numbers were even more discouraging. In places like the Lower Ninth Ward or Central City, half of all working-age people were not looking for work, Mr. Oakland wrote. The real unemployment rate in these impoverished, high-crime areas, which would include those not looking for work, would have been a ''whopping'' 32 percent, he wrote. 
 Compounding the city's difficulties, and, in effect, helping to stem the population loss, was a secondary factor: the direness of the city's poverty, and its concentration. Those conditions helped make the city's poor population exceptionally immobile. New Orleans was also poor not only in absolute terms, but also in relative terms. The poorest 30 percent of households had a lower share of the city's total income than the comparable slice in any other similar Southern city, Mr. Oakland found. 
 ''The job mobility was very low among the poor, so they just stay where they are, and the social welfare system shored them up,'' Mr. Oakland said. 
 The city's population was thus ''out of equilibrium, if you would say that,'' Mr. Oakland added. ''It's not normal to have that level of nonparticipation in the labor force.''
 Haunting the city's effort to repopulate, too, is the incalculable toll inflicted by ghosts from its past -- a political legacy of corruption and patronage, and a deep racial division with a far more distressing passage toward integration than was experienced, say, in Atlanta.
 Looking to the future, another 50,000 people might eventually be added to the city's population, Mr. Oakland suggested, but there are no guarantees. 
 There has been little to no construction of cheap housing that would enable the return of the largest category of those still displaced, Mr. Stonecipher noted. 
 A second category of people, 50,000 or more who have established themselves elsewhere but who could return, may be even harder to recapture, given the combination of past weaknesses and continuing present-day hurdles.
 ''The longer it lasts, the more likely it is that our population is plateauing, the longer the uncertainty continues,'' said Janet Speyrer, an economist at the University of New Orleans.

HEADLINE: Big Game? An Enron Survivor Hunts for Riches

BYLINE: By CHARLES DUHIGG

 BODY:
THE South Pacific islands of Papua New Guinea, where canned mackerel occasionally serves as currency and cannibalism was once on the menu, are a long way from the corporate jungles where Enron was born.
 Yet amid the wreckage of Enron, the energy giant that went bankrupt in 2001, is a leftover sliver of the company that is still doing business in Papua New Guinea: an oil refinery near the country's capital, Port Moresby, that was shipped there from Alaska and in which Enron continues to hold a small stake.
In November, the relatively obscure Houston company that owns most of that refinery, the InterOil Corporation, made the kind of announcement investors crave: explorations near the refinery had uncorked a vast pool of natural gas potentially larger than the United States' total residential consumption of the fossil fuel in 2005. The size of the discovery was so large, Phil E. Mulacek, InterOil's chairman and chief executive, informed an analyst, that simply controlling its output ''was sort of like trying to stop the Mississippi.'' 
 Just a few years ago, such proclamations -- and the executives who made them -- might have been viewed as curiosities, if they were noticed at all. Energy prices were so low that many natural-gas discoveries were burnt off so that drilling rigs could extract precious oil deposits further below. And rattled investors might have been wary of any company linked to Enron, especially one like InterOil that was boasting of possible treasures unearthed in remote jungles. 
 But that was then. This is now. 
 After a lengthy dormant spell, the global search for gas and oil has reignited with a fervor that is transforming companies like InterOil into Wall Street darlings. ''The gold rush is back on,'' said Andrew V. Boland, an energy analyst at Peters & Company, a Canadian investment firm. ''It's like the wild, wild West, all over again.''
 InterOil's gas find -- which is unconfirmed and may be impossible to transport -- caused the company's stock price to soar and its market capitalization to swell to $891 million from $572 million within three weeks of the announcement. Many of InterOil's financial backers, including Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, and Boone Pickens's investment firm, increased their bets after the discovery was revealed. Stanley Druckenmiller, a former lieutenant of George Soros, disclosed three days after the announcement that his hedge fund had poured more than $30 million into InterOil stock.
 The passion for unearthing energy riches goes well beyond InterOil, of course. Yet, as the tangled history and relationships behind InterOil demonstrate, fortune and merit do not always march in lockstep in today's energy scramble. In addition to enfranchising bold explorers, energy fever has empowered scrappy promoters and would-be kingmakers who are rushing to remake nations and economies in a flash, analysts say. 
 In a controversial move, the monarchy of Qatar, for instance, earned a shot at becoming a regional power broker after a collection of local magnates helped to persuade the government and ExxonMobil to pour more than $25 billion into the nation's gas fields. In Bolivia, President Evo Morales is trying to use his country's gas reservoirs to force neighboring Chile to give his landlocked country a corridor to the sea.
 For small companies like InterOil, the possibilities for riches and influence are even more intoxicating. ''I knew from the start this company would be great,'' said Wayne Andrews, an analyst at Raymond James who has long encouraged investors to buy InterOil. ''These guys have moved mountains. They're working in an area with huge documented reservoirs of crude oil and natural gas. This is how fortunes are made.''
 Critics disagree. The company's history of disappointing results cause some to worry that not everything at InterOil is as it seems.
 ''This is a very questionable company,'' said Peter J. Hodson, a senior portfolio manager at Sprott Asset Management who has both owned and bet against InterOil's stock, but is not currently invested in the company. ''These are not the types of people who are supposed to win the energy race.''
 INTEROIL was born in 1994, when Mr. Mulacek, a Texas oilman, bought a small Alaskan oil refinery and decided to relocate it halfway around the world.
 Mr. Mulacek, who declined repeated interview requests, founded his first energy company in 1981 while he was still an undergraduate at Texas Tech University. In 1990, according to an interview with The Australian, the newspaper, he was processing oil waste in war-torn Kuwait when he met a group of Chevron executives. Four years later, they invited him to Alaska on a fishing trip that also included a tour of a small refinery that Chevron was trying to sell.
 At the time, oil refineries were not in high demand. Global petroleum development had slowed to a relative standstill as energy companies faced record low oil prices. But Mr. Mulacek saw in the Alaskan refinery a unique opportunity: although the rugged terrain of Papua New Guinea, 6,000 miles away, was known to house oil and gas reserves -- in some places, visitors could squeeze rocks until their hands were coated with an oily residue -- the country had no domestic refining capacity. Mr. Mulacek, who is described by acquaintances as a uniquely intense and driven businessman, bought the refinery and started the move.
 To find investors to finance the purchase, he enlisted the aid of Gaylen J. Byker, an oil executive who he had met through mutual acquaintances. Mr. Byker was about to become president of Calvin College, an educational affiliate of the Christian Reformed Church that is based in Grand Rapids, Mich. (Mr. Byker still holds that position.) But before taking the reins at Calvin College, Mr. Byker incorporated a small company to invest in Mr. Mulacek's refinery. A few months later, in mid-1995, Mr. Byker sold a portion of that company to his previous employer, the Offshore Energy Development Corporation.
 When Offshore Energy went public a few months after that, Mr. Byker sold his shares for $1.6 million, according to securities filings. Five months later, Offshore Energy's stock had declined by more than 73 percent, and Offshore Energy announced that it was for sale. In 1997, Titan Exploration, controlled by the deal maker Richard Rainwater, and an Enron subsidiary named JEDI (an entity later implicated in Enron's bankruptcy) bought the company and its stake in Mr. Mulacek's refinery. 
 By the time Titan entered the scene, Mr. Mulacek and Mr. Byker were scrambling to find cash to finance the refinery's relocation, according to Mr. Byker. Foremost among potential financiers was the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a federal agency also known as OPIC that offers American companies loans and insurance for foreign projects with strategic value to the United States. 
 By 1999, when InterOil's talks with OPIC were announced, Papua New Guinea was struggling to maintain a fragile peace achieved only a year earlier when a treaty ended a popular revolt that had claimed 20,000 lives. The United States had promised more than $1 million in direct aid to help quell unrest. In 2001, OPIC agreed to lend InterOil $85 million to finance the refinery's rebuilding. 
 By then, the project was almost 10 years old and reconstruction was almost complete. But the refinery failed to meet expectations: although it began in 2004 to process crude bought from other oil companies, and has produced millions of barrels of gasoline and other products, it has never sold any of it at a profit. InterOil has booked about $893 million in revenue over the last three years, largely by selling the refinery's output. But the company reported increasing losses, posting a net loss of $37 million in 2005 alone, the last full year for which data are available. 
 ''When crude was $30 a barrel, this refinery made a lot of sense,'' said Mr. Byker, who still serves as an InterOil director. But the market for nontransportation fuels produced in the refining process, like naphtha, became less profitable as the price of crude rose, said Mr. Byker, causing InterOil's earnings to suffer. The company has spent millions of dollars making the refinery more efficient, but thus far ''it hasn't worked out as we hoped,'' he said.
 A dearth of profits, however, did not stop InterOil from raising wads of money from investors. InterOil raised more than $125 million from shareholders and $318 million from debt holders between 2003 and 2005, according to securities filings. It did so based on assets that consist primarily of the refinery, which Mr. Byker said InterOil bought for less than $10 million, about 60 Papua New Guinean gas stations and a handful of oil and gas exploration projects. 
 The company's executives and analysts say investors are willing to overlook InterOil's losses because they believe that its oil and gas exploration activities will eventually pay off.
 ''While there hasn't been any real success in the company's history, I think they're on the brink of something huge,'' said Mr. Andrews at Raymond James, one of the few Wall Street analysts who has consistently followed the company. ''I know it's controversial, and when people bash the company, I can't really say they're wrong, but I think it's going to be a great investment. It's happened with other energy explorers before.''
 In the last seven years, InterOil has drilled major wells in at least eight locations in Papua New Guinea. At the beginning of many of those projects, InterOil executives announced impressive preliminary results. With wells bearing such robust and bullish names as ''Rhino,'' ''Sterling Mustang'' and ''Triceratops,'' InterOil has announced tentative oil finds that topped 1.3 billion barrels. 
 And, as has always been the case on Wall Street, rosy announcements often provide more than enough fuel to ignite a stock surge. 
 A dollar invested in the company's stock in January 2002, when InterOil first said it discovered a major new oil system in Papua New Guinea, would be worth nearly $11.50 today. (By comparison, $1 invested in ExxonMobil would be worth $2.10.) During that time InterOil insiders, including Mr. Mulacek and Mr. Byker, have exercised stock options worth millions of dollars, and hedge funds have sold large blocks of shares to smaller, retail buyers, according to interviews with some of these large investors. 
 But none of InterOil's wells have ever produced any significant amounts of oil, according to securities filings. Almost all of its petroleum wells are now capped or dormant. InterOil remains dependent on buying crude from other Papua New Guinea oil explorers and foreign companies that it then refines. Mr. Byker said the company has always been forthright about its exploration activities, and has always been explicit in public statements that its business projections may be wrong. ''Those press releases were very carefully couched,'' Mr. Byker said. 
 InterOil's vice president for investor and public relations, Anesti Dermedgoglou, agreed. ''There is often a difference between expectations and results in life,'' he said. ''I can't help if investors get too excited. I don't control the stock price.''
 Mr. Byker added that throughout the company's history, InterOil insiders have held onto most of their stock, showing that they are as dedicated as the investors they approached. 
 The company has also always urged inside shareholders to be forthright about their purchases and sales of the company's stock, he said. 
 ''We're all pretty well committed,'' said Mr. Byker, who personally owns shares worth more than $8 million. Mr. Mulacek holds shares worth more than $25 million, according to securities filings. 
 But Mr. Byker acknowledges that the company's convoluted, labyrinthine ownership structure makes it difficult to know exactly who owns what at InterOil. For instance, a portion of InterOil's shares are owned by a series of different entities that Mr. Mulacek and his family partially own. There are also a number of other entities partially owned or affiliated with Mr. Mulacek or Mr. Byker that own InterOil stock. 
 ''The company grew up over a long period of time, and so there were a lot of different groups involved,'' Mr. Byker said. Although identified in filings as one of InterOil's largest shareholders, Mr. Byker said that ''there are lots of other people involved with this company who own more than I do.''
 ''But it's hard to tell who they are or who owns what,'' he added, ''because they work through limited partnerships and offshore companies.'' 
 Such explanations have not satisfied some short-sellers and analysts, such as Ira Zadikow at Great Eastern Securities in New York and Mr. Hodson of Sprott Asset Management, who say the company's complicated ownership structure is worrisome.
 InterOil has obtained millions of dollars in loans from Clarion Finanz AG, the investment firm of Carlo Civelli, a Swiss businessman who has worked with Mr. Mulacek since 1996 as an investor or adviser. Last year, InterOil announced that Clarion and Merrill Lynch had agreed to lend the company $130 million. Mr. Civelli has a long history as an investor in Canadian energy, mining and technology companies, where he often takes director posts. 
 In 1994, according to news reports, two inspectors working for the British government reviewing insider-trading allegations accused Mr. Civelli of improperly working with a broker to disguise stock sales of companies involved in takeover talks. The inspectors also examined financial transactions that they believed were ''akin to a money-laundering operation,'' according to the reports, for possible links to Mr. Civelli. Mr. Civelli was never charged with any crimes by the British government, and Vancouver Stock Exchange officials who reviewed the report decided not to pursue their own investigation.
 In an interview, Mr. Civelli said that he would have been criminally charged if there had been any real evidence of wrongdoing. ''They were interested in destroying my reputation,'' he said. ''They were not interested in the truth.''
 In a second, unrelated case earlier this year, Canadian securities regulators said Mr. Civelli had covertly helped another executive gain control of a publicly traded energy company after regulators had banned the executive from running any public companies. Mr. Civelli said the regulators' claims were false, and that he was simply helping to broker a stock deal. Canadian regulators have not charged Mr. Civelli with any wrongdoing in the matter.
 Merrill Lynch, which had a banking relationship with Enron and is now one of InterOil's major lenders, declined to discuss its relationship with Mr. Civelli or InterOil. For his part, Mr. Byker asserted that Mr. Civelli's problems had nothing to do with InterOil. ''He's been a very reliable and straightforward person in everything involving InterOil,'' he said.
 InterOil has had other entanglements with controversial figures. In 2004, Mr. Mulacek hired an investor relations executive named Carl Caserta, whom the Securities and Exchange Commission had barred from the securities industry almost two decades earlier, after he was accused of buying hundreds of thousands of stock shares for clients without their authorization. Mr. Caserta, who declined to speak on the record, stopped working for InterOil in 2005, according to his former employer, Lighthouse Capital Ltd. 
 Mr. Byker said the InterOil board was not aware of Mr. Caserta's history when he was retained. Mr. Dermedgoglou of InterOil said he was not aware that the firmhad hired Mr. Caserta.
 THE tangled corporate structure at InterOil, and the skein of financial and business relationships propping it up, might not have generated much attention if the company had not unfurled its November announcement about the Mississippi-sized natural-gas fields it had found in Papua New Guinea. The timing of the announcement was impeccable, arriving amid a global transformation in energy exploration.
 For years, foreign development of natural gas lagged behind the search for other resources like petroleum, because low natural-gas prices did not generate much interest. But earlier in this decade, energy prices began rising and natural-gas exploration became much more attractive. Previously discovered but undeveloped gas fields in Qatar, Nigeria, Indonesia, Algeria, Australia, Iran, Egypt and Trinidad and Tobago began drawing interest. Analysts at Cambridge Energy Research Associates forecast that production of liquefied natural gas, or L.N.G., will more than double by 2012.
 InterOil's blue-chip backers, all of whom declined to speak about the company, are betting that some of that enthusiasm will spill into Papua New Guinea. But if InterOil's gas find is to become a gold mine, someone needs to build a plant nearby that can convert natural gas into a liquid, so it can be easily transported. 
 While InterOil bought its refinery for just $10 million, L.N.G. plants are a tad more pricey: the cost of such facilities starts at about $4 billion.
 ''The name of the game is creating the infrastructure to bring reserves to market,'' said Michael Zenker at Cambridge Energy Research Associates. ''There's a tremendous appetite for L.N.G. projects, and companies and development banks are lining up. Where that money goes may have as much to do with hype and politics as economic logic.''
 Almost every country with untapped gas fields is racing to convince major energy companies, international lenders and third-world development organizations that its gas finds justify extraction. In November, when InterOil tentatively reported its discovery of 4 trillion to 11 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, the company also said it had lined up $130 million for pre-engineering work on a liquefied natural gas plant. But to win the energy race, it obviously will need to raise much more. 
 To that end, InterOil executives have enlisted Papua New Guinea's prime minister, Sir Michael Somare, and its energy minister, Sir Moi Avei, to convince investors and foreign governments that the nation deserves their help. At InterOil's urging, the country has changed its tax laws to make natural-gas investments more profitable. InterOil executives are circling the globe to pitch investors on the company's stock and a major new refinery project.
 Some independent engineers and analysts say InterOil's efforts may pay off.
 ''They've been very open with their data, and at first glance you can't help but be amazed,'' said Robb Moss, a geologist at Acumen Capital Finance Partners in Calgary, Alberta, who has reviewed InterOil's published findings. Acumen is not an investor in the company.
 ''But until you drill a lot of wells, you can't really measure anything,'' Mr. Moss added. ''It's almost impossible to accurately forecast anything at this stage.'' 
 Furthermore, analysts say, given the enormous amount of natural gas development occurring elsewhere, it is unclear if developing even a large discovery makes sense. InterOil critics note that Australia, a neighbor of Papua New Guinea, is already the fifth-largest producer of liquefied natural gas in the world, and is expected to more than double its production by 2015, according to the United States Department of Energy. Such concerns helped persuade a consortium of investors to pull out of plans to build a pipeline from Papua New Guinea to Australia in August.
 ''High gas prices have seduced investors into overlooking concerns,'' said Mr. Boland at Peters & Company. ''Energy is always cyclical, and the natural-gas market is particularly fickle.''
 If InterOil can convince investors to back an L.N.G. plant, the company is almost certain to profit from the gas fields, analysts say, because it will make the deposits cheaper to develop than fields in other countries. 
 To that end, Mr. Mulacek is working hard. A few years ago, he flew with a handful of Papua New Guinea ministers to Trinidad, a nation that won the natural-gas lottery when a plant was constructed there in the late 1990s. Today, the energy industry is one of Trinidad's largest employers.
 ''We're making our case to organizations like OPIC, who want to help impoverished countries, and to groups like Merrill Lynch and foreign investors, who are very interested,'' Mr. Byker said.
 If InterOil succeeds, the company's shares, which closed on Friday at $26.20, may climb. If executives fail, or the discovered gas reserves turn out to be too small to justify a pipeline or plant, the company may, like Enron, simply disappear.
 InterOil's executives are undaunted, and enthusiastic, about the challenges of striking it rich in Papua New Guinea.
 ''This is a beautiful island, filled with amazing jungles and rainforest, spectacular animals and birds that are like something out of storybooks,'' Mr. Byker said. ''It's like an unknown frontier. These areas need visionaries. That's how dreams become real.''

Generally, this means that it makes money by denying benefits of various kinds, especially prescriptions, to patients and employees, thus supposedly saving money for employers and keeping a big chunk of that money for itself. (I know this is an oversimplification, but it's basically true.) 
 Since roughly 1998, Caremark Rx's chief executive has been a wonderful, kindly gentleman named Edwin M. Crawford who revived the company and made it an industry leader. His son, Andrew, also works at the company as the senior vice president for industry analysis and underwriting.
Roughly one and a half years ago, the elder Mr. Crawford decided to talk to people about a business combination with Caremark. One of the first entities he talked to was the fine drugstore chain CVS, whose Watergate store in Washington is one of my own main hangouts. CVS said it was interested, but only if it acquired Caremark and CVS was the surviving entity. 
 Discussions went on, and Mr. Crawford made sure that as part of the deal, he would be chairman of the new company. Time passed, and serious backdating allegations involving hundreds of millions of dollars of Caremark stock options for Mr. Crawford and his colleagues surfaced; shareholders sued Caremark and Mr. Crawford in Nashville, where the company is based. 
 Last month, the Louisiana Municipal Police Employees' Retirement System also sued Caremark, in Delaware, accusing its officers of favoring themselves over shareholders when considering the CVS offer. 
 According to that suit, Mr. Crawford apparently made it clear that any company acquiring Caremark would have to indemnify him against such claims. CVS agreed to do so. Caremark's board was told that merger talks were going on, but CVS was not mentioned, nor was the board asked to approve specific terms early on. 
 By April 2006, Caremark's executives brought the board into the loop and mentioned CVS, according to the suit. Then, in September, Mr. Crawford told his board by telephone that he thought he might have reached a deal with CVS -- though the outline of the deal had apparently been set weeks before, the suit alleges. 
 In October, Medco Health Solutions asked to talk to Mr. Crawford about a deal, according to The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the situation. But the lawsuit says that when Mr. Crawford learned that he and his Caremark directors would not be part of the new company, he blew off the Medco people.
 In late October, Caremark's directors were briefed on the CVS deal, and were told that they would all, or almost all, be staying on as directors of the new company and that Mr. Crawford would remain chairman, even though the new company would be called CVS and CVS shareholders would own roughly 55 percent of it. 
 In addition, while senior Caremark executives and directors would keep their jobs, the transaction would trigger change-of-control provisions that would shower them with money as if they were all thrown out of work.
 The deal was approved by the board at the beginning of November and immediately made public. The deal involved CVS paying no premium at all to ordinary Caremark shareholders, but it did call for paying Mr. Crawford more than $50 million, giving his son a major job at CVS and providing him with that indemnity he wanted in the backdating lawsuit.
 The Caremark owners were originally to get roughly $48.50 a share in CVS stock. (Amid the outcry, CVS last week added a $2-a-share special dividend in cash to be paid after its takeover closes, if it does.) The $48.50 offer came despite two fascinating facts: a month before, Caremark stock traded at $59, and in the third quarter of 2006, Caremark bought back 1.8 million shares of its stock at an average price of about $57 -- usually a sign that management thinks it's a good price. It closed on Friday at $59.31, still well above even the revised CVS offer, suggesting investors think Caremark is worth more and that someone is likely to offer more.
 The agreement had a ''breakup fee'' of $675 million, to be paid to CVS if the deal did not go through. The deal also had a ''no shop'' clause preventing Caremark from actively seeking higher offers, although it could consider better offers that arrived unsolicited.
 Wall Street hated the deal. TheStreet.com labeled it as No. 1 of the ''Five Dumbest Things on Wall Street This Week.'' Analysts were puzzled by the low price, and particularly that CVS would pay no premium for controlling the combined company. 
 Shortly after the CVS deal was announced, another benefits manager, Express Scripts, made a hugely better offer: $26 billion, compared with CVS's original offer of roughly $21 billion. That was 23 percent more for the shareholders, but Caremark's board turned it down flat. 
 Even allowing for a dip in Express Scripts' cash-and-stock offer to $25 billion, it still beats even CVS's recently increased offer. But the Caremark board cares not, and the CVS deal is barreling toward completion.
 This is still a developing story, though. The market has worked to raise the Caremark price even with the Caremark board fighting it. It's interesting to think how much Caremark could have gotten if it really worked toward a higher price for its shareholders.
 It's almost unbelievable. How could Caremark's directors have planned to sell the company for virtually no premium when their duty is to maximize returns for holders in every situation? How can they allow management to accept a generous payout from CVS while effectively selling out the ordinary stockholders?
 Why did the Caremark board not require management to sell the company to the highest bidder, as required by case law in Delaware, where the company is incorporated? How can the board permit CVS to get that staggering $675 million breakup fee when CVS has spent at most a few million on legal and banking fees so far? 
 HOW can Caremark's management sign any deal-blocking clauses at all -- breakup fees or no-shop pledges -- when their duty is not to stop bidders but to encourage bidders?
 I called Caremark's representatives. They confidently said that Delaware law about companies ''in play'' does not apply to this deal because it is a ''merger of equals'' and Caremark is not ''in play'' even though CVS is basically taking over Caremark. (CVS will own 55 percent of the combined company, and its C.E.O. will run it.) The Caremark representatives stressed that the company was seeking the best deal for shareholders and said there was nothing unusual about breakup fees.
 As I see it, this is a deal in which managers -- the hired help -- apparently put themselves totally ahead of the stockholders. Managers will come out like kings; the stockholders will come out like pound animals.
 The case is going to court in Delaware. A court of chancery can stop this embarrassment, with language guaranteeing stockholders' rights. Or it can be business as usual. We know what Mr. Crawford expects.

HEADLINE: Tech Shares Fall as Earnings Disappoint 

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
Technology earnings reports that failed to meet Wall Street's expectations pulled down the Nasdaq composite index last week, but the Dow Jones industrial average managed a small gain. 
 A warning by the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke -- that looming Social Security and Medicare deficits would burden the economy for years to come if they were not addressed -- pulled down the markets on Thursday. His comments came at a Senate hearing.
On top of that, Wall Street was disappointed by technology earnings reports, including those of bellwethers like Apple, Intel and I.B.M. Apple's shares fell 7.7 percent for the week, among the worst performances in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Among the Dow industrials, I.B.M.'s drop of 2.5 percent and Intel's decline of 5 percent were among the worst for the week.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 9.45 points, or 0.08 percent, to close at 12,565.53. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 0.23 point, or 0.02 percent, to close at 1,430.50. The Nasdaq composite index fell 51.51 points, or 2.1 percent, to close at 2,451.31. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 4.78 percent from 4.77 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:

THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS: The Revolutionary Decade That Gave the World Impressionism, by Ross King. (Walker & Company, $16.95.) This is a spirited account of the battle between France's officially sanctioned history painters and the upstarts contemptuously dismissed as Impressionists -- embodied, for King, in the opposing fortunes of Ernest Meissonier and Edouard Manet. King, author of ''Brunelleschi's Dome'' and ''Michelangelo and the Pope's Ceiling,'' colorfully describes the controversy that raged around the annual Paris Salons (juried exhibitions) of the 1860s and '70s, and the impact of historic events on cultural politics. King ''tells a well-known story, but one seldom recounted in such vivid detail, or with such a novelistic sense of plot and character,'' Diane Johnson wrote here. 


LOVE AND OTHER IMPOSSIBLE PURSUITS, by Ayelet Waldman. (Anchor, $13.95.) Motherhood is far from sacred in this darkly funny novel about a woman who falls desperately in love with a married man but can't muster much affection for his precocious 5-year-old son. In the Book Review, Chelsea Cain called ''Love and Other Impossible Pursuits'' a ''bravely contrary'' novel: ''it actually says something new and interesting about women, families and love.''

THE PLACE YOU LOVE IS GONE: Progress Hits Home, by Melissa Holbrook Pierson. (Norton, $14.95.) Part memoir, part social history, this book mourns vanishing public and personal spaces as well as other environmental costs of rapid development and overpopulation. Pierson catalogs the changes that growth has wrought on three places she has called home: Akron, Ohio; Hoboken, N.J.; and Kingston, N.Y. Our reviewer, Anthony Swofford, called this a ''strange and lovely book, quirky, smart and defiant.''

ELIA KAZAN: A Biography, by Richard Schickel. (Harper Perennial, $16.95.) This life story of Elia Kazan (1909-2003) traces the distinguished stage and screen director's rise from a fledgling actor to his creative pinnacle presenting Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller on Broadway and directing films like ''On the Waterfront.'' Schickel -- a documentary filmmaker and movie critic who participated in the 1999 presentation of an honorary Academy Award to Kazan -- also analyzes the significance of Kazan's 1952 testimony before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. ''No mere page turner, this is a page devourer,'' John Simon wrote here, ''generating the kind of suspense that is usually the province of the playwright or novelist.''

PASSAROLA RISING, by Azhar Abidi. (Penguin, $13.) In Abidi's colorful picaresque fantasy, two brothers in 18th-century Portugal invent an airship -- four large copper spheres attached to a deck -- and visit Voltaire, Louis XV and the North Pole. Our reviewer, Alexander McCall Smith, called Abidi's descriptions of their flight ''beautifully realized.''

WORLD AS LABORATORY: Experiments With Mice, Mazes, and Men, by Rebecca Lemov. (Hill & Wang, $16.) An absorbing history of human engineering, ''World as Laboratory'' describes a long train of practical, absurd and dangerous 20th-century experiments -- financed and endorsed by the most prestigious institutions of the day -- and the scientists who organized them. In THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH: Alan Turing and the Invention of the Computer (Atlas/Norton, $13.95), David Leavitt tells the story of the tragic genius who revolutionized mathematics, helped the British crack secret Nazi codes and died after biting into a poisoned apple.

THE LAST OF HER KIND, by Sigrid Nunez. (Picador, $14.) Countercultural America in the 1960s and '70s, and its repercussions, are relived in this powerful novel about the divergent fates of two college roommates. Georgette George, the oldest daughter in a large working-class family, and Ann Drayton, a Connecticut heiress and future campus radical, meet at Barnard in 1968. Nunez, herself a 1972 Barnard graduate, follows the two women beyond their college years -- through jobs, marriages and their faltering friendship -- as Ann becomes the central figure in a murder case that draws national attention. ''Nunez's keen powers of observation make her a natural chronicler,'' Megan Marshall wrote in the Book Review.

THE WAL-MART EFFECT: How the World's Most Powerful Company Really Works -- and How It's Transforming the American Economy, by Charles Fishman. (Penguin, $15.) Fishman places the world's leading retailer in the larger context of globalization, and reveals a company driven to deliver low prices but unable to comprehend what he calls the ''troubling elements of the Wal-Mart effect: low wages, unrelenting pressure on suppliers, products cheap in quality as well as price, offshoring of jobs.''

HEADLINE: The Socialist Senator

BYLINE: By Mark Leibovich. 
Mark Leibovich is a reporter in the Washington bureau of The Times. This is his first article for the magazine.

 BODY:
When Bernie Sanders visits a high-school class, as he does regularly, students don't hear a speech, a focus-grouped polemic, a campaign pitch or, heaven forbid, practiced one-liners. Nor, in all likelihood, do they hear Sanders tell stories about his family, childhood or some hardship he has endured. He makes no great effort to ''connect'' emotionally in the manner that politicians strive for these days, and he probably doesn't ''feel your pain'' either, or at least make a point of saying so. It's not that Sanders is against connecting, or feeling your pain, but the process seems needlessly passive and unproductive, and he prefers a more dynamic level of engagement.
''I urge you all to argue with your teachers, argue with your parents,'' Sanders told a group of about 60 students at South Burlington High School -- generally liberal, affluent and collegebound -- one afternoon in mid-December. 
 The newly elected senator whipped his head forward with a force that shifted his free-for-all frizz of white hair over his forehead. (Journalistic convention in Vermont mandates that every Sanders story remark on his unruly hair as early on as possible. It also stipulates that every piece of his clothing be described as ''rumpled.'') 
 ''C'mon, I'm not seeing enough hands in here,'' he said.
 A senior named Marissa Meredyth raised hers, and Sanders flicked his index finger at her as if he were shooting a rubber band. She bemoaned recent cuts to college financial-aid programs. 
 Sanders bemoans these, too, but he'd rather provoke. 
 ''How we going to pay for this financial aid?'' Sanders asked. ''Who in here wants us to raise taxes on your parents to pay for this?''
 Not many, based on the show of hands.
 ''O.K., so much for financial aid,'' Sanders said, shrugging.
 Next topic: ''How many of you think it was a good idea to give the president the authority to go to war in Iraq?'' 
 No hands. 
 ''C'mon, anyone?'' 
 He paused, paced, hungry for dissent, a morsel before lunch. Sanders says he thinks Iraq was a terrible idea, too, but he seemed to crave a jolt to the anesthetizing hum of consensus in the room. 
 ''Iraq is a huge and very complicated issue,'' Sanders said, finally. (''Huge'' is Sanders favorite word, which he pronounces ''yooge,'' befitting a thick Brooklyn accent unsmoothed-over by 38 years in Vermont.) He mentioned that Vermont has had more casualties in Iraq per capita than any other state in the union, including one from South Burlington High School. 
 ''O.K., last call for an Iraq supporter,'' he said. Going once, going twice.
 By this point, Sanders's cheeks had turned a shade of dark pink with a strange hint of orange. It's a notable Sanders trait; his face seems to change color with the tenor of a conversation, like a mood ring. His complexion goes orangey-pink when he's impatient (often when someone else is speaking), purpley-pink when he's making a point or a softer shade of pink when at rest, ''rest'' being a relative term. 
 Next question from Sanders: ''Should people in this country who want to go to college be able to go, regardless of income?'' 
 Wall-to-wall hands, with the exception of one belonging to Andy Gower, a senior in a backward baseball cap who recently moved up from North Carolina. Relatively conservative, Andy is a conspicuous outlier in the class. Bernie knows how he feels, having spent eight terms as the lone Socialist in Congress, and the first to serve in the House since the 1920s.
 ''Why do you think that?'' Sanders asked Andy. 
 He replied with a question of his own: ''Why should people who can afford to go to college pay for people who can't?'' He was sheepish at first but gained momentum. ''Why should people who are successful in this society be burdened by people who aren't? It's just a fact of life. Some people will succeed, and some people won't. And it's just the way it's going to be and has always been.''
 A few classmates smirked, shook their heads. But Sanders was suddenly buoyant. He stomped forward, clapped twice -- provocation achieved. 
 Hands were shooting up everywhere, and Sanders contorted his mouth into a goofy grin. 
 ''At the end of the day, democracy is a tough process,'' Sanders said finally, arms restored to their flailing default positions. 
 ''The discussion we've had in here is at a higher level than what we often have on the floor of the United States Congress,'' Sanders gushed, for as much as he ever gushes, which is not much. 
 And given some of the things Sanders has said about the United States Congress, maybe this wasn't such a gush after all.
 Sanders has always been an easier fit in Vermont than in Washington. Being a Socialist in the seat of two-party orthodoxy will do that. While he has generally championed liberal Democratic positions over the years -- and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee endorsed his Senate campaign -- Sanders has strenuously resisted calling himself a Democrat. And he has clung to a mantle -- socialism -- that brings considerable stigma, in large part for its association with authoritarian communist regimes (which Sanders is quick to disavow). 
 But he does little to airbrush the red ''S'' from his political profile. On the wall of his Congressional office hangs a portrait of Eugene V. Debs, the Socialist Party presidential candidate of the early 20th century. A poster in a conference room marks Burlington's sister-city relationship with Puerto Cabeza, Nicaragua -- one of a few such alliances he forged with cities in Marxist states during his 10-year stint as mayor of Vermont's biggest city in the 1980s.
 Socialism brings Sanders instant novelty in Washington and, in many circles, instant dismissal as a freak. But Sanders's outcast status in Washington probably owes as much to his jackhammer style as to any stubborn ideology. It is a town filled with student body president types -- and Sanders, for his part, finished a distant third when he ran to be president of his class at James Madison High School in Brooklyn. 
 Few would describe Sanders's personality as ''winning'' in the classic politician's sense. He appears to burn a disproportionate number of calories smiling and making eye contact. ''Bernie is not going to win a lot of 'whom would you rather live on a desert island with' contests,'' says Garrison Nelson, a professor of political science at the University of Vermont. No matter. Sanders's agitating style in Washington also constitutes a basic facet of anticharm, antipolitician appeal at home.
 ''I'm not afraid of being called a troublemaker,'' Sanders says, something he's been called many times, in many different ways, many of them unprintable. ''But you have to be smart. And being smart means not creating needless enemies for yourself.''
 In this regard, Sanders has not always been smart, especially when he was first elected to the House in 1990. He called Congress ''impotent'' and dismissed the two major parties as indistinguishable tools of the wealthy. He said it wouldn't bother him if 80 percent of his colleagues lost re-election -- not the best way to win friends in a new workplace.
 ''Bernie alienates his natural allies,'' Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat, said at the time. ''His holier-than-thou attitude -- saying in a very loud voice he is smarter than everyone else and purer than everyone else -- really undercuts his effectiveness.'' The late Joe Moakley, another Massachusetts Democrat, waxed almost poetic in his derision for Sanders. ''He is out there wailing on his own,'' Moakley said. ''He screams and hollers, but he is all alone.''
 Frank says he came to like and work well with Sanders, with whom he served on the House Financial Services Committee. His early objections were over Sanders's railing against both parties as if they were the same. ''I think when he first got here, Bernie underestimated the degree that Republicans had moved to the right,'' Frank told me. ''I get sick of people saying 'a curse on both your houses.' When you point out to them that you agree with them on most things, they'll say, 'Yeah, well, I hold my friends up to a higher standard.' Well, O.K., but remember that we're your friends.''
 Among his House colleagues, ''Bernie's not a bad guy,'' is something I heard a lot of. ''You appreciate Bernie the more you see him in action,'' says Senator Chuck Schumer, the head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, who served with him for several years in the House. A fellow Brooklynite who is nine years younger, Schumer attended the same elementary school as Sanders (P.S. 197) and the same high school (James Madison, which also graduated a third United States senator, Norm Coleman, Republican of Minnesota). ''Bernie does tend to grow on people, whether it's in the House or in Vermont,'' Schumer says.
 But he has clearly grown bigger in Vermont, and more seamlessly. ''His bumper stickers just say, 'Bernie,' '' says Senator Patrick Leahy, Vermont's senior Senator and a Democrat. ''You have to reach a certain exulted status in politics to be referred to only by your first name.'' 
 Sanders is particularly beloved in Burlington, which elected the recovering fringe candidate as its mayor despite the Reagan landslide of 1980 -- thus christening the so-called ''People's Republic of Burlington.'' Some supporters called themselves ''Sanderistas.''
 His election to the Senate in November came at the expense of a too-perfect Bernie foil -- Richard Tarrant, a well-barbered, Bentley-driving Republican businessman who spent $7 million of his own money so he could lose by 33 percentage points. 
 ''Congratulations, Bernie,'' a fan yells to Sanders outside his district office in Burlington. Sanders was out for a quick bagel on a balmy December morning, temperatures in the 60s -- another day of Al Gore weather in the once-frozen north. He walked head down but kept getting stopped. ''Now you gotta run for president, please,'' the congratulator added, something Sanders gets a lot of too.
 It is a reception that any natural, eager-to-please politician would relish -- and accordingly, Sanders dispatches these glad-handing chores with the visible joy of someone cleaning a litter box, coughing out his obligatory thank yous and continuing on his way. 
 Sanders's popularity in Vermont brings up the obvious questions: to what degree is he a quaint totem of the state, like the hermit thrush (the state bird), and could a Socialist be elected to the Senate anywhere else? 
 In recent years, Vermont has joined -- perhaps surpassed -- states like Massachusetts and New York in the top tier of liberal outposts. Several distinctions nurture the state's credentials: It was the first place to legalize civil unions for same-sex partners; it is the home of Phish, the countercultural rock-folk band and contemporary analog to the Grateful Dead and of Ben and Jerry's ice cream (and its peacenik-themed flavors); and it is host to cultural quirks and ordinances like not allowing billboards, being the last state to get a Wal-Mart.
 The state has also incubated several politicians who have achieved national boogie-man status among Republicans. They include Leahy, the Grateful Dead fan and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee; former Senator James Jeffords, the liberal Republican who became an Independent in 2001, giving Democrats a temporary majority; and Howard Dean, the former governor whose presidential campaign boom (and perhaps fizzle) was tied heavily to his association with Vermont's progressive politics. 
 Sanders fits snugly into this maverick's pantheon. But Leahy says his fellow senator appeals to an antiestablishment strain in Vermont that is not necessary liberal. Leahy notes that he himself is the only Democrat the state's voters have ever elected to the Senate. Before 1992, only one Democratic presidential candidate carried Vermont -- Lyndon Johnson in 1964. 
 ''A lot of the lower-income parts of our state are Republican,'' Leahy says, adding that many of them are populated by rural libertarians who are greatly suspicious of government intrusion into individual rights. ''I saw Bernie signs all over those parts of the state.'' 
 Sanders opposes some federal gun-control laws, which has helped him in a state where ''you grow up believing it is legal to shoot deer on the statehouse lawn in Montpelier,'' says Luke Albee, a South Burlington native who was Leahy's House chief of staff.
 But again: Could Sanders be elected to the Senate anywhere else?
 No, not as a Socialist, Schumer says. ''Even in New York State it would be hard.''
 Massachusetts? ''Maybe this year he could,'' Frank says, meaning 2006. ''But if he were running in any other state, he probably would have to comb his hair.''
 Leahy says that just any Socialist probably couldn't get elected in Vermont, either. But Sanders has made himself known in a state small enough -- physically and in terms of population -- for someone, particularly a tireless someone, to insinuate himself into neighborly dialogues and build a following that skirts ideological pigeonholes. Indeed, there are no shortages of war veterans or struggling farmers in Vermont who would seemingly have no use for a humorless aging hippie peacenik Socialist from Brooklyn, except that Sanders has dealt with many of them personally, and it's a good bet his office has helped them procure some government benefit.
 ''People have gotten to know him as Bernie,'' Leahy says. ''Not as the Socialist.''
 Sanders calls himself as a ''democratic Socialist.'' When I asked him what this meant, as a practical matter, in capitalist America circa 2007, he did what he often does: he donned his rhetorical Viking's helmet and waxed lovingly about the Socialist governments of Scandinavia. He mentioned that Scandinavian countries have nearly wiped out poverty in children -- as opposed to the United States, where 18 to 20 percent of kids live in poverty. The Finnish government provides free day care to all children; Norwegian workers get 42 weeks of maternity leave at full pay. 
 But would Americans ever accept the kinds of taxes that finance the Scandinavian welfare state? And would Sanders himself trade in the United States government for the Finnish one? He is curiously, frustratingly non-responsive to questions like this. ''I think there is a great deal we can learn from Scandinavia,'' he said after a long pause. And then he returns to railing about economic justice and the rising gap between rich and poor, things he speaks of with a sense of outrage that always seems freshly summoned. 
 Sanders crinkles his face whenever a conversation veers too long from this kind of ''important stuff'' and into the ''silly stuff,'' like clothes and style. ''I do not like personality profiles,'' Sanders told me during our first conversation. He trumpets a familiar rant against the media, its emphasis on gaffes, polls and trivial details.
 ''If I walked up on a stage and fell down, that would be the top story,'' Sanders says. ''You wouldn't hear anything about the growing gap between rich and poor.''
 When I first met Sanders in person on Church Street, there were big streaks of dried mud on his shoes and dried blood on his neck from what looked to be a shaving mishap. His hair flew every which way in a gust of wind. At six feet tall, he is wiry, but he walks with shoulders hunched and elbows out, like a big, skulking bird. From a distance, he looked as if he could be homeless.
 Closer in, the overwhelming impression made by Sanders is that of an acute worrier. He evinces the wearied default manner of a longtime insomniac, eyes weather-beaten with big lines and a perpetual slight cringe. His brow appears close to collapse beneath the weight of an invisible sandbag.
 Richard Sugarman, a professor of religion at the University of Vermont and a longtime friend, recalls that during Sanders's days as mayor, constituents would sometimes call him at his listed home phone number in the middle of the night. ''Someone would call at 3 a.m. and say, 'Hey Bernie, someone just threw a brick through my window, what should I do?' He was as hands on as anyone. ... Does he have an off-mode? Not really.'' 
 Luke Albee, Leahy's former chief of staff, says: ''He has no hobbies. He works. He doesn't take time off. Bernie doesn't even eat lunch. The idea of building a fire and reading a book and going on vacation, that's not something he does.''
 As much as anything, this distills why Sanders has been an awkward fit in the chummy realm of Capitol Hill. He is no pleaser or jokester by anyone's prototype. I don't recall Sanders laughing more than two or three times in the 48 hours I spent with him in Vermont. His one memorably funny aside came when I asked if his Congressional office had a dress code. 
 ''Yes,'' he said. ''You can't come in if you're totally nude,'' he said. He instituted the rule, he said, when his outreach director, Phil Fiermonte, who is now sitting next to him, came to work naked. 
 ''Totally nude,'' Sanders said. ''On three occasions.'' 
 He was kidding, presumably.
 Riding in the passenger seat of Fiermonte's car, Sanders was shouting into a brick-size cellphone, the likes of which were all the rage in the 1990s. He was talking to a staff person who was about to meet with someone from the office of Senator Edward Kennedy, chairman of Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, one of five committees that Sanders will sit on. Sanders voice filled the car.
 ''Dental care is yooge,'' Sanders boomed into the phone. This has been a leitmotif of my visit -- Sanders's crusade to improve dental health among Vermont's rural poor. He views this as an employment and economic issue. ''How many employers are going to hire someone who doesn't have teeth?'' he asks. ''You go around this state, and you will find a lot of people with no teeth. It is their badge of poverty.''
 Improving dental care for the poor is a classic Sanders issue: unsexy and given to practical solutions and his obsessive attention. Sanders sees bad dental care among the poor as a ''pothole issue'' in Vermont, meaning it is pervasive and something that government should be active in fixing (like potholes). Teeth are tangible, especially when they hurt.
 Sanders's car pulled into the parking lot of H.O. Wheeler Elementary School in North Burlington, where he was visiting a drop-by dental clinic. The notion of ''school-based dental care'' excites Sanders immensely, and his gait speeds as he enters the school, past the main office, a classroom and several school officials he has come to know over multiple visits. 
 ''If you're a kid, and you're having dental pain, you're not going to be learning a lot,'' said Joseph Arioli, of Burlington's Community Health Center and one of a half-dozen program administrators -- including a dentist in scrubs -- convened around a dentist chair. 
 The clinic provides free access to dental care for kids at high risk of neglecting their teeth. Students are typically seen during the school day, which means they miss minimal class time and their parents don't have to leave work to take them. Betsy Liley, a grant writer for the city, says that many households in Vermont own just one toothbrush. 
 ''Lemme guess, a lot of the dietary habits you see here are not great,'' Sanders said. Nods all around. He said he'd do his best to secure more financing and vowed to return. And he told Liley that he might bring her to Washington to testify before a Senate committee. 
 Walking out, Sanders didn't bother with goodbye -- just as he didn't with hello -- only a thank you and a ''what you're doing here is yooge'' over his shoulder.
 ''Great program,'' Sanders said in the car. He likes to check in whenever possible. That's essentially what I did with Sanders in Vermont: check in, with programs that he's been involved with or wants to learn more about. He likes to hit lots of meetings, quick, businesslike transactions.
 Only once in six discussions I sat in on did Sanders indulge in a personal anecdote. He was in his office talking to Sharon Moffat, Vermont's acting commissioner of health, and the topic turned to dental care. 
 ''I have a personal story to tell you,'' Sanders said, and my ears perked up as I fantasized of learning the ''Rosebud'' episode that might explain Bernie's interest in teeth.
 ''I was in the House cloakroom about five years ago,'' Sanders said. ''And I was thirsty. I took a drink of grape juice. Blawww.'' 
 He scrunched up his face. 
 ''It was awful, awful. Then I looked at the label. The amount of junk they put in there is unbelievable.'' 
 Moffat nodded.
 ''Anyway, I no longer drink that stuff,'' Sanders said.
 Sanders's parents were Jewish immigrants from Poland. His father, Eli, a struggling paint salesman who saw his family wiped out in the Holocaust, worried constantly about supporting his wife and two sons. His mother, Dorothy, dreamed of living in a ''private home,'' but they never made it beyond their three-and-a-half-room apartment on East 26th and Kings Highway. She died at age 46, when Bernie was 19. ''Sensitivity to class was imbedded in me then quite deeply,'' Sanders told me.
 Sanders spent a year at Brooklyn College before transferring to the University of Chicago, where he studied psychology and helped lead protests against racially segregated housing on campus. He spent time on a kibbutz in Israel after graduation and then moved to Vermont with his first wife. ''I had always been captivated by rural life,'' he says. As a child, Sanders attended Boy Scout camp upstate and used to cry on the bus as it returned him to New York at the end of the summer. 
 In Vermont, Sanders worked many jobs for meager sums -- as a freelance writer, filmmaker, carpenter and researcher, among other things. (Sanders has one son, Levi, and three stepchildren from his marriage to his second wife, Jane O'Meara Driscoll, the president of a small college in Burlington whom he met at a party on the night of his first mayoral victory.) 
 Politics came to dominate Sanders's life. He was an early member of Vermont's Liberty Union party, an offshoot of the antiwar movement in Vermont. He ran as the party's nominee for the Senate in a special election in 1971 and finished with 2 percent of the vote. The following year, he ran for governor and received 1 percent. He would run two more times for statewide office that decade as a third-party candidate and never come close.
 That changed when he ran for mayor of Burlington in 1980, at Sugarman's urging. Sugarman studied the race and believed Sanders could win, if few others did. Sanders knocked on doors all over the city, campaigned day and night and beat a six-term Democratic incumbent by 12 votes.
 ''People generally assumed this was a fluke and that he would be gone in two years,'' said Peter Clavelle, a friend who succeeded Sanders as mayor. 
 Sanders spoke out against poverty in the third world and made good-will visits to the Soviet Union and Cuba, among other places that U.S. mayors generally didn't travel to during that time. But a funny thing happened on the way to what many had dismissed as a short-running circus. Sanders undertook ambitious downtown revitalization projects and courted evil capitalist entities known as ''businesses.'' He balanced budgets. His administration sued the local cable franchise and won reduced rates for customers. He drew a minor-league baseball team to town, the Vermont Reds (named for the Cincinnatis, not the Commies).
 Sanders's appeal in Vermont's biggest city blended the ''think globally'' sensibility of a liberal college town with the ''act locally'' practicality of a hands-on mayor. He offered sister-city relations with the Sandinistas and efficient snowplowing for the People's Republic of Burlington. Before Sanders's mayoral victory, Leahy says, it was easy not to take him seriously. ''Then he got over that barrier, and got elected. He fixed the streets, filled the potholes, worked with the business community. He did what serious leaders do.'' He was re-elected three times.
 In a sense, Sanders's stint as mayor become a template for his subsequent successes -- and limitations -- as a national officeholder. In the House, he gained great publicity and favor as an audacious critic with a geopolitical purview, but ultimately left his biggest mark with small-bore diligence to the local realpolitik. 
 I was reminded of this when I asked Sanders in early January what his immediate legislative goals would be in the Senate. He listed these broad-brush priorities: 1) ending the Iraq war; 2) reversing the ''rapid decline of the middle class'' (a corollary to ''addressing the gap between rich and poor''); 3) reordering priorities in the federal budget; and 4) enacting environmental laws to thwart global warming. When I asked how he would translate any of his priorities into concrete legislation, he nodded sheepishly and said, ''I'm in the process of trying to figure that out now.'' It is an unsatisfying response somewhat reminiscent of Sanders's all-purpose invocations of Scandinavia whenever he's pressed on how his socialist philosophy can be applied to the two-party system he exists in.
 As a general rule, Sanders is much more convincing at proffering outrage than solutions. He can do this in Vermont, in part, because he is an entrenched political brand -- ''Bernie'' -- and voters will forgive a little blowhardedness (if not demagoguery) from someone they basically agree with and who has grown utterly familiar to their landscape, like cows. Sanders can also pull this off because, as he did in the mayor's office, he has buttressed his bomb-throwing with rock-solid attention to the pothole matters of dental clinics, veterans' benefits, farm subsidies, the kind of things an attentive politician operating in a tiny state (with a population of just 620,000) can fashion a formidable political base from.
 After three terms as mayor, Sanders ran for Vermont's at-large House seat in 1988 as an Independent and lost by a small margin to Peter Smith, the Republican former lieutenant governor. He won a rematch in 1990.
 ''When I came into the House, no one knew what to do with me,'' Sanders says. ''I was the only representative from Vermont, so I had no one to help me. And I was the only Independent, so no one knew where to put me in terms of committee.'' 
 Sanders was known as something of a pragmatic gadfly in the House. His grillings of former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan became a running burlesque, much awaited by many Hill and Federal Reserve watchers whenever Greenspan appeared before the House Financial Services Committee. (''Do you give one whit of concern for the middle class and working families of this country?'' Sanders asked Greenspan in one representative exchange.) 
 Sanders was not without his legislative triumphs. He was adept at working with people with whom he otherwise disagreed sharply -- forging alliances with conservatives like Representative Ron Paul, Republican of Texas and a well-known libertarian, with whom he shared a common hostility to the U.S.A. Patriot Act. In what might have been Sanders's signature triumph of recent years, he was instrumental in striking a provision from the Patriot Act that would have required librarians to release data on what their patrons were reading. 
 But in keeping with his pragmatic gadfly's approach, Sanders was far more accomplished at filing amendments to House bills than actually writing and producing legislation of his own. He was also gifted at drawing attention to his issues and (just as important) to himself. He was the first congressman to lead a bus trip to Canada to help seniors buy cheaper prescription drugs. 
 As he makes the transition to his new job, Sanders says his former House colleagues have teased him about not becoming ''like the rest of them'' in the Senate. Sanders jokes about this, as much as he jokes about anything. He says he will be required to enter a machine that zaps his brain and transforms him ''into a member in good standing in the House of Lords.''
 ''We're talking about a completely different animal here,'' Sanders says. The House fosters a more hospitable habitat for the audacious and eccentric; their ranks tend to be camouflaged by its larger numbers, curtailed by strict time limits on floor speeches and reined in by the outsize power of the House leadership. Senators can speak for as long as they want and single-handedly buck the wishes of 99 other senators by placing ''holds'' on bills and nominations. Tradition dictates that senators exercise such privileges sparingly.
 ''There will be times when he causes the Democratic leadership some agita,'' Schumer predicts. ''But knowing him, I think he's smart enough not to make any gratuitous enemies. He might make enemies, but they won't be gratuitous enemies.''
 Sanders told me, ''You have to ask yourself, Did the people send me here to give long speeches, or did they send me here to get things done?''
 By ''you'' Sanders means himself, as his sleepless Socialist adventure proceeds into the House of Lords. 
 On a quiet morning in mid-December, Sanders was sitting in his new office in the basement of a Senate office building -- it is a temporary office he will inhabit before he moves to another temporary office that he will occupy until a permanent space opens up, probably around March. It's all very exasperating, he said, this office-space situation. But he asked that I keep the specifics of his exasperation out of the article. He is trying to meet a stepped-up standard of tact and decorum in his new home. 
 ''Why can't we get these phone calls forwarded from the House office?'' Sanders asked a staff person who is working temporarily at a temporary reception desk in the temporary-temporary office. Everything seems temporary, but not as temporary as before. Sanders has a six-year term now instead of a two-year one. Friends have advised him to pace himself, curb his impatience. He would seem ill wired for this, but he is trying. He even took a four-day vacation last month -- and to Palm Springs. 
 But now he has work to do, beginning with getting to know his colleagues. ''Personal relationships are very important in the Senate,'' he told me. He likes the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, a lot, appreciates that he gave him the committee assignments that he wanted -- Health, Education, Labor and Pensions; the Environment and Public Works; Veterans' Affairs; Energy and Natural Resources; and the Budget. And wouldn't you know, Reid has an interest in dental care, too. He grew up dirt poor in Nevada, and his mother had no teeth. The first thing Reid did when he got his first job -- at a gas station -- was buy her a new set. So the Senate's leading Democrat gets the importance of dental care, which could help save teeth in Vermont.
 ''Let's go somewhere else to talk,'' Sanders said, as we headed out the door of his temporary-temporary office. ''We can get some coffee.''
 We traversed a maze of hallways that lead into a Senate dining room. ''Can we sit down in here?'' he asked a busperson. Yes, but then Sanders looked at a bunch of tables covered in white linen table clothes, not what he had in mind. 
 We walked upstairs, in search of a quiet place in the new neighborhood, on the Senate side. He kept navigating short hallways and turning back. An elevator opened in front of Sanders. It said ''Senators Only.'' The attendant invited him on, but he hesitated, turned away and began looking for another route to wherever he was going.
 Sanders zigzags the Capitol this way barely recognized, or acknowledged (or congratulated, or urged to run for president). A few people stare at the new senator as he walks by -- maybe because he looks lost, or famous, or maybe just because he looks like a strange bird out of Vermont.

THE RACE BEAT
 The Press, the Civil Rights Struggle, and the Awakening of a Nation.
 By Gene Roberts and 
 Hank Klibanoff.
 Illustrated. 518 pp. 
 Alfred A. Knopf. $30.
Historians of the civil rights era have long recognized the impact of the press on the character and pace of the movement. From William Bradford Huie's graphic 1955 interview with the unrepentant killers of Emmett Till to the televised images of Bull Connor's attack dogs snapping at young demonstrators in the streets of Birmingham to the eyewitness accounts of the beatings of voting rights marchers in Selma, Ala., the power of the pen and the camera has been memorable. Until now, however, no one has offered an in-depth analysis of how and why the news media came to play such an important role in the struggle for racial justice. 
 In ''The Race Beat,'' the veteran journalists Gene Roberts and Hank Klibanoff painstakingly trace the evolution of civil rights press coverage in the South from the publication of ''An American Dilemma,'' by Gunnar Myrdal, in 1944 to the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. Myrdal, an economist and a Swede, was no journalist. But he was probably the first observer, the authors say, to argue that ''the future of race relations ... rested largely in the hands of the American press.'' The best antidote to racial prejudice and discrimination, Myrdal believed, was the dissemination of accurate information. ''There is no doubt,'' he wrote, ''that a great majority of white people in America would be prepared to give the Negro a substantially better deal if they knew the facts.'' 
 At the time, as Roberts and Klibanoff point out, ''the black press was at the center of a developing Negro protest in the United States. But if the protest were to succeed, the mainstream press -- the white press -- would have to discover racial discrimination and write about it so candidly and so repeatedly that white Americans outside the South could no longer look the other way. Then they would see segregation, white supremacy and black disfranchisement as being at odds with the American conscience ... and demand change.'' 
 Roberts, a former managing editor of The New York Times, and Klibanoff, the managing editor for news at The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, demonstrate how this hopeful equation became a reality in the two decades after World War II. The mainstream press was slow to grasp the significance of the civil rights story; as late as 1955, the New York Times reporter John Popham, who had been covering the South since 1947, ''remained the only correspondent assigned to the region for a national newspaper.'' But with the landmark Supreme Court decisions and the racial convulsions of the mid-1950s, the press could no longer ignore what was happening in places like Montgomery and Little Rock. And neither could the American public. In the post-Brown era, the escalating struggle between civil rights activists and die-hard segregationists became the nation's most gripping domestic news story, though, as the authors note, coverage was frequently consigned to the inside pages of newspapers preoccupied with electoral politics and the international drama of the cold war. 
 ''The Race Beat'' is very much an insider's account. Roberts and Klibanoff are sensitive to the details and challenges of journalistic practice: the complex relationship between editorial and news divisions; the politics of newsroom assignments; the strengths and weaknesses of competing wire services; the placement and longevity of news stories; the impact of libel laws and the legal oversight of newspapers; the role of management and financial constraints; the differences among print, television and radio coverage; and the significance of having correspondents on the scene. Having worked on both sides of the Mason-Dixon line, each man is also keenly aware of the difficulty of achieving fairness and avoiding advocacy in an emotionally charged setting laden with stereotypes. The result is a richly textured and balanced narrative that reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the news media, as well as the personal and contingent factors -- the subtle negotiations, missed opportunities and sometimes heroic efforts -- that influenced the on-the-ground coverage of the movement and its opponents. 
 No brief review can do justice to the varied cast of characters that populated the race beat during the 1950s and '60s. But readers should pay particular attention to Harry Ashmore, the liberal Arkansas editor who gained national attention during the 1957 Little Rock crisis; to the black journalists Moses Newson and Simeon Booker, who provided pioneering coverage of the Emmett Till trial for black newspaper and magazine readers and later risked their lives traveling with the Freedom Riders in 1961; and to Claude Sitton, the Georgia-born journalist who served as The New York Times's chief Southern correspondent from 1958 to 1964. With considerable justification, the authors characterize Sitton as one of the unsung heroes of the civil rights movement. ''Nobody in the news business,'' they insist, ''would have as much impact as he would -- on the reporting of the civil rights movement, on the federal government's response or on the movement itself.'' 
 While the book's emphasis is on the national media, Roberts and Klibanoff also survey the regional press, providing incisive portraits of black editors like Emory Jackson of Birmingham, moderate and liberal dissenters like Hodding Carter of Mississippi , and die-hard segregationists like James Jackson Kilpatrick of Virginia and Thomas Waring of South Carolina. Their stories, and the fateful choices of a not-so-distant past, are worth pondering in an imperfect democracy still grappling with both the burdens of race and the responsibilities of a free press.

HEADLINE: Public Parks and Private Schools

 BODY:
In a city of gaping economic disparities, public parks have long been the great equalizer. New Yorkers take pride in their egalitarian green spaces, which are open to everyone. But acreage has always been at a premium, and public money cannot keep pace with the costs of upkeep and improvements. Over the years, the city has thus come to depend on private donations to fill the gaps. 
 Public-private partnerships can reap great benefits, as long as private interests don't overtake the public's right of access. The city will have to work hard not to tip that balance the wrong way on Randall's Island, a 480-acre public park that sits in the waters separating East Harlem, the South Bronx and Astoria, Queens. 
Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe want to enter into a contract that would allow students at 20 of Manhattan's wealthiest private schools exclusive use of most of the island's playing fields during prime after-school hours for the next 20 years. In return, the city would get a real prize: upgraded and repaired fields which those schools have already been using for soccer, softball and other sports for 15 years, along with dozens of new fields, all financed by the private schools. Their total investment could be more than $80 million.
 The schools had originally wanted a 30-year contract and exclusive rights to 80 percent of the fields during prime time. They've scaled that back to 20 years and two-thirds of the fields, leaving public schools and community groups with access to one-third of the space after school hours. The city should claim a larger share of prime time for public schools -- perhaps 40 percent to start, with a possible increase to 50 percent if demand materializes. 
 There are also objections in principle. New Yorkers for Parks, an independent monitor, warns the deal could set a dangerous precedent, in effect selling off public parkland to the wealthy and giving a new twist to the words ''pay to play.'' 
 There's another very important point here, lost in the back-and-forth over contractual details. For people without private transportation -- and that means public school children -- Randall's Island is reachable only by a footbridge or the Triborough Bridge, with ferry service added for special events, like concerts. The Randall's Island Sports Foundation transports children from disadvantaged neighborhoods on the weekend. But public bus service is virtually nonexistent.
 This explains why private schools have so far had the place mostly to themselves on weekdays. City Comptroller Bill Thompson and Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer insist that as part of any new contract the city should guarantee better public transportation. It's an excellent idea.
 The contract is to be voted on soon by the Franchise and Concession Review Committee, a little-known panel with six votes -- four controlled by the mayor. This is the committee that approved the contract for Snapple soft drinks in public schools as well as the contract with a private company to build a 26-acre water park on Randall's Island, drawing an objection from Mr. Stringer over a projected $40 ticket price.
 Mayor Bloomberg, who has often shown impatience with government process, wants to change the committee rules to expedite its work. But in making decisions about the use of Randall's Island and other public spaces, the city needs more deliberation and transparency, not less.

HEADLINE: Mr. Chips Goes To Congress

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
We're in bipartisan nirvana. Bills are passing through the House 356 to 71 and through the Senate 96 to 2. Nancy Pelosi is aglow, and this week President Bush will trot out a State of the Union speech so conciliatory in tone it'll sound like Gandhi on Quaaludes. 
 The question is, What is all this good cheer accomplishing? It's time to render judgments on the substance of all this legislation coursing through the Democratic Congress: 
 Ethics reform: A-. This is the best thing the Democrats have done. The bans on lobbyist-financed gifts, meals and travel are unimportant. Few legislators are corrupted by a steak or even a ride in a Gulfstream. 
 But there are measures in the tough Senate bill that will change behavior. Legislators will have to wait two years before becoming lobbyists. Lobbyists will have to disclose donations they collect and bundle. There will be more transparency on earmarks. If this bill becomes law, the Democrats will have done something significant to clean up Washington.
 Minimum wage: B-. The traditional argument against raising the minimum wage is that higher labor costs mean that employers hire fewer workers. It's hard to believe this burden will cost many jobs, given how low the minimum wage is now. 
 On the other hand, raising the minimum wage won't be of much benefit to the working poor. Only 0.6 percent of all wage workers make the minimum, and many of those are middle-class teenagers or recent grads. 
 The economists Richard Burkhauser of Cornell and Joseph Sabia of the University of Georgia estimate that a mere 12.7 percent of the benefits of a federal minimum wage hike would go to poor families, while 63 percent would go to families earning more than twice the poverty line. In sum, a poorly targeted publicity measure that will nonetheless help some people in need. Raising the earned-income tax credit would have been better.
 Prescription drugs: D. While they were the opposition, Democrats fulminated that the Republicans were so deep in the pockets of Big Pharma that they wouldn't even let the government negotiate lower drug prices. But governing is harder than kvetching, and the Congressional Budget Office has concluded that the Democratic plan would have a negligible effect on prices for the elderly. 
 The plan allows the government to negotiate, but doesn't take the politically difficult step of giving it any leverage to actually lower prices. A symbolic gesture. 
 Student loans: C-. House Democrats (and 124 Republicans) voted to cut the interest rates on student loans. This is a nice subsidy for middle-class grads, but will do almost nothing to help working-class kids complete college. Over the past three decades, the federal government has spent more than $750 billion on financial aid, with spending levels exploding over the past 10 years. This money has done little to improve graduation rates. That's because relatively few students can't complete college for financial reasons. 
 Study after study has failed to find any link between recent federal subsidy programs and college attendance. Democrats would have been better off streamlining existing aid or focusing their efforts on Pell grants. 
 Energy policies: A-. Democrats have voted to reduce some of the government's oil and gas subsidies and shift them toward renewable energy. As Jerry Taylor wrote in The National Review recently, the case for the existing oil subsidies is ''laughably thin.'' In fact, it's too bad Congress didn't take an even bigger slice out of corporate pork. 
 Sept. 11 commission recommendations: C-. This is another case of governing being a lot harder than complaining. Democrats vowed to enact all the recommendations, but immediately backtracked on the one the commission said was ''among the most difficult and important'': strengthening Congressional oversight. No guts, no glory.
 Stem cell research. B. The House voted 253 to 174 to reverse the Bush restrictions on embryonic stem cell research funding (not enough to overturn a veto). A good move, for most of us. But it's hard to judge the practical consequences, given how distant the benefits of this research are, and the fact that recent innovations like amniotic stem cells might alter the whole debate.
 In conclusion, if a wonky Mr. Chips were to step back and render a judgment on the new Congress so far, he'd note that it's not a terribly ambitious student. It hasn't tried anything big. It has a weakness for showy symbolism and middle-class subsidies. Still, at least it hasn't humiliated the nation the way the last Congress did, and it looks set to do some modest good.

HEADLINE: City Hires Coordinator Of Food Policy

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
The city has hired Benjamin Thomases, an advocate for the poor, as its first food policy coordinator, officials confirmed Friday.
 Mr. Thomases, 31, is a graduate of Columbia Business School and has worked for nonprofit organizations focused on helping low-income people. 
Officials announced the creation of the food coordinator job in November, as part of an aggressive campaign to combat hunger and unhealthy eating. Although Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has made the battle against poverty a high-profile focus of his second term, it was not until City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn began pushing for such a position that the administration responded.
 In his new role, Mr. Thomases is to oversee a task force that will not only help agencies develop and coordinate a range of programs, but also ensure that those agencies serving meals -- like the Department for the Aging, the Administration for Children's Services and the Department of Homeless Services -- buy nutritious food. 
 The panel is to include representatives of Ms. Quinn's office along with officials from the education and health departments.
 Mr. Thomases' duties will also include figuring out ways to ensure that those eligible for food stamps are able to get them and overseeing a plan to expand to 1,000 stores a program to encourage bodegas in low-income areas to offer healthier products like low-fat milk and fresh vegetables.
 Mr. Thomases attended the social enterprise program at Columbia Business School and completed a summer internship in the real estate division of the Greyston Foundation, a nonprofit group devoted to community development in Yonkers. 
 After graduating in 2003, he became president of FirstSource Staffing, which, as part of the Fifth Avenue Committee in Brooklyn, helps find jobs for unemployed people with difficulties entering the work force.

HEADLINE: Fragile Hopes for Bipartisan Rescue of Social Security

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
President Bush is renewing his call for a bipartisan effort on Social Security, but few other issues so clearly highlight the limits of bipartisanship these days, the mistrust and ideological division just barely below the surface.
 Many Democrats and Republicans agree that this period of divided government should, theoretically, be an opportune moment to find a solution to the long-term fiscal problems in Social Security, the 72-year-old government pension system. It is almost universally acknowledged that any fix -- which would be likely to involve a politically risky mix of benefit reductions, tax hikes or other painful changes -- would require broad and deep bipartisan support.
''The American people have to sense on these types of issues that it's absolutely bipartisan and that the agreement was reached in an absolutely fair way,'' said Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, the senior Republican on the Budget Committee. ''And that's one of the strengths of divided government.'' 
 But even the earliest efforts at a rapprochement have been vexed, in large part because of the memories of the Social Security battle of 2005, when Mr. Bush campaigned hard to create private investment accounts in the program but failed. 
 Efforts have been made: Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. has talked to crucial lawmakers, including Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, ''encouraging everyone to bring all their ideas to the table, and hoping that some kind of consensus can emerge,'' as Michele Davis, the assistant Treasury secretary, puts it. 
 Mr. Rangel said he had also been talking about the possibility of action on Social Security with the ranking Republican on his committee, Representative Jim McCrery of Louisiana. And in the Senate, Mr. Gregg and Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the chairman of the Budget Committee, have proposed a bipartisan working group to explore broad entitlement and fiscal issues.
 But the old fault lines have quickly re-emerged. Vice President Dick Cheney, in an interview with Fox News last week, said Mr. Paulson's openness to all ideas did not indicate that the administration was open to any increase in the payroll tax that supports Social Security. Raising the cap on income subject to payroll taxes -- now at $97,500 -- is one of the most commonly cited ways to shore up Social Security. ''I think this president has been very, very clear on his position on taxes, and nothing's changed,'' Mr. Cheney said.
 Mr. Conrad said that after those comments, his effort to move forward with his working group ''is on life support.'' He added, ''People have interpreted that to mean that the administration is not willing to alter their position one iota, and it's their way or the highway. Well, that's not going to work.''
 Democrats already mistrustful of negotiating with the administration were buttressed in their views, Mr. Conrad added. ''They say, look, they're playing us for suckers.''
 Many Democrats say they still want the president to take private investment accounts explicitly off the table before serious negotiations can begin. Mr. Bush is expected to include those accounts in his budget again this year, although with their hypothetical creation pushed back a year.
 Representative Rahm Emanuel, chairman of the Democratic Caucus, said that in a climate of such uncertainty for many Americans' private pension programs, it was all the more important ''not to take away the one solid cornerstone of their retirement.'' He added, ''It's not good politics and it's not good economics.''
 Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the chairman of the Finance Committee, a critical venue for any Social Security plan, said he too believed the president must give up his private accounts before serious talks could occur. If so, he added, ''I'm more than open, if the president is truly willing to look at all options.''
 It is, in short, a polarized debate, and likely to become all the more so as the parties head into the 2008 election. On left and right, advocacy groups are watching for any signs of a flinch. Grover Norquist, the antitax conservative, said he was vocally making a pre-emptive case against any payroll tax increase, although he had been assured by the president in December that he would hold the line.
 Still, Mr. Norquist added, it is simply too dangerous to walk into negotiations with the Democrats without explicitly ruling out tax increases. ''Mom didn't want you to have girls at the house after 10, not because she didn't trust you, but because she thought it was unwise,'' he said.
 There is similar vigilance on the left. ''There is no reason for us, as a campaign working on this issue, and there's no reason for the Democrats to compromise with this president on the most sacrosanct program to progressives after he lost the privatization debate and lost the election,'' said Brad Woodhouse of Americans United for Change, a liberal labor-backed organization.

HEADLINE: Bush Urges Tax To Help Cover The Uninsured

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
President Bush intends to use his State of the Union address Tuesday to tackle the rising cost of health care with a one-two punch: tax breaks to help low-income people buy health insurance and tax increases for some workers whose health plans cost significantly more than the national average.
 White House officials say Mr. Bush has decided to forgo the traditional formula for the State of the Union -- a laundry list of ideas, many of them dead on arrival -- in favor of a more thematic speech that will concentrate on a few issues, like health care, immigration and energy, on which he hopes to make gains with the new Democrat-controlled Congress.
The basic concept is that employer-provided health insurance, now treated as a fringe benefit exempt from taxation, would no longer be entirely tax-free. Workers could be taxed if their coverage exceeded limits set by the government. But the government would also offer a new tax deduction for people buying health insurance on their own. 
 ''I will propose a tax reform designed to help make basic private insurance more affordable,'' Mr. Bush said in his weekly radio address on Saturday, ''whether you get it through your job or on your own.'' He did not offer specifics, but an administration official provided details of the plan.
 The proposed plan is a startling move for a president who has repeatedly vowed not to raise taxes. And it is certain to run into opposition from business groups, labor unions and, most of all, the Democrats who now run Capitol Hill. 
 ''It's a bad policy,'' Representative Charles B. Rangel, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the House committee that writes tax legislation, said in an interview Friday night. ''We are trying to bring tax relief to the middle class. The president is trying to increase their tax liability. This proposal is inconsistent with what the majority is seeking in the House and the Senate.''
 White House officials say the health tax plan would neither increase spending nor reduce tax revenues. Supporters say it would expand coverage to some of the 47 million uninsured. But critics say it would, in effect, tax people with insurance to provide coverage to those without it.
 That would amount to a tectonic shift in the way people get and pay for their health coverage, and historically it has been all but impossible to win Congressional approval for such changes. When President Ronald Reagan made a proposal similar to Mr. Bush's in 1986, it died in Congress, with Mr. Rangel helping to lead the opposition.
 As he heads into the address, his first delivered to a Congress controlled entirely by Democrats, Mr. Bush faces intense skepticism from lawmakers over his new strategy in Iraq. But while he will not be able to avoid the subject of Iraq in the speech, White House officials hope to use the address to shift the national conversation away from the war and toward the possibility of bipartisan cooperation in Washington. 
 ''What they want to accomplish is to have the average American believe that Bush really does want to work across party lines and he's going to do it,'' said one Republican strategist close to the White House.
 In his radio address on Saturday, Mr. Bush described his proposal as a way to ''treat health insurance more like home ownership,'' giving people tax deductions for their health insurance in much the same way as they get tax deductions for home mortgage interest. He said the current system ''unwisely encourages workers to choose overly expensive, gold-plated plans,'' driving up the overall cost of coverage and care. 
 The federal government does without tens of billions of dollars each year in potential tax revenue by making health coverage tax-free. The idea of limiting such tax-free coverage has circulated in various forms for more than two decades and is ''quite controversial,'' said Dr. Mark B. McClellan, a former White House economist and Medicare administrator, who has consulted with Bush officials on the plan.
 ''The conventional wisdom is that there would be too much political opposition to propose'' such limits, Dr. McClellan said.
 In preparation for the president's speech, the White House has been shopping the idea around Capitol Hill, trying to sound out lawmakers like Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, and Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. 
 The administration official said Mr. Wyden's plan contained tax provisions similar to the one proposed by the president. But in an interview, Mr. Wyden was skeptical. He said any tax changes must be coupled with regulations that would encourage private insurance companies to offer affordable coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions.
 ''The market is broken,'' Mr. Wyden said. ''Private insurance companies cherry-pick. They're trying to take just healthy people and send fragile people over to government programs more fragile than they are, and I'm not sure what this does to fix the broken market.''
 The Census Bureau estimates that 175 million Americans obtain private health insurance through employers, while 27 million people are covered by insurance bought outside the workplace. The rest, with the exception of the 47 million uninsured, are covered through government programs like Medicare and Medicaid and military health care.
 Under Mr. Bush's proposal, people buying health insurance on their own would receive a tax break similar to the one that has historically been available to people who receive coverage through their jobs. The plan is tied to the average cost of family health coverage, which is currently $11,500 a year.
 It would work like this: The administration would cap the amount of benefits that can remain tax free at $15,000 for a family and $7,500 for an individual. Anyone whose health insurance cost more than that would pay taxes on the difference. For example, a family with coverage costing $16,000 a year would pay taxes on $1,000.
 The cap would also be used to establish the amount of the new deduction for people who lack coverage. In this example, a family buying insurance on its own could take a $15,000 deduction -- even if the insurance cost less. The cap would rise with some measure of overall inflation, but would not necessarily keep pace with the costs of medical care and health insurance.
 A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity so as not to upstage the president, said, ''The vast majority of people with employer-provided coverage will benefit as well.''
 One of the nation's leading experts on tax policy, C. Eugene Steuerle, a Treasury official in the Reagan administration who is now a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, said the proposal ''would probably help increase the number of people with health insurance at no cost to the budget.''
 The administration official said the White House envisioned health insurance companies offering new plans to meet a growing market. But employers expressed doubts. 
 ''This is a classic case of robbing Peter to help Paul pay for coverage,'' said E. Neil Trautwein, a vice president of the National Retail Federation, which represents retailers of all sizes. ''I do not think the president will find many backers in the employer community for this proposal.''
 In trying to address the problems of the uninsured, Mr. Trautwein said, ''we should not start by endangering coverage for people who already have it.''

HEADLINE: Star-Struck on the Soccer Field, and in the Boardroom

BYLINE: By DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
PRODUCERS sign stars to save movies. Boards hire star chief executives to save companies. Can a star soccer player save an entire industry?
 Put aside the question of whether Major League Soccer, the modest circuit in the United States, is really in need of saving. The signing of David Beckham, whose salary with bonuses could exceed the entire payroll of the rest of the league, shows an overwhelming faith in star economics, where the leading lights of an industry wield disproportionate influence.
The basic principle of star economics is that an enterprise can't distinguish itself just by maintaining a high average in the quality of its work force. It has to have a star, a breakaway figure, to attract the attention of customers and to inspire its own employees. Moreover, the received wisdom is that a business can't do all the things that we now think are so important -- ''taking it to the next level,'' ''thinking outside the box'' or ''beating expectations'' -- without a star leading the way. 
 The economy certainly seems to be producing more stars. The highest-paid Americans are leaving the rest of the work force further behind almost every year. A combination of factors is behind the trend: the huge opportunities offered by globalization, the sudden popularity of hedge funds, the heady climate of innovation in high technology, the enormous pay packages offered to top executives, and more. The economy creates stars. And the more that employers chase them, the greater their radiance.
 Yet one could argue that in corporate America, at least, the heyday of the star system has already passed. Even Jack Welch, the nation's favorite management guru, now has his critics.
 And look at some of the names that crashed to earth -- names like Carleton S. Fiorina, a victim of unpopular strategy at Hewlett-Packard, and Albert J. Dunlap, forced out amid an accounting scandal at Sunbeam, to say nothing of stars-turned-convicts like L. Dennis Kozlowski, Bernie Ebbers and Jeffrey K. Skilling.
 Now corporate America often looks to established, old hands -- rather than stars with flair to spare -- to solve big problems. Alan Mulally, formerly of Boeing, is now aiming to turn around the Ford Motor Company, and Gordon Bethune, formerly of Continental Airlines, is advising creditors of Delta. It's substance over style.
 Soccer is ultimately an entertainment industry, and stars were bred in radio, films and television long before soccer became such big business. Hiring David Beckham is a lot like returning to the studio system of the 1940s, when a star would be expected to lend his talents to a string of movies, all for the same company and perhaps even the same director. But that system didn't last in Hollywood, since actors asserted their bargaining power. And it hasn't really worked in soccer, either.
 The old North American Soccer League, which closed down in 1984, was the star system carried to an extreme. Aging magicians of the game -- even Pele, its reigning legend -- were collected from around the world to play matches in football stadiums. But the opportunity to see men who were household names, at least for soccer fans, in the dusk of their careers did not create enough momentum for the league to survive. A previous attempt to bring an unquestioned star of the European game, Lothar Matthaus of Germany, to American shores ended quickly and in acrimony a few years ago.
 Mr. Matthaus was offered far less money than Mr. Beckham, though, and Mr. Beckham is a different sort of commodity. He is a marketing powerhouse, and the Beckham name is known to many people who have little interest in his athletic talents. Nevertheless, his allure as a salesman may slacken once his ability on the field ebbs away.
 Anna Kournikova, the Russian tennis player, became an object of ridicule when, despite or perhaps because of her many modeling jobs and photo shoots, she failed to win a tournament on the women's tour. The fizzling of Alex Rodriguez, perhaps the only player in any sport whose contract ($252 million over 10 years) is even roughly comparable to Mr. Beckham's, has been a source of ire and bitterness for many a Yankee fan, both here and abroad.
 Mr. Rodriguez's contract didn't seem quite so outlandish in the context of his team and teammates. The Yankees had already boasted baseball's most bloated payroll for several years before his arrival. Yet covering his salary may be much easier than covering Mr. Beckham's target for annual compensation, which could reach $50 million a year. The Yankees have a minimum of 162 games a year, and usually more in the playoffs. Their games are simulcast all over the world. Their merchandise is just as ubiquitous. The same isn't true for Major League Soccer. Say it receives $10 for every extra jersey or ticket Mr. Beckham helps to sell. Even if his total earnings come partly from endorsements -- and those do the league little good by themselves -- he will have to sell millions of tickets and jerseys to live up to his billing. That will be tough in a league where teams play a maximum of about 40 matches, often in half-full stadiums, with minimal coverage overseas.
 MR. BECKHAM'S arrival could raise the profile of Major League Soccer, but his advent also raises questions about just what the league is trying to accomplish. It began by trying hard not to repeat the North American Soccer League's mistakes, seeking instead to provide a career path for the nation's best young players. It has made some headway, with many players going on to success in Europe. As a tightly controlled business with a habit of moving its best players around, it has even picked up a reasonable fan base. 
 In the meantime, Americans who wanted a piece of soccer's huge international marketing clout went abroad instead, buying up the brand names of Manchester United and Aston Villa. But it seems that Mr. Beckham is being called upon to transform Major League Soccer into something newer and bigger, the way a star chief executive might be expected to transform a company or even an entire industry. 
 It was never going to be easy, given that he is already on the natural downward slope of a competitive athlete in his 30s. After Mr. Beckham's new deal made the headlines, Fabio Capello, his coach at Real Madrid, didn't hesitate to bench him. If corporate America's lessons about the star system are to be believed, the task could be even more difficult than Major League Soccer expects.

HEADLINE: Judging The State Of the Oil Market

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
IT was barely six months ago that Wall Street was keeping a nervous eye on the rising prices of oil and other commodities and investors in those sectors were enjoying an I-told-you-so satisfaction. 
 The stock market has since moved to new highs and commodities have been slumping, especially in the last few weeks; the main grade of American crude oil has fallen more than $10 a barrel this month. But John B. Brynjolfsson, who manages a multibillion-dollar commodity portfolio for the Pimco fund family, expects a recovery that may follow President Bush's State of the Union address on Tuesday.
Signs of slowing economic growth are responsible for much of the drop in industrial commodity prices generally. When it comes to energy, Mr. Brynjolfsson said, political factors also come into play, accounting for changes in traders' expectations of both supply and demand.
 The market has concluded that Mr. Bush's plan to send additional troops to Iraq is leading Middle East allies to open the taps, ''to keep the world economy lubricated and show good faith to the Bush administration,'' he said.
 The anticipation of greater supply is accompanied by an expectation that demand will fall, and Mr. Bush is likely to call in his speech for measures to conserve energy and to produce more of it from renewable sources, Mr. Brynjolfsson said.
 ''The State of the Union address, I suspect, will have large doses of energy policy in it,'' he said. But the impact of any programs arising from the speech is unlikely to be felt for months or years, he said, even if energy initiatives are backed by Democrats in Congress. ''The rubber wouldn't hit the road for months,'' he said. 
 Once the speech has been digested by the markets, he said, prices could rebound.
 The best way to benefit from any recovery in energy or other commodity markets is through easily tradable proxies for the actual materials, he said, such as futures contracts or exchange-traded funds, but not shares of production companies, which he finds comparatively expensive.
 ''Valuations fluctuate,'' Mr. Brynjolfsson said, ''but direct exposure to commodities turns out to be a more cost-effective way to get exposure than through equities.''

DATA WATCH -- The week's economic reports are expected to convey mixed messages. On Thursday, orders for durable goods are forecast to show a 3.5 percent increase for December after a 1.9 percent gain in November, according to a Bloomberg News poll of economists.
 The poll predicts that another report that day, for December sales of existing homes, will show a decline of 0.2 percent. But on Friday, a gain of 0.7 percent is expected for December new-home sales.

HEADLINE: In Gas-Plant Plan, a Weighty Silent Voice

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER

 BODY:
AT the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission hearings this month on Broadwater Energy's proposed floating natural gas plant in Long Island Sound, opponents seemed to be addressing a man who was not there.
 That would be Eliot Spitzer, New York's new governor, who has been silent so far on the $700 million project but will soon make a decision that could determine whether it proceeds.
 In coming weeks, Mr. Spitzer will rule whether the liquefied natural gas plant is consistent with New York's coastal management program for the Sound. The plant -- 1,800 feet long and 80 feet high -- would be permanently moored 9 miles off Wading River and 11 miles from Connecticut. The program, administered by the New York State Department of State, tries to balance economic development and environmental preservation in and around the Sound. The department is reviewing the Broadwater project. 
 If Mr. Spitzer finds the project contrary to state policies for the Sound, Broadwater, a partnership of Shell Oil Company and the TransCanada Corporation, would be blocked from proceeding even if the Energy Regulatory Commission, the federal agency with jurisdiction over such projects, approved it. 
 John Hritcko Jr., senior vice president and regional project director for Broadwater Energy, said recently that the company would appeal a finding of inconsistency to Secretary of Commerce Carlos M. Gutierrez and, if necessary, in a federal appeals court. If Mr. Spitzer signs a letter of consistency, Broadwater would advance toward its goal of building the plant in 2010. Opponents, including Suffolk, several Suffolk towns and opponents' groups, would be left to challenge the decision. 
 Mark Violette, a spokesman for the governor, said Mr. Spitzer would reserve judgment on the project until the State Department of State completed its review. Mr. Spitzer's decision is expected by March.
 Although the Broadwater plant is in New York waters, the Connecticut attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, contended that Connecticut had ''clear regulatory authority'' under its coastal zone management powers because the exclusionary zone around the plant and the tankers that supply it would extend into Connecticut waters. 
 Broadwater also needs approvals from New York's Departments of Environmental Conservation and General Services. 
 But Gov. M. Jodi Rell of Connecticut said in testimony to the commission that the state had ''little to gain and, potentially, a great deal to lose if this project moves forward.'' She said the project ''does not make sense for our state, environmentally or economically'' and promised to fight it. 
 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission held well-attended hearings in New London, Conn., on Jan. 9, in Smithtown, N.Y., on Jan. 10, in Shoreham, N.Y., on Jan. 11 and in Branford, Conn., last Tuesday. Opponents turned out in large numbers, but the project got support from trade union members who attended the Smithtown hearing wearing orange caps to identify themselves. 
 Opponents have flooded Mr. Spitzer with letters urging rejection of a project they said would industrialize, militarize and privatize the Sound, be a visual blight and a terrorist target, harm fisheries including those for lobsters, and routinely dump heated and chemical-laced water into a national estuary.
 ''All eyes are on Spitzer,'' said Adrienne Esposito, the executive director of Citizens Campaign for the Environment of Farmingdale and a leader of a Long Island and Connecticut coalition against the project. ''We are calling on the people's governor to protect the people's estuary.''
 Broadwater has disputed arguments that the project would industrialize the Sound and harm the environment. The company also says the plant's location in the middle of the Sound would make it barely visible from shore and safer in what it says is the unlikely event of a terrorist attack or an accident.
 Broadwater also says public support for the plant and the gas it would deliver is growing. On the eve of the first Long Island hearing, the company, which had hired its own polling company, released a telephone poll showing that 62 percent of Long Island voters would support the project. Opponents said public opposition was overwhelming and called the poll inaccurate and misleading.
 The federal hearings sought comments on a draft environmental impact statement the commission released on Nov. 23 that found the project was needed, safe and without any adverse environmental impacts that could not be mitigated. The draft included 79 conditions Broadwater would have to meet. 
 In September the Coast Guard issued a safety and security report that found the project was suitable for the Sound provided the measures it outlined were taken. But the report also said the Coast Guard would need assistance. Questions of how costs would be shared and how much New York and local governments would pay are unresolved.
 A final impact statement is expected within four months, clearing the way for the commission's decision on the project later this year. The comment period on the draft closes on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: What Was Once Theirs 

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
FOREIGNERS almost never show up on the ragged streets of the old town across the bay from Havana. But there was a knock recently on the front door of the battered yellow house in Guanabacoa that is home to Marielena and Francisco, a working-class couple, and outside stood an American. 
 The stranger explained that his wife had lived in that four-room house as a child. In 1962, almost four years after Fidel Castro took power, she and her family fled to New York, and now she wanted pictures to show their children where she had twirled in the patio and sung old Spanish ballads as she grew up in another time, and another world.
Marielena welcomed the stranger, but Francisco (he was afraid to give his last name) stood with arms folded over his bare chest. ''You came here all the way from America just to take pictures,'' he said suspiciously. ''Are you going to reclaim this house?'' 
 The stranger in Guanabacoa (pronounced hwan-ah-bah-COE-ah) had no intention of reclaiming the shoebox house or anything else. I know, because I was the person who knocked on that door during a trip to Cuba last year. My wife, Miriam, lived in that house until she was 10. When she saw the photographs I carried back, she was overcome with bittersweet emotion. Though now faded and chipped, the pink paint on the walls and the green and red tiles on the floor were still there, 44 years later. 
 Nothing had changed and, of course, everything had changed in the years since the revolution triumphed. That's the phrase Fidel Castro's regime has always used -- ''the triumph of the revolution'' -- and it slips off the tongues of even those Cubans who have benefited little from his rule. 
 But now, as they await the demise of the only leader most of them have ever known, Cubans are forced to reconsider what the revolution has meant. Many on the island are caught between two fears -- today's and tomorrow's. Where will they find the money, energy and enterprise to get themselves and their children through another day? And when Fidel dies, will the 1.5 million Cuban-Americans in Florida and New Jersey return to take back what once was theirs? Mr. Castro, who confiscated private property throughout the island nearly 50 years ago, has exploited such anxieties to bolster a sense of national identity, and those fears have only intensified during his long illness. 
 And not without reason. The United States maintains a list of some 5,911 compensation claims by American companies and United States citizens dating from the revolution. Including interest, they are now worth more than $6 billion. And lawyers in Florida and the New York area are girding for one heck of a fight.
 To Cubans who stayed, those who left are ''gusanos,'' worms that crawled away from the homeland. The government turned over any house left behind to other Cubans long ago, and after so many years the current residents believe these houses belong to them, though they hold no title because technically everything in Castro's socialist enclave belongs to the state. 
 Few exiles have papers either, and unlike the American citizens of a half-century ago whose claims were registered by Washington, Cubans who lost property had no mechanism in their own country for recording their losses. 
 But so much time has passed that many gusanos agree that they no longer have a legitimate claim to the houses and small properties they left behind. Miriam's family never even owned the house in Guanabacoa, and no one claims it as theirs. 
 Several public opinion polls and surveys of Cuban-Americans conducted recently in South Florida and North Jersey show that a declining percentage of the diaspora still dreams of reclaiming houses. This is especially true among the younger generation, whose members never lived in Cuba. 
 Still, some exiles did sneak out deeds and have fished them out of strongboxes since Fidel became sick. While some undoubtedly will try to reclaim former residences, most want factories, mills and other commercial properties. 
 ''Cubans are not going to fight over the last few crumbling homes,'' said Nicolas J. Gutierrez Jr., a 42-year-old Cuban-American lawyer in Miami who represents many business claimants and for himself seeks the return of two sugar mills, 15 cattle ranches, a food distribution center and more. ''Out of the hundreds of people I represent and the thousands I talk to I've never met anyone who says he's going to go back there and kick people out. On a base level, that would be immoral.'' 
 Even so, the fear held by people like Marielena and Francisco matters, having been planted by the regime and nurtured by a controlled press that issues regular warnings about ignoble gusanos and what they might try in a moment of crisis. 
 This dense cloud of uncertainty has been hanging over Cuba since the summer, when Mr. Castro, who is 80, ceded power to his brother, Raul, who is 75. For most Cubans, the fear of the future has little to do with who eventually replaces ''El Commandante.'' Rather, most are consumed by the contradiction between longing for change and fearing that change will come.
 All but the most strident military families and pampered government officials hate the current economic system. They have had it with ration books and wartime restrictions -- one tasteless roll a day, and every month eight eggs, a few pounds of chicken and a half-pound of something called ''ground-up texturized soy'' among other basics. But they also can't imagine life without such subsidized guarantees. 
 They also resent a two-tier currency system that makes many consumer goods available to tourists, but out of reach for Cubans. And capitalism itself seems brutal and forbiddingly unequal, a system they can glimpse only when it rubs shoulders with shabby Castro-style Communism in hotels they cannot enter and restaurants that let them in only if they are on the arm of a foreigner. 
 So engulfed have they been in the daily struggle to survive that many Cubans told me they wanted just to forget about the transition now taking place. The regime seemed willing to assist them. Visiting relatives in La Lisa, a poverty-stricken area outside Havana with a forest of six-story Soviet-style housing blocks, I saw what looked like a water tanker in a public square one Saturday night. Crowds thronged, and I could tell that it wasn't water that flowed from the tap. It was cheap beer. A bucket and a few centavos could make the weekend pass more quickly. 
 Still, there continues to be an undercurrent of pride in Fidel's ability to stand up to so many American presidents for so long, and a deeply rooted resentment of the United States and its embargo. So whenever Fidel dies, there is likely to be a great show of grief in Cuba, and a funeral fit for a pharaoh. 
 But the next day will bring the longed-for, dreaded future -- the specter of a new encounter with the outside world that will challenge the efforts of Cuba's current leaders to make certain that Fidel Castro's Revolution survives his death. 
 Already, the leaders are making him more myth than man. New billboards have sprouted along the main highways around Havana: ''Fidel Es Un Pais'' -- Fidel is a country. 
 But Cuban-Americans in the United States don't see it that way. And it isn't likely that Marielena and Francisco and other ordinary Cubans do either.
 When Fidel no longer looms over Cuba, it is much more likely that both sides will focus on what happens when there is another knock at the door, and another stranger asks to come in.

HEADLINE: Hang Up! Tehran Is Calling

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
One of the most worrying parts of President Bush's Iraq strategy doesn't have anything to do with Iraq. It's the way he's ramping up a confrontation with Iran.
 Across a broad spectrum of policy levers, Mr. Bush is raising the pressure on Iran, increasing the risk that he will drag the U.S. into a third war in an Islamic country in six years. Instead of disengaging from war, he could end up starting another.
We could have taken another route. In 2003, Iran sent the U.S. a detailed message offering to work together to capture terrorists, to stabilize Iraq, to resolve nuclear disputes, to withdraw military support for Hezbollah and Hamas, and to moderate its position on Israel, in exchange for the U.S. lifting sanctions and warming up to Iran. 
 Some diplomats liked the idea, but administration hawks rejected it at once. Lawrence Wilkerson, a former chief of staff to Colin Powell, says that the State Department sent a cable to the Swiss ambassador in Tehran, who looks after U.S. interests in Iran, scolding him for even forwarding the package to Washington.
 Obviously, Iran's offer might have led nowhere. But it's plain where rejection of the offer has taken us: more Americans are dying in Iraq, and some experts worry about clashes with Iran itself.
 The Iraq Study Group proposed engagement with Iran, but instead Mr. Bush has been escalating the rhetoric and military pressure. 
 ''When you have such a buildup and have zero communications, and you have an arena like Iraq where you may step on each other's toes, you could have rapid escalation,'' warns Vali Nasr, an expert on the region at the Naval Postgraduate School.
 It doesn't appear that Mr. Bush wants a war with Iran. His aim seems to be a show of force to deter Iran and reassure our allies in the region. But he is on a path that may easily lead to escalation.
 It's unfortunate that we are ratcheting up the military pressure, because the administration has quietly taken one very useful step against Iran: squeezing its access to international banking transactions. That has caused real economic pain and has added to the unpopularity of Iran's hard-line president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Those banking sanctions, not military moves, are a reason Mr. Ahmadinejad has been rebuked by the country's supreme leader. 
 Unfortunately, both Mr. Bush and Mr. Ahmadinejad benefit from confrontation. Both are unpopular domestically but can use a crisis to distract from their policy failures. 
 ''The current strategy benefits Ahmadinejad,'' says Professor Nasr. ''It's going to divert attention at the popular level from democracy.''
 Mr. Ahmadinejad is facing growing criticism: he has been heckled by university students and scolded in the press, and his candidates did poorly in recent elections. Ordinary Iranians love the U.S. -- it's the most pro-American country in the Middle East I've visited -- and a civil society is struggling to be born.
 ''If there is any military strike on Iran, all this movement will end,'' said Shirin Ebadi, the Iranian lawyer and Nobel Peace Prize winner.
 Even some Republicans opposed to a ''grand bargain'' favor some kind of engagement. Mitchell Reiss, a former senior State Department official under Mr. Bush, proposes technical talks with Iran about drug trafficking and maritime security. ''Even if they are a nonstarter for Tehran, I think we score points in the region for trying,'' Ambassador Reiss said.
 Granted, Mr. Bush is right to be frustrated by Iran and the way it's defying the international community with its nuclear program.
 Unfortunately, Mr. Bush's military pressure may end up making Iraq bloodier than ever. Instead of being cowed, Iran may use its proxies in Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon and elsewhere to kill more American officials and troops.
 Or even ordinary Americans here at home. ''It's a pretty good assumption that they have, if not operatives, at least sympathetic actors and affiliated groups'' in the U.S., said Henry Crumpton, the State Department coordinator for counterterrorism.
 Mr. Bush is absolutely right to denounce Iran's leaders for stealing elections, suppressing their people and dabbling in terrorism. But we ourselves are partly to blame for the awful government in Tehran.
 By instigating a coup in 1953 and seeking special legal privileges for American troops in 1964, we empowered extremists like Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and allowed them to tap nationalist outrage. So it would be in keeping with tradition if Mr. Bush, by shortsightedly stoking a confrontation with Tehran, now inadvertently helped Iranian hard-liners crush Iran's democracy movement.

HEADLINE: CLINTON ENTERS '08 FIELD, FUELING RACE FOR MONEY

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY and JEFF ZELENY; Patrick Healy reported from New York, and Jeff Zeleny from Washington. Campbell Robertson contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton jumped into the 2008 presidential race yesterday, immediately squaring off against Senator Barack Obama and the rest of the Democratic field in what is effectively the party's first primary, the competition for campaign donations.
 ''I'm in,'' Mrs. Clinton said in an e-mail message to supporters early yesterday. ''And I'm in to win.''
 If successful, Mrs. Clinton, 59, would be the first female nominee of a major American political party, and she would become the first spouse of a former president to seek a return to the White House.
 Her entrance into the race followed Mr. Obama's by less than a week, and highlighted the urgency for her of not falling behind in the competition for money, especially in New York, her home turf, where the battle has already reached a fever pitch. It also set off rounds of e-mail messages and conference calls among both her allies and opponents. [Page 27.] 
 George Soros, the billionaire New York philanthropist, has made maximum donations in the past to both candidates, for instance, and last week he faced a choice: support Mr. Obama, who created his committee on Tuesday, or stay neutral and see what Mrs. Clinton and others had to say. In this case, Mr. Obama won. 
 Mr. Soros sent the maximum contribution, $2,100, to Mr. Obama, the first-term senator from Illinois, just hours after he declared his plans to run. 
 ''Soros believes that Senator Obama brings a new energy to the political system and has the potential to be a transformational leader,'' said Michael Vachon, a spokesman for Mr. Soros.
 Mrs. Clinton's presidential operation is only one day old, but she already finds herself in a breakneck competition against Mr. Obama for fund-raising supremacy in two towns that she and her husband have mined heavily for political gold: New York and Hollywood. Mr. Obama's entrance into the race has also put up for grabs other groups that are primary targets for Mrs. Clinton, including African-Americans and women. 
 At this early stage in the nomination fight, securing donations and signing up fund-raisers are among the best ways of showing political strength in a crowded field (seven Democrats and counting). And Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton are looking to raise at least $75 million this year alone.
 Advisers said yesterday that they had begun corralling donors to build quickly on the formidable $14 million that Mrs. Clinton already had in the bank. They predicted that they would outpace Mr. Obama, though they acknowledged that he is moving impressively to try to match Mrs. Clinton's national fund-raising network, which has been in the making far longer than his. 
 Mrs. Clinton faces some fatigue among donors after more than 15 years of Clinton fund-raising, Democratic contributors and strategists said, and some skepticism about whether she can win. Yet she has the Democrats' most popular rainmaker at her full disposal, former President Bill Clinton, and she has influential friends like the lawyer and power broker Vernon E. Jordan Jr. to help keep African-American donors and others by her side.
 Notably, no prominent Clinton fund-raiser has moved to Mr. Obama's camp (though his aides are working on it). Mrs. Clinton has also lined up a powerful roster of fund-raising and economic advisers in New York, including the financiers Roger Altman, Steven Rattner, Blair W. Effron, Alan Patricof and Mr. Rattner's wife, Maureen White, a former finance chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee.
 ''Maureen and I will happily do everything we can to help her,'' Mr. Rattner said. ''Based on our long relationship with her, we feel that she has demonstrated incontrovertibly that she would be an effective candidate and a terrific president.''
 For all of the attention swirling around Mr. Obama, meanwhile, he faces many obstacles as he seeks to become the nation's first black president. His background, including a father from Kenya and a mother from Kansas, has elevated his appeal, but it does little to answer questions about whether he has the experience to serve in the White House. 
 Picking off Clinton loyalists is no easy task, either. Hours after opening his fund-raising committee on Tuesday, Mr. Obama convened separate conference calls with donors in Chicago and on the East and West Coasts; in the East Coast phone call, according to participants, Mr. Obama asked them to keep an open mind about his candidacy even if they had been allies of Mrs. Clinton.
 James Torrey, chairman of the global hedge fund Torrey Funds, said he signed on with Mr. Obama not as a snub to Mrs. Clinton, but because he believed that the Illinois senator had the best chance of inspiring Democrats and other voters.
 ''I know it's perceived as an anti-Hillary thing,'' Mr. Torrey said in an interview Friday. ''I think she's marvelous, I think she's a great senator, but I'd rather see Barack Obama as president. I think the Republicans will make it their life's work to bring her down.'' 
 Several New York and Hollywood donors offered a similar assessment: they liked Mrs. Clinton as a senator, but worried that her rating in a new Washington Post/ABC News Poll released Saturday was at 41 percent, despite having nearly 100 percent name recognition.
 Some of her veteran supporters in New York are now on the fence, including the business executives Orin S. Kramer and Robert Zimmerman, who are active in Democratic politics. Others say they plan to play it safe and contribute to both candidates. In Los Angeles, the producers David Geffen, Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg are working to plan a fund-raiser for Mr. Obama after he officially enters the race, which he is scheduled to do on Feb. 10. Mr. Geffen has signed on with Mr. Obama, while Mr. Katzenberg and Mr. Spielberg have not decided which candidate to formally endorse.
 Yet hedging bets with a spread of donations could prove perilous with the Clinton camp, said Bob Kerrey, the former Nebraska senator who is president of the New School University.
 ''The Clintons value loyalty, and I don't think they are going to risk offending her,'' Mr. Kerrey said of Mrs. Clinton's traditional supporters, noting that he spoke to several undecided Democrats last week. Referring to Mr. Obama, he added: ''He's got to reach out to Hillary's supporters and hope he can persuade some of them. If he doesn't, she's the nominee.''
 Mr. Zimmerman said he was enthusiastic about Mrs. Clinton. Asked why he had not aligned with her yet, he said: ''It's appropriate and respectful to hear every candidate's message.'' 
 Mr. Obama is putting together his own finance team to focus on New York. He has hired Julianna Smoot, who helped tap Wall Street money as part of a record-setting team at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee under Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York. He has also dispatched a fund-raiser, Jenny Yeager, to run his New York operation, and he is calling on Robert Wolf, chairman of UBS Americas, to raise money. (A spokeswoman for Mr. Wolf, who has donated to Mrs. Clinton and other Democrats, confirmed that he planned to help Mr. Obama.)
 In New York, chief executives, lawyers, entertainers, gay men and lesbians, African-Americans and women have been prominent in political fund-raising for decades -- though usually they are picking among outsiders, not hometown friends and allies. Yet the 2008 race will test personal and political loyalties, with Mrs. Clinton preparing to announce a run and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and perhaps former Gov. George E. Pataki moving to seek the Republican nomination. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is also being encouraged to run as an independent.
 The attention given to Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama is making fund-raising that much more difficult for other Democrats. While former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina still hopes to tap into a network of supporters among trial lawyers, his former profession, and to build an army of grass-roots donors, strategists for other candidates conceded that raising money would be an uphill battle and said it was an open question whether there was room for more than one alternative to Mrs. Clinton.
 ''I just got off the phone with someone who said, 'It's between Edwards and Obama,' and with a little nudging I pushed him over to the Obama camp,'' said Jeh Johnson, a partner at the Paul, Weiss law firm in New York who has been making fund-raising calls on behalf of Mr. Obama.
 Mr. Johnson, who was general counsel for the Air Force in the Clinton administration, said younger Democrats and women -- crucial parts of Mrs. Clinton's base -- were excited about Mr. Obama. ''I haven't encountered many New Yorkers who say, 'No, I'm not interested, I'm a Hillary supporter,' '' he said.
 The competition for supporters -- and contributors -- extends well beyond New York. And Mr. Obama could complicate Mrs. Clinton's fund-raising efforts in Chicago, another lucrative base for Democrats. In her Senate re-election bid last year, she raised nearly $700,000 from Illinois, her native state.
 One Democratic operative, who has knowledge of Mrs. Clinton's fund-raising operation in the Midwest, called donors in Chicago last week after Mr. Obama's announcement, asking whether it would be foolhardy to sign onto the Clinton campaign if he was in the race. While party officials say Mr. Obama will have an advantage in Chicago, they said Mrs. Clinton would still find considerable support there.
 While Mr. Obama has never run a national campaign, his political action committee, the Hopefund, has attracted a broad base of contributors from across the country.
 In the New York entertainment industry, too, Mr. Obama's candidacy has received raves. Hours after his announcement Tuesday, the Broadway producer Margo Lion sent out an e-mail message urging her friends to donate to him -- making clear that the theater community was not locked down by Mrs. Clinton.
 ''Along with many others in the industry, I will be producing a fund-raiser at the St. James Theater later this spring'' for Mr. Obama, Ms. Lion wrote. ''We need to find a new direction for our country, and finally, we have the man to do it.''


CORRECTION-DATE: June 1, 2007

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a front-page article on Sunday about Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential candidacy misstated the name of the university whose president, former Senator Bob Kerrey, commented on campaign donors. It is the New School, not the New School University.
A front-page article on Jan. 21 about the presidential prospects of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton referred incorrectly to the results of a Washington Post/ABC News poll on Jan. 19. The poll found that Mrs. Clinton had the support of 41 percent of Democrats questioned, not a favorability rating of 41 percent among all respondents. (Her favorability rating among all of those questioned was 54 percent.) The error was pointed out on Wednesday in a posting on the Web site of Media Matters for America.

HEADLINE: Categorized, Compared and Displayed: Social Ills as Museum Specimens

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Jan. 17 

 BODY:
If I ever need to be committed, I could do worse than end up someplace like the Medfield Insane Asylum of a century ago. There -- judging from the photos of that Massachusetts institution now displayed at Harvard University's Arthur M. Sackler Museum -- I would have a good chance of sleeping on starched linen, walking on spotless floors and rarely bumping into fellow inmates. The elite private rooms of the McLean Hospital are still more appealing, offering in 1903 the coziness of Victorian living rooms. And even insanity might not be too high a price to pay for the draperies, lace and furnishings promised by a photograph of the Lunatic Asylum for Men in Ghent, Belgium.
 But that is one of the problems when one starts looking more closely at the photographs in the Sackler's exhibition ''Classified Documents: The Social Museum of Harvard University, 1903-1931.'' One doesn't quite know how to interpret these images of institutions that have developed in response to human misery and illness, or even how much to trust them. They demonstrate, again and again, how many extraordinary efforts have been made to alleviate suffering. But these antiseptic photographs allow no disturbed patients to interfere with their pristine vision. 
On the other hand, the exhibition also contains images of shoddy rooms, threadbare clothes and women grimly rolling tobacco leaves. But some of these pictures can seem artificial and staged too, even when they are meant to seem bleak, as if they were simply intent on demonstrating how much poverty, disease and hopelessness yet remains. 
 With such photographs -- and with much writing as well -- it becomes difficult to see fully what is being shown and why, how it fits into a broader context and what is to be done. But to understand social ills and the efforts made to alleviate them, Francis Greenwood Peabody, Harvard's Plummer professor of Christian morals from 1886 to 1912, began accumulating thousands of these photographs, along with pamphlets, illustrations and handcrafted objects to document and cure those ills, thus founding Harvard's Social Museum. It folded nearly three decades later, and this modest exhibition is the first major look at its materials in more than 30 years. What it shows, though, may not always be what Peabody intended. 
 A liberal theologian and minister who helped end compulsory worship at Harvard College, Peabody imagined he was putting the understanding of society on the same scientific footing that he saw in other disciplines. That meant reasoning from induction: gathering evidence and generalizing from it. Peabody points out that Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology began in 1859, its Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology in 1866, its Semitic Museum in 1889; they all accumulated specimens, classified them and made connections.
 In his Social Museum, Peabody said he would do the same. He wrote: ''The facts of philanthropy, industry, poor-relief, housing, insurance, cooperation, alcoholism and penology are as capable of graphic representation as the lives and habits of beetles or plants.'' The Social Museum, as part of Harvard's then-new department of social ethics, was, he wrote ''the first attempt to collect the social experience of the world as material for university teaching, and to provide guidance for academic inquirers into the study of social progress.'' (Peabody's paper is at ocp.hul.harvard.edu/immigration/photos-social-museum.html.) 
 He created his own system of classification, his own set of genuses and species, under rubrics like ''Charity, Aged,'' ''Charity, Children'' and ''Charity, Tuberculosis.'' There were ''Crime, Prisons, New Hampshire'' and ''Crime, Women, Germany''; ''Defectives, Crippled, France'' and ''Defectives, Epileptics, United States, New York''; ''Housing, Improved, Germany, Frankfurt'' and ''Social Settlements, Iowa.'' What he saw taking shape, Peabody suggested, was ''the scope and comprehensiveness of this modern movement of social service,'' in which different cultures were working toward ''a common end of social justice and peace.'' 
 In this exhibition -- organized by Deborah Martin Kao and Michelle Lamuniere, who are photography curators with the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard -- that scope is evident. (A database of the entire Social Museum collection will soon be available at www.artmuseums.harvard.edu/socialmuseum.) The images illustrate settlement houses in which homes were turned into social training grounds for immigrants and the needy; public programs in New York that schooled girls for domestic service; before-and-after photos showing the cultivating effect of Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute on a poor black family in Virginia; an agricultural school in Woodbine, N.J., that taught milk sterilization and farming to Jewish immigrants; and factories of the H. J. Heinz Company and the National Cash Register Company, where reading rooms and social gatherings became institutionalized accompaniments to labor. There are also photographs of rundown apartments and poor working conditions, though none as horrifying as images we have come to know since or the ones that had already been well documented in novels and muckraking reports.
 But because almost nothing has context and very little has explanation, nothing is revealed other than the broad scope of the social welfare enterprise. Some images came to the museum from the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis and literally served as promotions for various social institutions. Some, like those showing poorly ventilated rooms, are meant to awaken outrage, but instead inspire mild curiosity partly because they resemble middle-class urban railroad flats still being used. 
 How serious were the problems and how successful the solutions? It is unclear. Poverty, disease, unemployment and madness were met by orphanages, settlement houses, asylums and work programs. But do the suffering and institutional remedies fit into a ''scientific'' social vision like the one Peabody desired for university study? Not really. Try applying established political or academic theories to these conditions -- say, Foucault's view of the oppressive control of social institutions, or a Marxist view of alienated labor and class struggle -- and enough seeps past the theories' boundaries to show how inadequate the abstractions are to illuminating generations of toil and hardship and generations of effort to alleviate their toll. A century after Peabody's project, the phenomena still overwhelm theory.
 Peabody's idea of a Social Museum is somewhat absurd because nothing in it was truly a specimen, the way a bone or a meteorite might be for a museum of natural history. Peabody's classifications represent surface observations with little deeper significance, as if someone had decided to assemble display cases containing all round objects, say, or all books with brown covers. The result could have been worse: forcing the images into an ill-fitting theory would have distorted as much as it revealed. 
 There is also a tension between Peabody's idea for this museum and the nature of a university itself. The Social Museum was more an attempt to sample than to comprehend, less an attempt to study a problem than to proselytize for a solution, or as Peabody put it, ''to direct the amelioration of industrial and social life.'' Directing that amelioration is not something that universities were once eager to do, which may have been one reason the Social Museum was ultimately absorbed into Harvard's largermuseums, and why, by the 1930s, the department of social ethics had become the department of sociology. 
 There is, though, something anthropologically intriguing about the Social Museum itself. Though in its simplicity it failed, its tensions are still latent in contemporary university life. At times, in books and at conferences, in policy papers and in community projects, the modern research university seems to be reaching back to its origins, as if determined to transmute, say, the study of sociology into the practice of social ethics, to change the world rather than simply to study it, to direct the amelioration of social life. At those times the theological and missionary origins of the university reappear and the university could almost seem to be seeking a place for itself in some future version of the Social Museum. 

Connections, a critic's perspective on the arts, appears every other Monday.

HEADLINE: Rethinking Income Gap

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''The American Way of Equality'' (column, Jan. 14): 
 As an economist who favors free markets and eschews media ''warnings'' of rising income inequality, I liked most of what David Brooks wrote (through the lens of Seymour Martin Lipset) about why socialism never caught on in this country. 
 Yes, our hopes and desires for a better life (whatever that entails) have been typically acted upon first by ourselves and secondarily by the government -- keeping ''big brother'' at bay. 
 But when a society's media keep harping on growing income inequality, as if there are evil forces producing income differences (at a time when our economy is robust), segments of society can eventually ease up and look for help.
 As Mr. Brooks said, the Democrats have responded to perceived pleas for help with ''pebbles'' -- but where there are pebbles, there are usually rocks and also boulders. That's what troubles me.

HEADLINE: The Clinic Is Open

 BODY:
Companies are proving that when it comes to health care, you can re-teach old dogs an old trick. On-site health clinics in the workplace, which had been disappearing since their peak in the 1970s, are staging a comeback. Corporations are waking up to the fact that healthy employees are more productive, while sick workers are a drag on the bottom line. And they're trying to do something about it. 
 The sky-high cost of health care in the United States isn't just a challenge for the families that struggle to pay rising premiums and co-payments. It's also a serious issue for American companies, whose competitors in other countries often benefit from national health insurance programs.
As Milt Freudenheim reported recently in The Times, some big American-based companies have rediscovered that it's cheaper in the long run to spend a little more on in-house health clinics. Companies from the Pepsi Bottling Group to Credit Suisse have opened or expanded their clinics. More than a quarter of the nation's 1,000 largest employers will likely offer some kind of on-site health services by the end of the year.
 For employees, a clinic is a major time saver, convenient and cheap (or even free). For companies, spending a relatively small amount of money on early detection and basic preventive care can save on expensive hospital bills down the line. It's an interesting stopgap solution, provided companies do not abuse their knowledge of employee medical conditions and remain focused on the long-term health of their workers, instead of just steering them away from expensive procedures.
 Innovative as they are, office and factory infirmaries will hardly solve the nation's entrenched health care crisis. 
 Total health spending reached nearly $2 trillion in 2005, accounting for 16 percent of the economy. It is a bit scary that the 6.9 percent increase in health spending that year -- rather than a cause for alarm -- is celebrated as the slowest pace of increase in six years. There are 47 million uninsured people in this country. State governments, like those in Massachusetts and California, are trying to chip away at the problem and business groups are lobbying in Washington for help with out-of-control costs.
 While it is a welcome sign that businesses and states are trying to come up with answers, health care is a national issue that requires a comprehensive solution.

HEADLINE: Your MasterCard Or Your Life

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
Americans are increasingly living in a house of cards -- credit cards.
 A disturbing new report shows that with health care costs continuing their sharp rise, low- and middle-income patients are reaching for their credit cards with alarming frequency to cover treatment that they otherwise would be unable to afford.
This medical debt, to be paid off in many cases at sky-high interest rates, is being loaded onto consumer debt that is already at dangerously high levels. Many families have been crushed by the load, driven from their homes, forced into bankruptcy, and worse. 
 The report, released last week, was jointly compiled by Demos, a public policy group in New York, and the Access Project, which is affiliated with a health policy institute at Brandeis University and is trying to broaden the availability of health care in the U.S. 
 Imagine for a moment the seriously ill patient who needs to be hospitalized. In the cold new world of health care, the primary message to such patients is often ''Show me the money!''
 In many instances, of course, the patient does not have the money. What the report found is that even people with health insurance are being drained by health care costs to the point where the credit card seems the only option.
 ''As deductibles and co-payments increase,'' the report said, ''hospitals are finding more patients unable to pay their medical bills. Some hospital management analysts are expecting an increase in self-pay patients and are bracing for higher levels of bad debt.
 ''In recognition of the evolving payment landscape and the risk of hospital bad debt, health care providers are more aggressively seeking upfront collection of co-pays and deductibles. A component of this strategy is to encourage patients to use third-party lenders such as credit cards to pay for medical expenses they cannot afford, which families frequently do to meet high medical bills.''
 It's one thing to reach for your Visa or MasterCard to pay for a Barbie doll or flat-screen TV. It's way different to pull out the plastic because you've just learned you have cancer or heart disease, and you don't have any other way to pay for treatment that would prevent a premature trip to the great beyond.
 A society is seriously out of whack when legalized loan sharks are encouraged to close in on those who are broke and desperately ill.
 This medical indebtedness is hardly surprising. Health care costs continue to rise much faster than family income and inflation, and Americans (who have stopped saving altogether) were already mired in staggering amounts of personal debt. Some families have been putting their groceries on credit cards. Many have taken the financially disastrous step of using home equity loans to bring down credit card balances.
 A serious illness for people already in shaky economic circumstances can be the final push into bankruptcy. 
 According to the report, called ''Borrowing to Stay Healthy,'' about 29 percent of low- and middle-income families with credit card debt reported using their credit cards to pay medical expenses -- in most cases for major medical problems.
 Over all, a full 20 percent of low- and middle-income families with credit card debt said they had used their cards to cover major medical expenses over the prior three years.
 This indebtedness -- subject to monthly late fees and penalties, and interest rates that can reach 30 percent -- only adds to the trauma of serious illness.
 It's believed that 29 million Americans are burdened with medical debt of one form or another. Individuals who are already saddled with medical bills that they can't pay are much more likely to avoid further medical treatment and to leave drug prescriptions unfilled. Such decisions often have life-threatening consequences.
 There is an epidemic of personal bankruptcies in the U.S. and medical factors are believed to play a role in as many as half of them.
 These are problems that cry out for reform -- of the American health care system and the American way of debt, both of which seriously threaten the American way of life. At the very least, in the short term, we need to protect financially vulnerable patients from a credit card universe in which there are no legal limits on fees or interest, and where the abuse of customers is the norm.

HEADLINE: I.B.M. to Introduce Workers' Networking Software

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN

 BODY:
And you thought social networking was all about text-messaging among bored teenagers.
 I.B.M. has another take on it. Today the company plans to announce a set of social software tools that will bring the kind of blogging, idea sharing and war-story swapping typically associated with MySpace and Facebook, the social networking sites popular among teenagers and college students, to the corporate world. 
Called Lotus Connections, the new software, expected later this year, will let employees set up virtual worlds in which they can meet like-minded colleagues within the company and exchange ideas with them, all in the name of improving productivity. And that's just for starters.
 The idea, said I.B.M.'s vice president for social software, Jeff Schick, is to ''unlock the latent expertise in an organization.''
 I.B.M. plans to show the software today in Orlando, Fla., at an annual conference for developers who work with the company's Lotus group, which produces Lotus Notes. An early leader in collaboration software, or ''groupware,'' Lotus Notes has been under attack in recent years from Microsoft's Exchange software.
 ''Microsoft has been a tough challenge for the Lotus Group,'' said Erica Driver, an analyst with Forrester Research, a market analysis and consulting company. ''Focusing on new technologies is a good approach.''
 Last week I.B.M. reported that strong software sales helped lift the company's profits and revenue last quarter, slightly surpassing Wall Street's estimates. The performance provided some encouragement that I.B.M.'s push to revamp its software strategy, including projects like Connections, is gaining ground. 
 Many companies have already discovered the benefits of bringing social networking into their businesses, but so far most of the tools available to them have focused on a specific element of social networking, like blogging. 
 ''I talk to corporate clients every day, and I'm finding the topic of social networking comes up all the time,'' Ms. Driver said. ''What I.B.M. has done validates the use of social computing tools for businesses.''
 Lotus Connections has five components -- activities, communities, dogear (a bookmarking system), profiles and blogs -- aimed at helping experts within a company connect and build new relationships based on their individual needs. 
 The profiles component, for example, lets users search for people by name, expertise or keyword. The program then not only provides contact information and reporting structure details, but also lists blogs, communities, activities and bookmarks associated with the person. 
 Inside I.B.M., employees have been using a prototype of the profiles feature for the last few years, and today 450,000 profiles of I.B.M. employees are stored there. 
 I.B.M. Research, the company's research arm, has long had an interest in social networking, and has several projects under way within Second Life, for example, the virtual world that allows people to communicate in a three-dimensional universe.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Manhattan: Call To Monitor Investment Decisions 

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN; Compiled by John Sullivan

 BODY:
Assemblyman Adriano Espaillat, left, a Manhattan Democrat, said yesterday that he would introduce legislation to create an 11-member investment review commission to monitor certain investment decisions made by the state comptroller's office. The office is the sole trustee of the state's Common Retirement Fund, which provides pension, death and disability benefits to public employees. Mr. Espaillat, chairman of a task force of black, Hispanic and Asian-American state lawmakers, said the commission would focus on social investment goals for the fund, like promoting economic development in urban and rural areas that are struggling economically.

HEADLINE: When John Meets Al

 BODY:
Four major bills have recently been offered in the Senate calling for mandatory controls on carbon dioxide, the main global warming gas. And last week, 10 big companies, including General Electric, Alcoa and progressive utilities like PG&E of California, joined in an informal coalition to press Congress and President Bush for action. 
 All of this has been accompanied by considerable fanfare. But at least as important was a quiet little letter to the members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce from its new chairman, John Dingell.
 A Michigan Democrat who in recent years has opposed stronger fuel economy standards for automobiles, Mr. Dingell is, at best, agnostic on global warming. But he said he would put climate change at the top of the committee agenda this year and, for good measure, would invite Al Gore -- whose documentary ''An Inconvenient Truth'' has raised public awareness of the issue -- to testify first.
 Mr. Gore should quickly accept. Mr. Dingell's support will be essential to any real progress on curbing emissions. In recent years, serious discussion of climate change has been largely confined to the Senate. But laws must be passed by both chambers, and if anything is to happen in the House, it will need Mr. Dingell's participation and consent. 
 That is the main reason House Speaker Nancy Pelosi established a select committee on global warming last week -- not to end-run Mr. Dingell's powers, which she can't really do, but to elevate an issue she regards as important and to pressure Mr. Dingell to take a leadership role. 
 Mr. Dingell is 80 now, a formidable warrior who during 51 years in the House has played a pivotal role in pushing through nearly every cornerstone environmental law, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and laws protecting wilderness and endangered species. But while he supported fuel economy standards years ago, his loyalties to Detroit have led him to oppose further restrictions. As for global warming, he has said that he needs to be convinced that the consequences are truly worth worrying about, and if they are, that the problem can be addressed without bankrupting the country. 
 Hardly a believer, in other words, but plainly open to persuasion. Which is why it's essential for Mr. Gore and others to become part of the conversation Mr. Dingell has invited. In the end, what is most likely to move him forward is not pressure from Ms. Pelosi or anyone else but appeals to his well-documented sense of environmental stewardship.

HEADLINE: The Lure of High Tech

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
The Spitzer administration is working on a major high-technology deal that will be announced in the coming weeks, according to Alain E. Kaloyeros, chief administrative officer of the State University at Albany's College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering. 
 Dr. Kaloyeros, who would not elaborate on the deal, had a close working relationship with former Governor Pataki and has been a key player in economic development deals that attracted technology companies to the state.
He said the latest deal convinced him that he should reject two recent job offers and remain in his job, adding that he had spent the last several weeks ''working with Patrick Foye to close arguably the biggest high-tech deal for the state.'' (Mr. Foye is the new downstate chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation.) 
 Dr. Kaloyeros said he considered the deal to be ''even bigger than A.M.D.,'' referring to the state's roughly $1.2 billion incentive package to encourage Advanced Micro Devices to open a semiconductor factory to the Albany area.
 But whether the latest deal actually gets done remains to be seen.
 ''We don't comment on rumors or speculation about potential economic development deals that may or may not happen,'' Christine Anderson, a spokeswoman for Governor Spitzer, said. DANNY HAKIM

HEADLINE: Months After War, Vision of Rebuilding Lebanon Wanes

BYLINE: By HASSAN M. FATTAH; Nada Bakri contributed reporting from Beirut.

DATELINE: BINT JBAIL, Lebanon, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
In August, Mohammed al-Seyed watched with some pride as tractors driven by Hezbollah men rolled in to begin scooping away the rubble and debris of a month of war with Israel, while engineers and others set to work. 
 This Hezbollah stronghold would soon rise again, the leaders of both the town and the militant group's building arm, Construction Jihad, said defiantly.
 More than five months later, however, with winter here and Lebanon's government enmeshed in political crisis, the tractors are gone, the army of men has disappeared and Bint Jbail's town center still resembles Dresden after World War II. 
 ''They told us everything was going to be rebuilt soon,'' Mr. Seyed said Tuesday, speaking of town leaders. ''They're not doing anything now. We want to build but they won't let us. They promise to pay us, but they don't. All we want is our homes back and they won't even let us have them!'' 
 There may be as many excuses for the slowdown in rebuilding in the south as there are political factions in this nation. Some people blame the weather; some say residents living abroad are just taking their time; some officials cite disagreements over the amounts paid to those who have lost their homes. In one rare admission, a senior Construction Jihad official said his group was overwhelmed by the destruction. 
 ''Our goal initially was to work with our own hands, but we soon realized we weren't enough, so we decided to begin reimbursing people,'' said Abou Ali Bayloun, regional director for Construction Jihad in the southern port town of Tyre. ''It is natural that the workers in the area will not be enough in the area. It needs a lot of workers to do this.''
 But politics is at the heart of the problem. Hezbollah and its supporters point fingers at the government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora; the government reflects the accusation back at Hezbollah. Residents now blame both sides. 
 Ultimately, some analysts say, neither side wants to take responsibility for the task of reconstruction. The government avoids direct involvement on the ground, trying to avoid blame for inefficiency, while Hezbollah has also reduced its activities and is capitalizing on residents' frustrations for the lack of action.
 ''One side doesn't want to be accused of slowing things down,'' said Habib Debs, professor of urban planning at the American University of Beirut. ''The other side wants to blame the government for not doing anything. So nothing is being done and both are happy that that neither is doing anything.''
 Certainly, the two sides lack coordination and cooperation, which alone is a serious barrier to reconstruction. Fear, too, plays a role: residents who could begin building have hesitated, fearing further conflict with Israel or, worse, civil war. 
 ''People are terrified,'' said Ali Eid, deputy mayor of the town of Srifa, one of the few southern towns witnessing major construction. ''They know that if there's problem in Beirut, it will spread and spread south. We've started because we had to. But Bint Jbail is closer to any war that may happen.''
 The political wrangling unleashed in the war's aftermath, culminating in the walkout by six Hezbollah-aligned ministers in November and six weeks of unbroken demonstrations in Beirut by Hezbollah and its new allies -- including Christian and Druse groups that were once its mortal enemies -- has raised sectarian tensions, especially between Sunnis and Shiites. 
 Officials of the Siniora government insist that they have done what they could for the Shiite-dominated and Hezbollah-friendly south, but that the political crisis has prevented major decisions from being made. 
 ''Hezbollah has been part of all the committees,'' said Mohammad Safadi, minister of public works and transportation. ''They are part of the decision-making process so they are as much to blame.'' Mr. Safadi said that up to 40,000 households had received government payments of up to $40,000 each to rebuild their homes and could proceed at will. 
 But officials in Bint Jbail and other southern towns accuse the government of adding red tape and withholding aid to punish them. Bint Jbail's leaders say that electricity service worsened after Mohammad Fneish, the minister of electricity and water resources, resigned with the other Shiite-aligned ministers. They say that telephone service is still spotty because the minister of telecommunications is Marwan Hamadeh, an ally of the Druse leader Walid Jumblat, an outspoken critic of Hezbollah.
 ''The whole south is in the same situation as us,'' said Haitham Bazzi, who heads a committee on reconstruction for the old section of Bint Jbail. ''They have forgotten us, despite the war and everything we went through. That's why many people here are fed up and want the government out even before the politicians do.''
 The town -- which has 6,000 full-time residents and almost 30,000 living abroad, most in the United States -- was adopted by the government of Qatar, which promised to finance the reconstruction. But many villagers feared that residents would take the payments and abandon the village, so Ali Bazzi, the mayor, lobbied to get the Qataris to hire a construction company to rebuild the whole area and preserve its historic nature. 
 He outlined big dreams for his decimated town in August. It was to become a model city in the south, with new apartment blocks, wider streets and modern infrastructure. A group of local residents and college professors stepped in with its own competing plan, which would rebuild the historic homes, preserving the town's character while leaving the high rises at the town's periphery. The debate, local residents say, continues. 
 Now the reconstruction plan is moving in stages, said Hussein Saad, a member of the city council. The first stage, now complete, entailed reimbursements of up to several thousand dollars for reparable damage to homes. The second will pay up to $40,000 for rebuilding demolished homes. And finally a third will rebuild homes in the historic older district. The foundations of a temporary market are in place, to house stores and stalls until the bombed-out market is rebuilt.
 But city officials say that much of the process has been stalled as they wait for approvals from the Department of City Planning, a branch of the Ministry of Public Works and Transportation in Beirut. Mr. Safadi, the minister, acknowledged the delay but said he had found a way to work around the problems.
 The cabinet has drafted new legislation allowing all residents of the south to expedite construction, but said the legislation would normally have to be passed by Parliament. Instead, the cabinet has encouraged city governments to move ahead. 
 ''We simply can't wait for Mr. Berri to hold a session of Parliament any more,'' Mr. Safadi said, speaking of Nabih Berri, the speaker of the Parliament who has backed the opposition and has refused to convene Parliament. ''We can no longer hold the people ransom.''
 In the rubble of Bint Jbail on Tuesday, Mr. Seyed's voice continued to rise. ''I am going to pitch my tent in the center of town and stage my own protest,'' he said. ''We'll bring down the city government. We'll bring down the whole damn show.''

HEADLINE: Gold-Plated Indifference

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
President Bush's Saturday radio address was devoted to health care, and officials have put out the word that the subject will be a major theme in tomorrow's State of the Union address. Mr. Bush's proposal won't go anywhere. But it's still worth looking at his remarks, because of what they say about him and his advisers. 
 On the radio, Mr. Bush suggested that we should ''treat health insurance more like home ownership.'' He went on to say that ''the current tax code encourages home ownership by allowing you to deduct the interest on your mortgage from your taxes. We can reform the tax code, so that it provides a similar incentive for you to buy health insurance.'' 
Wow. Those are the words of someone with no sense of what it's like to be uninsured. 
 Going without health insurance isn't like deciding to rent an apartment instead of buying a house. It's a terrifying experience, which most people endure only if they have no alternative. The uninsured don't need an ''incentive'' to buy insurance; they need something that makes getting insurance possible.
 Most people without health insurance have low incomes, and just can't afford the premiums. And making premiums tax-deductible is almost worthless to workers whose income puts them in a low tax bracket. 
 Of those uninsured who aren't low-income, many can't get coverage because of pre-existing conditions -- everything from diabetes to a long-ago case of jock itch. Again, tax deductions won't solve their problem.
 The only people the Bush plan might move out of the ranks of the uninsured are the people we're least concerned about -- affluent, healthy Americans who choose voluntarily not to be insured. At most, the Bush plan might induce some of those people to buy insurance, while in the process -- whaddya know -- giving many other high-income individuals yet another tax break. 
 While proposing this high-end tax break, Mr. Bush is also proposing a tax increase -- not on the wealthy, but on workers who, he thinks, have too much health insurance. The tax code, he said, ''unwisely encourages workers to choose overly expensive, gold-plated plans. The result is that insurance premiums rise, and many Americans cannot afford the coverage they need.''
 Again, wow. No economic analysis I'm aware of says that when Peter chooses a good health plan, he raises Paul's premiums. And look at the condescension. Will all those who think they have ''gold plated'' health coverage please raise their hands?
 According to press reports, the actual plan is to penalize workers with relatively generous insurance coverage. Just to be clear, we're not talking about the wealthy; we're talking about ordinary workers who have managed to negotiate better-than-average health plans.
 What's driving all this is the theory, popular in conservative circles but utterly at odds with the evidence, that the big problem with U.S. health care is that people have too much insurance -- that there would be large cost savings if people were forced to pay more of their medical expenses out of pocket. 
 The administration also believes, for some reason, that people should be pushed out of employment-based health insurance -- admittedly a deeply flawed system -- into the individual insurance market, which is a disaster on all fronts. Insurance companies try to avoid selling policies to people who are likely to use them, so a large fraction of premiums in the individual market goes not to paying medical bills but to bureaucracies dedicated to weeding out ''high risk'' applicants -- and keeping them uninsured.
 I'm somewhat skeptical about health care plans, like that proposed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, that propose covering gaps in the health insurance market with a series of patches, such as requiring that insurers offer policies to everyone at the same rate. But at least the authors of these plans are trying to help those most in need, and recognize that the market needs fixing. 
 Mr. Bush, on the other hand, is still peddling the fantasy that the free market, with a little help from tax cuts, solves all problems.
 What's really striking about Mr. Bush's remarks, however, is the tone. The stuff about providing ''incentives'' to buy insurance, the sneering description of good coverage as ''gold plated,'' is right-wing think-tank jargon. In the past Mr. Bush's speechwriters might have found less offensive language; now, they're not even trying to hide his fundamental indifference to the plight of less-fortunate Americans.

HEADLINE: Iran's Leader Stands by Nuclear Plans; Military to Hold Exercises

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
Iran's internal battle over President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's defiant rhetoric on Iran's nuclear program continued to simmer on Sunday, with the president repeating his vow to ignore international sanctions and a moderate daily newspaper warning of Iran's increasing isolation. 
 Speaking to reporters in Parliament, Mr. Ahmadinejad described the United Nations Security Council sanctions resolution as ''a rusty instrument'' that ''has no effect.''
 ''The resolution was born dead,'' he said. ''Even if they issue 10 more such resolutions it will not affect Iran's economy and politics.''
 He promised to continue Iran's nuclear program, saying other countries ''should know that the nuclear program is our red line,'' the television news reported.
 He made those comments days after two hard-line daily newspapers close to Iran's supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called on Mr. Ahmadinejad to distance himself from the nuclear issue, a sign that the president's his political capital may be declining as his country comes under increasing international pressure. The newspapers accused him of using inflammatory language.
 On Sunday, a third newspaper, the daily Kargozaran, which represents the views of moderate forces in the country, warned that international opposition against Iran was reaching an alarming level.
 ''It appears that the pressure against Iran is increasing, and, unlike an optimistic view, there is a tangible tendency among the countries in the region and in the international community toward America's policies against Iran,'' Jalal Khoshchehreh, the foreign editor, wrote. 
 The Security Council passed a sanctions resolution on Dec. 23 intended to curb Iran's uranium enrichment and missile programs. The United States and some European nations have said that Iran's nuclear program is for creating nuclear weapons. Iran contends that the program is peaceful.
 In what appears to be a response to increasing Western military pressure, the Revolutionary Guards will test-fire missiles in a three-day military exercise expected to begin Monday, state-run television said. The military will fire Zelzal and Fajr-5 missiles near Garmsar, 60 miles southeast of Tehran.
 The maneuvers, the first since the resolution was passed, followed the recent American decision to deploy a second aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf, effectively doubling the United States presence there, and to extend deployments of Patriot antimissile defense systems in Kuwait and Qatar. The British Navy is also sending more ships to the gulf.
 Also on Sunday, Mr. Ahmadinejad proposed a budget for the next year of the Iranian calendar, which begins on March 21, based on a significantly lower price of oil. Iran's budget is heavily dependent on oil revenues, and Mr. Ahmadinejad's budget last year was based on a price of $44 a barrel.
 The budget he presented to Parliament on Sunday reduces the price to $33, allowing a wide cushion in case oil prices continue to fall from their current level of about $52 a barrel.
 ''It is signal to our enemies, saying, 'We are ready, and we will manage the country even if you lower the oil prices,' '' Mr. Ahmadinejad said.

HEADLINE: Bush Expected to Make Call For Improved Fuel Economy

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD; Micheline Maynard contributed reporting from Detroit.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
There is widespread anticipation, inside government and outside, that President Bush will call for better fuel economy in his State of the Union address on Tuesday.
 The White House has posed questions to the Transportation Department about various options. One idea under consideration, government officials and car company executives who have consulted with the White House say, is to do away with the existing system of fleet averages, as has already happened with light trucks, and set a standard for each vehicle, based on its ''footprint,'' or distance between the wheels.
The president asked for the authority to do that last year, but Congressional Democrats rejected his request, saying the White House should use its existing power to simply raise the average. A standstill has resulted.
 The federal official in charge of gasoline mileage rules, Nicole R. Nason, has been telling members of Congress that when the current rules for car mileage were set, in 1975, she was 5 years old. Ms. Nason, administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, says she hopes that when her 5-year-old daughter starts driving, the standard will be higher. But that hope has not been enough to budge either side. 
 Raising the number from the current 27.5 miles per gallon would cause hundreds more highway deaths each year because automakers would meet the goal by moving to smaller cars, the administration argues. It also says that the system puts an undue burden on companies that specialize in large cars -- that is to say, American automakers.
 A problem for the Democrats is that, once there is no fleet average, the debate gets murkier because there is no single number to argue over. Simply reforming the system without setting specific goals is ''a license for obfuscation,'' said Clarence M. Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety, which monitors the auto industry and government safety regulators.
 Critics are pushing hard. Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who wants to increase fuel economy, said: ''Our problem in dealing with the Bush administration is that when they want to send troops to fight for oil, they do that whether they have the authority or not. When you ask them to reduce the need for oil, suddenly they're concerned about authority.'' 
 Higher-mileage cars can be just as safe as gas-guzzlers, Mr. Markey said, and to argue otherwise would mean ''that the Ford Escape hybrid is less safe than the regular Ford Escape.'' He plans to reintroduce a bill that would push the standard up by one mile per gallon per year for the first 10 years, and 4 percent per year thereafter. 
 The car portion of the Corporate Average Fuel Economy system, known as CAFE, has not changed since 1990, and the rule governing pickups, vans and sport utility vehicles is only slowly changing. Mr. Bush, however, is expected to take steps to encourage the development of batteries used to power hybrid-electric vehicles and further raise production of ethanol. 
 Established in 1975 after the Arab oil embargo, the system set a minimum standard for cars twice as high as the average at the time, pushing the standard to 27.5 miles per gallon in 1985. After minor adjustments from 1985 to 1990, the car standard has been frozen at 27.5 since 1990, first by Congressional order and now by a dispute over how the rules should be structured. 
 Over that 17-year period, domestic oil production has declined nearly a third, to 5.2 million barrels a day from 7.4 million. As demand has grown, imports have risen by more than two-thirds to fill the gap, to 10.1 million barrels a day from 5.9 million. Ethanol, liquids from coal and tar sands are all possible alternatives, but none will make major contributions in the near future; using less oil will require reducing driving or using vehicles with better gasoline mileage.
 The rule has produced unintended consequences. For example, it led car makers to redefine many household vehicles as ''trucks,'' because those had a more lenient standard. And automakers got credit under the system for building vehicles that could run on ethanol or other alternatives, even if the vehicles actually ran on gasoline. 
 And the window sticker has added a wry phrase to the American vocabulary: Your actual mileage may vary. Last year, in an effort to fix that, the E.P.A. reduced the mileage promised by the sticker.
 Last spring, under the ''footprint'' system for light trucks, Ms. Nason's agency set rules for model years 2008 through 2011. 
 The rules will push a typical Ford Explorer to 25.2 miles per gallon in 2011, from 19.4 in the 2007 model year, as measured by the Environmental Protection Agency. A PT Cruiser (which Daimler-Chrysler has classified as a light truck, helping it meet the truck average) to 28.1 miles per gallon in 2011, up from 27.4 in 2007. 
 (Both Ford and Daimler-Chrysler have the option of complying with the old rules based on a fleet average rather than the new vehicle-by-vehicle rule, which takes effect between model years 2008 and 2011.)
 The industry's official position is that the decision should be left to the highway traffic safety administration. Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents all the major companies except Honda, said, ''They're supposed to crunch the data and come up with a sweet spot, between affordability, safety concerns, jobs, and technology, and come up with the number.''
 The technology to go farther on a gallon of gas is no secret, but it costs money that Detroit auto companies have been loath to spend, especially now that they all have financial problems. For years, the automakers have argued that fuel economy is not a priority for buyers, and they have built a product line that follows that assessment. 
 Robert Heavenrich Jr., who retired last year as a fuel economy researcher at the E.P.A.'s Ann Arbor laboratories, said there was lots of room for modernization. More modern technology would use less fuel to do the same work. For example, Mr. Heavenrich said, he drives a 1985 General Motors Sierra Cutlass with a 231-cubic-inch engine. ''You can go down to a Buick dealer today and get that same engine-transmission combination,'' he said. 
 Mr. Heavenrich said that many Japanese cars used a hardware-software combination that allowed some cylinders to shut down during periods of low demand, like highway cruising, to save fuel, but that American manufacturers had generally not incorporated that innovation because it would raise production costs.
 The E.P.A. report on fuel economy trends that Mr. Heavenrich produced annually until last year said that mileage would be about 30 percent higher if buyers would settle for the vehicle size and performance characteristics that prevailed in the mid-1980s. But what sells is heavier, zippier cars.
 To some extent, though, consumers have voted for higher standards. The actual average fuel economy for cars sold in the 2005 model year, the most recent one for which numbers are available, was just over 30 miles per gallon.


CORRECTION-DATE: January 30, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article on Jan. 22 about the likelihood that President Bush's State of the Union address would call for increasing the fuel efficiency of cars referred incorrectly to the use of a technology by American and Japanese carmakers to save fuel by shutting down some engine cylinders when they are not needed. It is American companies, not Japanese ones, that are the largest users. (The White House set a target of improving fuel economy by 4 percent a year, beginning in the 2010 model year for cars and the 2012 model year for light trucks, according to materials released with the speech.)

HEADLINE: Election Ad Aggravates a Racial Divide in Atlanta

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
The nastiness of the 2006 campaign season has largely died away, forgotten amid the swearing-in ceremonies and gavel transfers of a new political landscape. But in this normally resilient city, one 30-second radio advertisement for a relatively obscure county race has lingered uncomfortably in people's minds.
 In the advertisement, Atlanta's three most prominent black leaders, Mayor Shirley Franklin, Representative John Lewis and Andrew Young, the politician and civil rights leader, evoked the police dogs and water hoses of the civil rights movement to urge voters not to support a Republican candidate for the Fulton County Commission. Though the candidate was not named in the advertisement, the three leaders, who are all Democrats, warned that right-wing Republicans would ''turn back the clock'' on equality and undo the efforts of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and others.
''Your very life,'' Mr. Lewis said in the advertisement's conclusion, ''may depend on it.'' 
 Even now, weeks later, the resentment fueled by the advertisement is being harnessed in a campaign to change the boundaries of Fulton County, and split off its predominantly white northern section, and city politicians have warned that the advertisement has poisoned relations with the Republican-dominated State Legislature.
 While Democrats argued that the advertisement was just the sort of politicking that their opponents long ago perfected, Republicans called it a race-baiting low blow. Many took the advertisement's suggestion of violence -- and the involvement of Ms. Franklin, who is generally admired for her ability to unite ideological opponents -- very personally. 
 ''People were killed back then,'' State Representative Barry Fleming, the House majority whip and a Republican from eastern Georgia, said in an interview last week. ''And she's saying that voting for a Republican for a local office is as bad as turning water hoses on people?''
 Many people did not learn of the advertisement until after Election Day, when it was replayed on the Fox News Network program ''Hannity & Colmes'' and right-wing talk radio, provoking a debate so pitched that Mr. Lewis, who was beaten during the 1965 voting rights march from Selma, Ala., felt compelled to declare on the op-ed page of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that he was not a racist.
 Ms. Franklin has apologized for causing offense, but has not backed down from the advertisement's message. She explained that she was speaking out not against all Republicans but the right-wing views that in Georgia led to a state constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, a bill requiring voters to show photo identification, and what she believes is a dangerous underfinancing of health care and other social services. Her own mother, she said, could not obtain an identification because she had no birth certificate -- a circumstance that is not unusual among blacks born decades ago in the South. (The voter ID law was blocked in court.)
 The advertisement appeared in an election cycle in which one Republican mailer distributed in the Atlanta area said, ''Democrats win elections by lying and stealing,'' further inflaming tensions.
 ''You want to talk to me about being outraged?'' Ms. Franklin said in a recent interview. ''I am really outraged.''
 Mr. Lewis has also offered an apology and defense of the advertisement, as has John Eaves, a Democrat and the newly elected Fulton County Commission chairman, whose campaign it supported. 
 Mr. Young did not return a phone call requesting comment.
 Some viewed the advertisement as a violation of Atlanta's central ethos: that of racial harmony. Although Georgia was no stranger to racial violence, they pointed out that hoses and police dogs were not used to quell Atlanta's civil rights demonstrations. 
 ''There are so many painful ironies here,'' said Howard Shook, a white Atlanta city councilman who has questioned Ms. Franklin about the advertisement. ''It would be an incredible irony if the mayor who did more than anyone else to bring people together had as one of her legacies a real fracturing of relations.'' 
 But if the advertisement wedged itself into the racial fault lines that lace Fulton County, it did not create them. Resentments in the mostly black county run so deep that in the northern third, which has a white majority, there is an active movement to split off and form a new county.
 Supporters of the split quickly seized on the radio spot, which supported Mr. Eaves, a black Democrat, over Lee Morris, a white Republican, for chairman of the County Commission.
 ''On Nov. 7 we face the most dangerous situation we ever have,'' Mr. Lewis said in the advertisement. ''If you think fighting off dogs and water hoses in the '60s was bad, imagine if we sit idly by and let the right-wing Republicans take control of the Fulton County Commission.''
 In the advertisement, Ms. Franklin referred to popular black leaders of the city's past. ''The efforts of Martin and Coretta King, Hosea Williams, Maynard Jackson and many others will be lost,'' Ms. Franklin said. ''That's why we must stand up and we must turn out the vote for the Democrats on Election Day.''
 Then Andrew Young said: ''And especially for John Eaves for Fulton County Commission chairman. Unless you want them to turn back the clock on equal rights and human rights and economic opportunity for all of us, vote for John Eaves as Fulton County chairman.''
 The advertisement's defenders have insisted that its critique was intentionally broad, invoking as evidence examples like the botched rescue effort following Hurricane Katrina and the high cost of prescription drugs. But its forum was narrow: Mr. Eaves's Republican opponent, Mr. Morris, is a moderate who describes himself as a pro-choice environmentalist who favors gay rights. To further complicate matters, he lives in Buckhead, the posh Atlanta neighborhood that for years felt ill-used by the city.
 Ms. Franklin had done much to repair that relationship, but the advertisement has fueled talk that Buckhead should withdraw from the city, taking its tax dollars to the theoretical new county. 
 ''We have loved Atlanta,'' wrote a wounded Bob Irvin, a former Republican state representative. ''But it has been revealed that Atlanta -- or at least its top political leadership -- doesn't love us.''
 Mr. Morris said he received more than 70 percent of the vote from Buckhead and the north, although he lost the November election by more than 10 percentage points. ''The real point here is how divided this county is,'' Mr. Morris said. 
 Earlier this month Glenn Delk, a lawyer who is white, used the words of Dr. King in an op-ed article published by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, supporting an independent Buckhead: ''When the day comes that the city of Buckhead opens its doors, I will gladly tell Franklin, Lewis and Young, and all others who've used race to obtain and keep political power for 30 years -- in the words of the Rev. Martin Luther King -- 'Free at last, free at last, thank God almighty, I'm free at last.' ''

Author(s):
Michelle Sale, The New York Times Learning Network
Javaid Khan, The Bank Street College of Education in New York City
Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour
Objectives:
Students will: 
 1. Examine a picture of a Cuban billboard and discuss what the billboard signifies and what they know about Cuba.
 2. Consider the impact of the end of Fidel Castro's rule by reading and discussing the article "What Was Once Theirs."
 3. Research and create posters about a particular time period in the history of American-Cuban relations.
 4. Write essays speculating on the future relationship of the United States and Cuba through the eyes of a particular person. 
Resources / Materials:
-student journals
 -pens/pencils
 -paper
 -classroom board
 -copies of the article "What Was Once Theirs," found online at http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20070122monday.html (one per student) 
 -resources about foreign relations between the United States and Cuba (global history textbooks, reference books, computers with Internet access, etc.)
 -large sheets of construction paper or poster board (one per group)
 -markers (enough for students to share)
Activities / Procedures:
1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: At the beginning of class, distribute copies of or project the image (without the caption) found online at http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2007/01/21/weekinreview/21depalma_CA2.650.jpg. In their journals, students respond to the following prompt (written on the board): "What does this picture show? In Spanish, it says 'Fidel is a country.' Who is Fidel? What country is this in? What can you infer about this country from this picture? What do you think life is like here? Why do you think this billboard was put up in the first place?" After a few minutes, allow students time to share their answers. As a class, discuss what they already know about Cuba and Fidel Castro. Would a billboard like this ever appear in the United States? Why or why not? How do these countries compare?
 2. As a class, read and discuss the article "What Was Once Theirs" (http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20070122monday.html), focusing on the following questions: 
 a. Why did Anthony DePalma go to Guanabacoa, Cuba?
 b. Why did Francisco hesitate when Mr. DePalma asked to come into his home?
 c. What is the economic impact of Fidel Castro's revolution? Consider direct effects on the people living in Cuba, as well as the concerns of businesses and individuals living in the United States.
 d. What is a "gusano"? What are the connotations of this term?
 e. Why is it believed that most Cuban exiles will stay where they are living after Mr. Castro dies?
 f. How do hotels in Cuba illustrate the two-tiered currency system?
 g. What was the purpose, and for Mr. DePalma the significance, of the beer-filled water tanker?
 h. Why is Fidel Castro a source of Cuban pride?
 i. What does Mr. DePalma mean when he refers to Cuba's future as both "longed-for" and "dreaded"?
 3. Divide students into eight small groups. Explain to students that they will be researching the history of United States-Cuban relations and creating posters illustrating their findings. Assign each group one of the following time periods: 1901-1940, 1941-1950, 1951-1960, 1961-1970, 1971-1980, 1981-1990, 1991-2000, and 2001-present. Each group should examine the political and economic relationship between these countries. Information for each time period should include the following:
 -Major events and decisions that happened between the countries or within each country that influenced the nations' relationship
 -Key people
 -Changes that occurred as a result of each event or decision
 -Official political actions (treaties, embargoes, etc.)
 -Groups of people affected by each major event, decision, legal action, etc.
 Once research is completed, group members work together to create a poster illustrating the relationship between the United States and Cuba during their assigned time period. Each poster must include the years covered during their research, as well as events, decisions, people, and changes that took place. Pictures, drawings, maps, etc. may be used to explain the details included on the poster. Each poster should also include a metaphor or other representation that shows how one of the following groups of people may have felt during this time period: ordinary Cubans, Cuban nationalists, Cuban emigrants, second-generation Cuban-Americans, ordinary Americans, etc.
 When posters are completed, student groups present their work to the class. As a class, discuss how various groups of people have been affected over the course of this relationship.
 4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Individually, students write essays from the perspective of a an individual (an ordinary Cuban, a Cuban nationalist, a Cuban emigrant, a second-generation Cuban-American, an ordinary American, etc.) speculating on what might happen between the United States and Cuba after the Castro regime is over. They should draw on what they learned from the Times article and the poster presentations and consider how the United States could benefit from a positive relationship with Cuba, as well as how Cuba could benefit from a positive relationship with the United States, and what the various barriers are to mending the relationship.
Further Questions for Discussion:
-How can communism impede modernization?
 -What is an embargo? How do goods enter a country that is under embargo?
 -Are you or members of your family immigrants? If so, would you or they ever return to your (their) native country? Why or why not?
 -How, if at all, does a political relationship affect a social relationship between citizens of different countries?
Evaluation / Assessment:
Students will be evaluated based on completion of journal entries, participation in class and group discussions, thorough completion of research and creation of posters, and well-supported, thoughtful essays. 
Vocabulary:
triumphed, demise, confiscated, exploited, bolster, girding, enclave, diaspora, claimants, ignoble, ceded, strident, subsidized, embargo, specter
Extension Activities:
1. Interview a Cuban immigrant about his or her feelings about the political, social and economic impact of Castro's death on Cuba. How will this person feel when he is gone? Will he or she return to Cuba? Why or why not? Write an article for your school's newspaper highlighting your findings.
 2. Create a two-column poster outlining the positive and negative effects of Fidel Castro's regime.
 3. Revisit the Elian Gonzalez story of 2000 (). Write an encyclopedia entry about the major events and facets of this story, including an explanation of the different opinions that turned this boy's story into such a controversial issue.
 4. Watch the slideshow "A Home That Once Was" http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2007/01/20/weekinreview/20070121_CUBA_SLIDESHOW_index.html. Write an essay about your experience with memories and nostalgia. How do you think Anthony DePalma's wife, Miriam, might feel about the recent photos her husband took of her childhood home?
Interdisciplinary Connections:
Economics - Research what an economy looks like in a communist country. Examine the economy of Cuba, China, Laos, North Korea or Vietnam, and compare it to the economy of a democratic nation. Prepare an oral presentation highlighting your findings.
 Geography - On a world map, highlight Cuba. Create a map key representing which countries have friendly relations with Cuba, and which are upholding the United States trade embargo. Color these countries accordingly.
 Media Studies - Create a collage of propaganda images from Cuba or a collection of communist countries and write a short analysis of the images.
 Teaching with The Times - Read the paper to find articles about immigrants in the United States. Compile them into a poster and write a brief description of the challenges and concerns of each group of people or person featured in each article.

HEADLINE: Scrambling To Get Hold Of a Passport 

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
The new requirement that Americans use a passport when they fly between the United States and any point in the Western Hemisphere has significantly increased demand for passports, testing the processing capabilities of federal offices, travel industry officials say.
 Particularly hard-hit by the new rule, effective today, they say, are business travelers trying to obtain a passport on an expedited, last-minute basis.
The last-minute passports are available through regional offices and passport service companies. But industry officials and the passport service companies say the government has greatly reduced the number of applications these companies can submit. In addition, they say the State Department's appointment system for expedited passports has been so overwhelmed by demand that it is often difficult, if not impossible, to get an appointment in a timely fashion. 
 These developments pose ''a real threat to the ability of American business to successfully compete in international commerce,'' warned Bill Connors, executive director of the National Business Travel Association, a trade group of corporate travel managers at the largest American companies. 
 Steve Diehl, vice president of business development for CIBT, one of the largest passport service companies, argued that the United States should allow as many passports to be processed as quickly as possible. ''This is how deals are made, when people can travel at the drop of a hat,'' he said. 
 Imposed by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, the new passport rule, called the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, was intended to strengthen border security. Until now, air travelers needed only a birth certificate and a government-issued photo identification, like a driver's license, to go to Canada, the Caribbean or Mexico. People who travel on cruise ships or in cars will not have to comply until probably next year. 
 According to the State Department, an estimated 27 percent of Americans currently carry a valid passport; it expects to issue 16 million to 18 million passports in its fiscal year 2007, ending Sept. 30, compared with 12.1 million in fiscal year 2006. In addition, department officials say, demand for passport processing was up 52 percent in the last quarter of 2006 from the period in 2005.
 The State Department insists that its offices are keeping up with the surging demand. Frank E. Moss, deputy assistant secretary of state for passport services, said last week that since late 2005, the department has hired 250 more adjudicators, who approve and process applications, and more contract workers. He said the department has also greatly expanded hours of operation at some regional passport processing offices. Of the 17 across the country, 14 are open to the public. The full list is available at travel.state.gov.
 ''We've been planning for the new passport requirements for two years, and with those preparations, we are meeting the unprecedented demand for American passports,'' Mr. Moss said.
 The State Department charges $97 for standard processing of a new passport and $67 for a renewal. It says each takes approximately six weeks. Expedited service is an extra $60 and is approximately four weeks quicker. In addition, certain passport offices let travelers who need same-day or next-day passports apply in person; appointments for these can be made by calling 877-487-2778.
 Officials from several passport service companies say this appointment system is not working as advertised. ''We get calls every day from people who try to go directly to the appointment line and can't secure an appointment that meets their departure date,'' Mr. Diehl said. ''Maybe it works in Norwalk, Conn., but not in New York.'' 
 Mr. Moss countered that the appointment system was working, and that in certain offices, appointments to obtain a same-day passport ''are not only available, but going unused.'' He added, ''If travelers need a passport for urgent travel, we will work with them so they won't miss their trip.''
 For fees ranging from $85 to $180 (discounted for corporate customers), passport service companies can help business travelers obtain passports in three days or less, though their ability to do so is becoming increasingly limited. 
 According to the National Association of Passport and Visa Services, a trade group, the nine regional passport offices most used by its members to process passports in two weeks or less reduced the number of applications each company can submit for such processing by 40 percent from 2002 to 2006. 
 Asked about these reductions, Mr. Moss said, ''We continue to make appointments for last-minute passport applications available, both to the general public and to private passport service companies.'' 
 The passport service companies say they are scrambling to accommodate existing customers, and some are even turning away new ones. 
 Jan Dvorak, president of Travisa Visa Service in Washington, said his company, which processes passports for corporations like DuPont and I.B.M., could no longer handle ''spontaneous'' requests for expedited passports. 
 ''The demand is incredible,'' he said. ''We're backlogged at least a week. And I don't anticipate any letdown for the rest of the year.'' 
 Christopher Davis, chief executive of G3 Visas and Passports, in Arlington, Va., said his company was having a ''difficult time servicing our corporate clients,'' including Yum Brands. Although Mr. Davis said G3 could still accommodate new business travelers who are not currently customers, he warned that unless the government increased passport service companies' processing capabilities, G3 might not be able to help new customers by the fourth quarter of this year ''if demand keeps up.''
 The National Association of Passport and Visa Services has been lobbying the State Department to increase the number of applications its members may submit for processing, enlisting trade groups like the business travel association, Travel Business Roundtable and Travel Industry Association of America in its efforts. The business travel association told the department in a letter last summer ''that passport services companies should receive, at a minimum, an increase in the number of passport applications commensurate with the increase in passport issuances that has occurred nationally since 2002.'' 
 The passport service companies' trade group met in November with a member of Mr. Moss's staff. Rob Smith, the group's executive director, said this was ''the first real dialogue'' the two sides have had. ''We're waiting to hear back about a future meeting,'' he said last week.
 Asked about the trade group's campaign, Mr. Moss said: ''We understand their concerns about the current requirements, and are trying to be responsive.''
 In the meantime, travelers who cannot be accommodated by the larger passport service companies can seek the help of smaller ones. According to Mr. Smith, over 200 are registered with the State Department.
 To find a reputable one, Porter Briggs, president of A Briggs Passport and Visa Expeditors in Washington, said it was vital to identify the company's location. ''If it's not in a mainstream city, it can't deal with passports and visas,'' he said.
 Regardless of how a passport application is processed, Fatemeh Le Tellier, director of marketing for another passport service company, Travel Document Systems, in Washington, urged travelers to make sure all their documents are in order. 
 ''You don't want to submit your application and then have it rejected,'' she said.

NOT A BAD YEAR FOR AIRLINES -- After $35 billion in net losses from 2001 to 2005, the domestic airline industry is expected to earn about $4 billion in 2007 and to report earnings of $2 billion to $3 billion for 2006, the Air Transport Association said. But the Champagne corks are not popping yet. John Heimlich, the trade association's chief economist, noted that despite cost cutting, reduction in capacity and a decrease in the number of aircraft types flown, ''debt levels remain high, leaving airlines vulnerable to fuel spikes'' and other risks like a recession, natural disaster or another significant terrorist attack. 


FOR PASSENGERS, FULLER PLANES -- A reason for the brightening prospects for airlines' bottom lines is that passengers are flying in planes that are, on average, more full than at any time in decades and are paying more. According to the Air Transport Association, yields for seven major airlines (that is a rough estimate of the revenue earned for each mile flown) rose an average of 8.9 percent on domestic routes in 2006. Yields were up 5.9 percent on hotly competitive trans-Atlantic routes, despite a sharp increase in overall seat capacity across the Atlantic among both domestic and foreign carriers.

FOR EMPLOYEES, LESS BAD NEWS -- United States airlines employed 1.6 percent fewer workers in November compared with November 2005 -- though that was the smallest year-to-year drop since February 2005, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics of the Transportation Department. The seven major so-called network carriers employed 263,000 full-time workers in November, which was about two-thirds of the total employees for the domestic industry. Low-cost carriers employed about 18 percent and regional carriers accounted for the remainder. As an indication of how hard the airlines' work forces were hit in the last four years, the network carriers had 361,000 full time employees in November 2002.

RANKING WORLD HOTELS -- World travelers responding online to the annual Travelers Choice survey by the consumer travel Web site Tripadvisor.com have ranked hotels in a multitude of categories, including the 100 top luxury hotels. For example, the top five luxury hotels in the United States were: Sofitel, N.Y.; French Quarter Inn, Charleston, S.C.; Four Seasons Hotel, San Francisco; Omni San Francisco; and Reunion Resort & Club, Celebration, Fla., according to the readers of Tripadvisor. The full lists of categories and rankings (including a list of what Tripadvisor readers rank as the ''10 Dirtiest Hotels in the U.S.'') are available at Tripadvisor.com/travelerschoice.

ET CETERA -- American Airlines has relocated to Terminal 2 at Narita International Airport in Japan, partly to help passengers connecting to China and elsewhere in Asia on four of its fellow Oneworld Alliance members in that terminal. American also plans to open a new 13,000-square-foot Admirals Club lounge in its new terminal. Singapore Airlines introduced a $360 million initiative to upgrade its cabin last week with the start of service on Boeing 777-300ER aircraft between San Francisco and Singapore. The new flat-bed first-class seat is 35 inches wide, which Singapore said is the biggest in the industry. In business class, the lie-flat seats are 30 inches wide and the new coach seats 19 inches wide, which Singapore says is two inches wider than the industry average. The in-flight entertainment system offers more than 1,000 on-demand options, including movies, television shows, interactive games and audio CDs. JOE SHARKEY

HEADLINE: Ford Shows a Hybrid Car With 2 Modes: Electric or Electric

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
Move over, gas-electric hybrid. Ford has a new entry, the electric-electric hybrid.
 The vehicle, based on a Ford Edge crossover, runs on electricity from a battery, charged either from a standard wall socket or from an on-board fuel cell. It has two highly visible fueling ports, both on the driver's side of the vehicle. One is a hose coupling for hydrogen gas, and the other is an electric connection like the one on a leaf blower, ready for a standard three-prong extension cord.
''I told the design team to make them prominent,'' said Mujeeb I. Ijaz, the manager of fuel-cell vehicle engineering at Ford. 
 Energy specialists say they think the plug-in hybrid could cut oil dependence by allowing a car to go the first 25 or 30 miles each day on energy drawn from the power grid, most of which is generated from coal. That would cover the entire commute of most drivers on most days.
 But almost all plug-in hybrid designs have a gasoline engine as a backup, to provide range. The plug-in Edge is the first to use a fuel cell instead, according to Ford.
 Marrying a fuel cell to a battery allows the fuel cell to run at a constant rate, which is gentler on the hardware than having it cycle up to its maximum when the car is accelerating and then down to nothing. And it means that the fuel cell can be much smaller, because it does not need to be sized to handle maximum load.
 The plug-in hybrid Edge has a 35-kilowatt fuel cell and a 130-kilowatt electric motor drive.
 Mr. Ijaz said that fuel cells were less expensive than they used to be, but were still near $1,000 for a kilowatt of capacity, about 10 times the price of a kilowatt from a battery, and 30 times the price of a kilowatt from a gasoline engine. 
 The finished product (of which there is exactly one) illustrates the economics of hydrogen. At $5 a kilo of hydrogen (which is the selling price at a demonstration fueling station here, but probably far below actual cost), a dollar's worth will push the Edge about eight miles. But a consumer who charged the batteries at 10 cents a kilowatt-hour, roughly the national average retail price, would go 25 miles on a dollar's worth.
 (A gasoline vehicle that gets 20 miles a gallon on unleaded regular at $2.25 a gallon would go a little less than 9 miles on a dollar's worth.)
 The Edge was built as an experiment, not as a money-saver. Partly financed by the Energy Department, it cost about $2 million. The assistant secretary of energy for conservation and renewables, Andrew Karsner, is scheduled to appear at the Washington Auto Show on Tuesday to discuss the Edge and other vehicles. 
 Among its disadvantages is a hydrogen tank that takes up about seven times as much space as a gasoline tank that would provide the same useable energy.
 The Edge has switches that allow the driver to plan a trip and do the last few miles on battery, with the fuel cell shut down, to maximize use of electricity from the grid, not from hydrogen. The tailpipe emits only low-temperature water vapor. On Sunday afternoon, at 32 degrees, as Ford raced to get photos of the vehicle before the snow started, Mr. Ijaz aptly described the tailpipe as looking like a dryer vent. In warmer weather the vapor would not be so visible.
 Running in cold weather has another complication; the Edge uses electric resistance heat, supplemented by waste heat from the fuel-cell stack. The air-conditioner is also electric. Both cut slightly into range. With fuel compressed to 5,000 pounds per square inch, range is 200 miles (plus 25 miles on electricity stored from the initial battery charge); Ford, like the rest of the fuel-cell industry, plans to shift to fuel cells that use hydrogen stored at 10,000 p.s.i.
 In city and highway traffic, the car, like most electrics, has no vibration, and the tire sounds are prominent because there is no engine noise to mask them. The sound of a compressor that pumps air through the fuel cell is also prominent.

HEADLINE: Shares Fall on Downgrades of Tech Issues

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street stumbled lower yesterday as growing concerns over technology companies led jittery investors to pull money out of the market ahead of earnings reports this week.
 The market has been vulnerable to erratic trading, with investors cautious about the direction of the economy and results. The technology sector so far has been knocked down the most, after outlooks last week from Apple and Intel fell below the Street's expectations.
With industry leaders like Qualcomm and Microsoft releasing their financial results later this week, many investors are bracing for disappointing reports. 
 ''The market is nervous,'' said Joseph Ranieri, managing director in equity trading at Canaccord Adams. ''We've had a few good quarters in a row in tech land. The problem with having good quarters is, it gets harder and harder to impress.''
 Blue-chip stocks also were dragged down by a downgrade of Boeing by an analyst at Wachovia who cited possible delays in aircraft orders from the jet maker. Shares of Boeing fell $3.03, or 3.4 percent, to $85.60.
 In all, earnings reports and economic data this year have signaled growth that is cooling, but not so quickly that it is squeezing corporate profits. This would normally be good news for the stock market, but investors have been retreating -- wisely, many market watchers say -- on signs they may have gotten ahead of themselves late last year, when the Dow Jones industrial average began racing into record territory.
 The Dow Jones industrials fell 88.37 points, or 0.7 percent, to 12,477.16. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 7.55 points, or 0.53 percent, to 1,422.95, and the Nasdaq composite index lost 20.24 points, or 0.83 percent, to 2,431.07.
 The stock indexes rebounded slightly from the session's lows after crude oil resumed its downtrend, and American Express reported that its profit rose last quarter thanks to robust spending during the holiday season. American Express lost 3 cents, to $58.06.
 Consumer spending could be bolstered further by falling fuel costs, as the price of crude oil is 16 percent lower this year. Crude oil for delivery in February fell 86 cents, to settle at $51.13 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after briefly rising above $53.44.
 Relief about the decline of oil was not enough yesterday to offset technology-related worries, which were kindled by analyst downgrades of Cisco Systems, the networking equipment maker; Motorola, the cellphone maker; and the computer maker Dell. Cisco fell 17 cents, to $26.53; Motorola slipped 55 cents, to $18.72; and Dell dropped 53 cents, to $24.49.
 Despite the market's recent aversion to technology stocks, the Dow, the S.& P. and the technology-dominated Nasdaq are all still up on the year. Stocks have the potential to rebound, especially as earnings season winds down, Mr. Ranieri said.
 A separate worry weighing on the market is interest rates. A report from the Chicago region's Federal Reserve Bank indicated above-trend growth in December for the first time in four months -- yet another argument for Fed policy makers to keep rates steady, or perhaps even increase them.
 In the bond market, the price of the 10-year Treasury note rose 4/32, to 9830/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, declined to 4.76 percent, from 4.78 percent.
 Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auctions for three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Illinois Is Putting Lottery on Block For Quick Payoff 

BYLINE: By CHARLES DUHIGG and JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
The state of Illinois yesterday took the first steps in selling its state lottery system, hoping to attract as much as $10 billion from investors who, in return, would own a monopoly that could turn out to be the biggest jackpot yet. 
 The sale, which may occur as early as the spring, would not be the first privatization of public property -- both Chicago and Indiana have recently earned billions of dollars by signing long-term leases with private companies to run toll roads. But the proposed lottery sale is almost certain be one of the largest privatizations of a state-run program, and it raises concerns that states, some of them critically short of cash, are selling valuable assets that could otherwise provide consistent streams of revenue.
Under the proposed sale, Illinois would receive a multibillion-dollar one-time payment, and the lottery's new owners would receive all revenue and profit for 75 years. 
 Indiana is also considering selling its lottery, and bids are due later this month. That sale is expected to raise more than $1 billion upfront and annual payments of $200 million. Midway Airport in Chicago, toll roads in Pennsylvania and the New Jersey Turnpike are all potentially on the block. 
 Illinois officials say selling the lottery, which collected revenue of about $2 billion and profits around $630 million last year, will give the business marketing and technological heft that the government cannot now provide.
 ''This is fundamentally a retail business, and governments are not equipped to manage retail businesses,'' said John Filan, the chief operating officer of the state of Illinois. ''Gaming is getting so competitive around the world that we're worried our revenues could go down unless there is retail expertise.'' 
 Opponents of lottery privatization disagree. They argue that many states, including California, New York and Florida, have hired companies like GTech, of Providence, R.I., to run their lotteries, gaining private-industry expertise without selling a valuable asset. Despite its public ownership, Illinois increased its lottery's revenue by more than 15 percent from 2003 to 2005, according to the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries.
 ''These are very healthy businesses,'' said Melissa Kearney, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Maryland. ''It's unclear exactly what is gained by selling a lottery, except for a huge pot of money that legislators can start spending right away.''
 Other critics say there is also a risk of selling the lottery for too little. ''If it turns out this thing is worth more than $10 billion, then they've denied future citizens hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenues just so they can temporarily plug a hole in the dike,'' said Dave Schulz, director of the Infrastructure Technology Institute at Northwestern University, and Chicago's budget director in the mid-1980s.
 But lotteries' declining profitability could make a high price tag more attractive. 
 ''Lotteries used to be highly profitable,'' said Michael Jones, who ran the Illinois lottery from 1981 to 1985 and is now the director of Independent Lottery Research in Chicago. ''Nowadays, that profitability as a percentage of sales has declined dramatically.''
 Taking lotteries out of state hands, however, could raise tricky policy issues as private operators strive for maximum revenue. 
 ''As a government agency, lotteries are bound by the duty of care that a government has to its citizens,'' said Rachel Volberg, director of Gemini Research, based in Northampton, Mass. ''A private operator is not bound by any duty of care.'' Private lottery operators could be more likely to advertise aggressively, Ms. Volberg said, particularly among people susceptible to gambling addiction and those who can ill afford to spend money on lottery tickets. 
 Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois, a Democrat, first floated the idea of privatizing the state's lottery while seeking re-election last May. At the time, Mr. Blagojevich estimated that the sale's proceeds would finance a four-year building and education plan for schools. Under the proposal, $6 billion would be set aside to provide the schools with $650 million a year for the next 18 years, slightly more than what they received last year in lottery income.
 At the time he made the proposal, Illinois Republicans charged that his real motivation was to keep State Senator James Meeks, an independent from Chicago, from entering the gubernatorial race. Mr. Meeks, an influential black leader, had threatened a challenge if education financing was not increased..
 Selling the Illinois lottery would require approval from the state Legislature, which, in turn would determine how the proceeds are spent.
 Many states banned privately operated lotteries after a series of political scandals in the 1800s. Starting in the 1960s, public lotteries began to reappear. In 2005, state lotteries took in more than $52 billion, according to the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries.
 State governments still typically avoid some marketing tactics that they consider politically objectionable. Massachusetts, for instance, banned almost all lottery advertising in the late 1990s, after voters and politicians complained that the tactics victimized poorer residents. 
 But that may change if lotteries are privately owned. 
 ''Right now, states don't sell lottery tickets in adult book stores, or next door to welfare offices, because lottery directors know that they can be fired by politicians,'' said I. Nelson Rose, a professor at Whittier Law School in Costa Mesa, Calif., who studies gambling, and has advised the Illinois Gaming Board on other matters. ''You'll won't see such hesitation among private companies. Those are great places to sell.''
 Illinois officials say that even after the lottery is sold, the new owners would be required to comply with state regulations regarding advertising and sales. 
 But Mr. Rose pointed out that once private owners controlled the state lottery, they would have an incentive to lobby legislators to loosen the rules.
 ''Illinois has riverboat casinos and horse racing, and they've becoming major political powers,'' he said. ''The lottery's new owners won't be any different.''
 Other recent municipal privatization projects in Indianapolis, New Orleans, Atlanta and elsewhere have struggled with charges of corruption and with customer complaints.
 In Atlanta, residents began complaining about brown brackish water after a French company, Suez, was hired to run the city's water system in 1999. Another French company, Veolia, was hired to run public waterworks in New Orleans, but has been accused of illegally discharging sewage into the Mississippi River on dozens of occasions. In Indianapolis, officials had to cancel school sessions and ask citizens to boil their drinking water in 2005 after a failure at a privately run water-treatment plant.
 Goldman Sachs and UBS are advising the state of Illinois in the current dealings. Mark Florian, a managing director in the Goldman Sachs Municipal Finance and Infrastructure Group, said that demand would come from bidders already in the industry as well as funds that invest in public projects and in private equity funds flush with cash. Another alternative on the table would be an initial public offering.
 Goldman Sachs, which has a $6.5 billion infrastructure fund, will not bid, Mr. Filan said.
 And Mr. Jones of Independent Lottery Research added, ''It's about time that lottery performance, lottery potential and where lottery funds go become something that the people who play the lottery debate and ask questions about, whether it's in a privatization scenario or in reaction to a privatization scenario.''

HEADLINE: In Arab Capital of U.S., Ethnic Divide Remains

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., Jan. 19 

 BODY:
After the longtime mayor, Michael A. Guido, died of cancer here in December, a flock of Arab-American candidates stepped forward in the hopes of claiming City Hall. 
 But despite the fact that roughly one in three Dearborn residents is of Arab origin, most of the Arab-American candidates had dropped out by mid-January. Poll numbers showed that none of them could win.
Internal rivalries echoing those that beset the Arab world, along with the general electorate's lingering unease about Muslims, combined to derail what many here had hoped would be the chance to prove that Arab-Americans had arrived politically -- at least in Dearborn, their unofficial capital in this country. 
 ''One day, an Arab-American will be in office at the top, but this will not be the time,'' said Osama Siblani, the burly publisher of the weekly Arab American News, whose friends tease him about his perennial ''this is the time'' editorial at every election. ''There is no doubt that electing an Arab-American to the City Hall in Dearborn would have sent a strong message to the rest of the country that Arab-Americans are part of the political process. Would we want it? Yes. Is it possible? No.'' 
 Mayor Guido had something of a checkered reputation among Arab-Americans here, not least because his first campaign, in 1985, distributed a leaflet promising to address the ''Arab problem.'' Things improved somewhat over the years -- he visited Lebanon, and Arab-Americans donated heavily to his campaigns. 
 But last summer, he criticized the ''mobs'' protesting Israel's attacks against civilian targets in Lebanon and sent the Arab-American community a $23,000 bill for overtime for police officers and firefighters during the demonstration. The bill, sent to a coalition of Arab-American groups, resulted in a free-speech lawsuit. 
 When Mr. Guido died, several Arab-American candidates stepped forward, including a well-known local prosecutor and a former North American middleweight boxing champion who recently starred on ''The Contender,'' a reality television series. An intensive vetting of candidates for the Feb. 27 election was started under the auspices of the Lebanese American Heritage Club so that the entire community could unite behind just one contender. 
 That did not happen, not least because the front-runner, John O'Reilly Jr., having been president of the City Council for 17 years, knew something about the internal rivalries pitting the Lebanese against the Iraqis against the Yemenis. Mr. O'Reilly, known as Jack, set out to separate the Yemenis from the rest of the Arab community here and succeeded in winning their early enthusiasm. 
 Arab-American candidates ''come to us and say 'salaam aleikum' and a few other Arabic words to play on our emotions,'' said Nass Al Rayashi, one of the founders of the Yemeni American Political Action Committee, using the Arabic greeting of ''peace be upon you.'' The committee was formed in March 2005 in large part because the Yemenis felt the Lebanese had dominated civic life at their expense. 
 The Yemenis, concentrated in the somewhat gritty South Side neighborhood sandwiched between the sprawling Ford Rouge plant and Woodmere Cemetery, want a candidate focused on local concerns. These include a lack of parking at the Dix Street mosque and pollution emitted by neighboring industrial areas including the Ford vehicle factory, which drew Arabs here for work for decades, but where fewer and fewer are finding jobs. 
 ''Don't tell us you go to Ali so-and-so's house to eat Arab food,'' Mr. Rayashi added. ''This is America, this is the melting pot. Our interests should be what is good for us here.'' 
 There has long been a division between the economically better off western side of Dearborn and the eastern side. In the old days, recalled Mr. O'Reilly, whose father was mayor from 1978 to 1985, the division was known as the ''cake eaters'' versus the ''factory rats.''
 Now some see it as more like the Muslims versus everybody else.
 ''People are a little bit afraid of them,'' Mr. O'Reilly said, attributing it partly to traditional Christian education that he said had long taught that ''their philosophy of religion was 'convert to Islam or die.' ''
 The fact that Arab-Americans in Dearborn are prone to demonstrations, including protests against last summer's war in Lebanon and the recent hanging of Saddam Hussein, only adds to the unease, he said. 
 Although more affluent Arab-American lawyers and real estate developers have gradually integrated the western part of the city, an ethnic divide remains. Abed Hammoud, a lead lawyer in the Wayne County prosecutor's office and the favorite of the Arab community until he withdrew from the mayor's race on Jan. 12, said he was met with surprise when he knocked on doors in western Dearborn. 
 ''People reacted like I had come from the moon,'' said Mr. Hammoud, 41, a kinetic figure with receding salt and pepper hair who left Lebanon in 1985. ''They said things like 'It's good of you to come to this end of town,' or they asked me about the people 'over there' and they meant the other side of town.''
 The Arab American Political Action Committee, which Mr. Hammoud and Mr. Siblani, the newspaper publisher, helped found in 1998 largely to inspire Arabs to run and vote, commissioned a poll to assess Mr. Hammoud's chances. They found Mr. O'Reilly, suddenly alone in the non-Arab field, commanding an unbeatable 65 percent lead to Mr. Hammoud's roughly 30 percent. They consoled themselves with the fact that Mr. Hammoud was likely to do better this time as a candidate than he did in his first mayoral primary, which fell on the unfortunate date of Sept. 11, 2001. 
 But basically the results suggested that at best he would capture the Arab vote -- not enough to win the entire city of 100,000. 
 Time alone may favor the Arab-Americans here. Mr. Hammoud cited numbers showing that in 1998, there were 60,000 registered voters in the city, 8,500 of them Arab-Americans. Today, it is 14,500 out of 57,000, and at least 60 percent of high school students are Arab-Americans. 
 ''People look at an Arab now, and the first thing that pops into their head is terrorism,'' said Tarick Salmaci, the boxer, who withdrew from the race. ''We want to change that. Arab-Americans have to become political figures to change that.

HEADLINE: U.S. Moves to Cut Flood Risk From Kentucky Dam

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: FRANKFORT, Ky., Jan. 22 

 BODY:
Fearing a dam break that could cause catastrophic flooding in Kentucky and Tennessee, the Army Corps of Engineers began lowering the water level on Lake Cumberland on Monday.
 The measure was intended to reduce pressure on the weakened 240-foot-high Wolf Creek Dam, said Lt. Col. Steven J. Roemhildt, commander of the Nashville office of the Corps of Engineers. 
''We must take this emergency action to reduce risk to the public and to the dam itself,'' Colonel Roemhildt said in a statement.
 Bill Peoples, a spokesman for the Corps of Engineers, said that failure of the dam was not imminent. But Mr. Peoples said evacuation plans should be readied in Nashville and other downstream communities. 
 Officials in Nashville, with a metropolitan area of 1.4 million people, said that they had a plan in place for any flooding but that any threat would be minimized once the lake's level was lowered.
 The dam, which has a concrete core surrounded by earth, was built near Jamestown in the early 1950s. The lake it holds back, Lake Cumberland, was created as part of a federal plan to control floods along the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers.
 Colonel Roemhildt said water had been seeping under the dam and eroding the limestone on which the concrete rested. He said crews were pumping grout into the ground to counter the erosion.
 The level of the lake will be initially reduced to 680 feet, The Louisville Courier-Journal reported, 10 feet below the normal level this time of year. 
 Reducing the water level could have an ecological and economic effect. Colonel Roemhildt said fish kills could be expected because of a rise in water temperature, and boats at marinas could be left high and dry.
 George Ward, the Kentucky commerce secretary, said that as many as 90 percent of the boat launching ramps would be unusable because they would not reach the water's surface.
 Lake Cumberland, about 100 miles southeast of Louisville, and one of the nation's largest freshwater reservoirs, is a popular boating destination. A thriving houseboat industry has sprung up around the lake, which has more than 1,000 miles of shoreline.
 At a marina near Russell Springs, workers spent Monday moving million-dollar houseboats to moorings where they could stay afloat after the water recedes.
 ''We're kind of at a loss,'' said Estelee Slusser, who operates the Alligator Dock No. 1 marina. ''It has just happened so quickly. We really don't know what to do.''
 The corps notified local officials and business owners before making the plan public on Monday. Ms. Slusser said she learned of it Friday.
 ''We spent the whole day yesterday on the phone with customers, trying to calm them down,'' she said.

HEADLINE: The Mystery of the Chinese Baby Shortage

BYLINE: By Beth Nonte Russell. 
Beth Nonte Russell is the author of the forthcoming ''Forever Lily: An Unexpected Mother's Journey to Adoption in China'' and the co-founder of the Golden Phoenix Foundation.

DATELINE: MCLEAN, Va. 

 BODY:
ACCORDING to a State Department report released this week, American citizens adopted 6,493 children from China in 2006, a decline of 18 percent from the previous year's total of 7,906. And yet, just over a month ago, this newspaper reported that China had prepared strict new criteria for foreign adoption applications because the country claimed it lacked ''available'' babies to meet the ''spike'' in demand. 
 China has always limited foreign adoptions, and it does not publish reliable statistics on the number of children in its orphanages. So how is one to know whether the decrease in adoptions reflects a lack of supply or a lack of demand?
In the week following the report on the new guidelines, more than one bewildered person said to me, ''But I thought there were lots of babies in orphanages in China!'' My response was to helplessly reply, ''So did I.'' My understanding of this was based not on conjecture, but on having been to China twice to adopt, having seen orphanages with my own eyes, and on research and other eyewitness accounts. Many hundreds and perhaps thousands of orphanages operate in China, most of them full of girls. 
 According to a February 2005 report in The Weekend Standard, a Chinese business newspaper, demographers in China found a ratio of 117 boys per 100 girls under the age of 5 in the 2000 census. Thanks to China's one-child policy, put into effect in 1979 in order to curb population growth, and a strong cultural preference for male children, this gender gap could result in as many as 60 million ''missing'' girls from the population by the end of the decade, enough to alarm even Chinese officials. 
 And what happened to these girls? According to the International Planned Parenthood Federation (a term that takes on a whole new meaning when referring to China), there are about seven million abortions in China per year, 70 percent of which are estimated to be of females. That adds up to around five million per year, or 50 million by the end of the decade; so where are the other 10 million girls? If even 10 percent end up in orphanages well, you do the math.
 A few months ago, in a conversation with my friend Patrick Mason, executive director of the International Adoption Center at INOVA Fairfax Hospital in Virginia, I confessed a growing fear: that China, the country from which my two daughters were adopted, would sooner or later shut down its international adoption program. Dr. Mason immediately dismissed my concern, saying, ''The number of orphans is just too great.'' 
 And yet, I continued to wonder whether, as China increasingly asserts itself on the world stage and prepares to host the 2008 Summer Olympics, allowing Westerners to adopt thousands of infants each year would fit the image it wanted to project. I suspect not, and China's new restrictions lead me to believe that national pride is more important than getting these children into loving homes. 
 The issue of abandoned and institutionalized children remains a taboo subject in China, a problem the government does not even acknowledge exists. The impulse to hide it seems to stem partly from embarrassment and partly from fear of revealing the grave human rights abuses the one-child policy has produced; surely, watching a parade of well-off foreigners cart off thousands of babies would make the Chinese authorities understandably uncomfortable. 
 But the answer is not to stop the foreigners from adopting; it is to put an end to their reasons for doing so. My fondest hope, and the hope of thousands of parents who have adopted from China, is for all the orphanages there to close because there are no more abandoned children to put in them. This will be accomplished only when China decides that there is no economic or political justification for the magnitude of suffering that has resulted from the one-child policy. The government must openly acknowledge the problem, in part by publishing verifiable information about the status of its orphaned children, and take real steps to correct it. To do so would go a long way toward building the international trust and respect China seems to want so badly.
 China has announced the lifting of restrictions for foreign journalists in preparation for the 2008 Olympics. Perhaps this will allow reporters to look for answers to some basic questions: how many children are there in institutions in China? If there is nothing to hide, why do visitors need approval to visit orphanages? Why are only certain orphanages allowed to participate in the international adoption program, and what is going on in the ones that are not?
 The Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption, to which China and 69 other countries are signatories, goes a long way toward ensuring against child abduction and trafficking; but it does not include provisions that would require member countries to report such information as the number of children housed in institutions or the criteria used for selecting ''suitable'' children for adoption. 
 The treaty states that ''for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality,'' each child should have the opportunity to grow up in a ''family environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding.'' Indeed, it requires that each signatory take ''as a matter of priority, appropriate measures to enable the child to remain in the care of his or her family of origin.'' One could argue that China's one-child policy directly violates the treaty by ensuring that many children will not remain in the care of the family but be relinquished to the care of the state.
 Under the new Chinese adoption guidelines, the international adoption celebrity Angelina Jolie could not adopt from China (she's not married, and alas, she and Brad have more than two divorces between them, which is a no-no); nor could the actress Meg Ryan (again, not married). Another person who is not eligible is yours truly. My husband is over 50, so I would have to trade him in, marry again, wait the required five years (another new rule) before beginning the adoption process, and by that time I would be sneaking up on 50 myself. 
 It is comforting to know that Madonna is still eligible, at least until she turns 50, gets fat (the new regulations call for a body mass index of less than 40), gets divorced or goes broke (anyone with a net worth of under $80,000 is excluded).
 The Chinese have asserted that the demand for adoptions far exceeds the number of babies it deems ''available,'' based on criteria that have never been made public. We can only wonder how many babies will be left behind by Beijing's new policies -- perhaps spending their lives in institutions because of these arbitrary and artificial limits.

HEADLINE: Shutting Doors Where a Drug-Making Giant Began

BYLINE: By ANN FARMER and NICK BUNKLEY; Ann Farmer reported from New York and Nick Bunkley from Ann Arbor, Mich.

 BODY:
Pfizer is closing the plant in the borough where it was born.
 As part of broad cutbacks announced yesterday, Pfizer will phase out its Brooklyn manufacturing plant over the next two years, eliminating 600 jobs.
 The building, on Flushing Avenue, is Pfizer's oldest active manufacturing plant and is on the same site where Pfizer was founded in 1849 by the cousins Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart of Germany.
 ''Colleagues were shocked and disappointed by the news, but acted very maturely,'' said Bill Barberich, the plant's site leader, standing outside the three-and-a-half acre compound after a morning meeting where employees were told the news. Ninety jobs will be cut between now and March 31, with the rest to follow gradually this year and next. ''It's a very bad day for a lot of people,'' he added. 
 The cutbacks are because of increasing competition from generic drug makers and are an effort to improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness. According to Pfizer officials, several of the products made at the plant have recently lost patent protection or will soon. Mr. Barberich said it was impractical to maintain the Brooklyn plant because of changing technologies. 
 ''This was a very difficult decision for the company to make,'' MacDara Lynch, Pfizer's vice president for manufacturing for the eastern United States and Canada, said in a press release. ''Our colleagues at the Brooklyn plant have contributed significantly to Pfizer's success over many years and we're committed to providing them with as much support as possible during this transition period, including severance, job placement assistance and other benefits.'' 
 Some employees stopped to talk as they exited the company parking lot, saying they had been anticipating the closing for a while. However, the announcement still came as a surprise. 
 ''Before today it was just rumors,'' said Johnny Ortiz, 35, who has worked at the plant for 10 years, most recently as a product supervisor. ''It's shocking, but what can you do.'' He said he intended to apply for other positions with Pfizer. 
 Mr. Barberich, who has, like everyone else, been given no future job guarantee, started at the plant as an engineer in 1988 and has worked in packaging and manufacturing during his 16-year career there. ''This is a great facility, and I've really enjoyed working here,'' he said. ''The people here are just fantastic. There's a lot of history. There's a lot of pride.''
 Besides the 660,000-square-foot plant, which takes up the block between Marcy and Tompkins Avenues, Pfizer owns additional real estate nearby totaling 15 acres. Company officials said they were working with government and community leaders to find an appropriate use for the various properties, which include a charter school which will remain open. Also nearby is Pfizer's original 1849 building, which the company plans to restore. 
 A Pfizer employee, Jessica Ortiz, who grew up across the street from the plant, said she hoped they will turn it into a museum. She says the plant holds many memories for her, including meeting her husband on the job there several years ago. ''It's a Pfizer love story,'' she said, laughing, as she followed her husband's car out of the lot. She added that she found the news something of a relief after expecting it for so many months. ''We're looking at it as a new start.''
 It was far less of a relief in Michigan, where news that Pfizer will eliminate about 2,400 jobs there stunned a state already suffering through the worst stretch of the job losses since the Depression. Over the last six years, Michigan has lost more than 200,000 factory jobs, mostly in the automotive industry, and Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm has been campaigning to restructure the economy around high-technology fields like life sciences.
 Besides hindering that effort, Pfizer's actions are an unexpected setback for Ann Arbor, which is less than an hour's drive from Detroit but had managed to avoid much of the turmoil. Google recently opened an office in Ann Arbor, home to the University of Michigan, and eventually plans to employ 1,000 people.
 But the 177-acre Ann Arbor campus that Pfizer is closing had twice as many workers as Google will have. In Kalamazoo, 250 jobs will be lost, although manufacturing operations south of the city employing more than 4,000 workers will remain open, to the relief of officials.
 ''This is a tough blow to a state that is already reeling,'' Ms. Granholm said at a news conference in Ann Arbor. ''This is a punch in the gut, but we are going to recover.''
 The defensive stance that people in Michigan have become accustomed to taking whenever a mass layoff is announced was evident at the news conference, where Ms. Granholm was joined by 10 state and local officials less than 90 minutes after Pfizer detailed its cuts.
 The governor took pains to point out that Pfizer's decision ''had nothing to do with Michigan being an expensive place'' and that there was ''nothing that Michigan could have done'' to prevent the job losses. ''If we could have done it,'' she added, ''believe me, we would have done it.''
 In fact, Pfizer expanded its Ann Arbor research offices to two million square feet recently with a city-approved tax credit worth $800 million, the largest such package Ann Arbor had ever given.
 Although Pfizer said that a ''substantial number'' of affected workers may be able to transfer to facilities elsewhere, Governor Granholm and local leaders said they hope to persuade many of those being laid off to stay in the area. 
 Adding to the resentment felt in Michigan toward Pfizer's decision is the fact that the facilities affected were once the hubs of locally founded pharmaceutical companies -- Parke-Davis in Ann Arbor and the Upjohn Company in Kalamazoo. Upjohn once had 2,000 workers in downtown Kalamazoo, but the cutbacks will leave that city with only 100 Pfizer employees.

HEADLINE: Chicago Fed Chief to Retire in August

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Michael H. Moskow, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, confirmed yesterday that he would retire Aug. 31, leaving a fourth high-level opening at the central bank. 
 The Chicago Fed will begin a nationwide search for a successor, the bank said in a statement, reiterating a 2002 resolution extending Mr. Moskow's retirement date until this year. Mr. Moskow took office in 1994 and has never dissented from the majority in a vote on interest rates.
The departure is part of a year of turnover at the central bank. On Jan. 11, the Boston Fed president, Cathy E. Minehan, announced plans to retire, while a search continues to replace the Atlanta Fed president, Jack Guynn, who left in October. The Fed board of governors in Washington also has a vacancy.
 Miles D. White, chief executive of Abbott Laboratories, will lead a four-person search committee, the Chicago Fed said. The committee plans to hire an executive search firm to assist, and expects to fill the position by September.
 Mr. Moskow ''has been a consistent voice on inflation, having really felt the consequences of letting inflation get out of control,'' said Carl R. Tannenbaum, chief economist at LaSalle Bank in Chicago.

HEADLINE: Springtime for Ethanol

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Renewable Fuels Association, the ethanol industry's major lobbyist, works out of cramped offices that it shares with a lawyer near Capitol Hill. Pictures of ethanol plants from its 61 board members hang everywhere. ''We're about to run out of wall space,'' said Bob Dinneen, the association's president. 
 The association may only have six staff members but it is now bursting with energy, a far cry from the early days when its founder, a South Dakota farm boy who was convinced America needed to break the stranglehold of foreign oil, quit in frustration after four years.
After three decades of surviving mostly on tax subsidies, the industry is poised tonight to get its biggest endorsement from on high that it has a long-term future as a home-grown alternative to gasoline. 
 In his State of the Union address, President Bush is expected to call for a huge increase in the amount of ethanol that refiners mix with gasoline, probably double the current goal of 7.5 billion gallons by 2012.
 While the details of the proposal are not known, 15 billion gallons of ethanol would work out to more than 10 percent of the country's current gasoline consumption, and is far beyond the current capacity of about 5.4 billion gallons. 
 At least half of the new ethanol would come from corn, signaling the administration's support to the Midwest farm states that have benefited the most from the recent ethanol boom. 
 For an industry once dominated by the will of a single powerful producer, Archer Daniels Midland, ethanol has come a long way, joining the oil industry and producers of major agricultural commodities as an entrenched political force in Washington. And it now enjoys a powerful role in presidential politics because of Iowa's status as one of the first states to select delegates to the parties' nominating conventions.
 But with dozens of new ethanol plants coming online this year, the ethanol lobby is facing a critical point. The political reality is that corn's days as the chief crop for making the fuel may be numbered. 
 Corn-based ethanol can only marginally reduce America's dependence on foreign oil. But it does little, if anything, to improve energy efficiency, and the mounting concern of some politicians is that relying on corn is leading to collateral damage in other parts of the agricultural economy and threatening the nation's status as the leading corn exporter. The big increase in the works may mean consumers would end up paying more at the supermarket.
 So the ethanol lobby and its political supporters now face the challenge of trying to maintain the momentum of ethanol's feel-good story before the potential negative consequences of the rapid ramp-up become all too apparent.
 Clutching the reins these last five years is Mr. Dinneen, a longtime Washington lobbyist who joined the association in 1988. He recalled his early years there as a pitched war with the oil industry. ''I would wake up in the morning and try to think of a way to vilify the oil guys,'' he said.
 Today, to keep the ethanol train moving, ethanol makers are cozying up to the oil industry, forming political alliances and enlisting executives from companies like Chevron as they race to make a quicker transition to cellulosic ethanol made from nonfood crops, like switchgrass. 
 Otherwise, public support could turn against the fuel, which yields a third less energy than petroleum-based gasoline and still relies on a federal subsidy of 51 cents a gallon to remain competitive.
 ''We are no longer debating whether this makes sense, if this public policy should be pursued,'' Mr. Dinneen said. ''The discourse now is how much ethanol can we produce, how quickly can we produce it and what is the pathway for greater production of domestic renewables.''
 That pathway, at the moment, relies on commercializing cellulosic ethanol made from crops like switchgrass or wood chips, which today is twice as expensive to produce as ethanol made from corn.
 Some analysts, though, believe that politics has already trumped economics. ''Once we have a corn-based technology up and running the political system will protect it,'' said Lawrence J. Goldstein, a board member at the Energy Policy Research Foundation. ''We cannot afford to have 15 billion gallons of corn-based ethanol in 2015, and that's exactly where we are headed.''
 Mr. Goldstein said that rather than speed up the process of producing more ethanol, Congress should ''step back and reflect on the damage we have already done.''
 By contrast, ethanol advocates in Congress are pushing to accelerate research into cellulosic sources with the stated goal of speeding the timetable for when corn can be supplemented -- or supplanted -- as the chief ethanol crop. 
 ''We need additional funds for transitioning to making more energy crops for our national security,'' Senator Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat and the new chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said in an interview earlier this month.''
 The agriculture secretary, Mike Johanns, said there will be an ''adjustment period'' for ethanol that will last a few years. But he is confident that more corn will emerge to ease the pain of higher grain prices, as seed companies improve yields and farmers shift their acreage from other crops. ''When you look at the whole constellation of issues, and advancements that are out there, it is a very encouraging time for agriculture,'' Mr. Johanns said in an interview.
 The race to crack the code to produce cellulosic ethanol more efficiently has attracted dozens of researchers, venture capitalists and even the interest of major oil companies like BP and Chevron. Vinod Khosla, a major venture capitalist who has poured money into seven different start-up companies, has been pushing Washington lawmakers to set more aggressive targets to ensure that the demand for corn moves beyond corn. ''If I am going to take the risk, the market has to be big,'' Mr. Khosla said.
 The Renewable Fuels Association is trying to balance the competing concerns. The organization was not always interested in rapid expansion, particularly if that meant allowing competition for A.D.M. from sources like Brazilian sugar. David Hallberg, the association's founding president, said he left after four years in the job partly because he grew tired of disputes with A.D.M. executives over the future direction of the industry.
 ''I thought my job was to grow the industry to be as large as it could be,'' said Mr. Hallberg, who denied he was forced out. ''That isn't what our bigger members always wanted.''
 By the time Mr. Hallberg left the organization in 1985, oil prices had plummeted to $9 a barrel, making ethanol uneconomic as a fuel. The industry turned its efforts toward selling ethanol as an oxygen enhancer for gasoline that could lift octane and reduce carbon monoxide.
 With the influence of Dwayne O. Andreas, A.D.M.'s longtime chief executive and now chairman emeritus, Congress passed the federal excise tax in 1978 that gave ethanol its primary subsidy, a credit worth 51 cents per gallon of ethanol, or $21 per barrel of oil. Mr. Andreas had powerful friends in Congress, including Senator Robert J. Dole, a Republican from Kansas who rose to majority leader and who pushed consistently over the years to retain the ethanol subsidy.
 In those early days the influence of Mr. Andreas and A.D.M.'s generous contributions to both Republicans and Democrats kept ethanol alive. The company also held greater sway within the organization because of its great weight as an ethanol producer. Even today, at around 25 percent of total ethanol capacity, A.D.M. remains the largest maker.
 At first, the ethanol producers had few allies. The National Corn Growers Association was agnostic about ethanol at best, and the American Farm Bureau opposed ethanol, worrying that it could raise the price of livestock feed and cut into exports, Mr. Hallberg said.
 That began to change in the late 1980s when the groups began to work together to supply ethanol to some 30 cities as a gasoline additive in the winter months. Those months were also when A.D.M.'s wet mill corn processing plants made more ethanol.
 While the ethanol and corn forces preferred their wintertime plan, they later threw their support behind a federal proposal to implement a reformulated gasoline with an ''oxygenate'' -- either ethanol or methyl tertiary-butyl ether -- in nine of the country's smoggiest cities. The program took effect in 1995.
 Ethanol's big breakthrough came over the battle to ban M.T.B.E. After gasoline spills in California revealed that M.T.B.E. could corrode groundwater, the Renewable Fuels Association and the corn growers were among those pushing ethanol as an environmentally safer alternative.
 California banned M.T.B.E. in 1999 and requested a waiver from the federal oxygenate standard, arguing it could make a cleaner-burning gasoline without ethanol. President Bush rejected the waiver, spurring an ethanol construction miniboom.
 In 2001, Mr. Dinneen took over as president, focused on reaching detente with the oil industry. To win approval for the renewable fuels standard, he eventually cobbled together an unlikely coalition of consumer groups, the American Petroleum Institute and environmentalists like the Natural Resources Defense Council. 
 The fuel standard Congress approved in 2005, which called for a ramp-up of ethanol use to 7.5 billion gallons by 2012, ended up lighting a fire under the industry. When oil prices shot over $50 a barrel, ethanol became profitable, and then President Bush set off an industry building boom when he said last January that ''America is addicted to oil.'' 
 It helped that the mix of ethanol's advocates had been changing. About a decade ago farmers began investing in ethanol plants; today more than half of the 110 ethanol plants in production are at least partly owned by farmers. The ownership by farmers brought home the rural benefits of the ethanol industry more directly.
 The association's expanding board, which is 10 times the size it was some 20 years ago, has also become more diverse and less beholden to the business agendas of its biggest members.
 As ethanol expands, Mr. Dinneen dismissed the concerns of some economists that its explosive growth could threaten exports and livestock prices, and that a potential investment bubble could burst before cellulosic ethanol has a chance to hit the market.
 ''I don't get all that worried that we are building too fast,'' he said. ''I am not bright enough or foolish enough to try to control the market.''

HEADLINE: Spitzer Picks Pennsylvanian To Spur Upstate Economy 

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
Gov. Eliot Spitzer poached one of Pennsylvania's top economic development officials on Monday to give him a similar job in New York as part of Mr. Spitzer's effort to rebuild western New York's stagnant economy. 
 The official, Daniel Gundersen, 46, was named the upstate co-chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, a $160,000-a-year post. He has been executive deputy secretary of Pennsylvania's Department of Community and Economic Development since 2003 -- essentially serving as the department secretary's top deputy. He has also worked in economic development for Maryland and for Philadelphia.
Mr. Spitzer has said repeatedly that revitalizing the faltering upstate economy will be a major priority of his administration, and to that end he has split the top management of the Empire State Development Corporation, creating co-chairmen for upstate and downstate. Mr. Gundersen will run an office based in Buffalo while Patrick J. Foye, the acting downstate chairman, will also have authority over the Albany region and the Hudson Valley. 
 Mr. Spitzer also continued his practice of appointing former colleagues at the attorney general's office to prominent roles. He named Ken Schoetz, who has been an assistant attorney general in charge of the Buffalo Regional Office, to be the chief operating officer of the development corporation upstate. Mr. Schoetz, whose job will pay $150,000, has also been one of the state's representatives on the Peace Bridge Authority. 
 ''Dan Gundersen brings tremendous economic development experience to New York State,'' the governor said in a statement. ''Paired with Ken Schoetz, we have the right team in place to bring much needed energy and focus to upstate economic development through the newly created Upstate E.S.D.C. headquarters.''
 Reviving the battered economy of the Buffalo region, which has suffered from a loss of automotive and other manufacturing jobs, will be no small feat. 
 In an interview, Mr. Gundersen said that, among other things, he wanted to identify companies that were growing in the region and make it a priority to keep them in the state. 
 ''There are fast-growing companies in every region of every state,'' he said. ''If you don't focus on the important issues to them, they're the most likely to relocate to regions that can sustain their growth.''
 The management of the development corporation was often criticized under former Gov. George E. Pataki, who appointed as chairman his fund-raiser and close ally, Charles A. Gargano, and then used the agency's borrowing authority to finance billions of dollars for special projects at the governor's discretion or the discretion of the Republican-led Senate.

HEADLINE: Death Knell May Be Near For Public Election Funds

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
The public financing system for presidential campaigns, a post-Watergate initiative hailed for decades as the best way to rid politics of the corrupting influence of money, may have quietly died over the weekend.
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York became the first candidate since the program began in 1976 to forgo public financing for both the primary and the general election because of the spending limits that come with the federal money. By declaring her confidence that she could raise far more than the roughly $150 million the system would provide for the 2008 presidential primaries and general election, Mrs. Clinton makes it difficult for other serious candidates to participate in the system without putting themselves at a significant disadvantage.
 Officials of the Federal Election Commission and advisers to several campaigns say they expect the two candidates who reach Election Day 2008 will raise more than $500 million apiece. Including money raised by other primary candidates, the total spent on the presidential election could easily exceed $1 billion.
 People involved in the Republican primary campaign of Senator John McCain of Arizona say he, too, is beginning to seek private donations for the primary and general elections, albeit with the option of returning them. A longtime proponent of campaign finance change, Mr. McCain has recently removed his name as a co-sponsor of a bill to expand the presidential public financing program. 
 Former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, another Republican primary contender, has already decided to forgo public financing for the primaries. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, a rival to Mrs. Clinton for the Democratic nomination, declined to comment, as did spokesmen for several other candidates. 
 In a sense, Mrs. Clinton was merely confirming what many in Washington already knew: that the public financing system has failed to keep pace with the torrents of money flowing toward the presidential elections. In 2004, President Bush and Senator John Kerry, the Democratic candidate, each opted out of the system for the primaries but not the general election. By accepting the public financing, they had to agree not to raise or spend any private money for the period after their nominating conventions.
 But when Mr. Bush raised some $270 million, and Mr. Kerry about $235 million, it became clear that major-party candidates could raise far more from private donors than from the public system.
 ''The 2008 race will be the longest and most expensive presidential election in American history,'' said Michael E. Toner, chairman of the Federal Election Commission. ''Top-tier candidates are going to have to raise $100 million by the end of 2007 to be a serious candidate.'' He added: ''We are looking at a $100 million entry fee.''
 The turn away from public financing is the twilight of a system once welcomed as a new era of clean government. 
 In 1986, a decade after the first publicly financed presidential election, a bipartisan commission headed by Robert Strauss, the former Democratic Party chief, and Melvin R. Laird, the secretary of defense under President Richard M. Nixon, concluded: ''Public financing of presidential elections has clearly proved its worth in opening up the process, reducing the influence of individuals and groups, and virtually ending corruption in presidential election finance.''
 Formed to curb candidates' dependence on big donors without running afoul of Supreme Court rulings protecting political spending as a form of free speech, the system provides taxpayer money for candidates who voluntarily agree to abide by spending limits.
 Any primary candidate who raises an initial $100,000 in small donations receives federal money to match the first $250 of each donation. For 2008, candidates could receive matching grants of as much as $25 million for the primary season, grants of about $15 million for a nominating convention and grants of about $83 million for the general election.
 The system is financed by taxpayers who check a box on their returns to allocate $3 to an election fund, with about 33 million people a year in recent years directing a total of about $400 million to each quadrennial presidential election.
 But the fund has faced chronic shortfalls as the percentage of taxpayers contributing has declined to less than 10 percent last year from over 30 percent in the 1970s. Those who could tap wealthy supporters began looking for ways to outmaneuver it almost from the beginning. 
 In the 1980 Republican primary, for example, John B. Connally, the former Texas governor, became the first candidate to reject public money and outraise his rivals, but his candidacy failed to catch on. 
 By the mid-1980s, candidates and donors were circumventing the spending limits by raising unlimited ''soft money'' donations to party committees from corporations, unions and wealthy individuals. The party committees used the money to help support a candidate's presidential campaign or to attack his opponent. 
 In 2002, Congress changed the campaign finance laws to ban soft money contributions to party committees, and donors turned instead to so-called 527 groups, which could still spend unlimited contributions.
 By 2000, two Republican candidates, the billionaire Steve Forbes and Mr. Bush, had turned down public money for the primary campaign. Mr. Bush became the first major-party nominee to do so. And in 2004, for the first time, both the Democratic and the Republican nominees turned down public financing for the primaries.
 For Mrs. Clinton and other 2008 candidates, deciding this early to turn down public financing means that she can immediately begin building two war chests, one for the primary and one for the general election. Candidates can raise twice as much from each individual donor: $2,100 for the primary and $2,100 for the general, for a total of $4,200.
 It also means that the presidential candidates will be more beholden than ever to the so-called bundlers, often lobbyists, who solicit donations to present to campaigns in a lump sum. In 2004, President Bush honored his biggest bundlers by calling them Pioneers and Rangers who raised $100,000 or $200,000, respectively.
 Beginning with the first quarterly disclosure of presidential campaign finances, due at the end of April, candidates can show off their cash on hand as a deterrent to competitors. Mrs. Clinton, who faces doubts among some Democratic primary voters about whether she can win the general election, may be able to point to her general election fund-raising as evidence of her strength.
 Candidates who wait until 2008 to start raising contributions for the general election may be starting too late to catch up. In 2004, for example, Mr. Kerry demonstrated during the primaries that he could raise far more money than public financing provided. But by the time he had won the nomination it was too late to raise private money to compete in the general election, and he relied instead on public financing. 
 On Monday, a spokesman for Mr. Kerry, who is weighing another presidential bid, said, ''It's smart for Democrats to keep their options open.''
 Mr. Toner, chairman of the Federal Election Commission, said he expected that even if the major candidates bypassed the election fund, the money would still be used by dark horses. Any hypothetical surplus would remain in the fund, he said.
 Lawmakers in both chambers of Congress have proposed legislation to revamp and expand the presidential primary financing system, but the ideas have not gained much traction in recent years. Phil Singer, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said she would support ''modernizing'' the system.
 Spokesmen for the Democratic leaders of both chambers say they like the idea. But Republicans are wary. ''The most massive poll ever taken on any subject is taken on the subject of using tax dollars for political campaigns,'' Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican leader, said in a statement. 
 ''That poll is taken every April 15 on our tax return,'' he said, referring to the voluntary check-off. ''About 10 percent of Americans choose to participate; 90 percent choose not to.''
 Charles E. M. Kolb, president of the Committee for Economic Development, a business group that advocates for election laws, said, ''It may take a collapse of the system in order to build it back up.''
 For now, Mr. Kolb added, ''obituary may be the right word.''


CORRECTION-DATE: January 24, 2007

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about the waning reliance of presidential candidates on public financing for campaigns included an outdated reference to Michael E. Toner, who said the 2008 election will be the most expensive in American history. As of Jan. 1, Mr. Toner is a commissioner of the Federal Election Commission. He is no longer its chairman, his position in 2006.

HEADLINE: A Trial to Remember

BYLINE: By STACY SCHIFF. 
Stacy Schiff is the author, most recently, of ''A Great Improvisation: Franklin, France and the Birth of America.'' She is a guest columnist.

 BODY:
Who knew that 12 angry Americans could be so easy to come by -- and a jury so difficult to assemble? ''It took us all day to get six jurors qualified,'' Judge Reggie M. Walton lamented last Thursday, after a contentious afternoon of voir dire in the Scooter Libby trial. Judge Walton had hoped to have seated his panel by then; selection took twice as long as expected. Opening arguments are scheduled for today, not the sort of trailer you would normally run before a State of the Union address. 
 To some minds, a jury has not been the only thing missing from United States of America v. I. Lewis Libby. ''In the most important sense, this is a case without a crime,'' The Wall Street Journal reminded us over the weekend. An artful leap followed: ''Yes, Mr. Libby is charged with perjury and obstruction of justice, which are serious offenses.'' 
It is true that what began as a search for a leak ended -- after much collateral damage -- with an indictment for a lie. At this juncture it can be difficult to grasp what, precisely, is on trial. Some of us seem viscerally to wish something else were. While the original investigation stemmed from the charge that a public official had provided accurate information to the press, potential jurors appear more eager to charge a public official with having provided false information to a country. It was, after all, Mr. Libby who drafted the 2003 masterpiece that Colin Powell presented to the United Nations, the one about Iraq's fabled chemical and biological weapons.
 Juror 0420, an economist, couldn't help but say she thought the Iraq war ''a tremendous mistake, a horrendous mistake, and a betrayal.'' She could not promise to be objective about Dick Cheney, who is slated to testify.
 Juror 0244 reported ''strong negative feelings about this current administration and its conduct of the war.'' He was gone in seconds.
 Juror 1140 admitted: ''I believe the vice president would have had the defendant leak.'' Had she any preconceived notions? ''Guilty.''
 Juror 1298 felt that she could muster the maturity to be open-minded about Mr. Libby. But when pressed by Judge Walton on whether a witness from the administration would carry ''a strike against them,'' she replied, ''Probably.'' Home she went.
 Juror 1980 made herself crystal clear: ''I cannot believe any statement from the Bush administration.'' Bye-bye.
 These exchanges produced a little rowdiness over in the press room, where stopwatches were set to see how long a potential juror could last. Remember that door-to-door campaign the president has promised for Baghdad? Those good-will ambassadors might be better deployed in our nation's capital. 
 On the stand will be the vagaries of human memory. Hence the carefully crafted questions submitted by Libby's team for prospective jurors: Can you honestly misremember? Is the memory like a tape recorder, or does it make mistakes? Can you falsely believe someone told you something when it was someone else, at a prior date? Can you hold to your memories even after they are found to be inaccurate? 
 The defense will contend that Mr. Libby's recollections were honest, even if incorrect. ''Confused, forgot or misremembered'' are not crimes. Deliberate lying is; to be convicted, Mr. Libby must be shown to have willfully misled. 
 He claims to have been preoccupied with vital security issues and buried under intelligence information; he paid little heed to the matter of a C.I.A. officer's employment. Technically this is called the ''Honey, I was too busy preparing the family tax return to think clearly when you asked about the lap dancers'' defense. 
 Surely it's a legitimate one, if perhaps a little tough to swallow after six years of distorted intelligence and Enron-grade responsibility. Also, is it just me, or does that argument sound disconcertingly familiar? Wasn't it Mr. Libby's ex-boss who -- when asked why he hadn't served in Vietnam -- replied, ''I had other priorities in the '60s than military service''?
 Generally, a memory can prove a dangerous thing to have under this administration. Even I can remember W.M.D., Mohamed Atta, African uranium, shock and awe, mission accomplished, and a heckuva job -- and I'm lousy when it comes to plot. The prodigious Mr. Libby, on the other hand, remembers all 79 ''Star Trek'' episodes. And their titles, too.

HEADLINE: Florida Acts to Lower Home Insurance Cost

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH; Terry Aguayo contributed reporting from Miami, and Christine Jordan Sexton from Tallahassee, Fla.

DATELINE: MIAMI, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
Struggling to fulfill a campaign promise made last fall by virtually every Florida lawmaker, the Legislature approved a series of measures Monday that would reduce home insurance rates -- modestly, for the most part -- by having the state take on billions of dollars in additional insurance risk.
 Insurance costs soared here after eight hurricanes hit the state in 2004 and 2005 and forecasters predicted that ferocious storms could keep hitting for at least the next decade. Easing the crisis is Gov. Charlie Crist's top goal, and he convened a special legislative session to address it within days of taking office on Jan. 1. 
But while Mr. Crist, a Republican, and the Republican-dominated Legislature said last week that they were committed to significant across-the-board rate reductions, reality proved more complicated. 
 South Floridians covered by the state-run insurer of last resort because private companies refuse to insure their homes will see the smallest savings -- as little as 8 percent. Their insurance costs have as much as tripled since 2004, forcing many people to consider leaving Florida.
 Homeowners with private insurance would save more -- up to 21.8 percent, on average -- according to legislative analysts.
 ''We don't claim that the bill is perfect,'' said State Senator Bill Posey, a Republican from Rockledge who helped negotiate the changes during a weeklong special session in Tallahassee, ''and we don't claim that the work is done.''
 The legislation would allow private insurers to buy backup coverage from the state's Hurricane Catastrophe Fund at below-market rates and, in turn, require them to reduce premiums. But a major storm -- or worse, a string of them -- could not only wipe out the fund but also force residents to pay steep yearly assessments on home, auto and other insurance policies to make up for it.
 ''The catastrophe fund's resources will wind up being drained more frequently than ever,'' said Robert P. Hartwig, the president and chief economist of the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group in New York. ''What's really happening here is that people are being obligated to pay massive assessments in the future.'' 
 Insurance companies nationally enjoyed record profits in 2006, which saw no devastating hurricanes, and Mr. Crist has strongly criticized the industry, an unusual move for a Republican. In particular, he has questioned why Floridians saw their rates rise despite the quiet storm season. But Mr. Hartwig said Mr. Crist should not expect homeowners in Florida to benefit from profits the industry reaped in less risky states.
 ''By law, the price of insurance in each state is based on the experience in that state and that state only,'' Mr. Hartwig said. ''Governor Crist, with all due respect, was basically saying if an insurer earns profits on homeowner policies in Montana or auto policies in Idaho, then somehow that profit should be available to homeowners in Florida to keep their rates down.''
 The legislation, approved by votes of 116 to 2 in the House of Representatives and 40 to 0 in the Senate, also repeals an average 21 percent rate increase that took effect this month for customers of Citizens Property Insurance, the state-run corporation, and another average increase of 56 percent that was to take effect in March.
 Citizens Property Insurance, which ran substantial deficits in 2004 and 2005, has become the state's largest home insurer, covering 1.3 million households. The new legislation repeals a requirement that it charge higher rates than private companies and allows it to sell more than just windstorm coverage, both changes that rankled private insurers.
 Some homeowners said Monday that the changes were not nearly enough given the astronomical rate increases of recent years, and that insurance policyholders should not have to worry about huge assessments in the event of a huge storm. 
 ''It's the pits,'' said Imogene Arnold, 75, who lives in Port Richey and said her Citizens premium climbed to $4,700 from $2,066 in the past year. ''We were really hoping around 40 or 50 percent.'' 
 Representative Susan Bucher, a Democrat from West Palm Beach, said, ''I believe what we did is cosmetic surgery when we need heart surgery.''
 Others were resigned, saying that the rate freeze for Citizens customers was at least something positive.
 ''At least for once the Legislature is listening to consumers and not just the insurance companies,'' said Heather Carruthers, a member of Fair Insurance Rates in Monroe, an advocacy group for policyholders in the Florida Keys. ''I absolutely think it's a good step.'' 
 Asked how she felt about the state's taking on billions of dollars in additional insurance risk, Ms. Carruthers said: ''It's a risk to the economy, but if people move out of Florida, as we've already seen happen, that would be more economically devastating. We have to stop that.''
 Mr. Crist, who has offered few of his own ideas for solving the insurance crisis and instead entreated lawmakers to ''get it done,'' described the legislation as a bipartisan victory after it passed Monday.
 Lawmakers, for their part, played a recording of ''Kumbaya'' on the Senate floor after voting.
 Mr. Hartwig of the Insurance Information Institute said that in the end, lasting insurance relief could come only from building less on Florida's vulnerable coasts and requiring the strictest of building codes, which the recent debate barely addressed.
 ''You cannot legislate away the real, formidable risk of hurricanes in Florida,'' he said.

HEADLINE: More Marketers Are Grabbing the Attention of Players During Online Games

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
CASUAL game sites have learned how to play the ad game. 
 The sites -- which offer puzzle and strategy games -- once focused on selling the actual games after the dot-com bust drove many advertisers away. But these days, they are becoming popular marketing spots as they begin to accept more branded messages.
Last year, advertisers spent about $150 million buying space on casual game sites or in the games themselves, up from $74 million in 2002, according to DFC Intelligence, a game industry research firm in San Diego. 
 This is all possible, of course, because advertisers are increasingly interested in reaching the diverse group of Web users who like to solve puzzles, play word games and decipher mind benders online.
 In December, about 65.9 million people played online games, which include puzzle games and action video games. That was up 13 percent from December 2005, when 58.4 million clicked online for a quick round, according to comScore Networks, an Internet research firm. While traditional action games still draw more men than women, casual games are more popular with women and offer the kind of friendly online experience that ad executives say companies want to be associated with.
 Big Fish Games, a casual game site known for its game Mystery Case Files, for example, says about 75 percent of its visitors each month are women. And, according to Forrester Research, about 51 percent of people over age 30 play online games.
 ''The gamer is actually a much more of a mainstream consumer than you may think,'' said Shar VanBoskirk, a senior analyst with Forrester Research. ''Consumers are really filtering out advertiser messages, and games are one way that they're actually still engaged.''
 PopCap Games, a company known for the Bejeweled puzzle game, is testing ads in the premiere versions of its games. Like many online games, PopCap's are available in two versions -- a free basic version and a fancier version for a fee, which it calls premiere. Traditionally, Web surfers tried the fancy version free for an hour before deciding whether to buy it. 
 Now, under a test PopCap is running with its game Zuma, consumers can download the fancy version and play it without ever paying -- if they are willing to see ads.
 AOL Games, a unit of Time Warner, is testing ads in the one-hour trial version of its deluxe games, said Ralph Rivera, vice president and general manager of AOL Games. About 95 percent of people who try games do not end up paying for the deluxe version, he said, and AOL would like to reach those users in some way.
 ''Within AOL, games is only second to e-mail and I.M. as far as time spent per user, so you're talking about a very highly engaged audience,'' Mr. Rivera said. ''Any time you have a highly engaged audience, you have advertisers who are looking to get in front of that audience.''
 Big Fish Games charges for downloads of games and also carries about 200 free puzzle and strategy games online, with ads. Starting last month, visitors who clicked on their first free online game of the day got a Sponsor Select pop-up screen giving them a choice of ads for that game. 
 About 25 percent of the people who play games on Big Fish have chosen to pick their advertisers, according to AWS Convergence Technologies, the company that operates Sponsor Select.
 Yesterday, for example, visitors could select either Better Homes and Gardens, Orchard Bank MasterCard or Windows Live Search to be the sole advertiser in the first game they played. The rest of the games they played showed them a variety of ads. 
 ''You're going to get ads no matter what,'' said Paul Thelen, chief executive of Big Fish Games. ''The advantage of Sponsor Select is it's more likely to be relevant to you.''
 Big Fish started offering free games online a year and a half ago. Four years ago, after the dot-com bust, it was not possible to make much money from ad-supported games, Mr. Thelen said. Now that is changing. While Big Fish still makes most of its money from user-paid downloads, its fastest-growing revenue area is its advertising.
 Whereas advertising in games used to be specialized, involving a lot of negotiation , the growing number of ad options for casual games is making game advertising more accessible to brands that once focused on traditional advertising, ad executives said.
 ''You don't have to be as adventurous or as bold to make it happen now,'' said Art Sindlinger, vice president and activation director at Starcom USA, a Publicis Groupe media-buying agency.
 One appealing aspect of casual games is that players often start friendly dialogues with each other, and brands can associate themselves with that community building, said Saneel Radia, vice president and group director of Play, a gaming division of Denuo, which is part of the Publicis Groupe. 
 ''If you look at the communication on a board of pool in Yahoo Games, it's, 'Oh, where's your family from?' '' Mr. Radia said. ''Go to XBox Live, and it's, 'I'm going to crush you.' ''
 Some advertisers have taken casual gaming a step further, creating their own casual games -- sometimes called advergames -- and posting them on their Web sites. 
 When the Dodge Caliber came out last spring, the Chrysler Group, part of DaimlerChrysler, posted five casual games on its site, and one called Caliber Buzz was played three million times within a month, said Vanessa Kelley, manager of cross-brand gaming at Chrysler. Online games are now a regular part of Chrysler car debuts, she said.
 ''It's the wave,'' Ms. Kelley said. ''These people don't watch television all that much. They are online. They're playing games.''

HEADLINE: Spike in Price of Oil Ignites Market Rally

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Shares rose moderately yesterday as crude oil surged more than $2 a barrel, setting off a rally among energy producers and as a series of positive earnings reports helped restore investor optimism.
 Energy prices spiked after Samuel W. Bodman, the secretary of energy, said the United States would double the size of the nation's strategic petroleum reserve. Prices were already rising as a cold snap in the Northeast was expected to increase demand for heating fuel in the region.
Exxon Mobil led blue chips and was among the Dow Jones industrials' biggest gainers; fellow refiners ConocoPhillips and Chevron also rose. The advance in oil stocks helped the Dow recover from an 88-point decline on Monday, its biggest drop in two months. 
 The markets also were lifted by robust earnings reports from United Technologies and Texas Instruments, which helped offset a warning from the telecommunications equipment maker Alcatel-Lucent that it would not post a profit during the fourth quarter because of a steep decline in sales.
 ''Earnings are not coming in all that bad,'' said Brian Gendreau, an investment strategist with ING Investment Management. ''There is an absence of any real bad news, leading indicators are up and companies are not falling off the table.''
 The Dow rose 56.64, to 12,533.80. 
 Broader stock indicators also advanced. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 5.04, to 1,427.99, and the Nasdaq composite index added 0.34, to 2,431.41. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies gained 7.42, to 785.38.
 Bill Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading, said he believed that the market might be at its peak for the year and that stocks would pull back as it became increasingly likely that the Federal Reserve would not cut interest rates.
 ''We're in a sweet spot right now where everything is O.K., and there's a little upside left. But there's also a correction out there considering the kind of advance the market has undergone,'' he said.
 In economic news, the Richmond Fed survey showed a slip in its manufacturing index this month, and the Conference Board said economic activity was set to increase slightly in the coming months.
 A barrel of light sweet crude for March delivery settled at $55.04 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 News of the plan to increase strategic reserves gave a boost to refiners. Exxon Mobil rose $1.59, to $74.49; ConocoPhillips was up $1.59, at $64.97; and Chevron increased $1.34, to $72.56.
 Alcatel-Lucent blamed integration costs and weaker sales for a loss in its first full quarter since it was created last year in a $11.6 billion merger. Its shares fell $1.04, to $13.15. 
 Technology stocks were up over all, however, after the chip maker Texas Instruments reported a robust quarterly profit and was upgraded by several Wall Street firms. Shares rose $1.01, to $29.60.
 United Technologies, which makes everything from air-conditioners to aircraft engines, reported that fourth-quarter profit rose 38 percent, which sent shares up $2.05, to $66.14.
 Bank of America fell 33 cents, to $53.32, despite reporting higher profits on growth in its loan business and its acquisition of the credit-card issuer MBNA Corporation. Shares of a rival, Wachovia, rose 38 cents, to $56.65, after reporting better-than-expected results.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 12/32 to 98 18/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 4.81 percent, from 4.76 percent.
 Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of four-week bills and 20-year inflation-protected securities.

HEADLINE: Move Over Silicon Valley, Here Come European Start-Ups 

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: MUNICH, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
A technology and media conference being held here this week provided ample evidence that Silicon Valley's dominance of Internet-style technology innovation is waning.
 The gathering, Digital Life Design, has become a showcase for a range of European entrepreneurs who have taken the start-up culture pioneered in Silicon Valley as a template and are successfully transplanting it here.
The star of this year's event was Niklas Zennstrom, the Swedish co-founder of the file-sharing system Kazaa and the Internet telephony company Skype, which was sold to eBay for $2.6 billion in 2005. Mr. Zennstrom last week took the wraps off a previously secretive start-up, Joost, that intends to provide a peer-to-peer approach to distributing video online. 
 ''We're trying to take the good things about television and the good things about the Internet and put them together,'' he said.
 Like many participants here, Mr. Zennstrom voiced the opinion that Internet-based commerce would accelerate in its disruptive effect on traditional businesses. Skype, for example, now says that it carries 4.4 percent of all worldwide long-distance calling. 
 ''We now have a pretty decent Internet infrastructure,'' Mr. Zennstrom said, noting in the future that it would give rise to ''many, many more disruptive industries.''
 The invitation-only conference, which ended Tuesday, attracted 1,000 old- and new-media publishers this year, mixed in with Internet software and service start-ups and a smattering of American dot-com executives. It serves in part as an intelligence-gathering event for its sponsor, Hubert Burda, a German publisher trying to move his more than 250 magazines into the Internet era. 
 Several organizers noted that Silicon Valley's original success as an innovation center was largely because of business and social networks developed over several decades in a community of venture capitalists and technologists. 
 Now, they said, with the Internet supplementing and replacing traditional face-to-face social networks, Silicon Valley might be losing its competitive advantage.
 ''The epicenter was Silicon Valley, but that has created a wave of innovation that has now reached the entire world,'' said Yossi Vardi, an Israeli entrepreneur and investor who financed his son's development of ICQ, an early Internet chat program later sold to America Online. 
 Internet start-ups in Europe received a significant boost last month with the initial public offering of Open BC/Xing, a German Web site that is a competitor of the American site LinkedIn for social networking among businesses.
 One of the best examples of the diffusion of Internet-style business creation is Tariq Krim, chief executive of Netvibes. His Paris-based company was a pioneer in the design of a Web service that allows users to personalize their start page, shifting the control away from the traditional Internet portal companies. 
 Netvibes, which received a $15.5 million investment from the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Accel Partners last year, now reports 10 million users. The company was an early practitioner of the so-called Web 2.0 approach, which is based on a system of hooking together Internet services provided by competing companies.
 After growing up in Paris, Mr. Krim received practical business schooling in Silicon Valley, first as an intern at Sun Microsystems and then, in the late 1990s, as a reporter for a French business magazine based there.
 In founding Netvibes in 2005, he said, he was inspired by the simplicity of Apple's Macintosh and was trying to offer that same ease of use to Internet users.
 ''Our digital life is fragmented into a wide number of services,'' he said. 
 Being based in Paris can sometimes be disorienting, he said, noting that when Netvibes began operating two years ago many people assumed that it was in Silicon Valley.
 The company was able to use online collaboration among its users to rapidly translate the service into 80 languages, even though the firm had just four employees initially.
 Netvibes recently opened a San Francisco office, and Mr. Krim acknowledged that he was fond of the Silicon Valley culture in which everyone seems to live and breathe computing and technology.
 ''I miss the fact you can start an interesting company just by talking to someone you meet while you are doing your laundry,'' he said.
 Still, he says that while there are major cultural differences in the way start-up entrepreneurs are viewed in Europe -- failure is not viewed as a badge of honor, the way it is in Silicon Valley -- a native community is beginning to emerge.
 He noted that an early investor in Netvibes was Martin Varsavsky, the Madrid-based investor who recently founded FON, a wireless-networking service based on subsidizing the cost of Wi-Fi modems and building communities of users around the world who freely share wireless access points. 
 Mr. Varsavsky argues that the new European start-ups are generally more sophisticated than their American competitors. 
 European Web video sites like Vpod and Sevenload are technically more advanced than YouTube, he said. Sevenload combines the features of Flickr, which allows sharing of still photos, and YouTube, the video sharing site.
 Other European start-up companies whose executives attended the conference included Rebtel and Truphone, which are offering low-cost Internet calls to cellphone users. Another European start-up, JaJa, is also pursuing the market.
 ''We have built Wi-Fi infrastructure at home and in the office and we are still using our cellphones,'' said Alexander Straub, a German entrepreneur based in London who founded Truphone last year. He said the roaming charges levied by cellular companies were not sustainable. ''It's pure robbery,'' he said. 
 A number of participants at the conference contended that with the quick spread of ideas in an Internet age, Silicon Valley companies no longer have a first-mover advantage.
 Gerald Haag, a former Amazon executive who is a founder of Dropshop, a Munich-based start-up for auction sellers, cited a case in which an idea from Silicon Valley was introduced in Europe. Two weeks later, he said, ''there was a German version.''

HEADLINE: What's a Pound Of Prevention Really Worth?

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
Arthur Agatston, the South Beach diet doctor, came to town last week and, in between bites of filleted fish, he was trying to persuade me that his patients rarely have heart attacks anymore.
 As he is quick to tell almost anyone -- as he told me before we had even sat down for our Greek lunch -- he is an accidental diet doctor. By training, he's a cardiologist. He spent 20 years doing research and seeing patients in Miami before his little nutrition manifesto was published in 2003. It and its various spinoffs have since sold close to 20 million copies.
 But Dr. Agatston still spends much of his time as a working cardiologist. After the first book came out, he opened a private practice where he treats everyone from locals who knew him when he was just another doctor to wealthy South Americans who fly in to see the famous South Beach doctor. 
 The practice has 2,800 patients, and, as best as Dr. Agatston can recall, only three of them had a heart attack last year. ''Heart attacks are essentially disappearing from my practice,'' he says in his Long Island-tinged accent.
 It is a fairly stunning claim, the sort of claim that you might expect to hear from someone who knows how to sell a product. If Dr. Agatston were to do a thorough review of his files, I wonder if he might come across a few more heart attacks, perhaps among patients he doesn't see regularly. 
 But his larger point is a perfectly good one: we now know an enormous amount about how to prevent heart attacks, with powerful drugs like statins, smoking cessation, exercise and diet. With the right preventive care, people can cut their risk of a heart attack by up to 80 percent, cardiologists estimate. 
 ''We have made major improvements in prevention,'' Dr. Gregg W. Stone , the director of cardiovascular research at Columbia University, says. ''But it's difficult. It takes frequent visits, a close relationship between a physician and a patient and a very committed patient.''
 Which is exactly the atmosphere Dr. Agatston's practice tries to create. Nurses there give patients specific cholesterol goals to meet and help them deal with the side effects of the drugs they are taking. A nutritionist, Marie Almon, meets with patients frequently enough to discuss real-life issues like how to stick to a high-fiber Mediterranean diet even on a cruise or a business trip. 
 There is only one problem with this shining example of a medical practice: it is losing money.
 See, preventive medicine just doesn't pay in the current American medical system. ''The time we spend with patients -- we get rewarded almost zilch,'' Dr. Agatston says. Or as Dr. Valentin Fuster, a former president of the American Heart Association, puts it: ''There is no incentive at all. It's a disaster.''
 This is obviously an exciting time for health care reform. In California and Massachusetts, state officials have announced plans to provide universal health insurance. Last week, the head of the Business Roundtable, a major corporate lobbying group, and Andy Stern, a union leader, held a news conference together to call for universal coverage. President Bush devoted a big part of last night's State of the Union address to his own health insurance ideas. The push to reduce the number of uninsured, now approaching 50 million, is long overdue.
 But a lack of insurance is only one of the two huge problems with health care. The other is the perverse system of incentives that nudges doctors and patients toward expensive tests and procedures when cheaper preventive measures might actually produce better results. Partly as a result, costs are rising rapidly for the 250 million people who do have insurance. 
 In cardiac care, nuclear scans and invasive procedures like bypass surgery bring in the money. Medicare alone paid almost $15 billion, or about 5 percent of its total budget, for bypasses, stents and other invasive cardiology in 2005, according to Jonathan Skinner of Dartmouth. Yet for many patients, there is no scientific evidence that stents or surgery prolong life.
 Dr. Agatston doesn't need Medicare reimbursements to make a living. His books, the latest being ''The South Beach Heart Program,'' have given him ''an outside income,'' as he delicately puts it. ''I can afford to be holier than thou,'' he says. 
 Absent a wealthy patron, many other clinics that focus on preventing heart disease are struggling to survive, Dr. Richard Pasternak, a Harvard Medical School cardiologist and Merck & Company executive, says. Family doctors, doctors who treat back pain and doctors who treat diabetes all face similar challenges.
 It's important to note that the economic gains from preventive care are sometimes exaggerated. Sadly, the cheapest patients are often the ones who receive no care whatsoever, because many die before they reach their medically expensive golden years.
 But the political case -- the moral case -- for prevention is unassailable. And to the extent that drugs and lifestyle changes replace surgery, rather than merely supplement it, preventive care can help pay for itself.
 Given the way the universal insurance movement has taken off, the most likely path to reform probably runs through local governments or other pilot programs, and some of this is beginning to happen. 
 Humana, the insurer, and Dr. Fuster will soon begin studying 6,000 high-risk patients, in part to get a better understanding of how they can be persuaded to take the preventive steps they should be taking. Medicare, meanwhile, is experimenting with some pay-for-performance stipends for doctors. 
 ''We still pay more when patients have more complications and get more services than when they get better results,'' Dr. Mark McClellan, Medicare's former director, told me recently.
 The prevention push is still waiting for its Massachusetts moment -- a signature event to make it a topic of national conversation, as Massachusetts's health insurance plan did for universal coverage last year. Dr. Agatston, who does have a track record of getting people's attention, has one idea.
 ''My dream has been to go to a corporation and say, 'Have all your executives and all your high-risk employees come to our practice, and if they hit our goals and still have a heart attack, we'll give you a million dollars,' '' Dr. Agatston said. ''My wife and our lawyers say, 'You can't do that!' But that's frankly my dream.''
 Any takers?

HEADLINE: A Suggestion Of Growth In Economy

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A gauge of future economic activity rose slightly in December as two of the economy's soft spots, the housing and job markets, showed signs of improvement, according to an industry-backed research group. 
 The group, the Conference Board, said its index of leading economic indicators edged up 0.3 percent last month, suggesting the economy may grow at a modest clip in the next several months. Two previous small increases were revised downward, to a flat reading in November and a slight decline in October.
Ken Goldstein, an economist with the Conference Board, said the housing and job markets showed signs of leveling in December, while manufacturers appeared to grow less cautious about inventory.
 ''When you start to put all the ducks in a row, it certainly doesn't add up to an economy that is going to come roaring right back,'' he said. ''But it's clearly not an economy that is continuing to slow.''
 Analysts had expected the leading index to rise 0.4 percent in December. The index, which stood at 138 last month compared with a revised 137.6 in November, is watched closely because it is intended to forecast economic activity over the next three to six months.
 Six of the 10 indicators that make up the index rose in December.
 Abnormally warm weather last month in the Midwest and Northeast resulted in an increase in construction in those regions. That swell of activity may have inflated December's index, said Mark Vitner, senior economist with the Wachovia Corporation.
 Mr. Vitner said he thought that the December pickup ''will come at the expense of growth in the early part of the year.''
 Last week, in a sign that tamed inflation fears, the Labor Department reported that the Consumer Price Index increased in December at its slowest rate in three years, in part because of the sharp decline in energy prices from record highs in 2006.

HEADLINE: Rare Armenian-Turkish Unity at Slain Editor's Funeral 

BYLINE: By SEBNEM ARSU and SUSANNE FOWLER

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
More than 50,000 mourners, including senior Turkish and Armenian officials in a rare display of unity, poured into the heart of Istanbul on Tuesday to bid farewell to Hrant Dink, the Turkish-Armenian journalist who was gunned down outside his offices last week, a death that many Turks hoped would be a catalyst for change. 
 The Armenian patriarch in Istanbul, Archbishop Mesrob Mutafyan, spoke out during Mr. Dink's funeral against curbs on freedom of expression and encouraged the thaw in relations between Armenia and Turkey that has become evident since the slaying. 
''It is unacceptable to judge and imprison someone because of his thoughts, let alone to kill him,'' the archbishop said during the hourlong service at the Holy Mother of God Armenian Patriarchal Church. ''It is mystical that his funeral turned into an occasion where Armenian and Turkish officials gathered together.''
 Diplomatic relations between Turkey and Armenia were frozen and their border closed in 1993 after years of grievances, chiefly over the mass deaths of Armenians at Turkish hands in 1915, during World War I. Many scholars and most Western governments accept that more than a million Armenians died in what they describe as a genocide, but Turkey says that there were deaths on both sides and that they were an unfortunate result of the war. But on Tuesday, in what was widely regarded as an important symbolic step, Turkish and Armenian officials appeared at Mr. Dink's funeral services. 
 Top Turkish officials -- Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin; Interior Minister Abdulkadir Aksu; the Istanbul governor, Muammer Guler; and the head of the security forces, Celalettin Cerrah -- were seated in the front row. Two generals were also present.
 The Armenian deputy foreign minister, Arman Kirakossian, was seated behind the Turkish governmental officials, with Karen Mirzoyan, the permanent Armenian representative to the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation.
 Religious leaders included the archbishop of the Armenian Church of America, Khajag Barsamian. Impressed by the strength of the public reaction to Mr. Dink's death, Archbishop Barsamian said in an interview that ''his soul will be in peace when he sees that his assassination created some positive steps between two countries.'' 
 Saban Disli, foreign relations officer of Turkey's governing Justice and Development Party, agreed that public revulsion with the killing could improve relations. 
 ''With the help of a supportive public opinion, the best approach to resolve conflicts between the two countries is to assess issues altogether, rather than considering them one by one in a deadlock,'' Mr. Disli said. ''The only obstacle that can hinder our good will to open the borders and re-establish dialogue with Armenia would be the destructive lobbying of the Armenian diaspora against Turkey.''
 Earlier, with hundreds of police officers in riot gear and with traffic barred on the main thoroughfares, normally chaotic sections of Istanbul were subdued as ethereal Armenian music played from loudspeakers along Republic Avenue; Turks of various ethnicities stood shoulder to shoulder, many in tears. 
 Many mourners waved circular placards reading ''We are all Hrant Dink'' in Turkish on one side and in Armenian on the other.
 Still other signs read ''Murderer 301,'' a reference to the law under which scores of writers and intellectuals, including Mr. Dink and the Nobel Prize winner Orhan Pamuk, have been prosecuted in lawsuits filed by nationalists. 
 Mr. Pamuk was provided personal security by the police on Tuesday, the CNN Turk Web site reported. Mr. Pamuk was escorted by policemen in plainclothes as he left for a book fair in Egypt.
 Mr. Pamuk has refused offers of personal security from authorities in the past, the Web site said.
 Article 301, which criminalizes the act of insulting ''Turkishness,'' remains a roadblock to Turkish entry into the European Union, which is urging Turkey to amend it. 
 Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has shown some willingness to have the law reworded, asking nongovernmental civic organizations late last year to come up with a draft to submit to Parliament. No single version has been agreed upon, but the killing of Mr. Dink seems certain to spur the debate. 
 During the march, an elderly woman of Armenian descent, crying on the street, said it was ''important to remember that Turkey became a republic with our blood, too.'' She asked not to be identified, saying she feared someone might shoot her, too. 
 The police said that Ogun Samast, 17, had confessed to shooting Mr. Dink and that he said he had been given the weapon by Yasin Hayal, a nationalist convicted in the bombing of a McDonald's restaurant in 2004. 
 Mr. Hayal has been detained in connection with the Dink case. Both men are from Trabzon, on the Black Sea in far eastern Turkey, a city known as a nationalist stronghold. 
 One of the mourners, Nazli Ilicak, a journalist, said that while Muslim Turks felt a strong sense of shame at the killing of Mr. Dink, the government ''will find it hard to turn this dynamism into a real step for peace with Armenia before the elections this year, especially in the shadow of increasing nationalism.''

HEADLINE: Aerospace Giant Posts 38% Gain 

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
United Technologies said Tuesday that its fourth-quarter profit rose 38 percent as strong earnings growth from aerospace divisions offset declines at its helicopter and heating-cooling companies. 
 Quarterly earnings increased to $865 million, or 87 cents a share, from $626 million, or 62 cents a share, in the period last year. The latest quarter includes restructuring costs of $82 million.
Revenue grew 14 percent, to $12.79 billion, from $11.26 billion in the period a year ago.
 Analysts polled by Thomson Financial forecast profit of 85 cents a share on revenue of $12.17 billion.
 United Technologies, based in Hartford, is the corporate parent of the jet engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney, the aerospace company Hamilton Sundstrand, Otis Elevator, Sikorsky Aircraft, the Carrier maker of heating and cooling products and other businesses.
 One concern of analysts is that a continued economic downturn in the United States will hurt the Carrier division, where fourth-quarter operating profits dropped 3 percent, to $203 million, as the housing market slowed and demand for air-conditioners and furnaces dropped.
 The company reiterated 2007 earnings guidance of $4.05 to $4.20 a share. Analysts are forecasting a 2007 profit of $4.16 a share.
 United Technologies' shares rose $2.05, to $66.14, on Tuesday.

The following are excerpts of reader responses to David Leonhardt's Jan. 24 column on the economics of illness prevention:
 David Leonhardt unfortunately perpetuates the big lie most of us tell ourselves concerning health care, when he writes about "the current American medical system." There is no such "system," unless a system can be defined as a collection of disparate, disorganized elements, often functioning at cross purposes to each other. We do ourselves a terrible disservice by claiming that there is anything systematic about American health care, over all.
Dr. Valentin Fuster, quoted in the article, offers a more accurate term: "It's a disaster." It will continue to be a catastrophe until we do actually construct a health care "system," rather than a mess of non-systematic, poorly adhering band-aids. Every time we repeat the great "system" lie, we delay progress toward health care disaster relief.

 Thank you for your article. I have been a family physician for 26 years and I know how costly it is to prevent disease. In family medicine, we can manage 90% of what our patients have and naturally we try to address the big killers (smoking, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia). But we can also manage the pain in the back, cough, rash, funny-looking moles, and so on. So, when my quadruple threat patient is in the room I can deal with what he or she wants to address -- that is, the things that bother them now -- or the things that will kill or disable them later. 
 There is a ceiling on what I can collect for my time. Insurers will not pay me for the hour needed to address problems properly. Insurers will not question the angioplasty, or repeat angioplasty, or coronary bypass when angioplasty fails, or heart transplant when all else fails (this scenario actually happens in my practice) or the kidney transplant when a heart finally works and now the same things that killed the first heart is killing the kidneys. 
 It takes a constant dedication to doing what is right to continue to address the risks for cardiovascular disease. If Dr. Agatston were not earning money on his publications, as your article implies, he would be doing catheterizations and stress tests to earn his living, that's for sure. Prevention does not pay. 
 - John J. Messmer
 Please review medical school curriculae: M.D. candidates do not learn how to heal and prevent illness, they learn to treat the symptoms of illness. 
 Turning the medical profession's pay & incentive program on its head by rewarding better results (i.e., a patient population that lives longer, healthier lives,) is a bit too utopian - it sounds a bit too much like common sense. A movement like this would be akin to tearing the shroud in the hallowed hall of the American Medical Association.
 - Daniel Lowry
 Excellent story, and a critical issue. It is astonishing how few insurers provide wellness stipends for employers and/or self-employed
 - Mark B. Solomon
 Are insurance companies just stupid? Don't they understand how good an investment it is to spend a small amount on prevention instead of giant amounts on treatment?
 Maybe the insurers are just stupid, but maybe they're just smart. If an insurer disburses $100 for preventive care on me today, does it save a $1000 on treatment for me in five years? Not if I change jobs and my new employer uses a different insurance company. Not if I keep the same job and my employer switches insurance companies.
 Job mobility currently means insurance mobility. Why would an insurer make an investment today when there is a high probability that a competitor will enjoy the return? Universal insurance via private insurance doesn't solve this if people can switch carriers (maintain "freedom of choice").

 Did you see McDonald's made $1.2 billion in profits in one quarter? What is that the 99-cent sandwich really costing us in future healthcare costs, especially since McDonald's customer base is more likely to be uninsured?

 I have a suggestion to simplify things. Do as the Chinese do and pay your doctor to keep you healthy. If you get sick, he pays you. There is an incentive to wellness, not sickness. 
 - John L. Benson
 I enjoyed your article on prevention, but how come you did not look at the Dean Ornish program for reversing heart disease? His organization is the Preventative Medicine Research Institute and he has been doing this research for 30+ years. I know many people whose lives have been changed by the program. 
 - Jim Venturi
 Does the coaching and personal care have to be rendered by doctors and nurses who are highly compensated and whose time is in great demand? If the approach has so much potential to save lives, save us from surgery, and, yes, save money, then why not create a new role for coaches who are specially trained in this field? What if a corporate division had a Health Coach, who with proper releases from employees, was looped in to medical tests results such as cholesterol counts, heart problems and other related issues? The coaches could be the ones providing the information, coaching, encouragement, goal setting and TLC. Same objectives achieved at far less cost.
 - Marshall Tarley
 Your message that preventative care is not properly incentivized for physicians is definitely long overdue and underappreciated. While it is important to motivate health care providers to push for preventative measures that work, patients need to do their "homework" too. Too often, physicians face a public that wants to have their cake and eat it too. How can preventative measures work for those patients who continue to abuse tobacco, overeat, or are not compliant with their medications. Those patients who work hard to maintain their health should be incentivized to do so monetarily. Physicians are now being asked to participate in a "pay for performance" model where certain clinical behavior is rewarded by third party payers. Wouldn't preventative measures work best if our patients are incentivized as well with their version of "pay for performance"?
 -Charles H. Koo, MD
 Great article. I'm afraid the problem isn't just confined to America. Here in the UK, when I went to the doctor on an unrelated issue and asked if there are health screenings that I should undergo to identify potential health issues, I was told that unless I'm above a certain age (I'm 31 but think that if I wait for the body to start failing, it is too late to make those changes which need to be made now, really) the National Health Service does not cover any tests. The only test that has proven to save lives which I will be allowed to take is a pap smear. 
 Grrr...private medical insurance will screen (via basic blood tests) but it will cost $:250 on top of the insurance premium?! Surely we should be rewarded for wanting to know where we stand health and fitness wise. I suspect they think I'm one of the worried well.
 - Hazel Tan
 There are two achievable and rapidly emerging, themes that will drive rapid change in the way health care is delivered. First and foremost, we must make consumers more accountable (financially) for making better health choices. Second, we must provide the tools with which they can make those choices.
 The is a mounting pile of evidence to suggest that consumers will change their health behavior with even small financial incentives (penalties) to encourage them. As your article suggests, there is also a growing amount of data to suggest that prevention works. Thus, if we create real accountability on the part of the consumer and we provide the tools with which they can practice prevention, the results will be powerful. Prevention is relatively cheap and it does not need to be delivered by a doctor or in a hospital. It can be delivered by lower cost providers (nurses, pharmacists, exercise and nutrition specialists, etc.) outside of a doctors office or health center. 
 There is no quick or easy fix to the complex problems facing our nations health care system. However, there are clear and proven steps that can begin to address the root issues. 
 -Brooks O'Neil
 I broke my arm falling into a ditch in kyoto 6 yrs ago. My husband, who is an internist/non-invasive cardiologist, took one look at my rapidly swelling arm, and we found a hospital near our hotel. for $150 I got 4 x-rays; consultation with the chief of orthopedics who had done some training in Maryland and spoke enough English; a sling to immobilize the arm; and enough pain medication to last the remaining 10 days of our trip. Oh, and my husband was offered a cup of green tea my husband was offered while he waited for the meds at the attached pharmacy. There was no insurance involved, and it took about 1 1/2 hrs from start to finish. So i'm a believer in universal single-payer health care.
 - Sue Lyon
 As the precursors of heart disease are present to the eye in the aortas of teenagers (Bogalusa Heart Study), we have to start teaching the science of prevention in primary school. It may be too late if we wait till one is an adult. I argue that learning how the body works and what makes it stop working is exciting science. It should be a major part of our school's curriculum, along with how to feed your genome to prevent what killed most of your relatives and will kill half of you. We all need to become pretty good preventive health doctors for our own bodies.

HEADLINE: A Commercial Landlord's Biggest Sale May Be Itself

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
For several years, Equity Office Properties, the huge commercial portfolio assembled by the Chicago real estate magnate Samuel Zell, lagged other publicly traded office landlords.
 No matter what remedial steps the company took -- extricating itself from weak markets by selling $2.7 billion worth of property in 2005 alone, focusing more on strong markets and reducing the vacancy rate in its buildings -- the share price did not budge significantly until rumors began circulating that the company might be sold.
Many analysts were scornful, or at best skeptical, of Mr. Zell's strategy of creating a national brand of office buildings scattered among 37 metropolitan areas. 
 Now, however, Equity Office, its holdings pared to 590 buildings from its peak of 774, is the object of a fierce bidding war involving some of the industry's most prominent risk takers. The contest drove Equity Office's share price to $52.44 at the market close yesterday, a big jump over its 52-week low point, on Feb. 15, of $29.25 a share. 
 The battle over Equity Office pits a group of investors led by Vornado Realty Trust, the owner of more than 100 million square feet of property and one of the nation's most successful publicly traded real estate companies, against Blackstone Group, a private equity fund that has been acquiring real estate at a breathtaking pace over the last five years. In November, Equity Office accepted an all-cash offer of $48.50 a share from Blackstone, in a $36 billion deal, including debt, that would represent the largest leveraged buyout ever. 
 Last week, however, Vornado and its partners sought to top that bid by offering $52 a share in stock and cash. Equity Office, which had appeared to welcome a competing bid, according to analysts, agreed on Monday to give the Vornado team access to nonpublic information and said the challenger had until Jan. 31 to make a formal offer, which is just six days before Equity Office shareholders are scheduled to vote on the Blackstone bid. None of the parties would agree to be interviewed. 
 The frenzy over Equity Office is only the latest indication of how much capital is flowing into commercial real estate, especially office buildings, the last sector to recover from the recession that began with the dot-com bust in 2000. Many investors, including Steven Roth, the chairman of Vornado, say they believe that vacancy rates will continue to decline in the next couple of years, with a corresponding rise in rents.
 In Vornado's latest annual report, Mr. Roth described the transactions in which private companies have paid large premiums for publicly traded real estate companies as an ''epidemic,'' and said this trend ''seems to support the conclusion, with which we agree, that public market trading prices are cheap to private values.'' 
 Yet Mr. Roth, who parlayed a stake in a discount appliance chain in New Jersey into a diversified real estate empire that includes premier office buildings in New York and Washington, the Merchandise Mart in Chicago, and some of the costliest retail space on Madison Avenue in Manhattan, has stayed on the sidelines while other REITs like Trizec Properties, CarrAmerica Realty and Reckson Associates Realty were acquired. 
 Last summer, according to a document filed by Equity Office with the Securities and Exchange Commission, top executives of an unidentified company met with Mr. Zell to discuss a possible merger, and was given access to the company's books. But nothing came of those discussions. (Analysts said the company was Vornado.)
 A deal with Equity Office would give Mr. Roth the chance to acquire quality buildings in desirable markets where his company is not currently represented while avoiding the rich prices that individual buildings are commanding. 
 Last month, Vornado paid $542 million, or about $1,009 a square foot, for 350 Park Avenue, a 30-story office building between 51st Street and 52nd Street in Manhattan. Earlier this month, it bought the 1-million-square-foot Manhattan Mall in Herald Square for $689 million, augmenting the 6 million square feet of space it owns in the rapidly appreciating neighborhood around Penn Station.
 Under Mr. Roth's agreement with his consortium partners in the Equity Office bid, Vornado would be able to expand its presence in New York and Washington while entering three markets where development opportunities are scarce -- Boston, downtown San Francisco and Los Angeles -- said Michael Knott, an analyst at Green Street Advisors, a research company in Newport Beach, Calif. 
 That would give Vornado prestigious addresses like the 39-story 1999 Avenue of the Stars in the Century City section of Los Angeles and the Ferry Building overlooking San Francisco Bay, a renovated 19th century structure containing 65,000 square feet of food markets and 175,000 square feet of prime office space. 
 Vornado's partners -- Starwood Capital Group and Walton Street Capital -- would be left with slower real estate markets like Chicago, but they would also gain a foothold in more promising cities like San Jose, Seattle and Miami, Mr. Knott said. The partners operate real estate funds whose investors overlap with one another's and with Blackstone's, real estate specialists said.
 Walton Street was founded by the principals in JMB Realty, a Chicago development company, where Barry S. Sternlicht, the chairman and chief executive of Starwood Capital Group, got his start. At age 29, Mr. Sternlicht engineered a $425 million leveraged buyout of Randsworth Trust, a British real estate company just two years before the collapse of the real estate market, which cost the company and its pension-fund investors all their equity in the project.
 But, like Mr. Zell himself, Mr. Sternlicht saw the distressed market as an opportunity to buy buildings at bargain prices. He bought millions of dollars worth of apartment buildings and sold them for a stake in Equity Residential Property Trust, another REIT founded by Mr. Zell. He also bought a troubled hotel REIT that he transformed into Starwood Hotels and Resorts.
 Mr. Sternlicht, a lodging industry innovator who is credited with creating the W Hotels brand, left the hotel company after a falling out with the board but has remained active in that sector. In 2005, Starwood Capital acquired the company that owned the storied Hotel de Crillon in Paris and also bought control of the Mammoth Mountain ski area in California.
 Neil G. Bluhm, the president of JMB and a co-founder of Walton Street (and Mr. Sternlicht's former boss) has also been an active buyer of hotels. Last year, Walton Street and its partners bought the Drake Hotel in Chicago. 
 In December, Pennsylvania authorities awarded Mr. Bluhm and his partners a license to operate a slot-machine casino in the former Jack Frost sugar refinery in Philadelphia's Fishtown neighborhood. He and Mr. Sternlicht teamed up last year in an unsuccessful effort to buy control of the Riviera Holdings Corporation, the owner of the Riviera Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
 That industry leaders are vying over his office REIT is sweet vindication for Mr. Zell, who has long argued that Wall Street has not given his company the respect it deserved. Over the last seven years, Equity Office's total returns (share price plus dividends) were 138 percent, compared with 280 percent for Vornado, according to Keven S. Lindemann, the director of real estate for SNL Financial, a research company in Charlottesville, Va. During the same period, the SNL REIT office index grew by 166 percent.
 ''The management team at Equity Office had been arguing all along that the market was not valuing their company properly,'' Mr. Lindemann said. ''Pretty much every management team says that. In this case, the Equity Office people were right.''

HEADLINE: Those Invited to Davos Reflect This Year's Theme of a Shift in Power 

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
The World Economic Forum convenes its annual conference here Wednesday with the theme ''Shaping the Global Agenda: The Shifting Power Equation.'' To judge by the names on the guest list -- and those not on it -- the phrase aptly reflects the turnout at this high-altitude huddle.
 Missing are Davos regulars like Bill Clinton, as well as marquee names from the Bush administration, which is sending only its trade negotiator, a deputy secretary of the Treasury, and a few other officials. 
On the list is Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung of Vietnam, newest member of the club of rising world economies, as well as Chad Hurley, the head of YouTube, the Internet site that allows anyone to post a video on the Web.
 ''The power shift is twofold,'' said Klaus Schwab, the Swiss organizer who has managed to keep Davos a hot ticket for three decades by latching onto the latest political and business trends. ''Power is shifting from the center to the periphery, and from the top to the bottom.''
 Mr. Schwab insists there will be no shortage of familiar names at this Alpine ski resort, with 24 heads of state or government, 85 cabinet ministers and more than 800 corporate chiefs. But the sense of flux in the United States, Europe and elsewhere is hard to miss in the program.
 For example, Mr. Schwab played down the absence of a top Bush administration official like Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who was invited to speak but could not find time. Senator John McCain, a strong presidential candidate, however, will be here to give his views on Iraq and other issues.
 ''People may be interested to listen to him to get the longer-term perspective,'' Mr. Schwab said in an interview.
 Some of the traditional heavyweights who do plan to attend are themselves victims of fading fortunes. Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain will close the conference with a speech that amounts to a farewell address -- his tenure running out amid recriminations over the Iraq war.
 John Browne, the chief executive of BP and a co-chairman of the conference, has announced he will step down from the giant energy company in July, a year earlier than planned, after a team of outside investigators harshly criticized BP for safety lapses that led to 15 deaths at its Texas refinery.
 Davos also says it is shunning Hollywood celebrities, even though they have lent this sober event a dash of sex appeal. Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, who stopped moguls and ministers in their tracks last year, will not be here, leaving Bono, the Irish rock star who has assumed a statesman's mantle, to twinkle on his own.
 ''We noticed there was undue publicity given to the attendance of those celebrities at the last meeting,'' Mr. Schwab said. ''We have to be careful that we are not hijacked by the celebrity world.''
 That does not mean the World Economic Forum is playing down big names in other fields. Among the political leaders scheduled to take part are Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany; Gordon Brown, Mr. Blair's presumptive heir; King Abdullah of Jordan; and Mahmoud Abbas, the head of the Palestinian Authority, who canceled last year. 
 Davos lost another sure-fire draw when Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, who had planned to discuss climate-related issues, pulled out after breaking his leg in a skiing accident.
 Climate change will nevertheless be a lively topic of conversation, and not just because the Swiss Alps have had little snow during this Caribbean winter. There will be 17 sessions on climate-related issues, and the organizers are hoping for announcements on a number of initiatives.
 From the corporate world, the organizers have booked repeat guests like Bill Gates, Michael S. Dell, Carlos Ghosn of Renault and Nissan, and the Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, as well as a few newcomers, like Rex W. Tillerson, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil.
 Rupert Murdoch, who last attended the conference when it was held in New York in 2002, is scheduled to come. Mr. Murdoch will take part in a panel about the global agenda.
 For anyone with a laptop or a BlackBerry, the future of media will be clear in the Web logs that are proliferating at the conference, including one by The New York Times and The International Herald Tribune. The organizers are aggregating blogs in something called the Davos Conversation.
 Already, bloggers are busy debating the merits of minute-by-minute coverage of the doings at Davos. For some, the openness at a gathering of world leaders is welcome. Others wonder whether the ubiquitous scrutiny will reduce the likelihood of anything real getting done here.
 In truth, Davos has rarely been a place for political breakthroughs, and while the schmoozing opportunities are nonpareil, it is not a seedbed for business deals, like Allen & Company's annual media conference in Sun Valley, Idaho.
 Mr. Schwab views the spread of Web logs as more evidence of the changing power equation. He said he might have to rethink guidelines for reporting events, which put many of the sessions off the record.
 The one issue on which progress is possible at Davos -- trade -- will be discussed behind closed doors. More than 30 trade and agricultural ministers are expected here, including the United States trade representative, Susan C. Schwab, and the chief European negotiator, Peter Mandelson.
 On Saturday, the ministers will gather to try to revive the stalled Doha round of global trade negotiations. After reports of a renewed focus on reaching a deal in the United States and Europe, there is cautious optimism that Doha could get a breath of new life in Davos.
 ''Everyone knows we're just about out of time,'' said a spokesman for the World Trade Organization, Keith Rockwell, referring to the approaching summer expiration of President Bush's special negotiating authority. ''This will mark the negotiations' kicking into a higher gear.''

To the Editor:
 Re ''The Mayor and His Tax Cuts'' (editorial, Jan. 18): 
 The tax cuts proposed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg are a testament to how far New York City has come in the past five years under his leadership.
After years of prudent budgeting, the mayor understands that continued growth is dependent upon reinvestment in our economy. By reducing the financial burden on citizens and businesses and eliminating the city sales tax on clothing and shoes, New York will be better able to compete not only within the region, but also on a national and international scale. 
 Let's give the mayor and his administration the support and congratulations that they have rightly earned.

HEADLINE: The Democratic Response: Economic Imbalance and the Iraq War

 BODY:
Following is an excerpt from a transcript of the Democratic response to the State of the Union address by Senator Jim Webb of Virginia as recorded by The New York Times. A full transcript: nytimes.com/washington. 

 There are two areas where our respective parties have largely stood in contradiction, and I want to take a few minutes to address them tonight. The first relates to how we see the health of our economy, how we measure it and how we ensure that its benefits are properly shared among all Americans. The second regards our foreign policy: how we might bring the war in Iraq to a proper conclusion that will also allow us to continue to fight the war against international terrorism and to address other strategic concerns that our country faces around the world. 
When one looks at the health of our economy, it's almost as if we're living in two different countries. Some say that things have never been better. The stock market is at an all-time high, and so are corporate profits. But these benefits are not being fairly shared. When I graduated from college, the average corporate C.E.O. made 20 times what the average worker did; today, it's nearly 400 times. In other words, it takes the average worker more than a year to make the money that his or her boss makes in one day.
 Wages and salaries for our workers are at all-time lows as a percentage of national wealth, even though the productivity of American workers is the highest in the world. Medical costs have skyrocketed. College tuition rates are off the charts. Our manufacturing base is being dismantled and sent overseas. Good American jobs are being sent along with them.
 In short, the middle class of this country, our historic backbone and our best hope for a strong society in the future, is losing its place at the table. Our workers know this, through painful experience. Our white-collar professionals are beginning to understand it, as their jobs start disappearing also. And they expect, rightly, that in this age of globalization their government has a duty to insist that their concerns be dealt with fairly in the international marketplace.
 In the early days of our republic, President Andrew Jackson established an important principle of American-style democracy: that we should measure the health of our society not at its apex, but at its base. Not with the numbers that come out of Wall Street, but with the living conditions that exist on Main Street. We must recapture that spirit today.
 Under the leadership of the new Democratic Congress, we're on our way to doing so. The House just passed a minimum-wage increase, the first in 10 years, and the Senate will soon follow. We've introduced a broad legislative package designed to regain the trust of the American people. We've established a tone of cooperation and consensus that extends beyond party lines. We're working to get the right things done, for the right people and for the right reasons.
 With respect to foreign policy, this country has patiently endured a mismanaged war for nearly four years. Many, including myself, warned even before the war began that it was unnecessary, that it would take our energy and attention away from the larger war against terrorism, and that invading and occupying Iraq would leave us strategically vulnerable in the most violent and turbulent corner of the world.
 I want to share with all of you a picture that I have carried with me for more than 50 years. This is my father, when he was a young Air Force captain, flying cargo planes during the Berlin Airlift. He sent us the picture from Germany, as we waited for him back here at home. When I was a small boy, I used to take the picture to bed with me every night, because for more than three years my father was deployed, unable to live with us full-time, serving overseas or in bases where there was no family housing. I still keep it, to remind me of the sacrifices that my mother and others had to make, over and over again, as my father gladly served our country. I was proud to follow in his footsteps, serving as a marine in Vietnam. My brother did as well, serving as a Marine helicopter pilot. My son has joined the tradition, now serving as an infantry marine in Iraq.
 Like so many other Americans, today and throughout our history, we serve and have served, not for political reasons, but because we love our country. On the political issues, those matters of war and peace, and in some cases of life and death we trusted the judgment of our national leaders. We hoped that they would be right, that they would measure with accuracy the value of our lives against the enormity of the national interest that might call upon us to go into harm's way.
 We owed them our loyalty, as Americans, and we gave it. But they owed us sound judgment, clear thinking, concern for our welfare, a guarantee that the threat to our country was equal to the price we might be called upon to pay in defending it.
 The president took us into this war recklessly. He disregarded warnings from the national security adviser during the first gulf war, the chief of staff of the Army, two former commanding generals of the Central Command, whose jurisdiction includes Iraq, the director of operations on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and many, many others with great integrity and long experience in national security affairs. We are now, as a nation, held hostage to the predictable and predicted disarray that has followed.
 The war's costs to our nation have been staggering: Financially. The damage to our reputation around the world. The lost opportunities to defeat the forces of international terrorism. And especially the precious blood of our citizens who have stepped forward to serve.
 The majority of the nation no longer supports the way this war is being fought, nor does the majority of our military. Nor does the majority of Congress. We need a new direction. Not one step back from the war against international terrorism. Not a precipitous withdrawal that ignores the possibility of further chaos. But an immediate shift toward strong regionally based diplomacy, a policy that takes our soldiers off the streets of Iraq's cities, and a formula that will in short order allow our combat forces to leave Iraq.
 On both of these vital issues, our economy and our national security, it falls upon those of us in elected office to take action.
 Regarding the economic imbalance in our country, I am reminded of the situation President Theodore Roosevelt faced in the early days of the 20th century. America was then, as now, drifting apart along class lines. The so-called robber barons were unapologetically raking in a huge percentage of the national wealth. The dispossessed workers at the bottom were threatening revolt.
 Roosevelt spoke strongly against these divisions. He told his fellow Republicans that they must set themselves ''as resolutely against improper corporate influence on the one hand as against demagogy and mob rule on the other.'' And he did something about it.
 As I look at Iraq, I recall the words of former General and soon-to-be President Dwight Eisenhower during the dark days of the Korean War, which had fallen into a bloody stalemate. ''When comes the end?'' asked the general who had commanded our forces in Europe during World War II. And as soon as he became president, he brought the Korean War to an end.
 These presidents took the right kind of action, for the benefit of the American people and for the health of our relations around the world. Tonight, we're calling on this president to take similar action, in both areas. If he does, we will join him. If he does not, we will be showing him the way.

HEADLINE: To Deliver Their Remarks, Democrats Opt to Put a Fresh Face Front and Center

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
When President Bush concluded his State of the Union address, Democrats did not turn to the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, or to the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, to deliver their response. They chose a different face for the party: a former Republican, an ex-marine and a secretary of the Navy in the Reagan administration.
 That Democrat, Senator Jim Webb of Virginia, who won his seat at least in part through his tenacious opposition to the Iraq war, wore his son's combat boots on the campaign trail last year. And on Tuesday evening, Mr. Webb invoked his own biography, and his family's three generations of military service, as he declared that today's soldiers could no longer trust the judgment of their commander in chief. 
''The majority of the nation no longer supports the way this war is being fought, nor do the majority of our military, nor does a majority of our Congress,'' Mr. Webb said. ''We need a new direction.'' 
 The choice of Mr. Webb was intended to provide a symbol, through his words and appearance, for the new majority in Congress. In a commanding voice, the senator chastised the administration for its economic and foreign policies, but said Democrats would try to work with Mr. Bush to change course.
 ''If he does not,'' Mr. Webb said, ''we will be showing him the way.''
 Late last year, before being sworn into the Senate, Mr. Webb created a minor furor when he declined to stand in line for a photograph with the president at a White House reception. When the two men finally came face to face, Mr. Bush asked Mr. Webb about his son, who was deployed in Iraq, to which Mr. Webb replied tersely, ''That's between me and my boy.''
 In a city that cherishes photo opportunities, where even political rivals are inclined to extend a hand and smile, the private moment highlighted deep tensions of the day. The conservative columnist George F. Will derided Mr. Webb as a ''pompous poseur'' disrespectful of the president, while liberal bloggers hailed him as a burst of fresh air.
 Mr. Webb, 60, is a leading member of the freshman class of Democrats who arrived here with a mandate of change. His triumph over Senator George Allen, a one-term Republican, made him a hero among Democrats, particularly among antiwar activists, and prompted Representative Pelosi, of California, and Senator Reid, of Nevada, to tap him for the marquee position.
 ''He represents to me what the new America is all about,'' Mr. Reid, ''someone who understands what it means to go to war, what it means to have peace, what it means to work on a bipartisan basis, someone who understands Reagan Democrats and the non-Reagan Democrats and independents and Republicans out there.''
 At the same time, Mr. Webb also illustrates the internal challenges facing Democrats as they settle on a response to the president's Iraq strategy. His five-minute speech did wade into the thorny question of whether the party will go beyond a symbolic resolution denouncing Mr. Bush's plan to send more troops to Baghdad.
 ''We are now, as a nation, held hostage to the predictable -- and predicted -- disarray that has followed,'' Mr. Webb said, speaking against a backdrop of a United States and Virginia flag on the Capitol's second floor. ''The war's costs to our nation have been staggering.''
 In his speech, which was approved by Democratic Congressional leaders, Mr. Webb also criticized Mr. Bush as presiding over an era of economic injustice.
 ''It's almost as if we are living in two different countries,'' Mr. Webb said, noting that corporate profits might be reaching new highs, but that those benefits were reserved for the few. ''The middle class of this country -- our historic backbone and our best hope for a strong society in the future -- is losing its place at the table.''


CORRECTION-DATE: January 25, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about Senator Jim Webb of Virginia and his response, for the Democratic Party, to the State of Union address omitted part of a conversation he had with President Bush at a White House reception for new members of Congress in November. President Bush approached Mr. Webb, whose son is a marine serving in Iraq, and asked, ''How's your boy?'' Mr. Webb replied, ''I'd like to get them out of Iraq, Mr. President.'' Mr. Webb did not say at that point in the conversation, ''That's between me and my boy, Mr. President.'' Mr. Webb did not make that statement until after Mr. Bush had said of the Iraq comment: ''That's not what I asked you. How's your boy?'' 
 The article also referred incorrectly to how Mr. Webb's speech dealt with Democrats' response to the president's Iraq strategy. The speech did not mention whether the party will go beyond a symbolic resolution denouncing Mr. Bush's plan to send more troops to Baghdad.

HEADLINE: Bush Seeks Vast, Mandatory Increase in Alternative Fuels and Greater Vehicle Efficiency

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and FELICITY BARRINGER; Alexei Barrionuevo contributed reporting from Chicago, and Matthew L. Wald from Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
Vowing to reduce the nation's thirst for foreign oil, President Bush called on Tuesday for a huge government-mandated increase in renewable fuels -- mainly ethanol -- and tougher mileage standards for cars and light trucks.
 It was the second year in a row that Mr. Bush made ''energy security'' a focal point of his State of the Union address, but his proposals on Tuesday were modest, and perhaps less achievable, than those he made a year ago when he said the nation was ''addicted to oil.'' 
The centerpiece of Mr. Bush's proposal, which he said would cut the projected use of gasoline by 20 percent over the next decade, was a nearly fivefold mandatory increase in the production of ethanol and other alternative fuels for cars and trucks. The most obvious beneficiaries would be makers of ethanol and other biofuels, but it could also promote the production of liquefied coal.
 Mr. Bush called for a mandatory requirement that makers of fuel produce 35 billion gallons of alternative fuels a year by 2017, replacing about 15 percent of the projected gasoline use in that year. 
 A second major plank of Mr. Bush's energy proposal calls for increasing fuel-efficiency standards of cars and trucks by 4 percent a year -- about one mile per gallon -- starting in 2010 for cars and 2012 for trucks.
 That was a significant change from Mr. Bush's approach last year, when he called for ''reform'' of the corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE, rules, but avoided suggesting specific mileage requirements.
 In a third proposal, Mr. Bush called for doubling the amount of oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to about 1.5 billion barrels of oil. The doubling would take place at a snail's pace over the next 20 years. Even so, advance word of the idea helped push up oil prices by $2.46 a barrel on Tuesday to $55.04.
 ''It's a big change that the president has endorsed these new fuel-efficiency standards,'' said Frederick W. Smith, the chief executive of the FedEx Corporation and a co-chairman of the Energy Security Leadership Council, a group of executive and retired military officers. These standards, he said, match their recommendations, ''which are achievable.''
 But the proposals face an array of obstacles, both practical and political. On a practical level, skeptics noted that Mr. Bush's goal for ethanol would require big advances in ''cellulosic ethanol,'' a form of ethanol made from plants like switchgrass that has yet to be produced at anything close to competitive prices. It could also require up to 40 million additional acres devoted to growing the plant material involved as well as a sprawling new infrastructure for transforming the feedstock into fuel.
 On a political level, Mr. Bush faces a Congress that is now controlled by Democrats, some of whom criticized him on Tuesday for proposing little to reduce the production of heat-trapping gases implicated in global warming. 
 ''I am disappointed,'' said Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico and chairman of the Senate Energy Committee. He said Mr. Bush was ''completely silent'' on energy efficiency and reduction of carbon dioxide from electric power plants, which contribute 40 percent of these emissions.
 Cars and trucks account for about one-third of heat-trapping gases that result from burning fossil fuels. Electric utilities and other ''smokestack'' sources were not addressed.
 ''If this was a real effort to solve the climate problem, it would include large stationary sources and utilities,'' said Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, a nonpartisan policy research group.
 Ms. Claussen and other environmental leaders also criticized the absence of any proposal for a mandatory cap on emissions of heat-trapping gases. 
 Many supporters of ethanol and other renewable fuels praised Mr. Bush's proposals. The Union of Concerned Scientists estimated that the mileage requirement could save 550,000 barrels of oil per day in 2017, and reduce emissions equivalent to ''taking 14 million of today's cars and trucks off the road.''
 But many cautioned that the goals would be difficult to attain, might do little to reduce gas emissions and could lead to higher food prices as farmers cater to energy demand rather than food production.
 Philip Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust, said, ''The big numbers may sound impressive, but this is nothing more than stay-the-course on global warming.'' The proposal, Mr. Clapp said, represents a 1.5 percent cut in carbon emissions a decade hence. ''They will still go up by 14 percent over the next decade.''
 And if liquefied coal, which produces double the heat-trapping gases of regular gasoline, is part of the alternative-fuel mix -- as coal-industry lobbyists and environmental groups say is the case -- the emissions reductions would fall significantly.
 Mr. Bush called for increasing the requirement for annual production of alternative fuels to 35 billion gallons a year. That would almost quintuple the current mandate of producing 7.5 billion gallons of ethanol by 2012. Spurred by tax breaks and soaring oil prices, ethanol production has climbed rapidly and is expected to hit 6 billion gallons this year.
 But energy analysts say that corn-based ethanol, which accounts for virtually all of today's production, will not be able to produce more than about half as much alternative fuel as Mr. Bush envisions by 2017.
 Mr. Bush also laced his proposals with numerous ''safety valves'' that could delay attainment of his goals.

HEADLINE: BUSH, PRESSING MODEST AGENDA, INSISTS U.S. MUST NOT FAIL IN IRAQ

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
President Bush tried to resuscitate his ailing presidency Tuesday night, using his State of the Union address to present a modest agenda of energy and health care proposals while warning an increasingly assertive Congress against undercutting his new Iraq strategy. 
 It was a speech that reflected Mr. Bush's difficult circumstances. It was limited in ambition and political punch at home, with no proposals to rival his call two years ago to remake Social Security, no mention of rebuilding New Orleans and no allusions to limiting stem cell research or banning gay marriage.
And when it came to his plan to send additional troops to Iraq, he was forced to plead with the Democrats who now control Congress -- and with a growing number of Republican critics -- to ''give it a chance to work.''
 In an admission that the United States now finds itself trapped in the cross-fire of a sectarian conflict, Mr. Bush said, ''This is not the fight we entered in Iraq, but it is the fight we are in.'' While he insisted that America could not afford to fail, he also warned the Iraqi government that ''our commitment is not open-ended.'' 
 His freshest initiative was setting a goal of reducing projected gasoline consumption 20 percent over the next 10 years. This hit a theme tailored to his appeal for bipartisanship in a city where the balance of power has shifted markedly against Mr. Bush since the last State of the Union address. Although he did not propose any measures to deal with emissions from power plants and factories, the main sources of greenhouse gases, he spoke of ''the serious challenge of global climate change.'' 
 The other main element of his domestic agenda, a package of proposals intended to improve access to health insurance, had drawn intense opposition from Democrats long before Mr. Bush walked to the well of the House chamber on Tuesday night, a scene he could not have relished but handled graciously. Behind him sat a Democratic House speaker, Representative Nancy Pelosi, sitting alongside Vice President Dick Cheney. In front of him was an audience of Democrats growing increasingly comfortable with their new power, including quite a few who are jockeying to take his job and reverse the policies he has put in place.
 Mr. Bush gamely ticked off other goals he would like to achieve before leaving office in three days short of two years. They included overhauling immigration laws, taking steps toward a balanced budget, dealing with the long-term financial condition of Social Security and Medicare, and imposing tighter standards on schools. 
 Yet the proposals were overwhelmed by the Iraq debate. 
 ''Many in this chamber understand that America must not fail in Iraq,'' Mr. Bush said, ''because you understand that the consequences of failure would be grievous and far-reaching.'' 
 While Mr. Bush has traditionally used these speeches to present a hopeful vision of Iraq's future, he could not do so on Tuesday night. His own nominee to take over the command of United States forces in Iraq, Lt. Gen. David H. Petraeus, told the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier in the day that ''the situation in Iraq is dire.''
 Mr. Bush started his speech 12 hours before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was to begin working on a bipartisan resolution in opposition to his plan to send additional troops to Iraq. Despite his proposal of a bipartisan council to advise him on the battle against Islamic extremism, Democrats immediately assailed him, and members of his own party continued to show signs of edging away.
 In the Democratic response to his address, Senator Jim Webb of Virginia, whose son is a marine serving in Iraq, said that Mr. Bush ''took us into this war recklessly,'' and that the United States was now ''held hostage to the predictable and predicted disarray that followed.'' Mr. Webb called for ''a formula that will in short order allow our combat forces to leave Iraq,'' and said that if Mr. Bush did not change course in Iraq and in his economic policies, ''we will be showing him the way.''
 Mr. Bush got a polite reception, but one far more muted than in previous appearances. He waited until the end of his nearly 50-minute speech to deliver the assessment that typically opens these addresses, that ''the state of our union is strong.'' For a man who finds himself struggling to maintain public and political support, Mr. Bush delivered the speech in a confident tone, with easy and relaxed smiles.
 Seeking new ground for consensus, Mr. Bush reached back to a theme that marked the first days of his presidency, when he would regularly appeal for bipartisanship. ''Our citizens don't much care which side of the aisle we sit on, as long as we are willing to cross that aisle when there is work to be done,'' he said. 
 But the power dynamic on Tuesday night was completely different. In the six years in which Republicans controlled one or both houses of Congress, Democrats said they saw little of that bipartisan instinct at work, and despite vows to behave differently, they have not shown much in return.
 In fact, Mr. Bush's argument on Tuesday night for embracing his Iraq plan amounted to a reverse of the argument that he made from the same podium four years ago, when he contended that dealing with Saddam Hussein would help the United States bring other rogue states to heel. This time, Mr. Bush spoke of a ''nightmare scenario,'' of an Iraq ''overrun by extremists on all sides.'' He said the violence in the country would turn contagious, spread beyond Iraq's borders and inflame the entire Middle East.
 And he appealed to Democrats to remember the votes many of them cast in 2002 to authorize the invasion, throwing some responsibility their way in the process. 
 ''We went into this largely united, in our assumptions and in our convictions,'' he said, recalling the days when his approval ratings were sky-high. ''And whatever you voted for, you did not vote for failure.''
 Mr. Bush was careful in describing what many in his administration believe could be a coming confrontation with Iran. While he vowed that the world would never allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon, he made no threats, saying he was relying on diplomacy to deal with both Iran and North Korea, the two countries that, five years ago, he declared in a State of the Union address made up an ''axis of evil'' with Mr. Hussein's Iraq. 
 There were no such labels on Tuesday, a reflection of the reality that with American forces tied down in Iraq, Mr. Bush's options are limited.
 But the effect of Iraq extends to the domestic front. Even his allies say the war threatens the prospects of the new initiatives he described.
 ''Iraq casts a huge shadow over anything in the domestic policy arena that the president talks about,'' said Glen Bolger, a Republican pollster. ''The situation makes it very difficult for the president to get Americans to pay attention to what he's saying on issues like energy and health care.''
 Dan Bartlett, the White House counselor, argued otherwise. ''If you talk about the issues the public cares about, and you put forward innovative, bold ideas,'' Mr. Bartlett said, ''the American people, regardless of what the polls say that day, will say, 'This is worth study, this is worth engaging the Democratic Congress on.' ''
 Ms. Pelosi and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate majority leader, said in a joint statement that Mr. Bush's goals on energy were ''commendable'' but suggested that they would seek to achieve them through different policies. 
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, speaking on ABC News, said Mr. Bush would find ''a receptive audience'' for his energy and health care goals, though she later said she found the early details of his health care plan ''really troubling.'' The Republican minority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said the two parties should find innovative ways to tackle the issues.
 Mr. Bush's aides and allies argue that he could exert some leverage by accusing Democrats of intransigence and ''do-nothingness'' should they flatly shoot down his proposals, as they were starting to do even before his speech.
 ''The real question is not whether he can make it work; he's extended his hand several times now,'' said Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona. ''The real question is how much do the Democrats want to cooperate with him.''
 But the Democrats have been in control only a few weeks, and polls indicate that for now the public is more likely to side with them in a fight. And it is not clear that Mr. Bush's new proposals would do anything to reverse the political balance of power.


2004

IMMIGRATION
''I propose a new temporary-worker program to match willing foreign workers with willing employers when no Americans can be found to fill the job.''

PROGRESS: The Senate passed a 2006 bill with a temporary-worker program, which Mr. Bush supported. The legislation died after facing opposition from Republican leaders in the House.

SAME-SEX MARRIAGE
''If judges insist on forcing their arbitrary will upon the people, the only alternative left to the people would be the constitutional process.''

PROGRESS: Backers lacked the votes in Congress to pass a constitutional amendment barring same-sex marriage. They complain Mr. Bush has not done enough to promote it.

2005

SOCIAL SECURITY
''If you're a younger worker, I believe you should be able to set aside part of that money in your own retirement account, so you can build a nest egg for your own future.''

PROGRESS: Mr. Bush campaigned hard for private investment accounts in 2005, but failed. Many Democrats say they still want the president to take private investment accounts explicitly off the table.

EMBRYONIC STEM CELL RESEARCH
''I will work with Congress to ensure that human embryos are not created for experimentation or grown for body parts, and that human life is never bought and sold as a commodity.''

PROGRESS: In his only veto, Mr. Bush rejected a measure that would have expanded federal financing for embryonic stem cell research. The bill recently passed the House again, but another veto is likely.

2006

OIL DEPENDENCE
''America is addicted to oil, which is often imported from unstable parts of the world. The best way to break this addiction is through technology. Tonight, I announce the Advanced Energy Initiative - a 22 percent increase in clean-energy research - at the Department of Energy.''

PROGRESS: The initiative remains in limbo, as Congress did not pass a 2007 appropriation for the Energy Department. As a result, $630 million, instead of $770 milllion, is being spent for research on energy sources like hydrogen fuel cells, ethanol, solar power, wind and coal gasification.

Measuring is the only way to know whether all our children are learning.''PROGRESS: The act was passed in January 2002. There have been signs of higher performance on tests, but the gap between minority and white students has narrowed little.TAX CUTS''The growing surplus exists because taxes are too high and government is charging more than it needs. The people of America have been overcharged, and on their behalf, I am here asking for a refund.''PROGRESS: A package of $1.35 trillion in tax cuts over 10 years was passed in 2001. Individual tax rates fell, the estate tax is being phased out, and tax rates on capital gains were halved. Almost all of these cuts are set to expire at the end of 2010.2002'AXIS OF EVIL'''States like these'' - North Korea, Iran and Iraq - ''and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil. We will work closely with our coalition to deny terrorists and their state sponsors the materials, technology and expertise to make and deliver weapons of mass destruction.''PROGRESS: Saddam Hussein's regime was toppled by a U.S.-led invasion in 2003. Since then, North Korea has tested a nuclear device and by some estimates produced the fuel for a half-dozen more. Iran, in defiance of U.N. sanctions, is enriching uranium.DOMESTIC SECURITY''My budget nearly doubles funding for a sustained strategy of homeland security, focused on four key areas: bioterrorism, emergency response, airport and border security, and improved intelligence.''PROGRESS: Progress has been generally slow. For instance, the single biggest bioterrorism initiative - to buy 75 million doses of a new anthrax vaccine - was canceled last month. Improving airport checkpoints has also lagged.2003AIDS IN AFRICA''I ask the Congress to commit $15 billion over the next five years, including nearly $10 billion in new money, to turn the tide against AIDS in the most afflicted nations of Africa and the Caribbean.''PROGRESS: Congress has committed the money, and it is being spent. But critics say the administration is channeling the money to nations whose policies fit its ideology.IRAQ''If Saddam Hussein does not fully disarm, for the safety of our people and for the peace of the world, we will lead a coalition to disarm him.''PROGRESS: A U.S.-led invasion removed Saddam Hussein from power in April 2003. It quickly became clear he had no weapons of mass destruction.

HEADLINE: A Healthy, Well-Regulated Wall Street

 BODY:
A healthy financial sector is crucial to the economic well-being of this country and to New York City in particular. And it is true that Wall Street is facing ever stiffer competition from financial markets like London's and Hong Kong's. But beware of the doomsayers who argue that American markets are in free fall and -- not incidentally -- contend that looser regulations are the only way to save them. 
 Senator Charles Schumer and Mayor Michael Bloomberg joined that chorus this week. In a new report, they warn that without changes to what they call America's ''stringent regulations and high litigation risks,'' this country's share of the lucrative finance business will decline further, at a cost of billions of dollars and thousands of jobs.
We certainly don't want American regulations to drive away good business. But it is first important to remember that when investors lose their shirts in huge frauds like Enron, plenty of damage is done to markets as well. And any discussion about the health of our financial industry must be as honest and open as possible. This report at times seems to cull facts to prove predetermined conclusions. 
 For example, to support its argument that the United States markets are losing ground, the report notes that over the first 10 months of 2006, American exchanges managed barely a third of the overall share of initial public offerings that they did in 2001. It strikes us as odd that a report released in late January could not include data from the previous November. In that month, the Securities and Exchange Commission registered 32 initial public offerings worth a total of $8 billion -- the highest monthly total in five years.
 The report goes on to say that the number and cost of securities class-action settlements in this nation set an all-time high in 2005. That's hardly surprising, considering the many settlements in that year stemming from the enormous fraud at WorldCom. But what about last year? The number of securities fraud class-action suits fell 38 percent in 2006, to the lowest level in 10 years. And in May, prosecutors indicted the nation's leading class-action securities law firm, Milberg Weiss Bershad & Schulman, for allegedly making secret payments to plaintiffs.
 The report raises some valuable questions, and we agree with some of its conclusions. Loosening restrictions on work visas for talented foreigners and visitor visas for dealmakers strikes us as essential. And efforts under way to reduce the costs associated with complying with Sarbanes-Oxley regulations -- for example, by focusing audits on the riskiest parts of balance sheets -- are a valuable recalibration of the law's most onerous provisions.
 While some common-sense changes are needed, the rights of shareholders and the stability of our markets cannot be trampled in the headlong rush for competitive advantages. United States financial markets are still the largest in the world, and Wall Street just enjoyed a year of record profits. And while we're talking about reforms, financial firms might take a look in the mirror and ask whether lower underwriting fees and smaller bonuses could also contribute to their long-term health and the health of America's financial markets.

HEADLINE: 'The State of Our Union Is Strong; Our Cause in the World Is Right'

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a transcript of President Bush's State of the Union address as recorded by The New York Times. A full transcript: nytimes.com/washington.

 The rite of custom brings us together at a defining hour when decisions are hard and courage is needed. We enter the year 2007 with large endeavors under way and others that are ours to begin. In all of this, much is asked of us. We must have the will to face difficult challenges and determined enemies, and the wisdom to face them together.
Some in this chamber are new to the House and the Senate, and I congratulate the Democratic majority. Congress has changed, but not our responsibilities. Each of us is guided by our own convictions, and to these we must stay faithful. Yet we're all held to the same standards, and called to serve the same good purposes: to extend this nation's prosperity; to spend the people's money wisely; to solve problems, not leave them to future generations; to guard America against all evil; and to keep faith with those we have sent forth to defend us. 
 We're not the first to come here with government divided and uncertainty in the air. Like many before us, we can work through our differences, and we can achieve big things for the American people.

Domestic Policy
 
 Tonight, I want to discuss three economic reforms that deserve to be priorities for this Congress. 
 First, we must balance the federal budget. We can do so without raising taxes. What we need is spending discipline in Washington, D.C. We set a goal of cutting the deficit in half by 2009 -- and met that goal three years ahead of schedule. Now let us take the next step. In the coming weeks, I will submit a budget that eliminates the federal deficit within the next five years. I ask you to make the same commitment. Together, we can restrain the spending appetite of the federal government, and we can balance the federal budget.
 Next, there's the matter of earmarks. These special-interest items are often slipped into bills at the last hour when not even C-Span is watching. In 2005 alone, the number of earmarks grew to over 13,000 and totaled nearly $18 billion. Even worse, over 90 percent of the earmarks never make it to the floor of the House and Senate; they are dropped into committee reports that are not even part of the bill that arrives on my desk. You did not vote them into law. I did not sign them into law. Yet they are treated as if they have the force of law. The time has come to end this practice. So let us work together to reform the budget process -- expose every earmark to the light of day and to a vote in Congress and cut the number and cost of earmarks at least in half by the end of this session.
 And finally, to keep this economy strong we must take on the challenge of entitlements. Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid are commitments of conscience, and so it is our duty to keep them permanently sound. Yet we're failing in that duty. And this failure will one day leave our children with three bad options: huge tax increases, huge deficits, or huge and immediate cuts in benefits. Everyone in this chamber knows this to be true, yet somehow we have not found it in ourselves to act. So let us work together and do it now. 
 When it comes to health care, government has an obligation to care for the elderly, the disabled and poor children. And we will meet those responsibilities. For all other Americans, private health insurance is the best way to meet their needs. But many Americans cannot afford a health insurance policy. 
 And so tonight, I propose two new initiatives to help more Americans afford their own insurance. First, I propose a standard tax deduction for health insurance that will be like the standard tax deduction for dependents. Families with health insurance will pay no income or payroll taxes on $15,000 of their income. Single Americans with health insurance will pay no income or payroll taxes on $7,500 of their income. With this reform, more than 100 million men, women and children who are now covered by employer-provided insurance will benefit from lower tax bills.
 At the same time, this reform will level the playing field for those who do not get health insurance through their job. For Americans who now purchase health insurance on their own, this proposal would mean a substantial tax savings: $4,500 for a family of four making $60,000 a year. And for the millions of other Americans who have no health insurance at all, this deduction would help put a basic private health insurance plan within their reach. Changing the tax code is a vital and necessary step to making health care affordable for more Americans.
 My second proposal is to help the states that are coming up with innovative ways to cover the uninsured. States that make basic private health insurance available to all their citizens should receive federal funds to help them provide this coverage to the poor and the sick. I've asked the secretary of health and human services to work with Congress to take existing federal funds and use them to create Affordable Choices grants. These grants would give our nation's governors more money and more flexibility to get private health insurance to those most in need. 
 It's in our vital interest to diversify America's energy supply, and the way forward is through technology. We must continue changing the way America generates electric power by even greater use of clean coal technology, solar and wind energy, and clean, safe nuclear power. We need to press on with battery research for plug-in and hybrid vehicles, and expand the use of clean diesel vehicles and biodiesel fuel. We must continue investing in new methods of producing ethanol, using everything from wood chips, to grasses, to agricultural wastes.
 We made a lot of progress, thanks to good policies here in Washington and the strong response of the market. And now even more dramatic advances are within reach. Tonight, I ask Congress to join me in pursuing a great goal. Let us build on the work we've done and reduce gasoline usage in the United States by 20 percent in the next 10 years. When we do that, we will have cut our total imports by the equivalent of three-quarters of all the oil we now import from the Middle East. 
 To reach this goal, we must increase the supply of alternative fuels, by setting a mandatory fuels standard to require 35 billion gallons of renewable and alternative fuels in 2017. And that is nearly five times the current target. At the same time, we need to reform and modernize fuel economy standards for cars the way we did for light trucks, and conserve up to eight and a half billion more gallons of gasoline by 2017. 

Fight Against Terrorism
 For all of us in this room, there's no higher responsibility than to protect the people of this country from danger. Five years have come and gone since we saw the scenes and felt the sorrow that the terrorists can cause. We've had time to take stock of our situation. We've added many critical protections to guard the homeland. We know with certainty that the horrors of that September morning were just a glimpse of what the terrorists intend for us, unless we stop them. 
 With the distance of time, we find ourselves debating the causes of conflict and the course we have followed. Such debates are essential when a great democracy faces great questions. Yet one question has surely been settled: that to win the war on terror we must take the fight to the enemy. 
 From the start, America and our allies have protected our people by staying on the offense. The enemy knows that the days of comfortable sanctuary, easy movement, steady financing and free-flowing communications are long over. For the terrorists, life since 9/11 has never been the same.
 Our success in this war is often measured by the things that did not happen. We cannot know the full extent of the attacks that we and our allies have prevented, but here is some of what we do know: We stopped an Al Qaeda plot to fly a hijacked airplane into the tallest building on the West Coast. We broke up a Southeast Asian terrorist cell grooming operatives for attacks inside the United States. We uncovered an Al Qaeda cell developing anthrax to be used in attacks against America. And just last August, British authorities uncovered a plot to blow up passenger planes bound for America over the Atlantic Ocean. For each life saved, we owe a debt of gratitude to the brave public servants who devote their lives to finding the terrorists and stopping them.
 Every success against the terrorists is a reminder of the shoreless ambitions of this enemy. The evil that inspired and rejoiced in 9/11 is still at work in the world. And so long as that is the case, America is still a nation at war. 
 In the minds of the terrorists, this war began well before Sept. 11 and will not end until their radical vision is fulfilled. And these past five years have given us a much clearer view of the nature of this enemy. Al Qaeda and its followers are Sunni extremists, possessed by hatred and commanded by a harsh and narrow ideology. Take almost any principle of civilization, and their goal is the opposite. They preach with threats, instruct with bullets and bombs, and promise paradise for the murder of the innocent. 
 Our enemies are quite explicit about their intentions. They want to overthrow moderate governments, and establish safe havens from which to plan and carry out new attacks on our country. By killing and terrorizing Americans, they want to force our country to retreat from the world and abandon the cause of liberty. They would then be free to impose their will and spread their totalitarian ideology. Listen to this warning from the late terrorist Zarqawi: ''We will sacrifice our blood and bodies to put an end to your dreams, and what is coming is even worse.'' And Osama bin Laden declared: ''Death is better than living on this Earth with the unbelievers among us.'' 
 These men are not given to idle words, and they are just one camp in the Islamist radical movement. In recent times, it has also become clear that we face an escalating danger from Shia extremists who are just as hostile to America, and are also determined to dominate the Middle East. Many are known to take direction from the regime in Iran, which is funding and arming terrorists like Hezbollah, a group second only to Al Qaeda in the American lives it has taken.
 The Shia and Sunni extremists are different faces of the same totalitarian threat. But whatever slogans they chant, when they slaughter the innocent, they have the same wicked purposes. They want to kill Americans, kill democracy in the Middle East and gain the weapons to kill on an even more horrific scale.
 In the sixth year since our nation was attacked, I wish I could report to you that the dangers have ended. They have not. And so it remains the policy of this government to use every lawful and proper tool of intelligence, diplomacy, law enforcement, and military action to do our duty, to find these enemies, and to protect the American people. 
 This war is more than a clash of arms -- it is a decisive ideological struggle, and the security of our nation is in the balance. To prevail, we must remove the conditions that inspire blind hatred and drove 19 men to get onto airplanes and come to kill us. What every terrorist fears most is human freedom: societies where men and women make their own choices, answer to their own conscience and live by their hopes instead of their resentments. Free people are not drawn to violent and malignant ideologies, and most will choose a better way when they are given a chance. So we advance our own security interests by helping moderates and reformers and brave voices for democracy. The great question of our day is whether America will help men and women in the Middle East to build free societies and share in the rights of all humanity. And I say, for the sake of our own security, we must. 
 In the last two years, we've seen the desire for liberty in the broader Middle East, and we have been sobered by the enemy's fierce reaction. In 2005, the world watched as the citizens of Lebanon raised the banner of the Cedar Revolution and they drove out the Syrian occupiers and chose new leaders in free elections. In 2005, the people of Afghanistan defied the terrorists and elected a democratic legislature. And in 2005, the Iraqi people held three national elections: choosing a transitional government, adopting the most progressive, democratic constitution in the Arab world and then electing a government under that constitution. Despite endless threats from the killers in their midst, nearly 12 million Iraqi citizens came out to vote in a show of hope and solidarity that we should never forget. 
 A thinking enemy watched all of these scenes, adjusted their tactics, and in 2006 they struck back. In Lebanon, assassins took the life of Pierre Gemayel, a prominent participant in the Cedar Revolution. Hezbollah terrorists, with support from Syria and Iran, sowed conflict in the region and are seeking to undermine Lebanon's legitimately elected government. In Afghanistan, Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters tried to regain power by regrouping and engaging Afghan and NATO forces. In Iraq, Al Qaeda and other Sunni extremists blew up one of the most sacred places in Shia Islam, the Golden Mosque of Samarra. This atrocity, directed at a Muslim house of prayer, was designed to provoke retaliation from Iraqi Shia, and it succeeded. Radical Shia elements, some of whom receive support from Iran, formed death squads. The result was a tragic escalation of sectarian rage and reprisal that continues to this day.

Iraq
 This is not the fight we entered in Iraq, but it is the fight we are in. Every one of us wishes this war were over and won. Yet it would not be like us to leave our promises unkept, our friends abandoned, and our own security at risk. Ladies and gentlemen: On this day, at this hour, it is still within our power to shape the outcome of this battle. Let us find our resolve, and turn events toward victory. 
 We're carrying out a new strategy in Iraq: a plan that demands more from Iraq's elected government and gives our forces in Iraq the reinforcements they need to complete their mission. Our goal is a democratic Iraq that upholds the rule of law, respects the rights of its people, provides them security and is an ally in the war on terror. 
 In order to make progress toward this goal, the Iraqi government must stop the sectarian violence in its capital. But the Iraqis are not yet ready to do this on their own. So we are deploying reinforcements of more than 20,000 additional soldiers and marines to Iraq. The vast majority will go to Baghdad, where they will help Iraqi forces to clear and secure neighborhoods, and serve as advisers embedded in Iraqi Army units. With Iraqis in the lead, our forces will help secure the city by chasing down the terrorists, insurgents, and the roaming death squads. And in Anbar Province, where Al Qaeda terrorists have gathered and local forces have begun showing a willingness to fight them, we're sending an additional 4,000 United States marines, with orders to find the terrorists and clear them out. We didn't drive Al Qaeda out of their safe haven in Afghanistan only to let them set up a new safe haven in a free Iraq.
 The people of Iraq want to live in peace, and now it's time for their government to act. Iraq's leaders know that our commitment is not open ended. They have promised to deploy more of their own troops to secure Baghdad, and they must do so. They've pledged that they will confront violent radicals of any faction or political party. And they need to follow through, and lift needless restrictions on Iraqi and Coalition forces, so these troops can achieve their mission of bringing security to all of the people of Baghdad. Iraq's leaders have committed themselves to a series of benchmarks to achieve reconciliation: to share oil revenues among all of Iraq's citizens, to put the wealth of Iraq into the rebuilding of Iraq, to allow more Iraqis to re-enter their nation's civic life, to hold local elections and to take responsibility for security in every Iraqi province. But for all of this to happen, Baghdad must be secured. And our plan will help the Iraqi government take back its capital and make good on its commitments.
 My fellow citizens, our military commanders and I have carefully weighed the options. We discussed every possible approach. In the end, I chose this course of action because it provides the best chance for success. Many in this chamber understand that America must not fail in Iraq, because you understand that the consequences of failure would be grievous and far reaching. 
 If American forces step back before Baghdad is secure, the Iraqi government would be overrun by extremists on all sides. We could expect an epic battle between Shia extremists backed by Iran, and Sunni extremists aided by Al Qaeda and supporters of the old regime. A contagion of violence could spill out across the country, and in time the entire region could be drawn into the conflict.
 For America, this is a nightmare scenario. For the enemy, this is the objective. Chaos is their greatest ally in this struggle. And out of chaos in Iraq would emerge an emboldened enemy with new safe havens, new recruits, new resources and an even greater determination to harm America. To allow this to happen would be to ignore the lessons of Sept. 11 and invite tragedy. Ladies and gentlemen, nothing is more important at this moment in our history than for America to succeed in the Middle East, to succeed in Iraq and to spare the American people from this danger. 
 This is where matters stand tonight, in the here and now. I've spoken with many of you in person. I respect you and the arguments you've made. We went into this largely united in our assumptions and in our convictions. And whatever you voted for, you did not vote for failure. Our country is pursuing a new strategy in Iraq, and I ask you to give it a chance to work. And I ask you to support our troops in the field and those on their way. 
 The war on terror we fight today is a generational struggle that will continue long after you and I have turned our duties over to others. And that's why it's important to work together so our nation can see this great effort through. Both parties and both branches should work in close consultation. That's why I propose to establish a special advisory council on the war on terror, made up of leaders in Congress from both political parties. We will share ideas for how to position America to meet every challenge that confronts us. We'll show our enemies abroad that we're united in the goal of victory.
 One of the first steps we can take together is to add to the ranks of our military so that the American armed forces are ready for all the challenges ahead. Tonight I ask the Congress to authorize an increase in the size of our active Army and Marine Corps by 92,000 in the next five years. A second task we can take on together is to design and establish a volunteer Civilian Reserve Corps. Such a corps would function much like our military reserve. It would ease the burden on the armed forces by allowing us to hire civilians with critical skills to serve on missions abroad when America needs them. 
 This is a decent and honorable country, and resilient too. We've been through a lot together. We've met challenges and faced dangers, and we know that more lie ahead. Yet we can go forward with confidence, because the state of our union is strong, our cause in the world is right, and tonight that cause goes on.

HEADLINE: Big Bank Stops Effort to Change Law Limiting Growth

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Bank of America's chairman and chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis, said yesterday that the company was backing away from a quiet lobbying effort to change a federal law that could prevent it from making major acquisitions.
 Just weeks after agreeing to initiate discussions with lawmakers to raise the possibility of lifting the 10 percent federal deposit cap, Kenneth D. Lewis said that he had told bank representatives to ''back off'' from those plans.
 ''I thought we had gotten out there a little too far in terms of our level of aggressiveness, and it sent the wrong signals,'' Mr. Lewis said in an interview yesterday. About two weeks ago, he made the decision to halt the political effort, he said. 
 Bank of America, which has about $693.5 billion, or just over 9 percent of the nation's deposits, had argued in a position paper that the law restricting a bank to no more than 10 percent of the nation's deposits is ''antiquated, conceptually flawed'' and anticompetitive. 
 While American banks are prevented from increasing their deposit base through acquisitions that might push them over the federal threshold, foreign banks face no similar restrictions. The bank also argues that the law is unnecessary because of antitrust laws, state regulations and market forces.
 But as the only bank near the 10 percent limit, Bank of America has found itself with virtually no allies. JPMorgan Chase, the next largest deposit holder, could acquire all but the five biggest banks and still remain under the federal cap. Wachovia, Wells Fargo and Citigroup, the next banks in line, have potentially even more room and time.
 Smaller community banks, meanwhile, have vowed to fight any move to lift the cap.
 A Wells Fargo spokesman said the bank also opposed lifting the cap, preferring to stick to its internal growth strategy that does not come close to hitting the limit. JPMorgan declined to comment, while Wachovia and Citigroup said they had no position on the subject. 
 On Capitol Hill, the proposed change has met with a lukewarm reception. Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the House Financial Services Committee, has suggested that lifting the cap may be part of some sort of ''grand compromise'' between Wall Street and Main Street interests. There does not appear to be much enthusiasm, but other lawmakers have not dismissed the idea out of hand.
 Bank of America's backpedaling is either the recognition of a rare misstep or a shrewd calculation for Mr. Lewis, who is known for his deliberate approach to corporate strategy.
 On the one hand, reports of the plans were a reminder of the bank's bigger ambitions, leading to speculation that it was setting the stage to engage in a major deal. On the other, it may be a way of taking the temperature of a new Democratic-controlled Congress while planting the idea in people's minds. Typically, it takes years to pass legislation to repeal banking laws like those governing interstate banking.
 ''They are testing the waters and seeing what is out there,'' said Brian Gardner, a policy analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. With several Democratic lawmakers representing areas like New York that have strong banking ties, the perception that Democrats are less open to the idea of raising the cap may be wrong, he said. ''It makes a lot of sense to probe and see how far the Democrats are willing to go.''
 Bank of America's plans may also underscore the challenge it faces in sustaining its robust growth.
 Yesterday, Bank of America said fourth-quarter earnings rose 47 percent. 
 Much of that growth, however, was from the recognition of unusually large gains on its equity investments as well as new profits from the recently acquired MBNA.
 Many of the biggest costs have been flushed out. And without the investment gains, internal growth appears to have stopped or slowed.
 Over all, the bank earned $5.26 billion, or $1.16 a share, from a restated $3.57 billion, or 88 cents, in the quarter a year ago. Fourth-quarter profits for its global consumer and small- business operations rose 44 percent, to $2.53 billion, with the additional boost from MBNA. Its corporate and investment banking earnings rose 23 percent, to $1.57 billion, at a time when much bigger Wall Street investment bankers -- with more commodities and international exposure -- posted huge gains in the quarter. Profits at Bank of America's wealth management and investment businesses declined 1 percent.
 The American economy, meanwhile, may be slowing. A downturn in the credit cycle is on the horizon if not already here.
 ''You know the headwinds will mute earnings growth; you also know that our businesses will perform quite well,'' said Joe Price, Bank of America's chief financial officer, in his first conference call with analysts and investors since succeeding Alvaro de Molina at the start of this year. ''The biggest question for us is the health of the American economy, and we think we are in pretty good shape.''
 Some Wall Street analysts suggest Bank of America is at a strategic crossroads, balancing internal growth with bigger ambitions. One path that is unlikely to be taken, at least for now, is a major acquisition.
 The federal deposit cap severely limits Bank of America's ability to buy a big bank in the United States. And on the conference call, Mr. Lewis seemed to rule out making a major European deal. 
 ''I think a European acquisition will cause us to pause; that's not what we are thinking about,'' Mr. Lewis said.

HEADLINE: Murder Victims Moved to Long Island for Safety of Suburbs

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON and NICOLE COTRONEO; Ann Farmer contributed reporting.

DATELINE: SYOSSET, N.Y., Jan. 24 

 BODY:
In the 18 years since Jaspal and Geeta Singh arrived in New York from India, they prospered, had two sons and managed to join the wave of South Asians leaving behind New York City's immigrant neighborhoods for more comfortable swaths of central Nassau County. 
 After moving from Staten Island to Queens, where their sons attended grammar school, the family moved last year to this upscale Long Island suburb, for its safety and its schools, friends said.
But when the two boys, now in middle school, returned home on Tuesday afternoon, they found their parents slain, their father on the ground floor and their mother in a second-floor bedroom.
 The news shocked family and friends, who called the couple loving and peaceful and without any known enemies.
 Nassau County police officials said on Wednesday that the couple apparently died of gunshot wounds and that their deaths did not seem to be a murder-suicide. The police provided no other details. 
 Detective Lt. Kevin Smith, a spokesman for the county police, called the deaths ''two homicides,'' but did not give any motive or mention any leads or suspects, nor say whether there were signs of forced entry. He said there had been no reports of domestic quarrels at the home. 
 Mr. Singh, 46, and his wife, 38, bought the two-story house on Doone Drive, in a maze of sleepy streets just south of the Long Island Expressway, close enough to the Little India section of Hicksville, on South Broadway, but away from its bustle. Yesterday, the block was flooded with homicide detectives, crime scene vans and a mobile command center. An officer from the canine squad led a German shepherd through the yards and around a drainage ditch and nearby sewers.
 A letter carrier, David Abbey, estimated that he delivered mail to the house around noon on Tuesday and did not notice anything suspicious
 That afternoon, the Singhs' sons, Josh, 13, and Ankur, 12, returned home from the Harry B. Thompson Middle School and rang their doorbell. When their mother did not answer, as she normally did, they entered with a key and found their parents dead. Ankur ran across the street and asked a neighbor to call the police.
 Neighbors said that Mrs. Singh took care of the boys full time and that Mr. Singh managed a furniture store in Lower Manhattan and was the co-owner of a gas station on Long Island.
 Ofira Bronfeld, who owns Economy Foam and Futons in Manhattan, said Mr. Singh was the store's manager. She called him ''a very, very fine man.''
 ''They were very devoted parents and they moved out to Long Island to be safer, but there's nowhere safe anymore,'' she said. ''May God help those children. The pain for them is just unbearable.''

HEADLINE: Incomes and Inequality: What the Numbers Don't Tell Us

BYLINE: By TYLER COWEN. 
Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University and co-author of a blog at www.marginalrevolution.com.

 BODY:
The growing inequality in wealth and income has led many people to question whether the contemporary American economy is rigged in favor of the rich. While there is little doubt that the gap between the wealthy and everybody else has widened in recent years, the situation is not as unfair as some of the numbers seem to imply. 
 Much of the measured growth in income inequality has resulted from natural demographic trends. In general, there is more income inequality among older populations than among younger populations, if only because older people have had more time to experience rising or falling fortunes. 
 Furthermore, more-educated groups show greater income inequality than less-educated groups. Uneducated people are more likely to be clustered in a tight range of relatively low incomes. But the educated will include a greater range of highly motivated breadwinners and relaxed bohemians, and a greater range of winning and losing investors. A result is a greater variety of incomes. Since the United States is growing older and also more educated, income inequality will naturally rise. 
 Thomas Lemieux, professor of economics at the University of British Columbia, estimates that these demographic effects account for about three-quarters of the observed rise in income inequality for men and 69 to 95 percent of the observed rise in income inequality for women (''Increasing Residual Wage Inequality: Composition Effects, Noisy Data, or Rising Demand for Skill?'' The American Economic Review, June 2006). In other words, rising income inequality is not just a result of unfairness or bad public policy.
 Alan Reynolds, senior fellow at the Cato Institute, goes further in his recent book ''Income and Wealth.'' Mr. Reynolds argues that many measures of income inequality do not adequately account for government aid to lower-income groups. Furthermore, he says, the rich appear to be getting so much richer because of the tax-induced shifting of income from the corporate sector to the personal sector in the wake of the 1980s tax changes. 
 He describes the observed rise in income inequality as a statistical illusion. The consensus of professional economists is that Mr. Reynolds goes too far. The long-term trend of rising income inequality is evident in many different studies, including those of executive compensation, even if some estimates are exaggerated. 
 In any case, as Mr. Reynolds and others point out, income is not the only -- or even the most -- important measure of inequality. For instance, inequality of consumption -- the difference between what the poor consume and what the rich consume -- does not show a significant upward trend (Dirk Krueger and Fabrizio Perri, ''Does Income Inequality Lead to Consumption Inequality?'' The Review of Economic Studies, January 2006). Consumption, of course, is not an ideal indicator of well-being; a high or steady level of purchases may reflect growing debt, and the ease of buying a big-screen TV does not reflect a comparable ease in buying good health care.
 Happiness, possibly the most relevant variable for a study of inequality, is also the hardest to measure. Nonetheless, inequality of happiness is usually less marked than inequality of income, at least in wealthy societies. A man earning $500,000 a year is not usually 10 times as happy as a man earning $50,000 a year. The $50,000 earner still enjoys most of the conveniences of the modern world. Even if more money makes people happier, it appears to do so at a declining rate, which places a natural check on the inequality of happiness. 
 Studies of personal happiness, based on questionnaires and self-reporting, indicate that the inequality of happiness is not growing over time in the United States. Furthermore, the United States has an inequality of happiness roughly comparable to that of Sweden or Denmark, two nations with strongly egalitarian reputations. (See the symposium in Journal of Happiness Studies, December 2005.) American society offers good opportunities for people to be happy, even if not everyone becomes rich.
 If we look at leisure, from 1965 to 2003, less-educated groups experienced a bigger boost in free time than more-educated groups (Mark Aguiar and Erik Hurst, ''Measuring Trends in Leisure: The Allocation of Time Over Five Decades,'' Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Working Paper). In other words, the high earners are working hard for their money and perhaps they are having less fun. 
 So matters are not as bad as the critics have suggested. The dollars in our bank accounts are one measure of societal value, and it hardly seems fair that the very wealthy should receive more and more. But for the rest of us, life on the ground is not so terrible. Income and wealth inequality measures, taken alone, provide a misleadingly pessimistic picture. 
 The broader philosophical question is why we should worry about inequality -- of any kind -- much at all. Life is not a race against fellow human beings, and we should discourage people from treating it as such. Many of the rich have made the mistake of viewing their lives as a game of relative status. So why should economists promote this same zero-sum worldview? Yes, there are corporate scandals, but it remains the case that most American wealth today is produced rather than taken from other people. 
 What matters most is how well people are doing in absolute terms. We should continue to improve opportunities for lower-income people, but inequality as a major and chronic American problem has been overstated.

HEADLINE: Study Says Many Firms Cheat New York Workers' Comp System

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
A new study estimates that employers cheat New York State's workers' compensation system by not paying $500 million to $1 billion a year in required insurance premiums, forcing other employers to pay higher premiums.
 The study by the Fiscal Policy Institute, a liberal research group, found that these illegal underpayments represent 15 percent to 20 percent of all the workers' comp premiums that are supposed to be paid each year statewide.
Some companies pay no premiums while others underpay by underreporting the size of their work force to qualify for lower premiums, the study said. 
 Government, business and labor leaders say the noncompliance hurts the state's business climate by forcing law-abiding companies to pay higher workers' comp premiums when many corporations are already complaining that their premiums are too high. 
 ''We were surprised to find this magnitude of noncompliance,'' said James Parrott, the chief economist for the Fiscal Policy Institute. ''This noncompliance has helped cause at least two things: very low benefits for injured workers in New York, which are among the lowest in the country, and second, despite these low benefits, workers' comp premiums that are considered very high.''
 Mr. Parrott said inadequate data made it hard to pinpoint the exact amount of cheating.
 The report asserts that if more companies paid their full premiums, the extra money would enable the state to cut workers' comp premiums over all and increase benefits for injured workers. The report maintains that a lack of enforcement has emboldened employers to cheat. 
 ''Not being honest on payroll has become almost an accepted practice in New York State,'' said Art Wilcox, a workers' comp expert with the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''It hurts the competitiveness of a business that does the right thing. It hurts the competitiveness of an insurance broker who refuses to play games with payroll. And it certainly hurts any insurance carrier who won't bend the rules because they're competing against people who will.''
 Michael Moran, a spokesman for the American Insurance Association, said he found it difficult to believe the level of noncompliance found by the study. ''It is very important for insurance companies to be paid correctly for all the people they cover,'' he said. ''They work at it very hard. They try to audit to make sure that things are right.''
 The Fiscal Policy Institute based its calculations on financial numbers filed with state agencies. It bolsters the finding of a report last year by the state's association of insurance agents, which estimated, based on inside knowledge of industry practices, that up to 20 percent of New York's employers did not pay all their required premiums.
 ''New York's honest businesses who are playing by the rules have had to subsidize those who don't even cover their employees or those who seriously underpay for the coverage they do have,'' said David Dickson, president of the association, Professional Insurance Agents of New York State. ''It approaches plain fraud.''
 Gov. Eliot Spitzer has pledged to make major changes in the workers' comp system, hoping to hold down premiums and increase benefits. The maximum benefit an injured worker can now obtain is $400 a week.
 ''Although we do not know the magnitude of the underreporting of workers' comp obligations, we recognize that it is a serious problem,'' said Christine Anderson, a spokeswoman for the governor. 
 Insurance experts say that a company with, say, 100 employees might tell its insurer that it has only 70 workers and then pay premiums for only 70. 
 But if any of the company's 100 employees are injured on the job, they would be likely to qualify for worker's comp benefits -- either medical coverage and weekly benefits in lieu of wages -- when they are out of work. This means that the amount collected in premiums might fall short of the amount spent on benefits. As a result of such a shortfall statewide, insurers often pressure New York officials to increase premiums for all employers in an effort to balance total premiums paid in with total benefits paid out.
 ''The lack of aggressive enforcement forces everybody in the process to bend the rules,'' said Mr. Wilcox of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''If insurance company A enforces the law but all the rest don't, then the client will end up with insurance company B or C or D.''
 In finding underpayments, the Fiscal Policy Institute first looked at the total amount of employee payroll -- $389 billion -- that the state's employers reported for 2003 to the Labor Department and Tax Department when they paid their unemployment insurance taxes. Then the institute examined the total payroll reported to the state agencies and the industry association that handle payroll data for employers paying workers' comp insurance. The total payroll reported for workers' comp came to just $311 billion (after the policy institute made some adjustments to account for excluded job categories.)
 ''Manufacturers are paying significant amount of workers' comp, and they obviously pay more than they need to because it looks like a large percentage of companies aren't paying into the system,'' said Randall Wolken, president of the Manufacturers Association of Central New York. ''If we're inadvertently increasing some companies' costs, we inadvertently drive some companies out of the state.'' 
 Last July, the state's insurance superintendent, Howard Mills, denied a request by insurers to increase workers' comp premiums, saying, ''The insurers' efforts to fight fraud -- both claimant and employer fraud -- can be said to be anemic at best.''
 At the time, Mr. Mills, who stepped down last month, said that without a greater commitment by insurers to fight fraud, it would be hard to justify any overall increase in premiums.
 One common practice, insurance experts say, is for companies, often taxi or trucking companies, to say that their drivers are independent contractors (who are not required to be part of the workers' comp system) when by many definitions they are actual employees.
 As part of the campaign against fraud, Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau and the State Insurance Fund, a state agency that provides workers' comp coverage to 194,000 employers, arrested Anthony Spychalsky last month and charged his company, NY Ceiling & Drywall, with underpaying premiums by at least $207,000. Mr. Spychalsky pleaded guilty on Jan. 8 to insurance fraud.
 Many industry experts say the State Insurance Fund, which focuses on providing coverage to small business, is more aggressive in pursuing premium fraud than private insurance carriers.
 Robert Lawson, the insurance fund's spokesman, said that in 2006, the fund's 200 auditors did 88,398 field audits. All the audits yielded an additional $89 million in revenues, coming to $493,000 per auditor, Mr. Lawson said.
 Mr. Dickson, the head of the insurance agents' group, said, ''The level of audits that are conducted by the commercial carriers and the frequency of the audits, I don't see that at the same standard as the State Insurance Fund's efforts.''
 Kenneth Adams, president of the Business Council of New York State, said, ''Whatever can be put in place to limit and reduce fraud by employers or injured workers, that will produce benefits throughout the system.''

HEADLINE: Bloomberg And Council Change Arts Financing 

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
Declaring that they had wearied of their annual dance over arts financing, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the City Council announced yesterday that they would make more money available to arts groups, award it on a merit basis and widen a peer-review process to level the playing field.
 Beginning in the 2008 fiscal year, arts groups on land not owned by the city will compete for $30 million in financing from the Department of Cultural Affairs, city officials said at a news conference. This year arts groups competed for a pool of just $3.8 million from the department, with an additional $20 million distributed through other budget channels. 
The hope is that arts groups will find it less necessary to appeal to their council representatives for small amounts of financing, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said at the news conference, in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn. ''What we're trying to do is make this a fair process, make it merit-based,'' he said, adding that the decision would affect some 1,000 cultural groups. 
 In addition, the 34 arts organizations in city-owned buildings, known jointly as the Cultural Institutions Group, will be allotted $115.3 million in the next fiscal year, and an additional $4.4 million for ''new needs.'' (That group includes heavyweights like the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Carnegie Hall, and smaller organizations like the Staten Island Historical Society.)
 For the current fiscal year, those groups received $102 million, and an additional $22 million that was negotiated into the budget by the City Council as so-called member items. 
 Now that the baseline figure has increased to $119.7 million, the member items -- added in this year's budget negotiations, in which the mayor made cuts and the City Council put the funds back -- are expected to be far less common, Mayor Bloomberg said.
 ''There will no longer be any cut and restoration dance,'' he said. 
 ''They can stop all the lobbying,'' he added, ''and get back to what they're supposed to be doing.'' 
 In the past some arts organizations not in the Cultural Institutions Group received fixed allocations in the city budget, known as line items, and lobbied City Council members for the discretionary or member items. The Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, said it was important to end political jockeying by cultural groups for council crumbs. 
 ''I am excited about no longer seeing all of those institutions on the steps of City Hall,'' she said.
 Nancy Umanoff, executive director of the Mark Morris Dance Group, said: ''I think it's wonderful that they're depoliticizing the process. It means that arts administrators can go back to running their institutions and not have to lobby politicians.''
 Arts organizations outside the Cultural Institutions Group are expected to compete for the $30 million between March and June of this year, Mr. Bloomberg said. Peer panels will evaluate the applications on a range of criteria, from education programs to management and financial stability. 
 ''What this does is tell groups, 'You're going to move forward, or we're going to take away funding and give it to groups that are moving up,' '' said Dominic M. Recchia Jr., chairman of the City Council's Cultural Affairs Committee. ''It's a sign that you have to produce.''
 Organizations with large building programs will receive multiyear appropriations, the mayor said; smaller groups will have to apply on an annual basis. ''They'll have to keep proving themselves,'' he said, adding, ''It will give the city new ways to discover and reward excellence in our cultural institutions.'' 
 Members of the Cultural Institutions Group will be reviewed under a new program called CultureStat, modeled after the police department's performance-monitoring process. 
 Kate D. Levin, the cultural affairs commissioner, said the new system was adopted in response to longstanding complaints from arts organizations that the financing process was indecipherable, unpredictable and unfair. 
 ''For years, they've been saying it doesn't make sense,'' she said in an interview.
 The agreement for the 2008 fiscal year, which starts on July 1, also establishes a base level of annual funding for the Parks Department ($14 million) and the Administration for Children's Services ($10 million).
 Mr. Bloomberg, known for his enthusiastic support for the arts, said yesterday that culture produced more than $5 billion in economic benefits to the city every year.
 Of course, this revamping of the cultural budget process does not preclude sparring between the mayor and the City Council in other areas. 
 ''There will always be an Irish jig left, as long as I'm on the other side of the building,'' said Ms. Quinn, the Council speaker.

HEADLINE: Barons Before Bedtime

BYLINE: By PENELOPE GREEN

 BODY:
ONE of Bradley Ziegler's favorite days is the day after Christmas, when the bargain bins at Toys ''R'' Us and Wal-Mart are filled with marked-down DVDs and GameCube games. As he has done for the past two years, Bradley will pick up an armful of $3.99 games and movies and then auction them for up to 10 times that on eBay to regular customers from Kentucky to Cyprus. 
 His computer is off by 9:30 each night (a house rule), but he likes the fact that he can make $50 or more before breakfast the next morning. Because on eBay, nobody knows you're 15 (or cares if you're asleep).
They call him Donald at the post office in his town in Bergen County, N.J., which Bradley thinks is pretty cool, though his mother, Susan Boyd, a first-grade teacher, would like her son to have a more philanthropic entrepreneurial hero. 
 While she is proud of him for intuitively discovering ''what others have to take courses to learn,'' she said, ''I wish the post office lady called him Mr. Gates instead of Donald.''
 For some time now, teenagers have been looking to entrepreneurs as pop icons -- whether Gates or Trump -- as much as they have to rock stars and athletes. Having your own business has become very cool; having your own business before your 20th birthday indescribably so. 
 Sniffing a ripe market, book publishers and self-help authors are making Tony Robbins-style wealth and investment guides for under-age readers. Books like ''The Motley Fool Investment Guide for Teens: Eight Steps to Having More Money Than Your Parents Ever Dreamed Of'' and ''Rich Dad, Poor Dad for Teens: The Secrets About Money That You Don't Learn in School'' put a capitalist spin on the old boomer mantra: never trust anyone over 30. 
 Since the rise and fall and rise again of the new economy, the face of the American dream has gotten younger, richer -- and more homebound. With the news full of 20-somethings who are making millions of dollars with ideas hatched on their laptops and in their dorm rooms (as the founders of YouTube, MySpace and Facebook have done), more and more teenagers are hoping to become the C.E.O.'s of their own companies, without ever leaving their bedrooms.
 ''These kids want to make money,'' said Atoosa Rubenstein, 35, the former editor in chief of CosmoGirl, which she founded when she was 26, and Seventeen magazine. ''They are being marketed to all the time, and they get what marketing is all about. Now it's social currency to have your own business. It used to be your wardrobe or your sport. Now your own business makes a statement about you and your interests. It almost breaks down into cliques: the future C.E.O. types, the fashionistas making T-shirts, the Webby guys tutoring adults on the computer or selling games on eBay.'' 
 Peter Liebenson, a 17-year-old senior at the Dalton School in Manhattan, said he hopes the name of his business, Pete's Caramels, will one day be as famous as, say, Famous Amos. But what is also true is that Peter's enterprise -- homemade caramels sold online (petescaramels.com) -- is appealing to him largely because it's a solo enterprise. ''I suppose in a general way I like to do my own thing,'' he said. ''Instead of football, I play boccie. Instead of the piano, I play the theremin.'' He said Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com, was an inspiring figure. ''Amazon's marketing is interesting to me,'' he explained. 
 His mother, Stacey Selden, is a New York City judge, and his father, Jeff Liebenson, is an entertainment lawyer. They are of an age and culture to remember when musicians like Robert Plant (or even Kurt Cobain) were the heroes of teenage boys. And they bemusedly admire Peter's company, which he started last summer. ''How did he know how?'' his mother wondered.
 ''I thought maybe he'd do an internship,'' Mr. Liebenson said, ''but Peter had this very clear idea.'' He took a two-day course in Web design at the School of Visual Arts, where he learned all sorts of nifty things (like how to make a photo of a caramel wiggle on a Web page), sent a batch of caramels to his favorite candy blog, candyaddict.com, garnering a glowing testimonial (''I predict sweet success for you!'') as well as a link to his site -- and a business was born. 
 With an ear for buzz phrases like ''no trans fats,'' Peter promises customers a product that is both healthy and delicious. Delivery may take up to a month (homework and college applications come first), but you can request samples for $1 and pay online through PayPal. If you send Peter a testimonial, he will refund your dollar. 
 With an Internet storefront, reviews on blogs and testimonials from customers, Peter has more orders than he can keep up with (from 22 states and as far away as the Netherlands, he said). Expenses are low (he pays $4 a month for Web hosting and his advertising came free). He estimates a total profit to date of about $45, after allowing for operating costs (a domain name, postage, packaging) and supplies (a candy thermometer, butter, cream, sugar and mixing spoons), a figure that took some time to arrive at (he sifted through receipts the other night), suggesting that Peter's impulses are more creative than acquisitive.
 Not all teenage entrepreneurs are so process-oriented. For many, the profit is the turn-on. Even parents can be tickled, if slightly abashed, by their child's moneymaking skills. One Palm Beach mother of a student at a New England boarding school reported buying cases of Red Bull at a Costco one parents' weekend, which her son sold for triple the cost to his dorm mates. ''They like to ski on the stuff,'' she said, begging anonymity. ''I also sent him 20 or so used movies which he rents from his room.'' 
 Boarding schools, of course, are fertile environments for under-age business types; the market is quite literally captive and therefore hungry for all manner of goods. In decades past you could spot the future captains of industry by their triple beam scales and twitching fingers. Now the drug dealers have been trumped by more legal monopolists. Two years ago Matt Swift was a junior at the Salisbury School for boys in Salisbury, Conn. He wasn't that athletic, he said, and had a lot of free time. He had always been entrepreneurial, selling water to his ski teammates on their Friday bus trips in grade school and looking up to his ''life mentor,'' Sheridan Snyder, a biotech entrepreneur (and his mother's partner).
 Mr. Swift, now a freshman at Georgetown University, described his business plan: ''We were in the middle of nowhere and the food was terrible and we thought, what's the best market for a boys' school?'' 
 Food and dates were the obvious answers, and food was the most viable option, he said. With the blessing of the headmaster, Chisholm S. Chandler, he and two friends, Nick Logothetis and Mike Katzenberg, created a snack shop in a basement classroom. Their initial investment was $5,000 each (these are fortunate boys), and they paid a teacher $50 every Saturday to drive them to a Costco and a Sam's Club for supplies. 
 Open for only 45 minutes after study hall each night, the place was an instant hot spot; beef jerky was their best seller. By Christmas they had a profit of $30,000, and began to funnel all of it into charities: Katrina and tsunami relief, computers and tutoring for a retirement home nearby, taking advantage of matching grants given by the Ford Foundation.
 ''We got a lot of flack in the beginning from teachers, so the charitable component was key,'' Mr. Swift said. ''Most people weren't comfortable with the idea of our profiting off our fellow students. Our grades did slip in the beginning, mine from A's to C's, but when Mr. Chandler told us we'd lose the shop, we brought them up again. It was a powerful incentive.'' 
 The next year the school offered the boys the restaurant concession in a new student center, and Sarum's Snacks, as it was called, stepped onto a broader, though no less successful, stage. Last year they sold their assets to the school, Mr. Swift said, and deputized two seniors to take their place. 
 The headmaster, Mr. Chandler, said the other day that there might have been ''some raised eyebrows that we were allowing kids into uncharted territory, but part of education is trying something new.'' He continued, ''If it failed, it would have been just as successful because they still would have learned something.''
 That the wealth-building gurus are reaching out to children may make some people squirm, but it is not surprising. ''Our culture is focused on doing well, on having more goods than anyone else,'' said Dr. Richard Gallagher, director of the Parenting Institute at the New York University Child Study Center. ''There is this dream of life that's being presented.'' 
 Idealistic and impressionable, teenagers, he suggests, are almost too easy a mark. Still, he went on to say, ''Giving kids some financial savvy can have some positive value,'' whether it comes from a book or a home-cooked business, if the parents stay in charge. ''You'd want to know how much money is being made,'' he said, ''and make decisions about what kind of freedom his 'luxury' money allows him to have.'' Money, of course, is another family value. 
 ''If you're all watching 'My Super Sweet 16,' that's one kind of value,'' he said, referring to MTV's ode to wretched teenage excess. ''But maybe you want to be talking about Bill Gates.''
 The most successful of the half-dozen or so money manuals out now is ''Rich Dad, Poor Dad for Teens,'' with 50,000 copies sold since its publication in 2004, according to Nielsen BookScan. (Though many young entrepreneurs seem more interested in listening to podcasts from Ad Age or flipping through Forbes magazine.) 
 ''Rich Dad, Poor Dad for Teens'' is a scion of the franchise created by Robert T. Kiyosaki and Sharon L. Lechter, whose first book, ''Rich Dad, Poor Dad,'' has been on the New York Times best-seller list for six years. That book tells a compelling and cult-creepy tale of financial success learned by Mr. Kiyosaki at the knees of Rich Dad, a neighbor, who encouraged him to play Monopoly instead of doing his homework while his biological father, a k a Poor Dad, wrung his hands. 
 The essential message is that higher education can saddle you with a lot of debt and that a salaried job is a losing situation, given the current state of corporate malfeasance and the cost of health care. The book is a manifesto for budding solo entrepreneurs of all ages. ''Money is a life skill,'' Mr. Kiyosaki said. ''It should be taught.'' 
 Responding to the lack of financial education in high schools and grade schools -- a personal bete noire of his -- Mr. Kiyosaki's company created a series of financial games called Cashflow. Players win when they get out of the rat race (salaried jobs) by amassing passive income (investments in real estate or the stock market). 
 Entire families -- so-called Rich Families -- now form game-playing and networking communities, getting together to play Cashflow on Friday nights. ''The game opens their eyes,'' said Amanda McCauley, whose two daughters, Kelsey, 13, and Karly, 11, are host to Cashflow games in Phoenix and deftly work ''credit card debt'' and ''rat race'' into conversations. ''They learn that money doesn't just come out of the A.T.M. machine.'' 
 The other day Kelsey described her continuing search for a site to deploy a gumball machine and accrue passive income. ''I baby-sit right now,'' she said, ''but I have to be there to actually earn the money.'' 
 Bradley, the eBay maven, has discovered his own source of passive income: books in his younger brother Justin's room. ''If I get into a selling mood,'' he said, ''I will look around the whole house for things to sell. All over my brother's room there are books that we have never read just lying around.''
 He has put Justin's ''Hardy Boys'' books on eBay three times, he said. And each time Justin goes online and takes them off.

HEADLINE: 30 Years After Opening, a Lab for Alternative Power Goes Begging

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: GOLDEN, Colo. 

 BODY:
Thirty years after it was founded by President Jimmy Carter, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory at the edge of the Rockies here still does not have a cafeteria. 
 Evaporation chambers for new solar energy systems look like they belong in an H. G. Wells movie. Technicians had to knock out a giant door from a testing facility to fit modern wind turbine blades, which now stick out like a bare toe from an old sock.
The hopes for this neglected lab brightened a bit just over a year ago when President Bush made the first presidential call on the lab since Mr. Carter and spelled out a vision for the not-too-distant future in which solar and wind power would help run every American home and cars would operate on biofuels made from residues of plants.
 But one year after the president's visit, the money flowing into the nation's primary laboratory for developing renewable fuels is actually less than it was at the beginning of the Bush administration. The lab's fitful history reflects a basic truth: Americans may have a growing love affair with renewables and the idea of cutting oil imports and conserving energy, but it is a fickle one. 
 Riding that wave, the new House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, just promised committee hearings on how lawmakers could help limit climate change and enhance energy independence; Congressional Democrats pledged to find more research dollars for clean energy. [And President Bush, in his State of the Union address, called for greater federal mandates to increase use of homegrown alternative fuels.] 
 But the intertwined goals of developing domestic energy resources and reducing global warming gases are not necessarily in step with each other. Despite a lot of promises, no one so far has wanted to pay the extra costs to make wind and solar more than a trivial energy source. Research is uncertain and expensive, and the benefits seem far away.
 So while all kinds of domestic energy technologies are being advanced in the name of energy independence, most of the money and attention are still focused on the dirty but cheaper standbys: offshore oil, oil sands and coal, in all its various incarnations, from straight out of the pit to black-coal liquid.
 ''You have fossil fuels competing with renewable fuels,'' said Benjamin Kroposki, a senior scientist at the Renewable Energy Laboratory. ''Renewables lose every time.''
 One example is the shotgun approach to tax incentives, loan guarantees and other spending in the 2005 energy act, the first major energy legislation enacted by Congress in a decade: $13.1 billion for oil, gas and coal, $12 billion for nuclear energy and $7.7 billion divided up among a wide assortment of renewables like ethanol, hydroelectric, wind and solar.
 Now that they are in control of Congress, Democrats have promised to increase the amount going to renewable energy sources, taking the money from tax breaks for oil companies.
 But even additional money for renewable energy will be going up against government tax policies that encourage more energy consumption. Companies can still deduct purchases of sport utility vehicles and utility bills, for example, while consumers get a break to build bigger homes with deductions for interest payments on mortgages, even on second homes, that far outweigh their energy saving credits.
 Meanwhile, fuel efficiency standards for automobiles have changed only slightly over the decades, and the federal government still does not have a building code to encourage energy efficiency.
 It is a policy mix that goes back many administrations and appears difficult to shake, partly because dirty sources of energy like coal and shale are what the United States has in abundance.
 ''We are going dirtier,'' said Amy Jaffe, an energy expert at the James A. Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University. ''If you need to come up with a fuel source other than drilling for oil under the ground in the Middle East, what is the most obvious thing with today's economy, today's infrastructure and today's technology? Oil shale, liquefied coal and tar sands. It's all dirty but it's fast.''
 Renewable energy today supplies only 6 percent of the country's energy needs, and much of that comes from decades-old dams supplying hydropower. Under current policies, the Energy Information Administration estimates, renewables will increase only slightly in importance in the decades ahead. They would supply 7 percent of United States energy supplies by 2030, while coal would increase over the same period from 23 percent to 26 percent.
 ''Denmark gets 22 percent of its electrical energy from wind today and we get 0.5 percent,'' noted Robert Thresher, director of the lab's National Wind Technology Center. ''That shows you what you can do when you really want to.''
 Meanwhile imports of oil and gas are set to continue to rise in the decades ahead, as domestic production slows and the population grows.
 ''The current trends do not seem sustainable,'' said Faith Birol, chief economist of the International Energy Agency. ''For me the most important thing that is missing from current consideration is an increase in vehicle fuel efficiency.''
 As they have in the past, higher prices for oil and gas have driven the renewed interest in alternative energy sources. With prices falling, some of that momentum may falter.
 Still, President Bush advanced his call last year to end the nation's oil addiction, providing some of the strongest rhetoric since President Carter called energy independence the moral equivalent of war. 
 [Mr. Bush set a goal of reducing gas use by 20 percent in the next 10 years. ''To reach this goal, we must increase the supply of alternative fuels, by setting a mandatory fuels standard to require 35 billion gallons of renewable and alternative fuels in 2017; this is nearly five times the current target,'' he said Tuesday night.
 [On Wednesday the administration sought to put some teeth into the goal by proposing $1.6 billion in new financing for renewable energy, with a focus on research and production of ''cellulosic'' energy from nonfood crops and agricultural waste.]
 The Democratic Congress appears ready to put clean energy front and center in its agenda.
 Prominent Democrats are talking about doubling the budget of the renewable energy lab, and otherwise greatly increase the priority of producing clean energy.
 ''You've got to invest in this new energy future that everybody pays lip service to, but when push comes to shove do we really stand there?'' said Representative Mark Udall of Colorado, a senior Democratic spokesman on energy issues. ''This is the country's economic future not to mention the national security ramifications.''
 Institutional investments in private clean energy companies in North America and Europe are rising quickly, from $500 million in 2004 to $1.3 billion in 2005 to $2.7 billion in 2006, according to Venture Business Research, an independent group based in Britain.
 But even while top energy companies are also beginning to invest significant amounts in wind, solar and plants, those investments pale in comparison with the resources they are pouring into making synthetic fuels out of oil sands, a process that emits significantly more carbon dioxide than conventional oil.
 Likewise energy companies are stepping up research and investments into oil sands, deep-ocean oil and gas drilling, and gasifying and liquefying coal -- all with significant environmental consequences.
 For instance, Royal Dutch Shell has invested $1 billion over the last five years in clean energy like biofuels for transportation, solar and wind for electrical generation and hydrogen. That is one of the biggest commitments to clean energy by any company, but it is less than one fifth of what Shell invested over roughly the same period with Chevron and another partner in a giant oil sand mining project in Canada.
 The companies say they can contain emissions through a process called carbon capture and sequestration. But most experts say development of technologies to bury significant amounts of carbon gases effectively could take decades.
 At the lab here, signs of change are mixed. Last year, the institution opened its first building in a decade, although meager budgets could leave its main laboratory as much as 80 percent vacant of equipment for the next several years unless Congress suddenly comes to the rescue. 
 Congressional earmarks that redirected Energy Department financing last year slowed or even shelved many research projects, including ones to develop bigger and more efficient wind turbines, to make hydrogen power out of a mix of algae and water, and to plant matter.
 Its scientists are also doing ground-breaking work on finding environmentally benign ways of generating electricity to produce hydrogen from water to power cars; they are working on new materials and designs to make devices powered by solar cells cheaper; and they are developing enzymes and more efficient machinery to convert switchgrass and corn stalks into biofuels to reduce oil consumption.
 When Chevron decided last year that it wanted to develop the next generation of ethanol and renewable plant-based diesel fuels from trees and agricultural waste, it turned to the lab here for a scientific partnership. Now Chevron and scientists from the federal laboratory are working to make hydrogen energy out of decomposed plants. DuPont, Cargill and the National Corn Growers Association look to the lab for help in producing ethanol.
 But it is hardly the kind of crash program that government labs have conducted in the past to build an atomic bomb or go to the moon. Rather, the lab gingerly hands over slices of its yearly budget of $200 million to a smorgasbord of programs in solar, wind, plant matter, geothermal, hydrogen and fuel cells, efficient buildings, advanced vehicles and fuels and electric infrastructure.
 ''Our budget is nothing compared to the price of a B2 bomber or an aircraft carrier,'' Rob Farrington, manager of the lab's advanced vehicle systems group, said.
 Articles in this series are examining the ways in which the world is, and is not, moving toward a more energy-efficient, environmentally benign future. Previous articles are at nytimes.com/energychallenge.

HEADLINE: Childhood Poverty Is Found To Portend High Adult Costs 

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
Children who grow up poor cost the economy $500 billion a year because they are less productive, earn less money, commit more crimes and have more health-related expenses, according to a study released on Wednesday.
 ''The high cost of childhood poverty to the U.S. suggests that investing significant resources in poverty reduction might be more cost effective than we thought,'' said Harry J. Holzer, an economist at Georgetown University and the Urban Institute and one of the four authors of the report.
Mr. Holzer was one of several poverty experts who testified Wednesday to the House Ways and Means Committee as the report was released. The new chairman of the panel, Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, said the experts were appearing ''not as bleeding hearts, but to calculate the costs of poverty to our economy and society.'' 
 ''We're talking about saving money and making productive people in the age of globalization,'' Mr. Rangel said in comments that seemed to reflect an awareness by Democratic lawmakers of the financial and political constraints they face. 
 The hearing was the first of many expected over the coming year intended to focus attention on the 37 million Americans who live below the official poverty line, defined as $19,350 a year for a family of four.
 For more than 10 years, lawmakers had mainly focused on sweeping welfare changes passed in 1996 that imposed time limits and strict work requirements on welfare recipients. In the process, Democratic staff members in the House and Senate said this week, other crucial poverty-related topics were neglected. 
 Apart from an increase in the minimum wage, which the House passed on Jan. 10 but was blocked on Wednesday in the Senate by Republicans insisting on concessions for small businesses, the Democrats have not put together a broad list of initiatives to combat poverty, staff members said, and they will spend time evaluating research and cost-effective tactics. 
 The report on the price of child poverty was commissioned by the Center for American Progress, a liberal group here that plans to issue detailed antipoverty recommendations in the spring. 
 A Republican scholar and former official who testified at the hearing, Ron Haskins, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, called the study superb and said that while economists might quibble over details, the $500 billion cost estimate costs ''might be in the ballpark.'' 
 Mr. Haskins noted that the authors had not specified the high cost of eliminating child poverty, which census figures show affected 12.3 million children in 2005, or 17.1 percent of those younger than 18. 
 ''Do not think that if we suddenly gave a bunch of money to poor people, everything would change,'' he told lawmakers, adding that behaviors, neighborhoods and parents' actions need to change if children's life paths are to change. 
 Mr. Haskins said it was important to continue work requirements for most welfare recipients, along with government support for programs like child care and tax credits. Promoting the economic benefits of marriage is also important, he said, because a disproportionate number of single-parent families are poor. 
 In the only flare of partisan discord, some Democratic lawmakers questioned the effectiveness of promoting marriage, a favorite initiative of the Bush administration. But Democrats voiced no inclination to reverse the transformation of the welfare system into more of a work program. 
 Mr. Holzer and others said that although various proposals to ease poverty needed more research, some efforts, especially the earned-income tax credit, which benefits low-income workers, and quality prekindergarten education had been shown to justify their cost and deserved to expand. 
 Poor schooling, lack of employment and the high arrest rate among poor young men, especially black men, have emerged as major concerns of liberal and conservative experts alike. 
 David R. Jones, president of the Community Service Society of New York, testified that 16 percent of people in New York City ages 16 to 24 were neither in school nor employed and that nearly 40 percent of all black men in the city were jobless, defined as unable to find work, unable to perform manual labor because of health problems, not looking for work or in prison. 
 Mr. Jones joined the growing chorus of experts who call for extending the earned-income tax credit, which supplements the low wages of poor working parents, to single men and women. 
 Social research and neuroscience have shown the importance of early childhood development on later functioning, Jane Knitzer, director of the National Center for Children in Poverty at Columbia University, told the panel. Yet the Early Head Start program serves just 62,000 infants and children, Ms. Knitzer said. 
 In the coming year, lawmakers are expected to focus on refining and continuing some existing programs for poor children, including Head Start, food stamps and a health-insurance plan known as S-Chip.

HEADLINE: Donors Gather to Help Lebanon's Government

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER; Ariane Bernard contributed reporting.

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
After 50 days of Syrian- and Iranian-backed protests that culminated in Tuesday's daylong standoff in Beirut, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and officials from more than 30 other countries are gathering here to see if they can inject enough money into the Lebanese government to prop up the pro-Western prime minister, Fouad Siniora.
 Ms. Rice, demonstrating the level of concern about the deteriorating situation, said Wednesday that the United States would provide close to $1 billion in aid. 
In many ways, the donor conference here on Thursday will serve as a snapshot of the larger proxy war between the United States -- joined by its Sunni Arab allies and Europe -- and Iran and Syria. Lebanon, like Iraq, is a battleground in that war, and Mr. Siniora, a Sunni Muslim, is fighting for his political survival.
 The Paris conference is considered central to the survival of his government. Lebanon is badly hobbled after the monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah last summer, with Hezbollah trying to use the war to strengthen its political role, and reconstruction efforts have been burdened by the country's $41 billion in public debt. 
 On Tuesday, opposition groups bent on toppling Mr. Siniora's cabinet essentially shut down the country with protests in Beirut.
 The protests, initiated by Hezbollah to press its claims, were the latest trial for Mr. Siniora, whose government has survived thus far, Lebanon analysts say, not just because about half of the country supports him, but also because he has strong international support, including from Europe, America and the Sunni Arab countries.
 ''Very clearly, Syria and Iran don't want to see this work,'' said David Schenker, a senior fellow in Arab politics at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, referring to the donor conference. ''If the Siniora administration walks away from Paris with sufficient funds, it will return to Lebanon vindicated and strengthened, proving that it can effectively govern and pursue key initiatives without Hezbollah.''
 Some Middle East experts say that Lebanon needs at least $5 billion in aid to cover reconstruction and debt payments. But even if Mr. Siniora were able to raise that much, he would face political problems back at home.
 His government has been under siege for two months now, as he has fought to establish a tribunal that may implicate Syria in the killing of a former Lebanese prime minister, Rafik Hariri, an outspoken critic of Syria.
 Syria occupied Lebanon for 30 years until being forced to withdraw its troops after the assassination. The United States has accused Syria and Iran of trying to bring down the Siniora government to wreck plans for an international tribunal to try suspects in Mr. Hariri's killing.
 The Paris conference is supposed to focus on ways to stimulate the Lebanese economy, improve living conditions for the people and lower the country's debt over five years. 
 Just how much money it will take to prop up Mr. Siniora is in question. On Wednesday, the European Commission was the first to announce that it would pledge 400 million euros, or $519 million, at the conference, bringing to 500 million euros, or $649 million, its overall reconstruction money for Lebanon over the next five years. President Jacques Chirac of France, who met with Mr. Siniora in Paris on Wednesday, followed with a pledge of a 500-million-euro loan to Lebanon, which a spokesman for Mr. Chirac said would be extended on ''highly preferential terms.''
 Ms. Rice told reporters aboard her flight that the United States, whose contribution will be watched closely, would provide an additional $770 million in grants, including $220 million for the Lebanese armed forces and additional money for the police and peacekeeping. The grants also will include $250 million in cash transfers directly to the government, which will be tied to certain benchmarks that the Siniora government would be required to meet through economic reform programs. A donor conference for Lebanon that was held in Stockholm last year after the Israel-Hezbollah war brought in $940 million in aid, including about $230 million from the United States.
 ''You will find that the United States will be very supportive of Lebanon at this conference,'' C. David Welch, assistant secretary of state for Near East affairs, told reporters in Paris. ''Of course, you all know the importance of our political voice; now we are going to put some money behind that.''
 How much Saudi Arabia and other Sunni Arab countries come up with will also be of interest, analysts say. Saudi Arabia and Qatar, in particular, have been giving money in hopes of influencing Lebanon, as a counterweight to Iran and Syria, which have long given huge amounts to Hezbollah and other Lebanese groups, particularly in the south, where support for Hezbollah is the strongest.
 On Tuesday, Mr. Chirac tried to play down the impression that donors at the conference were trying to impose their will on the Lebanese people by propping up Mr. Siniora. ''I have no preferences among the Lebanese people,'' Mr. Chirac said. ''I respect all the Lebanese people, but I advise them to obey the general rules of democracy, that is, to wait for normal elections to take place, in order, if that's the case, to change the government.''

HEADLINE: Chinese Leader to Visit Sudan For Talks on Darfur Conflict 

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH; Fan Wenxin contributed reporting.

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
Chinese officials announced Wednesday that President Hu Jintao would visit Sudan in early February and would seek a diplomatic solution to the conflict in the country's western Darfur region, which the United States has described as genocide. 
 Mr. Hu's visit to Sudan will be part of an eight-country tour of Africa, the latest of a string of high-level visits to the continent by Chinese officials.
In recent months, China has faced widespread criticism for its economic engagement with Sudan at a time when government-allied militias known as the janjaweed have carried out frequent attacks on civilian populations in western Darfur. At least 200,000 people have died in the conflict since early 2003, and many thousands have been forced to flee their homes. 
 China has played a leading role in building a thriving oil industry in Sudan amid the violence in Darfur, and now imports more than 64 percent of Sudan's oil exports, accounting for nearly 5 percent of China's petroleum imports. 
 A Foreign Ministry spokesman said that China would use its diplomatic influence to encourage a settlement of the Darfur crisis, but that China would not publicly pressure Sudan or threaten it with sanctions.
 ''The Sudan issue should be resolved like any other -- through peaceful negotiation,'' Assistant Foreign Minister Zhai Jun said at a news conference in Beijing. ''Using pressure and imposing sanctions is not practical and will not help settle the issue.'' 
 Mr. Zhai acknowledged China's prominent role as a leading trading partner of Sudan's and said China would sign new economic agreements with the country during Mr. Hu's visit. ''With Sudan, we have cooperation in many aspects, including military cooperation,'' he said. ''In this, we have nothing to hide.'' 
 China's intense engagement with the continent has brought increasing scrutiny, and very often criticism, from Western governments and from international human rights groups and others who say China ignores questions of governance and of rights as it pursues business opportunities in Africa. 
 Despite the vow not to pressure the Sudanese government, Chinese diplomatic analysts said the announcement of a diplomatic initiative with Sudan was a turning point in China's foreign policy and in its relations with Africa in particular. 
 ''This is a remarkable change,'' said Shi Yinhong, an expert in international relations at People's University in Beijing. ''It would boost China's image in the West, and would be welcomed in Africa, too.'' 
 Mr. Shi said that during the recent China-Africa summit meeting in Beijing, Mr. Hu had pushed the Sudanese president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, in private to cooperate with the United Nations. 
 ''China has begun to follow a different pattern on this issue,'' Mr. Shi said, adding, ''When the world talks about China's rise, naturally that places demands and pressure on China to take on more responsibility.'' 
 An expert in African affairs, however, expressed more caution. ''China now is showing slightly different tactics, paying more attention,'' said He Wenping, director of African studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, in Beijing. ''Hu's visit at least gives a clear signal that China thinks the Sudan issue is important and China wants to play a role. But China's strategy remains the same, and as always, it uses quiet diplomacy to keep a constructive engagement, rather than waving a stick.'' 
 In the last two years, Africa has been the focus of a huge push by Chinese diplomats and companies to expand China's influence abroad. Africa's many countries offer China a rich source of support in United Nations votes and help in securing petroleum and other natural resources needed by China's booming economy. 
 Africa is also a stage of China's bitter diplomatic contest with Taiwan, with China offering large amounts of foreign aid and investment to countries in order to keep them from recognizing Taiwan, which this country regards as a breakaway province. 
 The Foreign Ministry spokesman, Mr. Zhai, acknowledged that there had been problems in certain countries, like Zambia, where there were riots last year at a Chinese-controlled copper mine after a labor dispute over working conditions. ''We are also trying to educate Chinese businesses who have interests in Africa and investments there to respect social conventions and observe local laws and regulations,'' he said.

HEADLINE: With Cash in Hand, Hedge Fund Chiefs Join Political Fray 

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
Lisa Perry loves Hillary Rodham Clinton.
 So much so that two large portrait photographs of the senator by Chuck Close grace the hallway of her 1960s-themed penthouse apartment on Sutton Place in Manhattan.
 ''It's a beautiful picture because Hillary is beautiful,'' said Ms. Perry, a top Democratic fund-raiser, whose husband, Richard, runs a prominent $12 billion hedge fund. ''I will be there for her emotionally, and I will raise.''
 There are no Pop Art portraits of Rudolph W. Giuliani in the home of Paul E. Singer, a longtime hedge fund executive and a primary fund-raiser and policy adviser to Mr. Giuliani, but his support is no less ardent.
 ''Rudy Giuliani is the right leader for the times,'' Mr. Singer said. 
 Hedge fund money, which now exceeds $1 trillion, has emerged in the last several years as a potentially powerful force in politics, as underscored by the significant role it is playing in the presidential aspirations of Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Giuliani. During the 2006 election cycle, executives who work at the 30 biggest hedge funds made $2.8 million in contributions to political candidates or party committees, almost double the amount in 2000. 
 Yet it is not just the money they donate directly that makes people in hedge funds attractive to campaigns. They also offer access to other potential donors in the financial world, which in recent election cycles has become one of the biggest sources of political contributions. That pipeline has made it easy for well-connected candidates like Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Giuliani and Senator John McCain to consider forgoing public funding. (Mrs. Clinton has done so; Mr. McCain is expected to opt out; and Mr. Giuliani has not yet addressed the topic.) 
 And top candidates for the 2008 campaign are expected to raise a lot of money quickly -- at least $100 million each by the end of this year by some estimates.
 ''Are hedge fund guys going to be happy with their art collections and their houses in Greenwich or are they going to take the next step?'' said Byron R. Wien, the investment strategist at Pequot Capital. ''As Hollywood once invaded politics, you will see the same with hedge funds.'' 
 Money from Wall Street has long been a factor in Washington and has tended to flow, with a policy agenda, to the ascendant political party. Giving by people in hedge funds, on the other hand, tends to be more personal and ideological. Some of the most aggressive donors have been Democratic supporters like George Soros, David E. Shaw of D. E. Shaw and James H. Simons at Renaissance Technologies, as well as younger executives like Thomas F. Steyer at Farallon and Marc Lasry at Avenue Capital, all of whom gave generously during the 2006 election cycle. 
 While hedge fund money appears to be tilting toward Democrats of late, Republican donors like Julian H. Robertson Jr., the founder of Tiger Management, who has given more than $700,000 over the last three cycles, and Bruce Kovner at Caxton Associates have backed their party's candidates and causes. 
 Still, compared with the billions of dollars that hedge fund magnates have spent on art, mansions and other extravagances, these political donations are a pittance, held in check by federal finance laws that limit personal contributions to $2,100 and by a general reluctance to step into the public limelight.
 But with the rapid growth of their money and stature, an increasing number of the hedge fund wealthy are not just putting their money to work, they are forging personal and professional ties with a generation of politicians who have come to spend as much time raising money as they do drafting legislation.
 The courtship has been slow. 
 After all, the essence of the industry's success has been its unregulated status and secrecy, so hedge fund titans must weigh the thrill of proximity to political power with the increased public scrutiny that inevitably follows.
 The connections can take different shapes and forms. For John Edwards, the Democratic presidential candidate, the 14 months he spent as a paid senior adviser at Fortress Investment, a $29.7 billion hedge fund and private equity firm, helped him to bond with the fund's liberal-leaning executives, several of whom have given money to Mr. Edwards.
 As to what Mr. Edwards, a trial lawyer with no previous financial markets experience, did at Fortress, an adviser to the candidate said that Mr. Edwards ''advised on where there might be investment opportunities and where he saw the global economy going.'' Mr. Edwards resigned from Fortress last month before declaring his candidacy. 
 And Avenue Capital, a $12 billion fund run by Mr. Lasry, a prominent financial supporter of the Clintons, hired their daughter, Chelsea, last year.
 Mr. Singer and Ms. Perry represent different sides of the same coin. Mr. Singer, 62, is the founding partner of Elliott Associates, a $7 billion hedge fund with a conservative, risk-averse bias that has been in business since 1977, making it one of the oldest funds around. A reserved, private man who would answer questions only via e-mail, Mr. Singer is a self-described conservative libertarian who has given millions of dollars to Republican organizations that emphasize a strong military and support Israel. 
 They include Progress for America ($1.5 million in contributions), a political advocacy group set up to advance the policies of the Bush administration; Swift Vets and P.O.W.'s for Truth; and the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs, which includes Vice President Dick Cheney and Richard N. Perle, an adviser to the former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, among its past and current advisory directors.
 Mr. Singer said that his support for Mr. Giuliani sprang from an appreciation of Mr. Giuliani's work as mayor. ''Rudy's stewardship is primarily responsible for making New York one of the greatest cities of the world,'' he said.
 A trustee at the Manhattan Institute, the conservative policy group that has been a source of many of Mr. Giuliani's core policies, like welfare reform and a focus on quality-of-life issues, Mr. Singer sees Mr. Giuliani as the ''strongest, most conservative candidate in the race.'' 
 While Kenneth G. Langone, a co-founder of Home Depot, held Mr. Giuliani's first public fund-raiser last month, a campaign strategy notebook that was leaked to The Daily News of New York this month pointed to Mr. Singer as the locus of Mr. Giuliani's fund-raising network. ''I will be raising money for Rudy in professional and personal circles,'' he said.
 Asked to describe his political philosophy, Mr. Singer says his conservatism dates back to Barry Goldwater and is founded on free enterprise and a belief that the government should ''not be taking from one person and giving to another.'' He abhors what he calls social engineering and he has financially supported state propositions that advocate preventing state agencies from collecting racial information.
 He believes in the doctrine of American exceptionalism and is wary about United States involvement in ''international organizations and alliances.'' As for the war in Iraq, he said, ''America finds itself at an early stage of a drawn-out existential struggle with radical strains of pan-national Islamists.''
 In an industry known for its secrecy, Mr. Singer keeps a particularly low profile. He does all that he can to keep his picture from appearing in the media and does virtually no marketing for his fund, which had a return of 17 percent last year. Given his wealth, his disposition is frugal.
 ''He is not a trophy collector,'' said Lawrence Simon, the co-founder of Ivy Asset Management and an investor with Mr. Singer for more than 25 years. ''I don't even know if he has a second abode. He is very quiet in the way that he carries himself.''
 A graduate of the University of Rochester and Harvard Law School, Mr. Singer practiced law before he began to dabble in what was then an obscure investment strategy called convertible arbitrage. By buying convertible bonds and selling the attached stock short -- or betting that its price would fall -- he realized that he could achieve a decent investment return in up and down markets. 
 Steeled by the bear markets of the 1970s, he worries that managers may have become punch-drunk from a surfeit of happy investment times. ''I am struck by the size of the hedge fund community and the amount of money being managed by people who have little experience in risk management and adverse market environments,'' he said.
 In contrast to Mr. Singer's quiet approach, Ms. Perry's embrace of Mrs. Clinton has taken on a more celebratory cast. She has tapped New York's art world for fund-raising parties and opened up her Long Island house, in Sag Harbor, for gatherings for the senator.
 Over the last three election cycles, Ms. Perry, 48, has given more than $1 million to Democrats, putting her in the most elite tier of Democratic donors. Given that she wrote her first check in 1998, when she was a stay-at-home mother, it has been a rapid evolution and one that has been fueled by her belief that there are not enough women senators in Washington. Her litmus issue is a woman's right to an abortion and it is what first attracted her to Mrs. Clinton in 1999. 
 Now she considers her a personal friend. ''We have a strong bond,'' she said. ''She is the smartest, the most worldly. I just think she would be the most fabulous president.'' 
 She admits to getting a bit emotional at the thought of a woman in the White House. ''I feel it so strongly,'' said Ms. Perry, who is in the midst of starting her own line of Lisa Perry-branded clothing. ''I'm a strong feminist so I really want it to happen.'' 
 Mrs. Clinton's advisers are quick to give Ms. Perry her due.
 ''Lisa is an active, effective supporter,'' said Alan J. Patricof, the finance chairman of Mrs. Clinton's two Senate campaigns. ''She is not a frivolous person.''
 While her husband, Richard, is also a Democrat, Ms. Perry points out that her giving and fund-raising are driven by her own politics, not his. Still, he, too, is a supporter of Mrs. Clinton. 
 ''He thinks she is one of the smartest people he has ever met,'' Ms. Perry said.
 But it is her own largess that gives her a sense of pride. ''Not a lot of women write their own checks,'' she said.

HEADLINE: The State of the Union, and of the President 

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Bush, Pressing Modest Agenda, Insists U.S. Must Not Fail in Iraq'' (front page, Jan. 24):
President Bush, in his State of the Union address, proposed tinkering with his existing policies to solve our most urgent problems, including global warming, health care and the occupation of Iraq.
 Unfortunately, greenhouse gas emissions won't be curbed by ''clean coal technology'' and ethanol. Health care will not become accessible to all Americans through tax cuts. And the quagmire of Iraq will not be solved through escalation. 
 What our country needs are bold changes in failing policies, changes that the president seems incapable of delivering. 
 It is time for the Democratic Congress to take the lead in solving these problems, through attainable caps on carbon emissions, a truly universal health care system and an expedited redeployment of our troops out of Iraq.

Eric Ettlinger
Berkeley, Calif., Jan. 24, 2007

To the Editor:
 In his State of the Union address, President Bush once again tried to have the American people and the world believe that the maelstrom in Iraq and the Middle East is due entirely to a litany of acts of evil terrorists and the external influences of foreign powers, especially Iran and Syria. And he would have us believe that these are recent developments. 
 Nowhere was there any sign of introspection. Mr. Bush is still in denial. As a result, even more Americans and innocent civilians will die in Mr. Bush's misguided ''augmentation,'' as Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice calls it, and the world will be a much more dangerous place.
 After Mr. Bush was elected in 2000, I consoled myself that our system of government was strong enough to withstand the incompetence of any individual that held the office of president. Events of the last five years have shaken my confidence in the inherent strength of our Republic. 
 In 2008 and beyond, Americans must exercise their power to vote with the utmost care, lest America repeat the fate of other great powers in history that met their downfall.

To the Editor:
 President Bush said in his State of the Union address, ''This is not the fight we entered in Iraq, but it is the fight we are in.''
 Has he forgotten that he received many warnings, internationally and domestically, that the war we went into would become the war we are in now? He ignored them all.

To the Editor:
 When speaking about Iraq, President Bush told Congress, ''And whatever you voted for, you did not vote for failure.'' 
 This is the president's way of reframing the issue. Of course no one voted for failure, and the president's opponents are not hoping for failure. 
 The president knows full well that the failure has already occurred, but instead of looking at that failure as a way of learning how not to repeat it, he's framing the discussion so that his opponents -- including the 70 percent of the American people who disapprove of the way he's handling the war -- can be blamed for their lack of ''resolve.''
 Here is a short list of the president's errors: listening to his secretary of defense instead of the generals who cautioned him that we needed 500,000 troops to secure the peace; not clearing the troops out within six months of his announcement that ''major combat operations in Iraq have ended''; not listening to any voices, especially the Iraq Study Group report, urging anything but continued staying the course.
 I don't include his justifications for the invasion -- the W.M.D. or Saddam Hussein's involvement in 9/11. Those weren't errors. Those were lies.

To the Editor:
 In his State of the Union address, President Bush warned that ''America must not fail in Iraq.''
 Let's see if I have this right: Against the advice of many of its passengers, a man drives a car recklessly into a ditch. It gets stuck. At first he denies that it's stuck at all. Then when it's impossible to avoid the truth, he guns the gas, spins the wheels and sinks the car deeper in the mud, all the while yelling hysterically about how terrible it will be for everyone if they can't get out.
 Well thank you for enlightening us, Mr. President.
 President Bush patronizes the entire nation when he tells us that failure in Iraq would be a disaster for the nation. We are acutely aware of the consequences of his bellicosity, thank you.

William Horwitz
Irvington, N.Y., Jan. 24, 2007

To the Editor:
 The state of the administration's remarkable disunion from reality is highlighted by a signature phrase from the State of the Union address. 
 Contrary to President Bush's assertion that ''this is not the fight we entered,'' a great many people warned before the invasion of Iraq that the war would be pretty much exactly ''the fight we are in'' now. At the time, the president's orchestrated minions suggested that such people were stupid, timid, defeatist and unpatriotic. 
 No one expects a genuine admission of error from this president, but it would be nice to at least hear him apologize to the people who were maligned for having greater prescience and common sense than his entire retinue of foreign and defense policy makers.

To the Editor:
 Simple elegance marked our president's walk down the aisle to preside over the annual ritual of the State of the Union address, where not only is there no charging the podium, catcalling or other acts of incivility witnessed in other countries, but also there is rather attentive camaraderie and even occasional enthusiastic bicameral endorsement. 
 Here, legislators on both sides of the political line of scrimmage, loyal to their principles, build bridges and, through vigorously exchanged competing philosophies, unite our purpose.
 How heartwarming to see some of the president's toughest critics, like Senator John Kerry and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, rise in supportive applause. Sometimes Ms. Pelosi was on her feet ahead of the vice president. 
 How touching to come together as a nation to honor men like Wesley Autrey for extraordinary humanity and Sgt. Tommy Rieman for exceptional bravery. 
 How fortunate and privileged we are to be Americans. 

Elliott Scheinberg
Staten Island, Jan. 24, 2007

To the Editor:
 President Bush proposed tax cuts that would give uninsured Americans a modest amount of money to use toward premium payments for their own health insurance coverage. 
 Here's what he didn't say: unlike group plans negotiated by employers, individual coverage plans are subject to denial, termination or prohibitive rate increases if the covered person actually has a health problem. 
 For decades now, the G.O.P. has flimflammed voters with its snake-oil pitch about tax cuts. 
 Tax cuts didn't produce more revenue, despite promises from Republicans like Jack Kemp and Ronald Reagan. They produced staggering debt. 
 And tax cuts won't give uninsured Americans the access to health care that citizens of most leading nations take for granted. 
 Americans need real health care reform, not gimmicks, and we need it now.

David A. Scott
Columbus, Ohio, Jan. 24, 2007

To the Editor:
 The president failed to mention one of our greatest national embarrassments, the state of the city of New Orleans. Is it no longer part of the union?
 I can only surmise that President Bush could not include the topic without reminding us of his administration's astounding incompetence, which was unmasked by Hurricane Katrina. Or reminding us of his abandonment of New Orleans since his carefully staged post-disaster town square speech. 
 Here are the words the president should have said: ''We must allocate every resource possible to fulfill every pledge I made to rebuild New Orleans and the Gulf states ravaged by Katrina. We cannot accept any notion that the population of New Orleans could end up half of what it was before the storm. We cannot fail these people.'' 
 Mr. President, could you not find anyone to write those words?

Chris Westerkamp
Holyoke, Mass., Jan. 24, 2007

To the Editor:
 Re ''The State of the Union'' (editorial, Jan. 24):
 In his address, President Bush said the state of the union is ''strong.'' Should we believe that just because he said it? Does he base his statement on the fact that under his economic policies, the rich are getting richer?
 Mr. Bush's tragic blunder of invading and occupying Iraq is the chief cause of the continuing blood bath there. 
 Our president has admitted that mistakes have been made in Iraq in the past four years, but he still believes that he was correct in sending our brave troops into an unwinnable conflict that we initiated.
 The Iraq debacle has done irreparable harm to President Bush's credibility, which carries over to most everything he proposes. 
 Congress and the American people must hold Mr. Bush's feet to the fire and not let him send more troops to die in Iraq for his monumental mistake.

Paul L. Whiteley Sr.
Louisville, Ky., Jan. 24, 2007

To the Editor:
 After six years of the Bush administration and seven addresses by President Bush to Congress on the state of the union, it's now clear that Mr. Bush's political philosophy can be condensed into two principles: 
 First, most domestic problems in the United States can be solved by tax cuts or tax credits.
 Second, most of the United States' foreign problems can be solved by wars or threats of war.
 Unfortunately, the president's approach has only exacerbated America's problems, because our problems are too complex and difficult for these facile solutions.

HEADLINE: Congressional Office Forecasts Drop in Deficit, With Possibility of a Later Surplus

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicted on Wednesday that the federal budget deficit would shrink again this year and could actually swing into a surplus in 2012 -- but only if President Bush's tax cuts expire in 2010.
 The agency predicted that the deficit for 2007 would decline to about $200 billion. It would be the third big annual decline in a row, and it would come even though spending on the war in Iraq is expected to remain high this year. 
The decline of the deficit comes on the heels of unexpectedly large increases in tax revenue over the last two years and slower-than-expected increases in spending on Medicare.
 Much of that increased revenue came from taxes on sharply higher corporate profits and big gains in the stock market, even though Congress reduced the tax rate on capital gains and stock dividends in 2003.
 The agency's ''baseline'' estimate -- one that assumes current law does not change -- is that the deficit will decline to $172 billion this year, from $248 billion in the past fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, 2006. As a practical matter, officials said, the actual deficit will probably be about $200 billion because of outlays for the war.
 It is a rare piece of good news for President Bush, coming as he is struggling to persuade Congress to accept his strategy of sending more troops to Iraq and as his public approval ratings are at an all-time low.
 White House officials boasted that the projections validated Mr. Bush's strategy of cutting taxes to stimulate the economy and ultimately generate higher tax revenues.
 ''Two years ago, the president laid out an ambitious goal to cut the deficit in half by 2009, and we met that goal three years early,'' said Rob Portman, the White House budget director. ''We are now on a solid path toward the president's new goal to achieve a balanced budget by 2012, while making the tax cuts permanent and better constraining spending.''
 But Congressional budget officials cautioned that the projections were not as sunny as they looked, in part because they assume that Congress will let President Bush's tax cuts expire in 2010, along with many corporate tax breaks, and will not try to shield millions of families from a big increase in their tax bills because of the alternative minimum tax.
 Mr. Bush and most of his Republican allies in Congress have pushed to make the tax cuts permanent, rather than letting them expire at the end of 2010 as they are scheduled to do. Even some Democrats favor extending the tax cuts that benefit middle-income families.
 Extending the tax cuts would cost the Treasury $1.4 trillion in the next 10 years and increase the deficit in 2017 alone by more than $400 billion.
 Lawmakers in both parties have wanted to restrain the alternative minimum tax, a parallel tax that was aimed at only the richest families but has not been adjusted for inflation. If left unchanged, the alternative minimum tax is expected to engulf tens of millions of families with annual incomes of $100,000 and less. 
 Preventing an increase in the alternative tax would cost $1.2 trillion over 10 years and add more than $200 billion to the deficit in 2017, the budget office estimated. 
 Democrats countered that the fiscal picture remained bleak. ''While any improvement in the deficit is a welcome development, today's report from C.B.O. is no cause for a declaration of victory,'' said Representative John M. Spratt Jr., the South Carolina Democrat who is chairman of the Budget Committee.
 After factoring in the cost of tax cuts, Mr. Spratt said, the new report offered a ''bleak reminder of how much current policy will need to be changed to return the budget to a fiscally responsible course.''
 The budget office tried to include costs of the war in its projections. But the baseline projection included only the $70 billion in ''bridge'' financing that Congress approved last year, and President Bush is expected to submit a supplemental request next month that could be more than $100 billion.
 The agency estimated that actual outlays during the 2007 fiscal year would total almost $100 billion and add about $25 billion to the deficit beyond what the baseline estimate indicated. That estimate is consistent with others that war costs are running about $8 billion a month.
 Congressional analysts had a more difficult time grappling with war costs in 2008 and beyond. If the United States reduced the number of troops in Iraq to 30,000 in 2010, from more than 130,000 today, the agency estimated, the spending on Iraq would be about $300 billion less than it assumes right now.
 Over the long term, the Congressional Budget Office said, the real budget problem will be the surge in spending on Social Security and Medicare as baby boomers retire.
 It echoed Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, who told Congress last week that the recent improvement in the budget was merely the ''calm before the storm'' and that the nation would face ''draconian'' choices between severe cuts in benefits and steep tax increases if it failed to act quickly.
 Likewise, the budget office said there had been no ''substantial change'' to the problems that lie a few years ahead. ''Either a substantial reduction in the growth of spending, a significant increase in tax revenues relative to the size of the economy, or some combination of spending and revenue changes will be necessary,'' it said.

HEADLINE: China Says Its Economy Grew by 10.7% in 2006, With Little Inflation

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Jan. 25 

 BODY:
In the last 30 years, no major economy in the world has grown at the speed of China's, and no other country has been able to do it year after year, for over a decade.
 And on Thursday China did it again, saying that its economy grew by a whopping 10.7 percent in 2006, the fastest pace in more than a decade, with only modest signs of inflation.
 ''This is pretty impressive,'' said Shen Minggao, an economist in Beijing for Citigroup. ''I'd say 2006 was about the best year in a decade -- fast growth and low inflation.'' 
 The 10.7 percent growth recorded in 2006 was the fourth consecutive year of double-digit economic growth and China's strongest year since 1995, when the economy grew 10.9 percent. 
 The economic miracle -- fueled by soaring exports and huge investments in buildings, roads and cities -- goes on even in the face of frequent warnings from government officials and private specialists about asset bubbles, excessive bank lending and an overheating economy.
 ''Right now, the economy is growing at the upper limits of what is acceptable,'' said Li Lianfa, an economist at Peking University. ''The government is facing a lot of challenges.''
 Chief among them are balancing the supersize growth and heavy investment, and trying to distribute the riches as evenly as possible.
 Analysts say the government is determined to keep the economy revving, but is also wants to prevent anything from spoiling the party before 2008, when Beijing is to play host to the Olympic Games.
 To help cool the economy, Beijing has raised interest rates and pressured banks to temper lending, with some results. Fixed-asset investment slowed in the latter part of last year, for instance, and economic growth in the last months of 2006 slowed from a feverish second-quarter pace of 11.5 percent.
 Many economists are now forecasting that Beijing will take additional steps, possibly raising interest rates again early this year.
 Beijing is also under pressure to allow the Chinese currency, the yuan or renminbi, to appreciate more quickly against the dollar, in the hope of easing the country's trade surplus with the United States. 
 The yuan has strengthened somewhat against the dollar, climbing to about 7.8 yuan to the dollar, from 8.26 yuan in 2005.
 Economists have warned that if the yuan does not continue to appreciate against the dollar and other major currencies, China could face protectionist action, which could pose an even more serious threat to economic growth.
 These are the trials of a country where everything is red hot -- foreign investment, trade, real estate and stock prices, which climbed more than 130 percent last year and have soared even higher in the opening weeks of this year.
 Although inflation, driven largely by higher food prices, jumped to 2.8 percent in December, from 1.9 percent in November, analysts say they are not overly concerned about inflationary pressure. The core inflation number, excluding volatile items like food, was modest, with inflation rising just 1.5 percent in 2006.
 But other economists say that accelerated growth often leads to higher prices, and that there could be a lag before stronger signs of inflationary pressure are seen.
 Among the government's chief worries has been overinvestment in certain sectors of the economy, like real estate. Stock prices are another concern. After dipping to their lowest level in six years in mid-2005, stock prices in Shanghai have nearly tripled in a record-breaking run.
 The central bank said that last October, for the first time in five years, the bank savings of Chinese citizens slid from the month before as more money went into the stock market. An abrupt change in the market, analysts say, could create havoc.
 While the stock run-up means that Chinese companies can once again raise money with stock offerings in the domestic market rather than relying on the Hong Kong stock market, huge risks remain. Analysts have long derided the Chinese market as a gambling den crowded with companies using suspect accounting.
 In yet another effort to tame the economy, the government raised the banking reserve requirement ratio last month, to help restrict lending. And several economists say they expect interest rate increases in the coming months.
 But not all specialists share the view that China's booming economy is in any jeopardy. One such contrarian is Jonathan Anderson, an economist at UBS, who says his firm's internal figures show that China's economic growth has actually moderated over the last few years. Those figures show that the Chinese economy was growing even faster, at closer to 12 percent, not the 10 percent the government reported.
 So the new numbers, he says, are not so alarming.
 ''This really shouldn't be an issue for the authorities,'' he said. ''What you're seeing is a very stable economic situation with very little inflation.''

HEADLINE: Homes and Treasuries Give Investors a Jolt

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A lackluster home sales report and a disappointing bond auction halted a two-day rally in the market yesterday, sending the Dow Jones industrials into a triple-digit decline.
 The market drifted lower for much of the session after the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes fell 0.8 percent in December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.22 million. Then, in the afternoon, a tepid reception for the Treasury's latest sale of five-year notes sent bond prices falling and yields rising sharply, rattling stock investors already worried about higher interest rates.
The Dow fell 119.21 points, or 0.94 percent, to 12,502.56. 
 Broader stock indicators also fell. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 16.23 points, or 1.13 percent, to 1,423.90, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 32.04 points, or 1.30 percent, at 2,434.24. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down 9.84 points, or 1.24 percent, at 784.19.
 Earlier in the day, investors' cheer over quarterly reports from eBay, Nokia and AT&T failed to translate into gains as strong earnings news had done in previous days.
 ''We had a great run,'' said Ryan Larson, senior equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management, a division of RBC Dain Rauscher. ''I think people are kind of tired right now and looking for other avenues.''
 The Dow's decline yesterday erased nearly all the previous two-day rally of about 145 points.
 David J. Thompson, chief investment officer at Dwight Asset Management, said the data hinting at stability in the housing market unnerved the bond market because it could signal that the economy is holding up better than expected and raises the prospect of higher interest rates. He also said some bond investors were surprised by the weak response to the note auction.
 ''I think the market is just coming to grips with the fact that the economy is stronger than folks thought two months ago,'' Mr. Thompson said.
 Wall Street seemed largely to shrug off a Labor Department report that the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits last week surged by the largest amount in 16 months, reversing two weeks of declines.
 Light crude fell $1.14, to $54.23 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Recent sharp drops have stopped as investors grow more confident that OPEC will cut production.
 EBay jumped $2.45, to $32.45, after the company posted a 24 percent increase in profit.
 Ford Motor rose 2 cents, to $8.22, even as the automaker reported a loss for 2006 of $12.7 billion -- the worst in its 103-year history. Falling sales and enormous revamping costs hurt results. Investors had been expecting a weak showing, however, and appeared relieved that the report was not worse.
 AT&T rose 16 cents, to $36.79, after the company reported a 17 percent increase in fourth-quarter profit and growth in wireless subscribers and in its regional wireline businesses.
 Nokia, the mobile phone maker, rose 90 cents, to $21.11, after the company's fourth-quarter profit rose 19 percent on higher sales.
 Lockheed Martin's fourth-quarter earnings rose 28 percent as it raised its full-year profit forecast. Its shares rose 30 cents, to $97.44.
 Bond prices fell in response to the auction and the real estate report, which also showed that the inventory of existing homes available for sale fell 7.9 percent, to 3.51 million. The price of the 10-year note fell 16/32, to 98 2/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, jumped to 4.87 percent, from 4.81 percent.
 Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of five-year notes.

HEADLINE: Fearing Protectionism, In India

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland 

 BODY:
As India and China have grown rapidly in recent years, there has been no shortage of forecasts of protectionist backlashes in the developed world, although the actual effect of those complaints has been minor. 
 But now there is talk of a different threat.
''Backlash within India is a bigger problem,'' said Kris Gopalakrishnan, a co-founder and president of Infosys, an Indian company that has become one of the biggest winners from the era of globalization. Its stock price has quintupled in less than four years, and over the last 12 months it has hired 22,000 people. 
 ''There is one part of India which is rapidly growing and another part that is being left behind,'' he said in an interview here. ''In the last round of Indian elections,'' both at the national and state levels, ''any chief minister who was seen as pro-business lost.''
 At the World Economic Forum here this week, business and government leaders have celebrated what they see as the success of globalization. Unemployment is low around the world, and growth is strong. Worries about a United States slowdown have faded, and even the self-appointed pessimist on one panel of economists here, Nouriel Roubini of Roubini Global Economics, saw the threat in the United States as being a ''growth recession'' rather than a real recession. In such a downturn, the American economy would see a few quarters of growth below 1 percent. 
 If a few years ago the big question about China was whether it would have a hard landing or a soft one, now no one sees any landing at all. Instead, there are questions about what it will do with all that money. Zhu Min, an official of the Bank of China, offered assurances that China would not have trouble managing another $200 billion in foreign currency reserves that it will add this year.
 And Montek S. Ahluwalia, a member of the Indian government as deputy chairman of the state planning commission, can talk of being dissatisfied with an economic growth rate of over 8 percent, promising to raise it to 10 percent within five years. A few years ago, a growth rate of 8 percent would have seemed like a wonderful dream.
 But the growth has come, and with it concern about unequal distribution. Mr. Gopalakrishnan said 37 percent of Indians are illiterate, and more than 30 percent live in poverty.
 Infosys, which prospered from the outsourcing of technical work from companies in the developed world, played a role in India's growth. But its direct benefits remain restricted to the most educated sectors of Indian society, even if it does reach further down the education hierarchy than it once did.
 A decade ago, Mr. Gopalakrishnan said, Infosys hired 90 percent of its new employees from the top tier of Indian universities. Now that proportion is down to about 10 percent, simply because there is a lot of competition for the graduates of those colleges. 
 Instead, it hires most of its new employees from 200 Indian colleges, and puts all new workers through a 16-week training program that leads to about 4 percent of them failing. It also hires workers from the countries where it seeks contracts, including 130 in the last year from American colleges. It is trying to become more of a strategic consultant to its clients, a plan that requires more local knowledge.
 But even as Infosys and other Indian companies have prospered, they have contributed to rising inequality in India -- in part by helping to bid up salaries for those who get top jobs -- and Infosys now seeks workers willing to take less than it pays in India.
 Mr. Gopalakrishnan said Infosys aimed at having about 30 percent of the work on its typical contract done in the country where the client is, and the rest done remotely. All of that remote work used to be done in India, but now Infosys has added locations in China, Mauritius and the Czech Republic, and is looking for a location in Latin America.
 It is not hard to imagine an Indian politician denouncing that strategy in terms that would be familiar to Ross Perot. And that explains why it is not enough to say that globalization has produced unprecedented growth.
 ''Democratic societies,'' said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, ''need to have a population that feels the benefits from this process are shared by them.''
 And that is no sure thing, even in India. ''It is an amazing time,'' Mr. Gopalakrishnan said, pointing to the rapid economic growth in much of the world. ''How long it will last is anybody's guess.''

HEADLINE: More People With Weak Credit Are Defaulting on Mortgages 

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ and CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
Wall Street's big bet on risky mortgages may be souring a lot faster than had been previously thought.
 The once booming market for home loans to people with weak credit -- known as subprime mortgages and made largely to minorities, the poor and first-time buyers stretching to afford a home -- is coming under greater pressure. The evidence can be seen in rising default rates, increasingly strained finances at mortgage lenders and growing doubts among investors.
Now, Wall Street firms, which had helped fuel the growth in the market by bankrolling and investing in subprime mortgage lenders, have begun to pinch off the money spigot. 
 Several mortgage lenders have recently collapsed. While the failures so far are small in number, some industry officials are concerned that they could be the first in a wave. The subprime sector, which produced loans worth more than $500 billion in the first nine months of last year, could shrink significantly. 
 A sharp contraction in subprime mortgages would have ripple effects, reducing consumers' access to credit and affecting investors like foreign central banks, pensions and mutual funds that have been big buyers of mortgage-backed securities. 
 The recent bankruptcy of Ownit Mortgage Solutions, a lender based in Agoura Hills, Calif., provides a cautionary tale. Even as its revenue grew by more than a third in the first nine months of 2006, to $8.3 billion, the company was losing money. It shut down after its financial backers, which included Merrill Lynch & Company and JPMorgan Chase, could not come up with a deal to save it.
 In addition to Ownit, Sebring Capital Partners, based outside Dallas, closed in December, and Mortgage Lenders Network of Middletown, Conn., has stopped making loans through brokers. It also laid off more than 800 employees and is under investigation by state regulators.
 ''Pick a company -- small, medium or large -- they all have the same problem: capital,'' said Marc A. Geredes, who runs a small mortgage company, LownHome Financial, in San Jose, Calif. ''The economics of the business do not make sense right now.''
 Wall Street firms were attracted to such lenders because they helped feed a pipeline of securities backed by the mortgages, a market bigger than the one for United States Treasury bonds and notes. Merrill Lynch, for example, securitized $67.8 billion in residential mortgages in the first nine months of 2006, up 58.4 percent from the period a year earlier. 
 But an increasing number of borrowers are defaulting on subprime loans earlier now than they did a year ago, often within six months of having taken the loan out, shaking Wall Street's confidence in its subprime partners.
 In one indication that investors are losing their taste for mortgages, hedge funds that specialize in mortgage-backed securities had an outflow of $1.8 billion in 2006, down from an inflow of $1.8 billion in 2005, according to Hedge Fund Research. It was the only category of hedge funds to have a negative flow for the year.
 ''We have been and continue to be cautious about the subprime market -- its lending standards, decline in home price appreciation, other deteriorating credit fundamentals,'' said Jim Higgins, chief executive of Sorin Capital Management.
 While Wall Street's tolerance for mortgage risk has waned, it is still interested in mortgage originators. This week, Citigroup bought a mortgage servicing business from ABN Amro Holding for undisclosed terms, and Barclays Bank bought the Equifirst Corporation, a subprime lender, for $225 million. But something of a shakeout has begun. 
 ''The pendulum swung too far the other way,'' said Guy D. Cecala, president of Inside Mortgage Finance, which publishes data and newsletters on the industry. ''At some point, it comes back. But what it usually takes is a little blood on the road.''
 If that is indeed how the story will play out, William D. Dallas, the founder and chief executive of Ownit, would argue that his company has become an early case of road kill.
 In mid-November, JPMorgan Chase, which provided Ownit with money to make home loans, notified the company that it was in default and would lose access to a $500 million credit line by Dec. 13 because it was losing money. It had taken on too much debt and its net worth had fallen, according to bankruptcy documents and people briefed on the company's finances.
 Mortgage lenders as small as Ownit and as big as Wells Fargo sit in the middle of housing's food chain that starts with individual home buyers and can end with investors in exotic credit derivatives on the other side of the world. Smaller lenders like Ownit use money provided by banks like JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch to make loans that it receives from mortgage brokers, who work with the people buying homes or refinancing loans and help with the paperwork.
 Once completed, the mortgages are sold to Wall Street banks that package hundreds of loans at a time into bonds that are sold to investors and traded in financial markets. 
 The bonds are sliced into different layers of risk and many investors typically accept lower returns in exchange for guarantees that they will be paid ahead of people in the lower-quality portions of the securities if borrowers default on mortgages. 
 Investors also shield themselves by requiring mortgage companies like Ownit to buy back mortgages that incur ''early payment defaults,'' an industry term for loans that have turned bad quickly.
 In recent months, banks have sought the safety of these protective measures and grown pickier about the kinds of loans they will buy after noticing that a growing number of borrowers who took out loans in 2006 were falling behind within months. According to its bankruptcy filing, Ownit was asked to buy back $166.4 million in loans, $93 million of which was owed to Merrill Lynch. 
 Merrill Lynch owned about 20 percent of Ownit and provided a credit line worth billions of dollars to the company. (Also in December, Merrill Lynch bought First Franklin Financial, a subprime lender co-founded by Mr. Dallas, for $1.3 billion from National City.)
 Ownit's strained financial circumstances set the tone for negotiations with JPMorgan, Merrill Lynch and CIVC Partners, a Chicago-based private equity firm that owns the majority of Ownit. Mr. Dallas, who along with other executives owned about 20 percent of the company, said Merrill Lynch agreed to step in to make up Ownit's financial shortfall and was even willing to buy the 80 percent of the company it did not already own.
 But Mr. Dallas said the deal fell apart on Dec. 7, when Merrill pulled its offer of additional funds and its representative on Ownit's board, Michael Blum, tendered his resignation by fax. 
 Mr. Blum, a managing director who heads structured finance at Merrill Lynch, declined through a spokesman to comment.
 ''While it is unfortunate that Ownit closed its doors, we met every contractual obligation we had to them,'' William Halldin, the spokesman for Merrill Lynch, said. ''Like its majority owner, we did not think it was in the best interests of our shareholders to make a further investment.''
 The representative of CIVC Partners on the board of Ownit, Daniel Helle, did not return calls for comment. Officials at JPMorgan declined to discuss the negotiations.
 Mr. Dallas acknowledged that Ownit, like other subprime lenders, saw a sharp increase in defaults from new borrowers in 2006, compared with 2005 and 2004 -- years when few loans showed early losses. But he said the defaults were still low at 2 percent and insisted that most of those borrowers had simply missed one or two payments because they were confused about where to mail payments, because many of them had two mortgages on their homes.
 Across the industry, 2.6 percent of the subprime loans securitized in the second quarter of 2006 had been foreclosed on or repossessed within six months. That is up from 1 percent for loans securitized in the second quarter of 2005, according to Moody's Investors Service, the ratings agency. 
 Joseph Rocco, an analyst with Moody's, noted that foreclosure rates typically rise as loans get older.
 The grim statistics reflect the sharp slowdown in housing. Home prices, for instance, in many previously hot markets on the coasts and in the Southwest, are falling as sales have slackened, making it harder for homeowners to sell their properties. 
 They also indicate that mortgage lenders became more generous last year, giving 100 percent financing and allowing borrowers to state their incomes with little or no documentation in an effort to bolster volume, according to industry experts.
 Banking regulators have increasingly voiced concerns about the loosening of lending practices by subprime lenders. Late last year some demanded that applicants be more closely vetted before being qualified for adjustable-rate and other risky loans.
 Yet, housing advocates and industry experts say policy makers are also worried that too sharp a pullback in lending by Wall Street and commercial banks could cut off consumer access to credit. 
 For his part, Mr. Dallas acknowledges that standards were lowered, but he placed the blame at the feet of investors and Wall Street, saying they encouraged Ownit and other subprime lenders to make riskier loans to keep the pipeline of mortgage securities well supplied.
 ''The market is paying me to do a no-income-verification loan more than it is paying me to do the full documentation loans,'' he said. ''What would you do?''

HEADLINE: Sales of Existing Homes in '06 Had Biggest Drop in 17 Years

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 

 BODY:
Sales of existing homes fell last month, closing out a year when demand for homes slumped by the largest amount in 17 years.
 The National Association of Realtors reported that sales of existing homes were down 0.8 percent in December, a bigger decline than had been expected. For the year, sales fell by 8.4 percent, the biggest annual decline since 1989, when sales of existing homes fell by 14.8 percent. 
The sales figure underscored the sharp contraction in the once-highflying housing market, which before last year had set sales records for five straight years.
 Even with the sharp decline in sales last year, the median price of an existing home sold in 2006 managed to rise 1.1 percent. But that was far below the double-digit gains during the boom years. The median home price rose by 12.4 percent in 2005.
 Economists said they believed that the low point for housing had been reached, and they were forecasting a slow rebound in 2007. Because of that optimism, analysts say they do not believe the slump in housing will drag the overall economy into a recession.
 The 0.8 percent drop in sales in December came after two straight months of improving sales, the first back-to-back sales gains since the spring of 2005.
 David Lereah, chief economist for the Realtors, said that he believes that sales of existing homes have hit bottom and will start to gradually improve.
 He said that in 2005, 40 percent of the market represented purchases of second homes and investors buying homes looking to resell them for quick profits.
 He said speculators had now left the market and that should leave sales at a more sustainable level.
 In other economics news, the number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits shot up last week by the largest amount in 16 months, reversing two weeks of big declines.
 The Labor Department reported that 325,000 newly laid-off workers filed claims for jobless benefits last week, an increase of 36,000 from the previous week. That was the biggest one-week rise since a surge of 96,000 claims the week of Sept. 10, 2005, when devastated Gulf Coast businesses laid off workers after Hurricane Katrina.

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
The American Folk Art Museum's transporting exhibition of the scroll-like drawings of the Mexican artist Martin Ramirez (1895-1963) should render null and void the insider-outsider distinction. 
 Ramirez, who created the roughly 300 drawings that make up his known work between 1948 and 1963 while confined to a mental hospital in Northern California, is simply one of the greatest artists of the 20th century. He belongs to the group of accessible, irresistible genius draftsmen that includes Paul Klee, Saul Steinberg and Charles Schulz. Well selected and beautifully installed by Brooke Davis Anderson, a curator at the folk art museum, this show of 97 drawings, some mural-size, is the first museum exhibition of Ramirez's work in New York and one of the best shows of the season.
Whatever ideas about art you hold dear, expect them to be healthily destabilized here. If a purely visual, white-cube experience of the autonomous art object is your thing, you may be startled by the illuminating correlations between the artist's newly excavated biography and his pulsating images. 
 If you think art is anything but autonomous and that, rather than speaking for itself, it mainly says what we want it to say, then you must deal with the way these works made enough noise to survive against almost impossible odds. 
 If you revere outsider artists as pure, isolated, often insane visionaries who exist outside time and place, make way for a so-called outsider whose work reflected many of the specifics of his cultural and historic moment. In addition, Ramirez's art was in step with the explorations of many ''insider'' artists of his time, especially in his use of collage and images from popular culture. 
 Ramirez had an indelible style built on a supreme sense of economy and shot through with a mix of sly humor and sunny optimism that coats deeper, darker feelings. He had his own way with materials and color -- buoyed by an unerring sensitivity to the power of blank paper -- and a cast of unforgettable characters, including mounted caballeros, levitating Madonnas, and deer and dogs on high alert. But most of all Ramirez had his own brand of pictorial space, which he regulated with rhythmic systems of parallel lines, curved and straight. He played spatial illusion as if it were an accordion, expanding and contracting it in a mesmerizing play of stasis and movement. 
 He might orchestrate the curved lines into stepped, hivelike hills punctuated by dark tunnels where ornate trains and buglike cars or buses chug in or out along extravagantly banked roadways or railroad beds defined by further lines. The straight lines might form fluted, beautifully shaded proscenium stages that bring to mind old-time movie screens. Here we usually find the caballero aiming his pistol in one direction while pointing his reined-in steed in another, as if ready to wheel and dash to safety. This character is Ramirez's signature motif: the show begins with a posse of 19 caballero drawings, double- and triple-hung on a single wall. 
 Ramirez changed my art-world view 21 years ago when I was invited to write an essay for the first large, high-profile exhibition of his work, at the Moore College of Art and Design in Philadelphia. At that time the facts about his life were scant. His birth date was calculated as 1885 instead of 1895. He was thought to have migrated from Mexico around 1915, not 1925, to work on the railroads being built in Northern California, where he was hospitalized in the early 1930s and shortly thereafter found to have schizophrenia. He lived out his years in DeWitt State Hospital in Auburn, near Sacramento. (It was later discovered that the initial years of his confinement were at Stockton State Hospital.) 
 At DeWitt in 1948, a psychologist and artist of Finnish descent named Tarmo Pasto discovered Ramirez and began to save the large drawings he made on available bits of paper glued together with a paste made of bread or potatoes and saliva. In the first gallery at the Folk Art Museum, note the handle of a brown-paper shopping bag at the top edge of a tall, narrow landscape dominated by winding stairs interspersed with white churches and roadside chapels. 
 Dr. Pasto began bringing Ramirez art materials, and at one point lived on the grounds of DeWitt, a former Army camp, so he could observe Ramirez every day. In the early '50s he helped arrange four solo shows of Ramirez's work, most of them on college campuses, including Syracuse. In 1955 Dr. Pasto sent 10 drawings to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, but never heard back. A museum intern rediscovered them in the mid-1990s, and they were officially accessioned in 1997; all of them have been lent to this exhibition. 
 In 1968 the Chicago artist Jim Nutt met Dr. Pasto when both men were teaching at Sacramento State, and eventually persuaded him to sell most of his Ramirez drawings to Mr. Nutt and his art dealer, Phyllis Kind. Dr. Pasto wanted to send his son to medical school, and the drawings needed extensive conservation. He could not afford either.
 This show is in a sense a tribute to the dedication of Dr. Pasto, who died in 1986, shortly after the opening of the Moore College show, which he was too sick to see. But the Folk Art Museum exhibition and its catalog also benefited from the efforts of Victor M. Espinosa and Kristin E. Espinosa (until recently his wife), sociologists who specialize in the history of immigration. 
 Mr. Espinosa, who is Mexican, was disturbed by the art world's failure to research Ramirez's roots. He eventually discovered that Ramirez had a wife and four children in Mexico, a stream of descendants there and in California and a painful story of separation and isolation on all sides. The Espinosas' research, which extended over 15 years, enables this exhibition to align Ramirez's art with his life. 
 Among the facts the Espinosas unearthed: Ramirez drew in the margins of his letters home before he was incarcerated, which questions his inclusion in the art-of-the-insane category. The churches depicted in his drawings are recognizably those of the region he came from, the west-central province of Jalisco. There, it turns out, Ramirez owned a horse and was a skillful rider, which sharpens appreciation of the deft fusions of his caballeros with their mounts. As for the fluted post-and-lintel proscenium that frames them so glamorously, DeWitt had a movie theater, so the caballero is probably part Hollywood cowboy. 
 Ramirez's shaded lines segue effortlessly from abstract to descriptive and back again, just as his shapes are constantly being adjusted or assigned new roles. When shaded ellipses crown the prosceniums they suggest stage lights; in landscapes they read as cactuses. In one drawing, they are clustered together to form an enormous mountain, complete with a tunnel, that glows from within like a giant jukebox. 
 Rhythmic surfaces, plunging spaces and various modes of transportation (boats also shunt out of the tunnels, turning the roadways into canals) make visual the themes of distance and separation, isolation and longing. In one drawing, a tiny woman appears at the bottom of a long corridorlike path, while a small man is far above her, boxed in by lines. 
 Sometimes the prosceniums are inhabited by a man who has shed his sombrero and ammo belts and sits quietly at a table writing letters or perhaps waiting for inspiration to strike. In one of the show's best drawings, the sides of the stage resemble half-open shutters through which this man is seen against a dense black background. The velvety field is broken by a locomotive trundling over a little hillock, like an ever-present memory -- an emblem of the way Ramirez revisited his life through his art. 
 In still other images, the proscenium becomes a portable altarpiece inhabited by a fabulously garbed Madonna with beaming cabochon eyes, a movie-star smile and a spiked crown reminiscent of the Statue of Liberty's. She is a kind of phantom ur-wife. In three exceptionally large drawings, the Madonna breaks free of Ramirez's repeating lines and looms over us nearly life-size -- the only figure to be so honored and the only one to assert a full-fledged personality. 
 Outsider art is often conveniently artist-free; it has been made by someone who is, as the term implies, on the margins -- poor, uneducated, nonwhite, mentally ill, dead or otherwise inaccessible. All this makes for an aura of purity and innocence, but also a blankness. The work becomes a vessel, open to interpretation, in need of protection and available for a reverential possession and habitation that is almost a form of colonialism. This exhibition counters such possession by suggesting that Ramirez's art was, like all great art, typically site-specific, that is, firmly rooted in real experiences and memories that he reshaped and distilled according to his needs and talents. The more we know about this artist, the clearer it becomes that we are just beginning to fathom his extraordinary achievement. 

''Martin Ramirez'' continues through April 29 at the American Folk Art Museum, 45 West 53rd Street, Manhattan; (212) 265-1040. It will also be seen at the Milwaukee Art Museum, Oct. 6 through Jan. 6, 2008.

HEADLINE: Some Pieces of Church Silver Don't Go Gently To the Auction Block

BYLINE: By Wendy Moonan

 BODY:
It is often controversial when an American church sells its antique church silver, as reaction to a Christie's sale of early American silver shows once again. Its Jan. 18 auction included 14 pieces of church silver consigned by the First Church in Salem of Salem, Mass., all of which sold. 
 Typically, a pre-Revolutionary Puritan would donate a tankard, beaker or cup to a church to mark a special event or commemorate the death of a loved one. ''Donated silver was a way that individuals of some means could attempt to assure they would be remembered in their communities, since their names were usually prominently engraved on it,'' said Donald R. Friary, director emeritus of Historic Deerfield and an authority on New England church silver.
Church silver is particularly valuable if made by one of the country's first craftsmen, whether Paul Revere or someone less famous like Jeremiah Dummer, the first native-born American silversmith. Silver that valuable, however, must be insured and is often kept in a bank vault. 
 Churches that find owning such silver to be too onerous often lend it to museums; at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, for example, several exceptional pieces of church silver on view are loans. 
 ''The allure of church silver is obvious,'' said Jeanne Sloane, the head of the silver department at Christie's. ''It has unbroken provenance, and it tends to be in mint condition in terms of color, patina and in the crispness of its engraving, because it is so infrequently used. Usually, it has been sitting wrapped up in a vault.''
 Most church silver is domestic silver that has been ''regifted'' to the church. This includes beakers, cups, canns (a type of mug) and bowls.
 ''Domestic silver was used because Puritans were iconoclasts and they rejected the formality and rituals of the Catholic and Anglican churches,'' Mr. Friary said. ''The churches used the silver for baptisms and communion.''
 Part of its appeal is that it is not liturgical. ''This is secular silver,'' Ms. Sloane said. ''Part of the Puritan philosophy was not to use the trappings of the high church. They purposefully wanted people to feel there was no need for ritual objects. Church silver is an incredible source for classic forms of American colonial silver.''
 Established in 1629, the First Church in Salem is thought to be the oldest continuously operating Protestant congregation in the United States. In the early '70s, Richard D. Pierce wrote in The New England Quarterly that the First Church in Salem ''provided the model for all later Congregational churches in Puritan New England.''
 The Christie's sale of early American silver totaled $1.7 million against a presale estimate of $1.1 million to $1.8 million, and 94 percent of the 70 lots were sold. Although the First Church in Salem had consigned only 14 lots, 5 were in the top 10 sale prices. The total for the church silver was $787,800, against the presale estimate of $600,000 to $1 million. (The sales figures include the buyers' commissions, which are not reflected in the estimates.)
 Two lots will stay in Salem, as they were bought by the Peabody Essex Museum. The first, a 13-inch-high flagon made by John Andrew of Salem in 1769, cost the museum $102,000. Andrew, 22 when he made the flagon, went on to become Salem's most important 18th-century silversmith. The museum also spent $4,000 on a pair of canns made in 1805 by Ebenezer Moulton of Newburyport, Mass. One is inscribed ''Gift of Mrs. Johanna Ward.'' Mrs. Ward was the second wife of William Ward, a China trade merchant and master mariner. Their house in Salem is now a National Historic Landmark.
 Why did the church sell its silver?
 The Rev. Jeffrey Barz-Snell, the 31st pastor of the First Church in Salem, noted that the church was selling only 14 of its many silver objects. ''We have other items in our holdings, including a set of silver made by Paul Revere,'' he said in an interview.
 ''We had no dire need for cash,'' he continued. ''This was more of a proactive than reactive decision. We've almost doubled in size in the last eight years. There is a new attitude with regard to objects of historical significance: small institutions that don't have the resources to display objects in their possession can increase exposure to them by selling them.''
 In addition to the Peabody Essex purchase at Christie's, the Historical Society of Old Newbury/Cushing House Museum in Massachusetts bought a pair of the church's silver canns for $6,600. Rebecca Putnam of Salem, a descendant of the Endicotts, a prominent 17th-century Salem family, said she had ''mixed feelings'' about the sale.
 ''It was a hard decision for everyone,'' she said. ''I'm a longtime member of this church. This fall we had a special church meeting to discuss the sale and then voted for it unanimously. The economics made it necessary.''
 Michael J. Weller, owner of the San Francisco gallery Argentum-The Leopard's Head, was one of several dealers who attended the sale, although he did not buy any church silver. ''It's sad but it's inevitable that church silver will move on to the market,'' he said. ''Why should the church have to be the custodian of things that have not been used for 200 years?'' 
 Another auction attendee said that church silver was the pre-Revolutionary era's equivalent of a gift of stocks or bonds, but others object strenuously to that viewpoint. ''Church silver was given to dignify and honor the sacraments,'' Mr. Friary said. ''Such pieces were not investments. They are part of the collective memory of the community.''
 Bill Hosley, the director of the New Haven Museum and Historical Society, said, ''Church silver without question has sacred value, and not only in the religious sense. In many cases, these pieces are the single oldest things that have never left a town. They are literally the crown jewels.''
 Church silver, he continued, ''is important for its history, its art, its sense of place and the fact it is connected to a place in the most visual way.'' He added: ''The church in Salem has an unbroken continuity of more than 300 years that is almost unique. America's sense of obligation to anything that is not here and now is evaporating. What will it take to shock people into thinking there is something wrong with such sales?''
 Eric Shrubsole, at 95 the dean of America's silver dealers, said he didn't buy any church silver at Christie's. ''Personally, I don't think churches should sell their silver unless they have to,'' he said. ''You know, church silver is not so salable. It may have been domestic silver once, but it was still used in a church. A lot of my clients think it's against their religion to buy it.''


CORRECTION-DATE: January 31, 2007

 CORRECTION:
The Antiques column in Weekend on Friday, about an auction of silver that had been owned by the First Church in Salem, in Massachusetts, attributed an erroneous distinction to the church. The Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan, founded in 1628, is the oldest continuously operating Protestant congregation in the United States -- not the First Church in Salem, which was founded a year later.

HEADLINE: Eloquent Tongues but Anguished Irish Hearts 

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
Quite a few languages are spoken in Brian Friel's play ''Translations.'' There is a fair amount of Latin and Greek. Gaelic makes frequent appearances. And English is of course the play's official lingua franca.
 But you can leave your Berlitzes and your dead-language primers at home. A basic fluency in the workings of the human heart is all that's necessary to absorb the beauties of Mr. Friel's tender, sad and funny play about the difficulty of finding a home in the world, a person to share it with, and a name to call it by. 
''Translations'' has already had two major New York productions: Off Broadway in 1981 and on Broadway in 1995. Neither made much of a splash (it racked up just 25 performances in the more recent run), but ''Translations'' is anything but a splashy play. A quiet ensemble drama set in rural Ireland in 1833, it explores the troubled lives of a handful of characters struggling to adjust to the shifting dynamics of the world around them, which is undergoing quiet but radical change as the hard fist of British regulation seeks to impose itself on local tradition. Item No. 1 on Britain's agenda is mapping the island and translating the Gaelic place names into proper English, a process that has complicated political and cultural overtones for the Irish people that resonate to this day. 
 Mr. Friel's touch is delicate, his narrative artful but oblique, his lyrical voice steeped in the lusty idioms of rural Ireland. And then there's the Greek and Latin, intoned with joyous relish by men who like to chase it with a spot of hard liquor. ''Translations'' is, in short, the kind of play whose merits are likely to be lost in translation when exposed to the bright spotlight of Broadway. 
 And yet here it is on Broadway again, where it opened last night at the Biltmore Theater, courtesy of the Manhattan Theater Club (which also produced the Off Broadway production) and the McCarter Theater Center in Princeton, N.J. On this occasion it has wisely been entrusted to Garry Hynes, the brilliant Irish director known for her work with the fiery young playwright Martin McDonagh and the cycle of plays by J. M. Synge seen at the Lincoln Center Festival last summer. Ms. Hynes has in turn wisely entrusted Mr. Friel's challenging play to a stageful of little-known but hugely talented actors, creating an ensemble of an extraordinarily high caliber and consistency. In their hands -- on their tongues, I should say -- ''Translations'' is nothing short of glorious.
 Mind you, the play trades in a subtle glory, the kind that steals upon you furtively and without the help of advance PR. Last season a revival of Mr. Friel's ''Faith Healer'' opened on Broadway with rather more eclat, thanks to the high-profile presence of Ralph Fiennes in the title role. Ms. Hynes's cast boasts no stars of that renown, indeed no stars of the renown of Mr. Fiennes's estimable co-star, New York's beloved Cherry Jones. Nor does it involve the kind of tour de force monologues of which ''Faith Healer'' is composed, long, heart-searing speeches in which the characters seem to shed their skins paragraph by paragraph, until their souls stand naked and exposed before us.
 But this news may come as a relief to those who found ''Faith Healer'' a tough sit. ''Translations'' is ultimately as emotionally resonant as that play is -- and possibly just as heart-rending -- but its rich cast of colorful characters, its more pointed humor and its layered narrative make it more accessible. And nobody talks for more than two minutes at a time, which is the blink of an eye for an Irishman onstage.
 Why should they? All too often the words they speak cannot be understood by their listeners, even when their lives depend on them. In ''Translations'' Mr. Friel celebrates the sweet music of human speech, but the play also explores the seriocomic truth that language divides as easily as it unites, and sometimes fumbles and stalls just when we need it to soar. Greek or Latin, English or Gaelic, it is the only tool we have to forge emotional bonds, diffuse social conflict and translate inner passions into the practices of daily living. But how paltry it can seem as a medium of expression for all that fills our searching souls!
 Its eloquence and its limits are most movingly illustrated at the climax of the first act, when love comes upon two of the play's central characters with the speed of a runaway horse. The Irish dairymaid Maire (Susan Lynch) has long been betrothed to a local, but she yearns to escape the stultifying culture of Ballybeg (the fictional town where many of Mr. Friel's plays are set, here also known in Gaelic as Baile-Beag). Maire has recently announced a bold plan to move to America, but her eye has been caught by Lieutenant Yolland (Chandler Williams), the British soldier with no fixed place in the world who feels strangely at home among the wary but friendly locals. He has fallen in love with the land, the people and, poignantly, the language it is his job to make obsolete. 
 He speaks scarcely a word of Gaelic, and her English is limited to a few phrases and a useless bit of nonsense, courtesy of Aunt Mary: ''In Norfolk we besport ourselves around the maypole.'' As they each trot out their stray bits of each other's language, Mr. Williams and Ms. Lynch -- who both give enchanting performances -- make palpably clear the anguish and frustration of being unable to find even rough words to communicate inchoate feelings. As funny as it is touching, this beautifully played scene exposes the truth and the lie in the cliche that lovers need no common language to lay bare their hearts. 
 But almost everything in this production plays beautifully. The boozy give and take between Hugh (Niall Buggy), the schoolmaster who runs the humble rural schoolroom where the play takes place, and his prized old pupil Jimmy Jack (Dermot Crowley), is wonderfully funny, as they tease each other with etymological tests.
 The mixture of tension and affection between Hugh's sons is intimated with subtle force. Manus (David Costabile), an ardent nationalist, takes over the teaching chores when Hugh has taken a nip too much, at least until his heart is broken and he comes to feel an exile in his beloved home. Owen (Alan Cox) ran away to Dublin and has returned to Ballybeg as the hired assistant to the British soldiers in their mission, which he believes can help advance the cause of the locals, if they can be made to see it. (Now if only he could get his employers to call him by his right name, and not by the Anglicized Rowan.)
 Mr. Friel's characters are too complexly drawn -- and in this production played -- to line up neatly for or against the advent of a new language that may bring economic benefits but will speed the erosion of an entire culture. Hugh, that lover of dead tongues, makes the eloquent observation that words ''are not immortal,'' and ''a civilization can be imprisoned in a linguistic contour which no longer matches the landscape of fact.'' The mournful corollary Mr. Friel's play gently illuminates: People are far more mortal than the words they use, and a changing civilization may leave them adrift and alone. 
 You don't have to search hard for lamentable contemporary resonance in ''Translations.'' The attempt to impose a new civilization on a subjugated country by force looms as the background for the smaller personal dramas that take up much of the casually drawn narrative. And the plot turns on the disappearance of a soldier, possibly a casualty of Irish resentment of the occupying force.
 But the quiet urgency of Ms. Hynes's production derives more from the limning of the small strains tugging at the tight fabric of a community of individuals, each bedeviled by a private struggle. The ensemble is rounded out by Michael Fitzgerald as the impish young Doalty, who bridles more than most at the presence of the British; Geraldine Hughes as the feisty Bridget; Graeme Malcolm as the stern, condescending redcoat Captain Lancey; and Morgan Hallett as Sarah, a disturbed young woman who has trouble communicating at all, and can barely say her name. 
 Ms. Hynes's production also benefits from evocative work from some of her regular collaborators, the set and costume designer Francis O'Connor and the lighting designer Davy Cunningham. Mr. Cunningham's painterly lighting is particularly integral to the nuanced contouring of the production. As the narrative darkens in the last act, the triangle of light that formed a bright spot in the dimness of the barn is shut out, as hope for a promising end to almost everyone's trouble begins to dim.
 A despondent and tipsy Jimmy Jack and Hugh are alone in the dusk when Maire enters and asks, ''Master, what does the English word 'always' mean?'' 
 He gives her the answer in Latin, but adds: ''It's not a word I'd start with. It's a silly word, girl.'' 
 In fact, in the darkening gloom of the barn, in the final moments of Mr. Friel's haunting but hugely rewarding play, it sounds like the saddest word in the English language. Or any language.

* 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raul Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

* 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

'LES MISERABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)

'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

'THE VERTICAL HOUR' David Hare's soggy consideration of the Anglo-American cultural divide stars Julianne Moore (representing the Americans) and Bill Nighy (leading the British), directed by Sam Mendes. The Yanks don't stand a chance. With his irresistibly mannered performance as a laconic doctor, Mr. Nighy mops the floor with Ms. Moore. Actually, he mops the floor with Mr. Hare's play (2:20). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

'AS YET THOU ART YOUNG AND RASH' An abstract collage of shards of feeling built out of Euripides' ''Suppliant Women,'' this meditation on grief and the death of children in senseless war offers plenty of parallels to current society without doing anything so obvious as explicitly referring to them. The five-member cast, led by three beautiful middle-aged women, is strong; the director, David Herskovits, has helped them shape an evocative piece that might be too nonliteral for some tastes, but is both moving and distinctive (1:10). The Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 352-3101. (Anne Midgette)

'DUTCHMAN' A revival of the poet Amiri Baraka's screed on race and American values, 43 years after its Greenwich Village debut, aims for all the fire and might of a Malcolm X speech but none of the rhetorical elegance. It shouts so loudly that you can't hear a thing (1:00). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village (212) 239-6200. (Ginia Bellafante)

'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time. The excellent duo Jeremy Shamos and Christopher Fitzgerald make the pitch (2:05). The Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)

'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men and two women perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)

'MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS' This musical is too big for its stage, but the young turn-of-the-last-century sweethearts have great chemistry, and there are four terrific songs (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Anita Gates)

'NO GREAT SOCIETY' The brainy experimentalists of Elevator Repair Service provide a madcap and almost dreamlike re-enactment of a 1968 episode of William F. Buckley's ''Firing Line,'' which features Mr. Buckley squaring off with Jack Kerouac (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)

'THE SCENE' Theresa Rebeck's latest is a sharp-witted, sharp-elbowed comedy about the savage economies of sex and show business in Manhattan. Tony Shalhoub plays an out-of-work actor, Charlie, happily married -- but not really -- to Patricia Heaton's frazzled chat show booker. Enter the femme fatale Clea, played by the gifted Anna Camp, and goodbye, Charlie (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Isherwood)

* 'TOYS IN THE ATTIC' Austin Pendleton's fine revival of Lillian Hellman's last play faithfully attacks the corrosive attachments of family. What good is a family, and thus a society, the play implicitly asks, that can only look in the mirror? (2:30) Pearl Theater, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Bellafante)

'VICTORIA MARTIN: MATH TEAM QUEEN' Must all stage teenagers speak in that exaggerated surfer-dude style in which ''awesome'' and ''totally'' make up about 50 percent of any conversation? Yes, apparently they must, from the evidence presented in this thin comedy, which is about a high school girl who finds herself on the all-male math team. The playwright, Kathryn Walat, seems to have been trying to grab the coattails of a certain spelling-bee-related show. She missed (2:00). The Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger)

* 'THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE' David Mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted Harley Granville Barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of Victorian finance. An excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THE WOMEN OF TRACHIS' In Kate Ryan's wonderfully perceptive adaptation, Sophocles' rarely produced tragedy about the death of the hero Heracles and his wife, Deianira, has terrific contemporary traction. Alice Reagan's superbly cast and infectiously energetic production is fun, intelligent and eminently worth seeing. (1:00). The Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 352-3101. (Jonathan Kalb)

Off Off Broadway

* 'THE DIRTY TALK' Kevin Cristaldi and Sidney Williams are just great in this two-hander by Michael Puzzo about strangers stranded in a hunting cabin. How they came to be there is hilariously doled out by Mr. Puzzo, along with some thoughts about identity, the Internet and the liar in all of us. Padraic Lillis, the director, has the two actors in perfect sync (1:20). Center Stage, 41 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger)

'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance (1:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)

Long-Running Shows

'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 254 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

Last Chance

* 'A BEAUTIFUL VIEW' The Canadian playwright and director Daniel MacIvor mines two funny, subdued and entirely affecting performances from Caroline Gillis and Tracy Wright as women whose enduring friendship may be more (1:20). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante)

'THE BROTHERS SIZE' Loosely based on West African myths, this impressive and emotionally absorbing debut by Tarrell Alvin McCraney portrays two battling brothers in Louisiana (1:30). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman)

* 'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)

'DEAD SET #3' Themes of apocalypse and trauma echo throughout the Big Art Group's flashy and shallow new entry in the ever-expanding genre of high-tech theater (1:15). The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, Ext. 11; closes tomorrow. (Zinoman)

'FLUKE' A meditative collage of enigmatic riffs on ''Moby-Dick'' presented by the rambunctious experimental company Radiohole (1:30). Collapsable Hole, 146 Metropolitan Avenue, at Berry Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 388-2251; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman)

'GET YOUR WAR ON' Based on the absurdist comic strip of David Rees, this sardonic history lesson of the past six years will delight Bush-haters (1:10). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman)

'INVINCIBLE SUMMER' The performance artist Mike Daisey's monologue is a showcase of facile observation. During his first summer in New York six years ago, he discovers that it's hot and that people are generally much nicer than their comportment on subways would lead you to believe (1:30). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante)

'REGRETS ONLY' Old acquaintance comes under siege in Paul Rudnick's chiffon-thin comedy about the varieties of love and marriage. But no one who sees this latest offering from one of the funniest quipmeisters alive is going to doubt that Christine Baranski is a one-liner's best friend (2:00). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212; closes on Sunday. (Brantley)

'TWO TRAINS RUNNING' Directed by Lou Bellamy, a rough-edged revival of August Wilson's 1992 play about the stark economics of life and death for African-Americans, set in a dying diner in Pittsburgh in the late 1960s. The pace drags in this production, but it remains a bracing reminder of Mr. Wilson's singular talent for making cold, hard numbers sing hot, molten blues (3:40). Signature Theater at Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Brantley)

* 'THE VIETNAMIZATION OF NEW JERSEY (AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY)' A revival of Christopher Durang's satire of war, family life and Bicentennial fever, on the 30th anniversary of its debut at the Yale Repertory Theater, swishes along at the speed of a Nascar race. Blanche Baker is a gem as an out-of-it 1970s matron who just can't dust off the Eisenhower era. The Beckett Theater, on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Bellafante)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

'ALPHA DOG' (R, 117 minutes) Based on a true Southern California crime, Nick Cassavetes's entertaining exploitation flick features a lot of attractive, talented young actors shimmying across the screen while embodying the collective parental nightmare. Do you know where your children are? Well, in this film they're getting busy, chilling out, smoking blunts and chugging coolers faster than a toothless wino. Oh, and committing murder. (Manohla Dargis)

'ALONE WITH HER' (No rating, 79 minutes) In this voyeuristic thriller, a young man named Doug (Colin Hanks) becomes smitten with a coffee shop waitress named Amy (Ana Claudia Talancon) and tries to insinuate himself into her life through high-tech means, videotaping her routines from afar, then bugging her apartment. In the end, though, the characters seem less archetypal than vague, and aside from its sophisticated presentation, the film doesn't differ all that much from its template -- the late 1980s/early '90s Fill-in-the-Blanks-From-Hell movies that followed ''Fatal Attraction,'' many of whose elements are revived almost verbatim. (Matt Zoller Seitz)

'ARTHUR AND THE INVISIBLES' (PG, 94 minutes) Luc Besson serves up a hybrid of live actors and computer-generated figures to tell a not-endearing-enough story about a boy (Freddie Highmore) who shrinks to microscopic size to find some gems and his missing grandfather. Lots of famous names (Madonna, Robert De Niro, David Bowie, Snoop Dogg) lend their voices to the computerized part of the movie, but only briefly near the end does everything click. (Neil Genzlinger)

'BABEL' (R, 143 minutes, in English, Spanish, Japanese, Berber, Arabic and sign language) This hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked, not quite simultaneous stories set on three different continents, with dialogue in several languages. The themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. Almost. (A. O. Scott)

'BLOOD DIAMOND' (R, 138 minutes) The makers of this foolish thriller about illegal diamond trafficking in Africa, starring an excellent Leonardo DiCaprio, want you to know there may be blood on your hands, specifically your wedding finger. Too bad they haven't thought through what it means to turn human misery into entertainment. (Dargis)

* 'CHILDREN OF MEN' (R, 100 minutes) The end is nigh in this superbly directed political thriller by Alfonso Cuaron about a nervously plausible future. Based on the P. D. James book, the film stars an excellent Clive Owen and features equally sterling support from the actors Michael Caine, Danny Huston and Chiwetel Ejiofior, among others, as well as the great cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. (Dargis)

* 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis)

'DREAMGIRLS' (PG-13, 131 minutes) The Broadway musical arrives on the screen, capably directed by Bill Condon, ardently acted and sung by Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy, Beyonce Knowles and (especially) Jennifer Hudson, but undone by mediocre and anachronistic songs. (Scott)

* 'GOD GREW TIRED OF US' (PG, 90 minutes) This sober, uplifting documentary, which won two major awards at last year's Sundance Film Festival, follows the resettlement in the United States of three Sudanese young men uprooted as children by the civil war. Handsomely photographed, and inspirational but not cloyingly so, it is the rare contemporary documentary that doesn't leave a residue of cynicism and outrage. (Stephen Holden)

'THE HITCHER' (R, 90 minutes) Like the 1986 cult favorite of the same title, this remake is a crash-and-burn action horror film with intellectual pretensions. The overachieving Irish character actor Sean Bean plays the Hitcher as a philosophical sadist, toying with people who didn't get the memo saying that God is dead, but the movie is too shallow to embellish that vision. The merger of mystical solemnity and chain-reaction slapstick suggests a Road Runner cartoon directed by John Woo. (Seitz)

'THE ITALIAN' (PG-13, 99 minutes, in Russian) This dark fairy tale from Russia pulls you into a richly atmospheric, persuasively inhabited world teeming with young foundlings and pathos, and upended by one remarkable little boy. (Dargis)

'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king, while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis)

* 'LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA' (R, 141 minutes, in Japanese) Another masterwork from Clint Eastwood's astonishing late period, and one of the best war movies ever. Ken Watanabe is especially fine as the general commanding Japanese troops in the doomed defense of the island of Iwo Jima. (Scott)

* 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott)

* 'Little Miss Sunshine' (R, 101 minutes) A bittersweet comedy of dysfunction that takes place at the terminus of the American dream. The excellent cast includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano and that national treasure, Alan Arkin. (Dargis)

* 'MAFIOSO' (No rating, 99 minutes, in Italian) This 1962 film, revived by Rialto Pictures, is a rambunctious, astonishing blend of farce, thriller and social satire. The director, Alberto Lattuada, follows an up-and-coming Fiat manager (Alberto Sordi) on a visit from Milan to his native village in Sicily. His homecoming is full of surprises -- painful for him, altogether delightful for the audience. (Scott)

'NOTES ON A SCANDAL' (R, 92 minutes) Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett play a misogynistic game of cat and mouse from which no one emerges unscathed, including the audience. Adapted by Patrick Marber from a novel by Zoe Heller and directed by Richard Eyre. (Dargis)

* 'PAN'S LABYRINTH' (R, 119 minutes, in Spanish) Guillermo del Toro's tale of a young girl's ordeal in post-Civil-War fascist Spain is either a fairy tale in the guise of a political allegory or vice versa. In either case it is a moving, enchanting, strange and humane example of popular art at its very best. (Scott)

'THE PAINTED VEIL' (PG-13, 125 minutes) Nicely directed by John Curran, this version of the W. Somerset Maugham novel draws you in by turning a distaff bildungsroman into a fine romance with Naomi Watts and Edward Norton. (Dargis)

'PRIMEVAL' (R, 94 minutes) A giant crocodile named Gustave terrorizes Western journalists in war-torn Burundi. Not as much fun as it might have been, but not as terrible either. (Scott)

'THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) How you respond to this fairy tale in realist drag may depend on whether you find Will Smith's performances so overwhelmingly winning that you buy the idea that poverty is a function of bad luck and bad choices, and success the result of heroic toil and dreams. (Dargis)

* 'THE QUEEN' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, and starring a magnificent Helen Mirren in the title role, ''The Queen'' pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. (Dargis)

* 'REGULAR LOVERS' (No rating, 175 minutes, in French) Philippe Garrel's tender portrait of late-1960s French youth stars the filmmaker's son, Louis Garrel, as a 20-year-old Parisian struggling through the fires of revolutionary promise and its smoldering remains. Magnificent. (Dargis)

'STOMP THE YARD' (PG-13, 109 minutes) Brotherhood is powerful in this sometimes compelling, sometimes complacent movie about stepping and African-American fraternity life at an Atlanta institution called Truth University. D J (Columbus Short), a street-style dancer, needs to find his place in a university ruled by Gammas and Thetas and stepping. (Rachel Saltz)

'TEARS OF THE BLACK TIGER' (No rating, 113 minutes, in Thai) A western weepie from Thailand, filmed in garish color. In spite of the relentless genre pastiche, it has a charming sincerity. (Scott)

'VENUS' (R, 91 minutes) A modest, diverting, touching tale of a young woman who attracts the interest -- avuncular and also erotic -- of an aging actor, played with effortless aplomb by the great Peter O'Toole. (Scott)

* 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Almodovar, with Penelope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott)

Film Series

CRITICS CHOICE: GREAT DOCUMENTARIES (Sunday) A series of significant documentaries introduced by members of the New York Film Critics Circle continues with Ross McElwee's family history ''Bright Leaves'' (2003), presented by Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly, and Werner Herzog's ''Grizzly Man,'' a 2005 study of a man who mistakenly (and tragically) believed that he understood bears, presented by Kyle Smith of The New York Post. (Through Feb. 25.) Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us; $10. (Dave Kehr)

I AM NOT A WAR PHOTOGRAPHER: FILMS OF LYNNE SACHS (Tonight through Sunday) Three programs of nontraditional documentaries by a filmmaker who employs subjective perspectives and abstract visual effects to examine contemporary conflicts. Tonight ''Which Way Is East: Notebooks from Vietnam'' (1994) is doubled with ''Investigation of a Flame: The Catonsville Nine'' (2001). Tomorrow brings a program of four short films and ''Invisible,'' a 30-minute work-in-progress. Sunday's screening is ''States of Unbelonging,'' a new video feature about Revital Ohayon, an Israeli filmmaker killed in 2002 in a terrorist attack near the West Bank. Anthology Film Archives, 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org; $8. (Kehr)

STORM WARNINGS: THE FILMS OF BAHMAN FARMANARA (Tonight through Thursday) This retrospective focuses on the work of one of the few Iranian directors to work before and after the revolution. His ''Prince Ehtejab'' (1974), screening tonight, tomorrow and Monday, is a Visconti-like historical epic about the end of the Qajar Dynasty, centered on the last prince of the line, who withdraws from political conflict into the private reality of his palace. An international success, it led to Mr. Farmanara's appointment as the head of the Iranian Film Development Company, but his 1979 work ''Tall Shadows in the Wind'' (tonight, Sunday and Wednesday) was banned by the shah's shaky government, and Mr. Farmanara spent the next several years in Canada, eventually returning to the new Iran, where he encountered a different form of censorship. After having 10 scripts rejected by the government censors, he was able to film in 2000 the gently satiric, self-reflective ''Smell of Camphor, Fragrance of Jasmine'' (tomorrow, Tuesday and Wednesday), a hit at the New York Film Festival that marked Mr. Farmanara's comeback. The series also includes two recent films, ''A Little Kiss'' from 2005 (tonight through Wednesday) and ''A House Built on Water'' from 2002 (Sunday, Monday and Wednesday). Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 975-5600, filmlinc.org; $10. (Kehr)

Pop

Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

THE BOOKS (Tomorrow) Nick Zammuto and Paul de Jong of the Books make beguiling electronic collages out of disembodied vocal samples, a few plucks from a banjo or another string instrument, and unclassifiable noises that fade in and out like traffic. Part of the pleasure of listening is trying to figure out just why all this chaos works so wonderfully and wittily. With Jack Rose and Essie Jain. At 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $20. (Ben Sisario)

* DAVID BYRNE (Thursday) He may have set a still unsurpassed standard with Talking Heads for art-pop that is as arty as it is truly poppy, but Mr. Byrne's influence reaches much wider than the rock world, into theater, film and, especially, world music.

RHYS CHATHAM (Tomorrow) A force in the fruitful meeting of drone minimalism with loud guitar-rock in the 1970s, Mr. Chatham remains a lover of big, electrified din. For his current tour he revisits a 1970s piece, ''Guitar Trio,'' with members of his band augmented by a phalanx of guitarists, including Thurston Moore, Lee Ranaldo and Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, an important inheritor of Mr. Chatham's style.

DEERHOOF (Tonight) More than a decade into its career, this avant-garde rock band from San Francisco still has plenty of surprises.

With Busdriver and Proton Proton. At 9, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $16. (Sisario)

* LINCOLN CENTER'S AMERICAN SONGBOOK (Wednesday and Thursday) Now in its ninth season, this series has greatly expanded from its origins as a home for the midcentury pantheon of Harold Arlen, Richard Rodgers and the like. Wednesday features an acoustic show by Josh Ritter, a 30-year-old songwriter whose guileless, boy-next-door voice belies the depth and ambition of his songs, whether he is confessing a simple crush or following his thoughts on a long, Whitmanesque incantation. On Thursday Howard Fishman, who has long been rummaging through the attic of American song, pays tribute to Bob Dylan and the Band's monumental ''Basement Tapes.''

* MAUDE MAGGART (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday) In her must-see cabaret show, ''Good Girl/Bad Girl,'' this 31-year-old singer, a knockout in a red dress, uses an astutely chosen selection of songs to explore conflicting female sexual stereotypes from the perspective of a young woman who understands but rejects abject surrender to a man. High point: Joan Baez's ''Love Song to a Stranger.''

NORTHSIX (Tonight and Wednesday night) Another rock club bites the dust, but this time there's a twist: the gentrification is happening in Brooklyn, not Manhattan, and the gentrifier is another rock club. Northsix was a pioneer when it opened in Williamsburg six years ago, and has been an important incubator for the Brooklyn scene; it will close after this week's shows for renovations by its new owners, the proprietors of the Bowery Ballroom and the Mercury Lounge, and reopen later this year as the Music Hall of Williamsburg. Tonight features a solo set by Ted Leo, a veteran pop-punk bandleader who is one of the best songwriters in the game, and on Wednesday is Radio 4, which emulates the frantic punk-funk of early-'80s British bands like Gang of Four and Public Image Limited. At 9, 66 North Sixth Street, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $15; $13 in advance for Wednesday's show. (Sisario)

PAOLO NUTINI (Wednesday) A Scottish heartthrob who just turned 20, Mr. Nutini has already conquered the British charts with snappy, vaguely racy tunes like ''Jenny Don't Be Hasty,'' about an affair with an, ahem, older woman. (She's 23, he's 18.) He begins a coordinated American invasion next week, with the release of his debut album, ''These Streets'' (Atlantic), and appearances on ''Late Night With Conan O'Brien'' and the ''Today'' show. With Musiq Soulchild. At 7 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario)

O'DEATH, T K WEBB (Wednesday and Thursday) O'Death draws from the starkness and spiritual purity of Appalachian folk, the menace of punk and the rowdy theatricality of Tom Waits, jumbling sacred and profane. A Brooklynite by way of rural Missouri, the singer and guitarist T K Webb plays ragged, stark Delta blues about desolation and dying young, surrounding his creaky tenor with a halo of eerie reverb. Wednesday At 7 p.m., Europa, 98 Meserole Avenue, at Manhattan Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 383-5723, europaclub.com; $8.

* JONATHAN RICHMAN (Thursday) No rock star delivers intimacy like Mr. Richman, the eternally youthful and eternally nebbishy granddaddy of New Wave and indie rock. He fell in love with the acoustic guitar decades ago, and backed up by the tiniest of bands -- a drummer playing a snare and little more -- sings of simple pleasures lost and found with tiptoe dynamics. He begins a four-night stand, kicking off the Knitting Factory's 20th-anniversary celebration. At 8 p.m., 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $20 in advance, $23 at the door. (Sisario)

SUNBURNED HAND OF THE MAN (Sunday and Monday) Improvisation means lots of things in rock, but to this Massachusetts collective, which has been churning out dozens of albums and homemade recordings since the mid-'90s, it means spacey, meandering drones that seem like endless psychedelic trips.

Sunday at 3 p.m., Issue Project Room, 400 Carroll Street, between Bond and Nevins Streets, Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, (718) 330-0313, issueprojectroom.org; $15.

* M. WARD (Tonight) Ubiquitous as a sideman for indie-rock royalty -- Cat Power, Bright Eyes, Beth Orton, Jenny Lewis -- M. Ward stepped into the fore last year with an extraordinary solo album, ''Post-War'' (Merge). Over scratchy, portentous acoustic blues, he sings of malaise and loss in a dry, spectral voice: ''He was a good man but now he's gone,'' goes a deadpan requiem for a soldier. With Portastatic. At 8, Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824, the-townhall-nyc.org; $25. (Sisario)

Opera

* 'IL SIGNOR BRUSCHINO' (Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday) Mention Rossini, and most people come up with ''The Barber of Seville,'' but this work -- in which the composer honed the comic gift that came to the fore in ''Barber'' and other opera buffe -- hasn't been staged in New York since 1933.

Robin Guarino directs the company's performance of this frothy piece of fun.

* 'LA TRAVIATA' (Tomorrow and Thursday) The soprano Hei-Kyung Hong gives a beautifully sung and deeply felt portrayal of Violetta in the Met revival of Verdi's ''Traviata,'' in Franco Zeffirelli's extravagant 1998 production. The other news is the promising performance of an artist who, like Ms. Hong, is from South Korea: the tenor Wookyung Kim, singing Alfredo in his Met debut season. As a Verdi tenor, Mr. Kim is a little green, but he has an appealing and robust voice, and at his best, sings with ardor and flair. The baritone Charles Taylor, who was ill on opening night, sings Germont. Carlo Rizzi conducts. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out tomorrow, $15 to $175 on Thursday. (Anthony Tommasini)

* 'DECASIA' (Tonight and tomorrow night) The composer Michael Gordon and the filmmaker Bill Morrison have collaborated on this enveloping multimedia work. Mr. Morrison's contribution is a fast-cut montage of antique films, in which bubbles and other signs of decay create patterns as crucial to the work as the images of cowboys, flappers, factory workers, dancers, parachutists and the exotic Middle East and North Africa. Mr. Gordon's powerful 65-minute score -- played by an orchestra deployed in the balconies -- evolves from a faint, metallic rattle to a barrage of percussion, electric guitars, brass choirs, woodwinds and strings. At 7 and 9:30, Orensanz Center for the Arts, 172 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 352-3101; $25. (Kozinn)

DAVID FINCKEL AND WU HAN (Tuesday) This cello-piano, husband-wife duo are customarily to be found on the Upper West Side running the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, but on Tuesday they cross town for a recital at the Morgan Library & Museum's spiffy new recital hall. The program includes Schubert's heavenly ''Arpeggione'' Sonata. At 7:30 p.m., 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org; $45. (Holland)

* FOCUS FESTIVAL (Tonight, and Monday through Thursday) The Juilliard School's annual new-music festival turns its sights this year on Hungarian music since Bartok. A few of the composers -- Gyorgy Kurtag, Gyorgy Ligeti, Peter Eotvos and Istvan Marta, for example -- are already forceful presences in the world of chamber music. But the festival's longtime director, Joel Cohen, invariably turns up a number of worthy newcomers. At 8, Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 155 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406, juilliard.edu; free, but tickets are required for tonight's concert. (Kozinn)

SUSAN GRAHAM (Monday) An eloquent interpreter of a large repertory, from German Classicism to contemporary American music, this American mezzo-soprano is devoting her recital at Carnegie Hall to French art song, with works by Bizet, Franck, Faure, Lalo, Gounod, Debussy, Chausson, Duparc, Ravel, Messiaen, Honegger, Poulenc and others. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $25 to $80. (Kozinn)

HAMBURG SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight and tomorrow night) The Hamburg Symphony, founded in 1957, is not to be confused with the Hamburg Philharmonic or the Norddeutscher Rundfunk Symphony Orchestra, based in the same city, which will come to Carnegie Hall in March. This one, led by Andrey Boreyko, is embarking on its first United States tour and will make its New York debut tonight in a program of Mendelssohn's ''Hebrides'' Overture, Brahms's Second Symphony and Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto, with the soloist Robert McDuffie. Tomorrow the Brahms and Tchaikovsky are on the program at the Tilles Center. Tonight at 8, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $40. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Tilles Center for the Performing Arts, at the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University, Brookville, N.Y., (516) 299-3100, tillescenter.org; $48 to $90. (Midgette)

ISRAEL PHILHARMONIC (Tuesday and Thursday) This orchestra, founded in 1936 and originally named the Palestine Orchestra, begins its 70th-anniversary celebrations with a United States tour. On Tuesday Lorin Maazel, who was named an honorary life member of the orchestra in 1985, will conduct the program, which features Beethoven's Violin Concerto with the stellar violinist Maxim Vengerov as soloist, Beethoven's ''Leonore'' Overture No. 3 and Mussorgsky's ''Pictures at an Exhibition.'' On Thursday Zubin Mehta, the Philharmonic's music director, leads a program including Berlioz's ''Symphonie Fantastique'' and Mahler's Ruckert Lieder with Thomas Hampson, a baritone. Tuesday at 8 p.m., Thursday at 7 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $45 to $125. (Vivien Schweitzer)

* MOSCOW SOLOISTS (Sunday) The violist and conductor Yuri Bashmet will lead his Moscow Soloists in orchestral arrangements of chamber works. Mahler arranged Schubert's ''Death and the Maiden'' Quartet and Beethoven's String Quartet in F minor (Op. 95), the so-called ''Quartetto Serioso,'' to attract a larger audience for these pieces, then considered esoteric. The program also includes Britten's ''Lachrymae,'' based on a song by John Dowland (which Britten initially wrote for piano and viola and later arranged for orchestra), and Schnittke's ''Monologue.'' At 2 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $23 to $75. (Schweitzer)

* 'MOZART AT 251' (Tomorrow) For years, Uri Caine, a jazz player and musical polyglot, has intelligently deconstructed music by classical composers with a blend that might include jazz, bossa nova, klezmer and tango. Having already reimagined Bach's ''Goldberg'' Variations and Beethoven's ''Diabelli'' Variations, he now turns to Mozart. The program opens with a ''pure'' reading of Mozart's Divertimento in E flat (K. 563), by the cellist Matt Haimovitz, the violinist Jonathan Crow and the violist Douglas McNabney. Then Mr. Haimovitz will join Mr. Caine, the clarinetist Chris Speed, the bassist Drew Gress and others for a renegade Mozartian jam session. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, ekcc.org; $30 in advance, $35 at the door. (Schweitzer)

NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight and tomorrow night) The Italian maestro Riccardo Muti has also fared well with the New York Philharmonic. His first of two programs last week was predictably distinguished. This weekend he conducts an unusual all-Italian program, beginning with the Piano Concerto No. 2 by Giuseppe Martucci (1856-1909), a conductor, pianist and composer much admired in his day. This 1886 concerto was taken up by noted conductors, including Mahler and Toscanini. Gerhard Oppitz will be the soloist. Mr. Muti will also conduct ''Feste Romane'' by Ottorino Respighi, who was a composition student of Martucci's, and the ballet music from Verdi's ''Macbeth.'' On Thursday Esa-Pekka Salonen arrives in his dual roles as conductor and composer. His program includes the premiere of his Piano Concerto, a Philharmonic commission, with Yefim Bronfman as soloist. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $28 to $96. (Tommasini)

OBERLIN CONSERVATORY SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight) Robert Spano, the energetic music director of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, leads the Oberlin Conservatory Symphony Orchestra in a concert that includes Jennifer Higdon's ''Blue Cathedral.'' Mr. Spano has championed this appealing work, which is performed more regularly than most new pieces, and recorded it in 2004 with the Atlanta Symphony. The program also includes Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra and Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 25 in C (K. 503), with the pianist Pedja Muzijevic. At 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $20; $5 for students. (Schweitzer)

GARRICK OHLSSON (Sunday) This past summer the American pianist Garrick Ohlsson, an exciting virtuoso as well as an artist of integrity, presented acclaimed cycles of the complete 32 Beethoven piano sonatas at the Ravinia and Tanglewood festivals. Beginning Sunday, he performs the first of three Beethoven sonata programs at Lincoln Center. The opener offers two well-known sonatas, the ''Pathetique'' and the ''Appassionata,'' along with two inventive, bracing early sonatas, No. 6 in F and No. 11 in B flat. The latter is a score the composer was especially pleased with. At 2 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $50. (Tommasini)

ST. LAWRENCE STRING QUARTET (Monday) This energetic Canadian quartet helped open the Baryshnikov Arts Center last season and returns to that loftlike space to play works including Schumann's Quartet Op. 41, No. 2, and Shostakovich's searing Quartet No. 8. At 7 p.m., 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212) 218-7540, baryshnikovdancefoundation.org; free, but reservations are required. (Kozinn)

* JOHN SCOTT (Sunday) Having just started a cycle of the complete organ works of Buxtehude, Mr. Scott, the organist and director of music at St. Thomas Church, focuses on Ligeti for a day. He opens the Miller Theater's two-part ''Remembering Ligeti'' mini-festival with a concert offering the rare and exciting chance to hear his complete organ works. Alongside Ligeti's ''Ricercare: Omaggio a Frescobaldi'' (1953), Two Etudes (1967-69) and ''Volumina'' (1962-66), Mr. Scott will perform Jonathan Harvey's ''Fantasia'' (1991), Toccata for organ and tape (1980) and ''Laus Deo'' (1969). At 5:15 p.m., Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; free. (Schweitzer)

* 'THE SONG CONTINUES' (Tonight) The Marilyn Horne Foundation winds up its annual mini-festival dedicated to the art of song with a gala concert called ''Gypsy in My Soul,'' featuring Ms. Horne as its host and a quartet of singers and a guest artist who's more Sicilian than Gypsy, the tenor Marcello Giordani, as performers. The wide-ranging program includes the world premieres of two pieces the foundation commissioned from Gabriela Lena Frank, as well as songs by Brahms, Vaughn Williams, Dvorak and Turina. At 7:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $37 and $45. (Midgette)

VOX VOCAL ENSEMBLE (Tomorrow) George Steel has been exploring Tudor church music for the last several years, both in his programming for the Miller Theater and on the podium of the Vox Vocal Ensemble, his virtuoso choir. In the latest installment of that exploration, sponsored by Miller but performed in the acoustically more amenable Church of St. Mary the Virgin, Mr. Steel leads his Vox group in settings of parts of the Lamentations of Jeremiah by Byrd, Tallis, White, Mundy and Parsley. At 8 p.m., 145 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $35; $21 for students. (Kozinn)

* TRAJAL HARRELL (Tonight through Sunday) Mr. Harrell has become known for authoritatively oddball choreography and visual design. His latest work is ''Showpony,'' in which he examines vogueing, postmodernism and the fashion spectacle and muses on his own choice to be part of a performing culture. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, Sunday at 7:30 p.m. (followed by a discussion with the artists). Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194, danspaceproject.org; $15 or T.D.F. voucher. (Dunning)

At 7:30, Mark Morris Dance Center, 3 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place (across the street from the Brooklyn Academy of Music), Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (212) 352-3101, mmdg.org; sold out. (Dunning)

At 8 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, worldmusicinstitute.org; $27; $15 for students. (Dunning)

* NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) The company is getting the jump on a spring-season celebration of Lincoln Kirstein with ''Tribute to Kirstein'' tomorrow and Wednesday nights. It was Kirstein who made City Ballet happen by coaxing George Balanchine to the United States. The program includes ''Episodes,'' ''Vienna Waltzes'' and a piece by Christopher d'Amboise. Other programs for the week include ''Tradition and Innovation'' (''Mozartiana,'' ''In Vento'' and Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 2) tonight; ''Stravinsky and Balanchine: an Eternal Partnership'' (''Agon,'' ''Monumentum pro Gesualdo,'' ''Movements for Piano and Orchestra,'' ''Duo Concertant'' and ''Symphony in Three Movements'') on Sunday; and ''Essential Balanchine'' (''Square Dance,'' ''Liebeslieder Walzer'' and ''Stars and Stripes'') on Tuesday and Thursday.

(Dunning)

LAURA PETERSON CHOREOGRAPHY (Tonight and tomorrow night) Ms. Peterson, who has danced with everyone from Risa Jaroslow to Poppo and the GoGo Boys, describes her new ''I Love Dan Flavin'' as a tongue-in-cheek futuristic dance with fluorescent light and pioneering techno music. At 8, Dixon Place, 258 Bowery, between Houston and Prince Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 219-0736, Ext. 11, dixonplace.org; $15 or T.D.F. vouchers; $12 for students and 65+. (Dunning)

RAGAMALA MUSIC AND DANCE THEATER (Tomorrow) The company will perform ''From Temple to Theater,'' which includes both traditional Bharata Natyam dances and contemporary choreography.

* TAMAR ROGOFF'S 'EDITH & JENNY' (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Rogoff's piece alludes to the childhood friendship of her daughter, Ariel Rogoff Flavin, and Claire Danes, who trained in dance before becoming a film actress, as well as roles each played as 11-year-olds in films by Jeff Mueller. (Through Feb. 4.) Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 5 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 5 p.m., Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 477-5288, ps122.org; $20; $15 for students and 65+. (Dunning)

* STATE BALLET THEATER OF RUSSIA (Tonight) The great Russian ballet dancer Vladimir Vasiliev has choreographed a new production of ''Cinderella,'' set to the familiar Prokofiev score.

Art

Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.

Art Fairs

53RD ANNUAL WINTER ANTIQUES SHOW, through Sunday. Mature is the word in the trade for fairs like the Winter Antiques Show, though time-honored, even venerable, would be closer to the mark. The show has been around forever (well, since 1955). It delivers substantial, sometimes spectacular, retail. Dealers and clients alike return, like swallows to Capistrano, year after year. So if solid tradition, rather than Basel-Miami-style blowouts, is what you want in a fair, this one's for you. Seventh Regiment Armory, 643 Park Avenue, at 67th Street, (718) 292-7392. (Holland Cotter)

Museums

* American Museum of Natural History: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples -- larded with fascinating facts and tales -- ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Roberta Smith)

* GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'Spanish Painting from El Greco to Picasso, TIME, TRUTH, AND HISTORY' through March 28. This show is carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Velazquezes and Zurbarans and El Grecos and Riberas and Dalis and Picassos, many famous, many not. I can't tell you how often I was stopped by a picture so good or unexpected that it made me do a double take. Velazquez's painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Michael Kimmelman)

INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'HENRI CARTIER-BRESSON'S SCRAPBOOK: PHOTOGRAPHS, 1932-46,' through April 29. This show has more than 300 of the prints Henri Cartier-Bresson glued into an album and toted to New York for curators at the Museum of Modern Art to cull. Captured by the Nazis, he had been presumed dead when the Modern planned his retrospective. Then he turned up alive -- the ''posthumous'' exhibition opened, with him in attendance, in 1947. The current exhibition reconstructs as best as possible the original layout of the scrapbook. It's an eye-straining affair, but it surveys the revolutionary work he shot in Spain, Italy, Mexico, Britain and France. Here are the familiar, and, more interestingly, some less familiar, shots of crowds in Hyde Park in London at George VI's coronation, of picnickers on the banks of the Marne in France and whores in Valencia, Spain. His taste for uncanny detail linked him to Surrealism and Surrealist wit, but unlike many Surrealists, he remained committed to human values. Boys mug at his camera. Prostitutes swan. Their gazes equalize them with us. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Kimmelman)

INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'MARTIN MUNKACSI: THINK WHILE YOU SHOOT!' through April 29. Munkacsi, who inspired Cartier-Bresson, was, by contrast, self-taught, a creature of his own devising. This is the most complete retrospective, with a thick catalog (not too well researched) and dozens of vintage prints from the 1920s through the early '60s. He favored scenes of daily life, absorbing avant-garde ideas about odd angles and abstract compositions. Munkacsi was a stylist, and he made catchy images the only way he knew how, in a modernist mode, which, being an opportunistic form, could serve any master. (See above.) (Kimmelman)

* THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920S,' through Feb. 19. The 100 paintings and drawings on display here are by 10 artists, including George Grosz, Christian Schad, and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic's porous worlds reassemble; we look into the faces of museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)

* THE MET: 'ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,' through Sept. 3. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92) portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht Durer; and Bonnie Seeman's fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and Continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Grace Glueck)

* MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'DOUG AITKEN: SLEEPWALKERS,' through Feb. 12. Produced in concert with Creative Time Inc., this monumental video projection, screened nightly (from 5 to 10) on three sides of the sleek exterior of the newly expanded Museum of Modern Art, consists of short, silent and rather too glamorous meditations on the working nights of five emblematic New Yorkers played somnolently by musicians and actors who include Donald Sutherland and Tilda Swinton. But Mr. Aitken's astute and restless cinematic ambition and commanding sense of scale are in full force, especially in the more abstract portions of the piece, resulting in a fitting ode to the city that never sleeps and that the camera has always loved. (212) 708-9400, daily. (Smith)

WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'KIKI SMITH: A GATHERING, 1980-2005,' through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float here: men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum's black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith's art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed on its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Cotter)

Galleries: Chelsea

* ROBERT IRWIN: 'WHO'S AFRAID OF RED, YELLOW AND BLUE 3' In the past, Robert Irwin has paid homage to Joseph Albers. Now he makes a bow to a different kind of perceptual magician, Barnett Newman, turning Newman's 1966-70 paintings titled ''Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue'' into a kind of self-reflective architecture. Optical illusionism has long been Mr. Irwin's calling card, but here he has achieved it by bare-bones means, offering quieting visual fare for an overstimulated world. PaceWildenstein, 545 West 22nd Street, (212) 989-4258, pacewildenstein.com, through Feb. 3 . (Cotter)

* PORTIA MUNSON: GREEN On the floor, all manner of discarded plastic objects and cheap toys coalesce into a dense scatter piece that commemorates the fall of nature, the rise of suburbia and the varied tonalities of indigenous if artificial green. On the walls, exquisite mille-fleur-like color photographs made on a scanner redirect set-up photography back toward the experimental nature prints and photogenic drawings of the 19th century. P.P.O.W., 555 West 25th Street, (212) 647-1043, through Feb. 3. (Smith)

Last Chance

* BRONX MUSEUM OF THE ARTS: 'TROPICALIA: A REVOLUTION IN BRAZILIAN CULTURE,' Tropicalia, or Tropicalism, wasn't a style or a movement as much as an atmosphere, a rush of youthful, cosmopolitan, liberating optimism that broke over Brazil in the late 1960s like a sun shower, and soaked into everything -- art, music, film, theater and architecture -- until a military government clamped down. This show is an attempt to recapture the moment's fugitive spirit, and with the presence of artists like Helio Oiticica and Lygia Clark, the architect Lina Bo Bardi, and musicians like Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso, it comes close. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter)

BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'TIGERS OF WRATH: WATERCOLORS BY WALTON FORD,' This show assembles more than 50 of Mr. Ford's large-scale watercolors of birds, animals, snakes and lushly exotic flora, produced since the early '90s. They frequently depict moments in which a wild animal encounters human culture, often to its detriment. Sometimes the threat is overt, as in pictures of animals and birds roped or wounded; in other images the sense is that some horrible violence has occurred or is about to. Though they're wonderfully lucid and dramatic, the moralizing of these images can become a little tedious. But this popular artist imparts an environmental message, couched in a lament for the irreversible loss that occurs when a sense of ethics does not govern the treatment of animals. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Benjamin Genocchio)

* 'THE CONSTANT POSSIBILITY OF ERASURE' Organized by Donna Harkavy and Gracie Mansion, this excellent group show is at once witty and elegaic, exploring transience as an existential reality and as a conceptual ploy in late-20th-century art. Robert Rauschenberg's 1953 ''Erased de Kooning'' is an important reference point, present through Mike Bidlo's painstaking recreation. Joseph Beuys, Gary Simmons and Christian Xarec all have chalk pieces on blackboards, while Allan Kaprow preferred drawing, and simultaneously erasing, chalk pictures on the sidewalks or streets. Joanne Stamerra Hendricks uses erasers as a medium, and Jim Dingilian uses smoke. Dorsky Gallery Curatorial Projects, 11-03 45th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-6317; closes on Monday. (Cotter)

* 'THE EARLY WORK OF WILLIAM KING' The spindly figure sculptures by William King that we know best have arms like I-beams, legs like stilts, and heads that are barely there. But his early work looks quite different, and that's the revelation of this absorbing show, assembled by the art critic Sanford Schwartz at Alexandre Gallery. Much of the material is hand-size or toy-size and comes in a variety of forms and media, and most of it is being exhibited for the first time. Alexandre Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 755-2828; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)

* FRICK COLLECTION: 'MASTERPIECES OF EUROPEAN PAINTING FROM THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART,' This exhibition transcends the usual traveling masterpieces-from genre, with room to spare. The 14 paintings include almost always outstanding works by household names like Velazquez, Caravaggio, El Greco, Turner and Poussin, as well as Annibale Carracci, Francisco de Zurbaran and Andrea del Sarto. But the astute installation makes the most of all this star power, letting the works talk among themselves to a remarkable degree, illuminating their likenesses, differences and collective progress. Extending John Berger's famous title, the show might be called ''Ways of Seeing Paintings.'' 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700; closes on Sunday. (Smith)

THE MET: 'AMERICANS IN PARIS: 1860-1900,' The Americanization of the world may be a done deal now, but not so long ago the United States was a buyer rather than a seller of cultural information, and France was a major source between the Civil War and World War I. That's the story told in this exhibition that goes a little way toward reversing the fall season's trend of big, surveyish shows made up of splashy objects and bland ideas. In this case, the basic ideas, though undeveloped, are inherently interesting, and the art, with some notable exceptions, is conservative and staid. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter)

* MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MANET AND THE EXECUTION OF MAXIMILIAN,' This gripping show reminds us of Modernism's mutinous, myth-scouring origins. And it does so by bringing one of art's great path-cutters, Edouard Manet, onto the scene, wry, politically infuriated and painting like Lucifer. There's not a lot of him here -- eight paintings, three on a single theme: the death by firing squad of the Austrian archduke Ferdinand Maximilian in Mexico in 1867. But it's enough. Manet's images, surrounded by a riveting selection of prints and photographs, are electrifying. (212) 708-9400, www.moma.org; closes on Monday. (Cotter)

NEWARK MUSEUM, THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'MASTERS OF AMERICAN COMICS' Organized by the Hammer Museum and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, where it made a splash, this show has come east, cut in size and split between the far-flung Newark and Jewish museums, in which it looks cramped. Art Spiegelman, one of the masters who helped instigate the exhibition, felt so aggrieved by the circumstances that at nearly the 11th hour he pulled his work. This was a pity, for the obvious reasons, and also because the Jewish Museum scrambled to fill the gap he left by appending a half-baked display of superhero comic artists. Still, the show shouldn't be missed. It spotlights artists like Chris Ware and Gary Panter, amazing talents and endearing in the tradition of those shy, gifted kids who drew endlessly in their roomswhen other kids wouldn't play with them, dreaming about someday telling the world, ''I told you so.'' Newark Museum, 49 Washington Street, (973) 596-6550, newarkmuseum.org; and the Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Kimmelman)

P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'MUSIC IS A BETTER NOISE' An involvement of some sort with music is the main criterion for this disparate but engaging show. The artist-musicians on hand include Jutta Koether, the rapper Rammellzee, Don Van Vliet (a k a Captain Beefheart) and Devendra Banhart. Chuck Naney contributes a beautiful sound-light installation in the stairwell, and Rodney Graham tries his hand at music video. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org; closes on Monday. (Smith)

RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART: 'I SEE NO STRANGER: EARLY SIKH ART AND DEVOTION,' Sikhism is the world's fifth-largest organized religion, but how many Westerners know that it was conceived as universalist in scope and radically egalitarian socially? Or that its holy book, far from being a catalog of sectarian dos and don'ts, is a bouquet of poetic songs blending the fragrances of Hindu ragas, Muslim hymns, and Punjabi folk tunes? This is precisely the information delivered by this small and beautiful show. Vivid and concentrated, it presents, mostly through miniature paintings, a kind of Sikh self-portrait, the image of a history shaped by hard work, pluralism and mystical transport, as well as by militancy. 150 West 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org; closes on Monday. (Cotter)

THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'PICASSO AND AMERICAN ART,' Despite the glamorous pictures in it, this is one of those dull affairs incubated in the world of academe: a walk-through slide show that states the obvious. Picasso's ''Woman in White,'' a picture of heavenly arrogance, hangs between Arshile Gorky's ''Artist and His Mother'' and de Kooning's ''Standing Man,'' terrific paintings too. We are meant to register the plain insinuation of Picasso's neo-Classicism, then move on. The show ends not with the lively question of Picasso's impact on young artists today but with a virtual retrospective of the later, Picasso-inspired works by Jasper Johns. In picture after picture, Johns buries allusions to the great Spaniard, aspiring presumably to Picasso's own late meditations on Velazquez. Except that even when he was old and running out of steam, Picasso still had joie de vivre. Johns doesn't so much enthrone Picasso as repeatedly entomb him; closes on Sunday. (See above.)

HEADLINE: Colleges Regroup After Voters Ban Race Preferences

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
With Michigan's new ban on affirmative action going into effect, and similar ballot initiatives looming in other states, many public universities are scrambling to find race-blind ways to attract more blacks and Hispanics. 
 At Wayne State University Law School in Detroit, a new admissions policy, without mentioning race, allows officials to consider factors like living on an Indian reservation or in mostly black Detroit, or overcoming discrimination or prejudice.
Others are using many different approaches, like working with mostly minority high schools, using minority students as recruiters, and offering summer prep programs for promising students from struggling high schools. Ohio State University, for example, has started a magnet high school with a focus on math and science, to help prepare potential applicants, and sends educators into poor and low-performing middle and elementary schools to encourage children, and their parents, to start planning for college.
 Officials across the country have a sense of urgency about the issue in part because Ward Connerly, the black California businessman behind such initiatives in California and Michigan, is planning a kind of Super Tuesday next fall, with ballot initiatives against racial preferences in several states. He is researching possible campaigns in Arizona, Colorado, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming, and expects to announce next month which states he has chosen. 
 Ann Korschgen, vice provost at the University of Missouri, said in a recent interview, ''Just this morning, we had a conversation along the line of how we would continue to ensure diversity at our campus if we could not consider race.'' 
 The issue is already heating up in Colorado. This month, two Republican representatives in Colorado asked the state to examine the University of Colorado's spending on diversity, after a libertarian group questioned the expenditures.
 Mr. Connerly said that a decade ago, when California passed its ban, Proposition 209, he thought the state was ahead of its time, but that now, he believes ''the country is poised to make a decision about race, about what its place in American life is going to be -- and I really believe the popular vote may be the way to achieve that.'' 
 Both defenders and opponents of affirmative action say the lesson of last fall's campaign in Michigan -- where Proposition 2, banning race and gender preferences in public education, employment and contracting, passed by 58 percent to 42 percent despite strong opposition from government, business, labor, education and religious leaders -- is that such initiatives can succeed almost anywhere. 
 ''Certain things become popular as state initiatives, like the ban on gay marriages, and restrictions on affirmative action could become one of those things,'' said Terry Hartle, senior vice president for government and public affairs at the American Council on Education.
 If so, he said, private universities, with their wide discretion in admissions and financial aid, could have a competitive advantage regarding diversity, reshaping the landscape of higher education. 
 ''Private universities can do whatever they want, consistent with federal law and the Supreme Court,'' Mr. Hartle said. ''Where minority students have a choice between selective public universities that cannot use affirmative action, and selective private universities with strong affirmative action programs, the private universities may seem like the more hospitable places, which would give them an advantage in drawing a diverse student body.'' 
 To many educators, that would be a troubling turnabout.
 ''You'd think public universities are charged with special responsibility for ensuring access, but it could come to be exactly the opposite, if there are a lot of these state initiatives,'' said Evan Caminker, the dean of the University of Michigan Law School, adding, ''in terms of public values, it's a big step backward.''
 Mr. Connerly is unbothered: If black and Hispanic students are rare at selective universities, the solution is better academic preparation, not special treatment in admissions. ''Every individual should have the same opportunity to compete,'' he said. ''I don't worry about the outcomes.''
 Legally, affirmative action has been a moving target. In 2003, the Supreme Court ruled in cases involving the University of Michigan that race could be one of many factors in admissions, although admissions offices could not give extra points to minority candidates. Many colleges nationwide then moved to ''holistic'' review, considering applicants' ethnicity, but not awarding a set number of points. In states that could face a ballot initiative campaign, though, that standard could fall. 
 Nationwide, after 30 years of debate, and litigation, over affirmative action, universities have made strikingly little progress toward racially representative student bodies. And recently, with growing awareness that affluent students are vastly overrepresented at selective colleges, the longstanding focus on racial diversity has been joined by a growing concern about economic diversity. 
 Currently, four states with highly ranked public universities -- California, Florida, Michigan and Washington -- forbid racial preferences, either because of ballot propositions or decisions by elected officials. 
 Texas banned affirmative action for seven years. The University of Texas resumed consideration of race after the 2003 United States Supreme Court ruling. ''We need every tool we can get,'' concluded Dr. Bruce Walker, the university's director of admissions.
 In California and Texas, the first two states to ban racial preferences, underrepresented minorities at the flagship universities declined -- even though both states, and Florida, adopted plans giving a percentage of top high school graduates guaranteed admission to state universities. 
 In Texas, students admitted through the Top 10 percent plan swamped the flagship Austin campus. But the plan, now being rethought by the Legislature, never brought in many minority students. Last fall, with both race-conscious admissions and the Top 10 plan, blacks made up an all-time high of 5 percent of the freshman class, and Hispanics 19 percent.
 A decade after the California ban, only 2 percent of this year's freshmen at the University of California, Los Angeles, are black: a 30-year low. Hispanic representation at U.C.L.A. has dropped, too. At Berkeley, the number of blacks in the freshman class plunged by half the year after the ban, and the number of Hispanics nearly as much. 
 Systemwide, blacks make up only 3 percent of U.C. freshmen, although about 7 percent of the state's high school graduates are black. Most top black students choose private institutions over state campuses. Over all, of the top third of all students offered admission to the University of California class of 2005, most enrolled and only 19 percent went instead to selective private colleges. But among blacks in that group, 51 percent chose selective private colleges. Meanwhile, up the coast, Stanford University is enrolling more underrepresented minority students. Among this year's freshmen, 11 percent are African-American, up from 8 percent in 1995; Hispanic enrollment has risen, too. 
 ''Folks look for a place that's comfortable,'' said Richard Shaw, Stanford's admissions dean. ''They want a sense that there's kids like them at the institution.'' 
 The University of Michigan, with other state institutions, tried to win a delay of the ban so it would not hit in the middle of this year's admissions cycle.But the courts rejected this effort, so officials have stopped considering race and gender as factors in admissions, and worry that next year's entering class will be less diverse. Many officials worry that they will lose top minority candidates to selective private universities. 
 ''We know from colleagues in Texas and California that if we can't take race into account, we're at a competitive disadvantage,'' said Julie Peterson, a spokeswoman for the University of Michigan, where two-thirds of the applicants are from out of state. 
 Since most of Michigan is overwhelmingly white, said Mary Sue Coleman, the university's president, a plan guaranteeing admission to a percentage of top high school graduates would have little impact, and nothing short of affirmative action will maintain the university's racial diversity. 
 ''Of course, you want to look at family income, and being the first in the family to attend college and those kinds of factors, of course we do that, but it doesn't get us to a racially diverse student body,'' Dr. Coleman said. 
 At the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, a program guaranteeing that low-income students can graduate debt-free helped to increase the percentage of blacks in the freshman class to 12 percent, and to increase both economic diversity and the enrollment of underrepresented minority students. Other states have started similar programs. 
 In Detroit, Wayne State University Law School recently adopted a new admissions policy. Jonathan Weinberg, the professor assigned last year to draft a contingency policy, looked at other states with race-blind admissions and found that instead of race, they look to ''a set of broader diversity concerns that go to socioeconomic status.'' 
 Last month, the faculty adopted his policy, eliminating any mention of race, but broadening the factors the admissions office may consider. Those include being the first in the family to go to college or graduate school; having overcome substantial obstacles, including prejudice and discrimination; being multilingual; and residence abroad, in Detroit or on an Indian reservation.
 Frank Wu, the law school's dean, said Wayne State's effort to comply with the law could bring a legal challenge. 
 ''There's a new fight building,'' Mr. Wu said, ''and that's going to be whether the mere fact that you're striving for diversity means you're somehow trying to get around the ban and find proxies, or pretexts, for race, and that that's impermissible. It's ironic, but in some quarters our effort to adopt a new policy to comply with Prop 2 has been interpreted as an effort to circumvent it.''
 Roger Clegg, president of the Council for Equal Opportunity, which opposes racial preferences, said policies like Wayne State's do raise questions.
 ''I have a real problem when schools adopt what on their face are race-neutral criteria, if they are doing so to reach a predetermined racial and ethnic goal,'' Mr. Clegg said. ''Both in law and in common sense, the motivation matters.'' 
 At Ohio State University, where admissions are increasingly selective, officials are looking for a long-term answer. ''When we saw what was coming down the road, we started looking to other models, but no other model results in as much diversity,'' said Mabel Freeman, assistant vice president at Ohio State. ''The only long-term solution is to do better in the pipeline and make sure all kids get the best education possible, K-12.''

HEADLINE: When Money Talks, Do Voters Lose?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Death Knell May Be Near for Public Election Funds'' (front page, Jan. 23), about candidates' decisions to forgo public financing in presidential elections:
 Public financing for federal elections was intended to reduce the role of money, not voters. Candidates who abandon that system are repudiating the principle of ''one person one vote'' in favor of ''one dollar one vote.''
 If we have come to the point where the presidency goes to the highest bidder, like a prized antique, it isn't just public financing for elections for which the ''death knell'' is near. Democracy itself will be on its last legs.

Eric B. Lipps
Staten Island, Jan. 23, 2007

To the Editor: 
 In your article about public campaign financing, Charles E. M. Kolb, president of the Committee for Economic Development, says, ''It may take a collapse of the system in order to build it back up.''
 But when the chairman of the Federal Election Commission says presidential candidates must raise $100 million nearly a year before an election in order to be a contender, the system already has collapsed and transformed our government from democracy to plutocracy.
 We've never really had public financing of any federal elections -- merely public supplements to elections controlled by private money. Piecemeal reforms have failed to reverse the justified cynicism of citizens toward elections. 
 It's time to make our most important public processes serve citizens by demanding full public campaign financing and amending the Constitution to negate the Supreme Court's absurd doctrine that buying political influence is protected ''free speech.''

Jeff Milchen
Director, ReclaimDemocracy.org
Bozeman, Mont., Jan. 24, 2007

To the Editor:
 The best hope for the public campaign financing is that leading presidential candidates pledge to upgrade the antiquated system if elected and then walk away, fast, from the current model, which is incapable of producing the 2008 winner. 
 A redesigned system should dramatically expand the leverage of small-dollar donors within the system and substantially increase the amount of public money available to qualified presidential candidates. 
 Under full public financing, known as ''Clean Elections,'' the gathered power of ordinary citizens puts candidates who give up large private donations on a level playing field with opponents financed by deep-pocketed individuals and interests. 
 With the biggest corruption scandal to hit Washington since Watergate still in the news, it is vital that we end our dependence on vested-interest financing.

Nick Nyhart
President and C.E.O.
Public Campaign
Washington, Jan. 23, 2007

To the Editor:
 Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, argues that the low percentage of taxpayers using the $3 checkoff on their federal tax forms demonstrates disapproval of public financing. This is misleading.
 In 2006, Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research conducted a poll, commissioned by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, where I am counsel, to test the reasons taxpayers did or did not check off the election fund box. Two-thirds of those polled lacked basic knowledge about the fund. 
 Many taxpayers were born after it was established post-Watergate, and the last major public education effort on the fund was in 1993. Unsurprisingly, taxpayers who lack familiarity with the fund are less inclined to participate. 
 The fund can be revived through legislative fixes that make it better suited to current election conditions and by a public education campaign about its purpose.

Ciara Torres-Spelliscy
New York, Jan. 23, 2007

To the Editor:
 We should make all election campaign financing illegal, have the government purchase equal TV time for all declared candidates, and broadcast each candidate describing his or her ideas for solutions and priorities. 
 Let's start using logic and intelligence for decision making. Let's start hearing about ideas that are real and new.
 The present system of media purchase with special-interest dollars shuts out many of the most qualified and most ethical candidates.
 Of the people, by the people, for the people -- anyone remember that?

HEADLINE: Salvadoran's Death in Iraq Leaves His Mother Fuming

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

DATELINE: SAN SALVADOR, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
From her hillside home in western El Salvador, Herminia Ramos sobbed and sobbed the other day as she recalled her fallen son.
 In some ways, Ms. Ramos is like the thousands of other Salvadoran mothers who lost children in the 12-year civil war here that ended in 1992. But Ms. Ramos' grief is fresher than the rest, the result of a more recent conflict.
 El Salvador is the only country in Latin America with troops in Iraq, a point of pride for President Antonio Saca, who is a gung-ho supporter of the Bush administration, but extremely unpopular among the war-weary population.
 ''Our army should be at home,'' said Ms. Ramos, 48, fuming against a war she said she did not know the first thing about until smartly dressed officers showed up at her home in 2004 to inform her that her son, Natividad, had become the first Salvadoran to die in combat in Iraq. 
 The United States has been debating for years the reasons for the war in Iraq and whether the invasion and continued presence of troops there are justified. Was there reason to believe that weapons of mass destruction were there? Was Saddam Hussein's despotism enough reason to topple him? Did links between Iraq and Al Qaeda exist?
 El Salvador, which has been involved in the war since August 2003 and currently has 380 troops in Iraq, has been having its own discussion. Ms. Ramos, for one, can find no justification. Those other mothers can say that their children fell while fighting for their country, either for the Marxist guerrilla movement or the American-backed government. But Natividad Ramos, 20, died in Najaf in a clash with armed followers of the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr.
 ''I got through our war without losing any family,'' she said of El Salvador's civil war, which took an estimated 75,000 lives. ''And now my son was sent to fight in someone else's war.''
 Officially, Mr. Saca's government says the deployment of what is called the Cuscatlan Battalion is a way to thank the world for its assistance in helping stop the civil war here a decade and a half ago. Salvadoran officials say their country is an active part of the United Nations and believe in the world body's effort to rebuild Iraq.
 They stress the humanitarian dimension to their soldiers' work there, like building roads, health clinics and schools, while acknowledging the dangers that have resulted in the deaths of five soldiers and the wounding of about two dozen more. They proudly note that El Salvador's army, once linked to right-wing death squads, has been purged of its bad elements and is now one of the most respected institutions in the country.
 But those arguments have not been enough to sway local critics. A newspaper opinion poll put opposition to El Salvador's involvement in Iraq at 81 percent. In 2004, masked protesters briefly took over the country's main cathedral and demanded an immediate withdrawal of troops. For the most part, though, Salvadorans have been preoccupied with local concerns, such as their economic woes and the insecurity that causes strains in their own country.
 Every time a new contingent is sent, though, the legislature splits along party lines, with the right-wing government and its allies backing the plan and the leftist opposition voting no.
 ''It's the gringos' war,'' said one critic, Olga Serrano, who is executive secretary of a group of wounded veterans from the war in the 1980s. ''What are we doing over there?''
 Behind the scenes, government officials sell the plan differently. They point to all the benefits they believe they are receiving from Washington as a result of their assistance, even as the Bush administration insists that it is not giving El Salvador special favors for its troop presence.
 ''We're doing this to help the Iraqis but we're also doing this for our own people,'' said Carlos Rolando Herrarte Rivas, a legislator from the center-right Christian Democratic Party who went to Iraq in December as part of a government delegation to visit the troops. ''The president can't say that but that's why we're doing it.''
 Mr. Herrarte, a retired colonel, said the Bush administration had been treating Salvadoran migrants well despite strong anti-immigrant sentiment in the United States. He pointed to the Bush administration's decision in January 2005 to grant a one-year extension of temporary protected status for about 250,000 Salvadorans living in the United States. The status gives them a reprieve from deportation because of natural disasters or political turmoil at home.
 Mr. Herrarte also cited the $461 million in antipoverty funds that El Salvador was awarded last fall by the Millennium Challenge Corporation, an American foreign aid agency, as being another outgrowth of the war effort.
 ''When I go to my town, they yell,'' he said of his vociferous antiwar constituents. ''They want to know why we are there. They say, 'Get them out.' Then I start explaining how this is helping our people in the United States.''
 To say that El Salvador and the United States are joined at the hip is an understatement. Nearly a third of native-born Salvadorans are living in the United States, including relatives of President Saca, Defense Minister Otto Alejandro Romero Orellana and many other decision makers. Those Salvadorans abroad send home about $2.5 billion every year, which represents about 17 percent of the country's gross domestic product.
 Former President Francisco Guillermo Flores Perez, who was considered especially close to the White House, sent the first troops to Iraq in 2003. The issue came up in the presidential campaign the following year when Mr. Saca, a pro-American businessman, defeated Schafik Handal, a former Communist guerrilla.
 Mr. Handal had pledged to withdraw Salvador's 380 soldiers from Iraq immediately. Mr. Saca said a victory by Mr. Handal ran the risk of cutting the flow of money from Salvadoran migrants in the United States.
 Mr. Saca has continued sending troops even though the governing Nationalist Republican Alliance party, known as Arena, lacks a majority in the legislature. Mr. Saca's party has had to strike deals with two smaller parties to come up with the 43-vote simple majority.
 The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, an outgrowth of the guerrilla movement that fought the government in the 1980s, has consistently voted against the war.
 Critics of decision to send Salvadoran troops point out that Nicaragua, Honduras and Dominican Republic continued to have strong relationships with Washington, even though they pulled their troops out of Iraq in the spring of 2004.
 They point out that Hondurans and Nicaraguans also have the same preferred immigration status that Salvadorans do. Honduras and Nicaragua also received Millennium grants, albeit smaller ones than El Salvador's, critics note.
 Salvadoran officials are not speaking of an increase in troops to quell the Iraqi insurgency. But when they are asked how long the country plans to involve itself in the war, they do adopt President Bush's language: as long as it takes.

HEADLINE: Hollywood, the Sequel: Less Shabby, More Chic

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 25 

 BODY:
For decades, tourists deposited themselves at one of the most famous intersections in America -- Hollywood and Vine -- and looked around in puzzlement, wondering what exactly they were supposed to be seeing. 
 The surrounding Hollywood neighborhood had fallen into such miserable disrepair that its main consumers were people seeking drugs or tattoos. Many entertainment companies were long gone. Crime was rampant, incomes were depressed, and people who labored in the industry that gave the neighborhood its fame were nowhere to be found.
But in a few weeks, work will begin on a luxury hotel and a collection of $1 million condominiums at Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street, joining a skyline of condos and trendy new hamburger and sushi outposts rising among the mid-20th-century architecture. 
 That Los Angeles neighborhood, which had been promised a comeback for a good 40 years, seems to have finally achieved it, a cross-continent bookend to the transformation of Times Square in New York, with one key difference: Los Angeles residents, not just tourists, have found reasons to go there and live there. 
 ''Hollywood is a testament to people's desire to live in places with some sense of history and a sense of place,'' said David Malmuth, a developer who brought the Kodak Theater, home to the Academy Awards, to Hollywood and also oversaw the renovation of the New Amsterdam Theater in Times Square.
 In the last several years alone, more than $2 billion has been spent on projects in the neighborhood, including mixed-use retail and apartment complexes and new schools and museums. Many urban planning experts see something other than a confluence of low interest rates, a tight housing market and developers with a gleam in their eyes. 
 The Hollywood renaissance represents a potential future of much more of Los Angeles, a sprawling, horizontal city where vertical, dense and at least somewhat walkable neighborhoods with public transportation are increasingly in vogue. 
 ''It is a comeback that shows there is some demand for a more urban way of life,'' said Anastasia Loukaitou-Sideris, chairwoman of the Department of Urban Planning at the University of California, Los Angeles. ''It is a comeback that is based not only on entertainment and commercial spaces, but mixed use and housing, at the same time the city is building its rail service.''
 Among the many celebrated neighborhoods of Los Angeles, the 25 square miles of Hollywood have long stood out. 
 Outside of the Walk of Fame, the circular Capitol Records building and other historically sumptuous landmarks, the neighborhood is a richly diverse community of 222,694 people -- from the wealthy residents peering out at the world from the hills above Hollywood proper, to the middle- and lower-income inhabitants of the streets below. 
 Like a great old house, the bones of Hollywood remained mostly untouched in its down years by large-scale development and the more unfortunate inclinations of contemporary urban planners. Yet years of disinvestment in the area, led by the fleeing of the movie studios, took its toll.
 ''It just needed a huge surge of capital investment to bring those buildings back,'' said Christi Van Cleve, a partner at Roschen Van Cleve Architects, which has restored several buildings in the neighborhood. 
 Proponents of the new Hollywood have a data point they love to trot out: in the 1980s, the average stay on Hollywood Boulevard was a depressing 28 minutes, or about the time it can take to find a parking spot in the thriving nearby city of West Hollywood. People slept in the streets, and a drug trade prospered among boarded up historic sites. 
 By the early 1990s, three major projects proposed for the area had fallen apart. Subway construction was just beginning, leaving a sinkhole in the street and traffic nightmares all around. The Los Angeles riots and an economic recession had done little to brighten the hopes of Hollywood, and private equity wanted no part of it.
 Then, in 1993, ''Jackie Goldberg came along,'' said Leron Gubler, president of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, referring to the Los Angeles city councilwoman representing Hollywood at the time who went on to become a state legislator. ''She said, 'Nothing is going to happen here until we address some of the basic problems,' '' Mr. Gubler said.
 The Community Redevelopment Agency, a city-sponsored revitalization effort, had begun to pay for street improvements, fixing up facades on buildings. Next came a police foot patrol paid for largely by the transit authority.
 In 1995, Ms. Goldberg and the chamber staff decided to create a business improvement district along six blocks on Hollywood Boulevard. The next year, the district was established with $600,000 raised through business owners, who had their trepidations. They had heard the ''Hollywood is back'' storyline before.
 ''It was a challenge,'' said Mr. Gubler, who at one point nearly stalked the owner of the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel to get the last signature on a petition needed to get it all done. The hotel -- founded in 1927 by a syndicate of Hollywood stars like Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, and home to the first Academy Awards -- had as much at stake as any luminary. 
 By 1997, thanks to armed guards, crime in the area had dropped over 50 percent. ''That is when we began to see the light at the end of the tunnel,'' Mr. Gubler said.
 At the same time, Mr. Malmuth, the developer, took an interest in Hollywood. He and others focused on the corner of Hollywood and Highland, a major intersection ripe for commercial development. Mr. Malmuth joined a development firm that committed to a mixed-use project that would become the home of the Academy Awards ceremony.
 The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which had been sniffing around for new options for the Oscars, embraced the idea of a live theater surrounded by retailers and other tenants. 
 ''When I took this into the board of governors, I thought it was going to be a hard sell,'' said Bruce Davis, the executive director of the academy. ''At that time, Hollywood definitely had a seedy reputation.''
 The Hollywood and Highland project, first proposed at a cost of $150 million in 1998, came to fruition in 2001 at a cost closer to $600 million. Slowly, a steady stream of interest among other commercial developers followed, and nightlife and restaurants -- the dual forces of urban renewal -- came too, as did the final piece, new housing. 
 Now cruising east on Hollywood Boulevard toward a sea of glittering lights, the sleazy motels and tattoo parlors begin to give way to Starbucks and a Virgin Megastore, and the hopelessly chic Geisha House, a giant emporium of oyster shooters and sashimi ''igloo style,'' and the sort of people who spend a good chunk of their week in Pilates classes.
 In a nod to the corner's glamorous past, there will be an 11-story W Hotel at Hollywood and Vine. It was there that the famous Brown Derby Restaurant opened in 1929, and for years remained the watering hole for studio executives and ''the talent'' streaming out of nearby film studios -- more Spago than Spago today. 
 The restaurant fell to seed like much the neighborhood in the 1970s, and closed in 1985. In a depressing coda, most of the building burned in 1987, and it was demolished in 1994. The new project at the intersection, expected to open in 2009, will include the 300-room W Hotel and a 14-story luxury condominium tower. Across the street, a converted office building has sold out its luxury condos, including one to Charlize Theron, said Eric Garcetti, the Los Angeles City Council speaker whose district includes Hollywood.
 ''People are seeing stars here again,'' said Mr. Garcetti, who helped pass an ordinance to increase housing in the area. Developers creating apartment and condo complexes with city money are required to set aside 20 percent of the units for low-income residents, and a few sites offer more, like one along two blocks at Hollywood and Western, in colorful block buildings that look like a Mondrian painting. 
 But displacement of the residents who stood by Hollywood at its worst -- the seamy underbelly of neighborhood renewal -- is no doubt happening.
 ''The more they put up big flashy apartments, the more difficult it is to make ends meet,'' said Tita Stallings, who has lived in Hollywood for 20 years. ''As a low-income single parent, it scares the hell out of me.''
 Larry Gross, the executive director of the Coalition for Economic Survival, a tenants' rights organization, estimates that at least 1,000 units of low-income housing have been lost to development over the last five years. 
 Mr. Garcetti said he has struggled against this tide, requiring developers, for instance, to offer jobs to local residents and pay higher wages, and pushing for more affordable housing. ''We don't want the people who laid the groundwork here to get pushed out,'' he said.
 The Gap is in Hollywood now, which may just about say it all. And the subway is now open for business, ferrying people in and out of the area and setting the foundation of what may become a new Los Angeles, with fewer cars and more urban living.

HEADLINE: Artistic Revival Takes Root Amid Relics of Copper Mines 

BYLINE: By JIM ROBBINS

DATELINE: BUTTE, Mont. 

 BODY:
This is the city that copper built, in the mountains atop the Continental Divide. 
 When the copper played out, though, most of the people left. A city of more than 80,000 people at the turn of the 20th century, Butte now has about 35,000 residents. The dwindling population has left many historic buildings in the heart of uptown Butte empty or greatly underused.
Now community leaders hope the lure of cheap square footage in the 19th- and early 20th-century structures will transform the decaying former mining-company town into a refuge for artists, whose creativity will spark reclamation. 
 ''Art brings hope,'' said Glenn Bodish, the executive director of the Butte Silver Bow Arts Foundation. ''Everybody went to work for the company, and followed the company's rules, and when they left people lost their jobs and were knocked over.'' The city makes up part of one of the largest National Historic Landmarks in the country based on the number of buildings. But for decades many structures were abandoned for back taxes. Many sat empty with broken windows, or fell prey to arsonists or wrecking balls. That is changing. Artists understand craftsmanship, Mr. Bodish said, and can find beauty in the neglected buildings. 
 ''I love the history,'' said Steven Nordgren, a restoration graphic designer from Detroit who moved here last year in large measure because of the architecture.
 ''Everybody is doing decal arts these days,'' Mr. Nordgren said. ''But I love working with the lost arts, the historic applications of glue-chip glass, applied gold leaf, plaster restoration, stenciling and trompe l'oeil in churches and theaters.'' 
 The arts renaissance here began in a chateau-style home built in 1898 by Charles Clark, the son of William Clark, one of the copper kings who built the bustling metropolis over veins of copper beneath what was called the richest hill on earth. The home is now a museum.
 Five years ago, the Butte Silver Bow Arts Foundation bought a burned-out coffee shop, the Blue Venus, in an old building next to Venus Alley, the mining town's largest red-light district. The coffee shop has been renamed Venus Rising, a metaphor for the arts community that has started to rise from the ruins of Butte. There are nine employees, and an art gallery in the back. An artist-in-residence works in a studio upstairs. The foundation is now partly financed through this and other small business operations.
 For a dollar, the foundation just bought the old Y.M.C.A., a classic 1917 building, and opened 18 studios, already fully occupied, and an art-supply store. 
 ''It's cool that there are enough artists to fill up this building,'' said Patricia Briggs, a fantasy writer who returned to Butte after leaving, and now has a studio in the Y.M.C.A.
 While some artists have been recruited, others have shown up on their own. John Richen, a sculptor from California, got off Interstate 90 for a rest stop and fell in love with the town. He recently remodeled two historic buildings, turning one into a coffee shop and the one next door into a restaurant. 
 Dawn and John Wexo, who are both writers and sculptors, are moving their bronze foundry from Buffalo, Wyo., to Butte. They hope to locate in a hoist house called Mountain Con, a large building where machinery once lowered miners in elevators into the tunnels.
 Longtime Butte artists say the renaissance has been invigorating.
 ''It's exciting,'' said Toni Seccomb, a sculptor and member of Main Stope Gallery, an artists' cooperative that takes its name from the timber that holds up a mine. ''There are more artists around, and the creativity feeds on it. Butte is also still affordable, and the rest of Montana isn't.''
 And there is hope for a kind of artistic reparation. An art collection amassed by William Clark, the copper tycoon, is in the Clark Wing that he financed at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington. The arts foundation would like to bring it to Butte, at least on temporary loan, after the gymnasium at the Y.M.C.A. is converted into a gallery to be called the Museum of Fine Arts Butte. 
 ''For Mr. Clark to amass his collection cost Butte economic, cultural and environmental devastation,'' Mr. Bodish said. ''Butte has been sacrificed for America. Bringing part of this collection back temporarily is a gesture of their understanding how important Butte was in American history. It closes the loop.'' 
 Butte demands a lot from the artists, and others, who move here. Temperatures plummeted to 33 degrees below zero this month, not uncommon here in the Rockies. In 1989, the city set a record wind-chill temperature of 91 below. 
 ''You spend time inside,'' said Donna Croitz, a sculptor who moved here from Dallas in 2005 and has a studio at the Y.M.C.A. ''And I keep pictures of beaches on the wall.''

HEADLINE: Distinguishing the Remarkable From the Merely Old

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
AS de facto custodian of everything within the built city that bears sprucing up and saving for posterity, Robert B. Tierney, chairman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission, is instantly miffed when a photographer gives his office the once-over and offhandedly remarks that there is nothing in it worth preserving on camera. Well, maybe him. But only if he puts on the silly paper party hat crowned by a cartoonish depiction of the Chrysler Building sitting on the bookcase next to two -- likewise ceremonial -- hard hats from Lincoln Center and the High Line.
 ''I saw it at a street party and took one because it seemed to speak to what I do,'' explains Mr. Tierney, 63 and dignified in a herringbone jacket and a rep tie that features New York City's official 1625 seal and was designed by former Parks Commissioner Henry Stern and former Deputy Mayor Robert Wagner Jr. The tie cost $9.95, was not a hot seller, and was probably a gift from Mr. Wagner, now deceased, his political mentor, touchstone, and office neighbor inside City Hall during the Koch administration. 
''But I've never worn this hat, and I'm not putting it on now,'' Mr. Tierney continues, mock-defiantly, in his office at 1 Centre Street; he also declines to be photographed with his tacky green glass ashtray from the Landmark Hotel in Las Vegas. In defense of his defensiveness, he alludes to the mess President Calvin Coolidge once got himself into by plunking an American Indian headdress on his cranium for a photo op. 
 Not that the noncombative Mr. Tierney ascribes presidential powers to himself. ''I'm not a demagogue,'' he says, when asked to articulate his reaction to a 2006 op-ed article in this newspaper in which Tom Wolfe, incensed by a proposal to graft a 30-story tower designed by Norman Foster onto a 1949 building in a historic district at 980 Madison Avenue, pilloried the commission as a spineless ''bureau of the walking dead.'' 
 But the power to subjectively distinguish and designate landmarks from run-of-the mill geriatric architecture and, touchier still, the power to preserve them, even without consent from their rightful owners? All his, along with the 10 unpaid commissioners, most of them architectural experts, who sit on the board and spend Tuesdays reviewing preservation prospects at public hearings. 
 Or not: it was on Mr. Tierney's watch that no additional public hearing was convened in response to the protective flurry, and irate lawsuits, that peaked in 2005 when the so-called Lollipop Building, Edward Durell Stone's 1965 design at 2 Columbus Circle, was sold to, and reconfigured by, the Museum of Arts and Design. Bye-bye, big white elephant with the lollipop portholes. Mr. Tierney does not miss it, and insists that the city's residents, tourists, and skyline aesthetics are better served by its reincarnation. 
 ''There is just an enormous responsibility to keep intact what we already have, keep it healthy, used, and animated,'' he says. ''That said, we make discretionary decisions all the time. You can't designate everything. Choices have to be made.'' 
 One recent choice, which temporarily appeased Mr. Wolfe while consternating the high-octane developer Aby Rosen and a celebrity coterie including the artist Jeff Koons and Revlon's chairman, Ronald Perelman, was the commission's rejection last week of the pencil-thin, sky-piercing tower proposed for 980 Madison Avenue. Impressive but inappropriate for the neighborhood, says Mr. Tierney, who otherwise has accolades for the designs of Mr. Foster (the Hearst Tower) and holdings of Mr. Rosen (the Seagram Building and Lever House).
 ''There are historic districts where we've allowed pretty modern interventions,'' he says, citing the Morgan Library. ''We don't freeze districts in aspic, or Jell-O, or whatever the right word, but you can't just throw a glass building in the middle of a historic district.'' 
 Mr. Rosen and Mr. Foster were invited to resubmit a proposal of less invasive proportion. ''I don't think we're blocking progress at all,'' adds Mr. Tierney. ''But the landmark of the future doesn't have to be all glass boxes and dramatic interventions.'' The refurbished Gansevoort Market and the soon-to-be designated Crown Heights, among others, are proof, he says, of that. 
 Mr. Tierney's ties to city government and friendship with deputy mayor/mayoral confidante Patricia E. Harris, who works with the commission, hark back to the late 1970s ,when he became counsel to Mayor Edward I. Koch. Mr. Tierney was appointed commission chairman by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in 2003 despite his lack of a formal education in architecture or urban planning. 
 A doctor's son, Mr. Tierney grew up in West Haven, Conn., in a sea captain's house built in 1854. He graduated from Yale and in 1968 earned a law degree from Vanderbilt University. He lives in a historic district in Greenwich Village in a 1914 building that Mr. Koch dismisses as ''a tenement.'' He and his wife, Carolyn Wakeman, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, have a weekend home in Old Lyme, Conn. 
 He has learned, he says, how to read architectural drawings and is most passionate about the designs of Louis I. Kahn. ''A lot of this job is about interacting with other branches of government. I now know that times of great economic activity, though good for the health of real estate, put a certain strain on the city's fabric.'' 
 Economic viability, he notes, has to be factored into landmark decisions. ''Sentimental feelings don't drive what I do here, but this,'' he says, picking up ''Lost New York,'' a book about vanished landmarks, ''can actually reduce you to tears.''

HEADLINE: More Are Being Priced Out of L.I. Housing Market

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
In 2000, 60 percent of the homes sold on Long Island could be classified as ''affordable'' for families earning up to $100,000 a year, under the old rule of thumb that buyers should spend no more than 2.5 times their income on places to live.
 Last year, according to a new report, just 2 percent of the houses sold on Long Island were in that range for families with such earnings, which make up more than 60 percent of Long Island households. 
The staggering drop over six years, according to the Long Island Index, an annual study of local economic and social trends, is the result of sluggish income growth and soaring housing costs, among other factors that have made the area increasingly unaffordable and driven many people away.
 ''It took our breath away, that the change has been so dramatic in such a short period of time,'' said Ann Golob, director of the study, which is scheduled for official release Friday. The report, titled ''In a Tough Spot,'' puts it bluntly: ''The image of our region as a wealthy suburb is far from reality for a growing number of Long Islanders who are struggling to keep up with high and rising costs.''
 Though home prices have retreated in recent months, they remain at near-record levels, a bonanza for many homeowners, at least on paper. Those already living here are insulated from the entry barrier of high prices first-time buyers would face.
 As the nation's first post-World War II suburb, Long Island flourished for decades as a middle-income alternative to New York City and is now home to nearly three million people.
 Factors contributing to the affordability problem include the loss of higher-paying jobs and growth of lower-paying ones. A decade ago, wages here exceeded the national average by 16 percent; that has shrunk to 5 percent, and average pay has stagnated since 2003.
 At the same time, the number of residents using food stamps rose 20 percent from 2000 to 2003, the most recent data available. 
 ''Now our income advantage is disappearing, pushing some families near the breaking point,'' the report says. In the report's survey of 808 residents, 58 percent complained of difficulty paying their monthly housing bills, while 54 percent said they were thinking of abandoning Long Island for lower-cost areas. Still, 82 percent called Long Island a good or excellent place to live, but only 48 percent said it was on the right track.
 ''I find it hard living on just a pension and Social Security, and I feel bad for the younger people,'' said John Schnitzler, a retired banker in East Meadow, N.Y. Still, Mr. Schnitzler said he enjoyed his three-bedroom home and being ''45 minutes from the city, 10 minutes to the beach, with the malls right here.''
 The report, sponsored by the Garden City-based Rauch Foundation, has been produced annually since 2004, with the advice of academic, civic, labor and other groups.
 ''Taken as a whole, Long Island's story has been a success story,'' it says. ''But our continued success is now in doubt. We face significant problems, which yearly grow worse.'' 
 In a competitive economy, the report warned, Long Island will lose out to other areas unless it expands business and housing and reduces taxes. ''In an era of easy mobility, a region defers change at its peril,'' it said.
 The 2.5-times-income formula for home prices is often ignored across the New York metropolitan area, where many residents spend disproportionately for shelter and shortchange other parts of their budget compared with other parts of the country. 
 The report did not adjust housing prices for changing mortgage rates, which were about two percentage points higher in 2000. But Ms. Golob noted that homeowners who bought then were able to cut carrying costs by refinancing as rates fell.
 Beyond home prices and mortgage rates, an additional factor in the cost of housing is property taxes. They are notoriously high on Long Island and have jumped faster than inflation, the report said. 
 Many residents are under financial stress because of scant income growth, up 2 percent on average since 2000. Meanwhile, they are squeezed by the rising costs of taxes, heating, electricity and gasoline. Even for families with incomes above $110,000, 43 percent report difficulty in paying housing bills.
 Long Island has yet to replace the aerospace and defense industry that once drove the economy, Ms. Golob said. Venture capital investment and federal research grants have fallen. 
 Research at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory has generated businesses. Its president, Dr. Bruce W. Stillman, said the island needs more cooperation by government, academia and business. Finding housing for researchers is so difficult that the lab assigns an administrator to help place them, sometimes in houses it bought for that purpose. 
 ''People love their hometown of Long Island -- they just can't afford it any more,'' the Nassau County executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, said in response to the report. ''We remodeled the Levitt houses, and now we have to remodel the suburban paradigm.''


GRAPHIC: Chart: ''Unaffordable Suburbs''Hardly any of homes sold on Long Island last year were affordable to families earning up to $100,000 a year, a group that makes up more than 60 percent of Long Island's households. This is based on the standard formula that a home should cost no more than 2.5 times income.Percentage of households earning up to $100,000'00: 72%'05: 63%Earning $100,000 to $200,000'00: 23%'05: 29%Earning more than $200,000'00: 6%'05: 8%Percentage of homes selling for up to $250,000'00: 62%'06*: 2%Selling for 250,000 to $500,000'00: 28%'06*: 55%Selling for more than $500,000'00: 10%'06*: 44%*January-JuneGraphs track figures since 2000.(Source by Long Island Profiles, calculations by Regional Plan Association)(pg.

HEADLINE: United Way's Top Executive Says He Will Retire in the Summer

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Lawrence Mandell, president and chief executive of the United Way of New York City, stunned the staff of the organization yesterday by announcing that he would be retiring in June.
 The announcement follows an internal investigation into the group's handling of its assets, United Way officials said. It was the second internal investigation at the organization in a year; the earlier one found that Ralph Dickerson Jr., Mr. Mandell's predecessor, had used $227,000 of the charity's money to cover personal expenses in 2002 and 2003.
Bertina Ceccarelli, spokeswoman for the United Way of New York City, would not comment. But a person with knowledge of the investigation's findings, who would speak only on condition of anonymity because the board had voted not to discuss the matter publicly, said there was no finding of criminal conduct. 
 In a letter to the staff, Mr. Mandell said that he was leaving because he had successfully guided the organization, which raised $100 million in the year that ended June 30, 2005, toward a new mission. Once focused on raising money for member charities, the group now allocates grants to a broader array of nonprofit groups that work with it on issues like helping people to achieve economic independence and gain access to health care. 
 ''While we have been successfully focused externally on our community impact strategy, the next phase is to look inward and shore up the systems necessary to support our impact work,'' Mr. Mandell wrote in his letter, a copy of which was obtained by the New York Times. ''The beginning of this next phase of our transformation represents an ideal time for me to plan for succession.''
 When Mr. Dickerson retired in 2003, Mr. Mandell, who is 63, seemed committed to a longer tenure, according to a current and a former United Way employee. His announcement was thus a surprise, although the local nonprofit community had been buzzing for some time about the activities of a team from Covington & Burling, the law firm that conducted the most recent inquiry for the United Way's board.
 The investigative team interviewed many United Way staff members and took computer hard drives during its investigation. The board's executive committee met on Friday with Mr. Mandell to discuss the team's findings, ''and he did a lot of screaming and yelling,'' according to an employee who heard the outburst and spoke about it on condition of anonymity because they had been told not to discuss the meeting.
 The team's report was presented yesterday to the full board. Current and former employees who spoke on condition of anonymity said the board had become concerned that Mr. Mandell was failing to follow procedures for getting larger grants approved. 
 Mr. Mandell declined to be interviewed. 
 Several top executives have left the organization during the last two to three years. Most recently, one of its most experienced fund-raisers, Dennis Serrette, took a job at the National Urban League, and Gladys Carrion its senior vice president, is joining the administration of Gov. Eliot Spitzer as commissioner of the office of children and family services. 
 At the time the first investigation was completed, Carter McClelland, the chairman, said the organization was prepared to review more of Mr. Dickerson's 15-year reign. It is unclear whether the investigation reviewed by the board yesterday included that period.
 The United Way of America, the umbrella organization, conducted its own review of the New York City affiliate, and its lawyers are to present their findings later next month.

HEADLINE: Schumer To Democrats: Challenges Ahead

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:

Positively American
Winning Back the Middle-Class Majority One Family at a Time
By Senator Chuck
Schumer with Daniel Squadron
274 pages. Rodale. $24.95.
 New York's senior senator, Charles E. Schumer, was a chief architect -- along with Representative Rahm Emanuel in the House -- of the Democrats' 2006 campaign strategy that helped lead to their take-back of Congress in November, persuading incumbent Democrats in red states not to retire; countering Karl Rove's much ballyhooed Republican machine with a hefty war chest and aggressive on-the-ground tactics of their own; and perhaps most important, recruiting and backing candidates (like Jon Tester in Montana, Bob Casey in Pennsylvania and James Webb in Virginia) who could compete in red-leaning states. 
In the days after the election, Mr. Schumer cautioned his party against irrational exuberance, noting that the Democrats' win was largely the result of Republican mistakes and the unpopularity of President Bush and the Iraq war, and warning that the party had a lot of work to do if it wanted to turn the '06 results into a more lasting majority. In his provocative first book, ''Positively American,'' the senator amplifies these views while laying out a series of concrete proposals for winning back the middle class, from promoting college- tuition tax deductions to creating a kind of Manhattan Project for freeing the country from its dependence on fossil fuel.
 Despite its cheesy red, white and blue cover and a hokey title that sounds like a line plucked from a campaign pamphlet, the book offers a smart, tough-minded appraisal of the Democratic Party's weaknesses and challenges, addressing its current identity crisis, as well as many of the strategic and tactical disadvantages that political analysts like Thomas B. Edsall, Mark Halperin and John Harris have said the Democrats face in 2008 and the years to come.
 At times, the volume seems to want to be a Democratic version of Newt Gingrich's ''Contract With America,'' but unlike Mr. Gingrich, Mr. Schumer -- who is now the third-ranking Democrat in the Senate -- is not a polarizing bomb-thrower. For that matter, his book, much like his post-'80s record in the House and Senate (which includes helping to write the 1994 crime bill, spearheading passage of the Brady Bill, supporting the death penalty and calling for increased Homeland Security measures) is deliberately centrist: practical and pragmatic in tone, Clintonian in its willingness to mix up proposals traditionally labeled liberal or conservative, eager to use common sense to find common ground on issues like education and immigration.
 This approach can lead to recommendations that fall into the category of the obvious -- who doesn't want to reduce cancer, childhood obesity and tax evasion? Who doesn't want to protect children from pornography? -- while circumventing big, messy, controversial issues like Social Security and national health care. But if ''Positively American'' doesn't lay out a new, overarching paradigm for the Democrats, it does provide Mr. Schumer's party with at least the beginnings of a credible blueprint for change and renewal.
 Using a fictional suburban family named the Baileys (reminiscent, consciously or not, of the Bailey family in the classic movie ''It's a Wonderful Life'') to illustrate his points, Mr. Schumer writes that his party has made the mistake, in recent years, of forgetting the middle class: ''We talked about them, but we didn't listen to them. Even worse, we were under the illusion that they liked what we had to say. In the 2004 election, the middle class was the runaway bride, and Democrats were left standing at the altar.''
 Analyzing data from the Democrats' 2004 loss, Mr. Schumer writes that ''we were competitive among the middle class -- voters with household incomes between $30,000 and $75,000 -- only because of near unanimous support among middle class African-American voters'' and that that support from ''African-American voters at all economic levels has a lot more to do with three decades of the Republican Party's exploiting white racism to win elections than it does with any great Democratic Party achievements.'' Meanwhile, he notes, President Bush beat Senator John Kerry by 22 points among white, middle class voters, who represent a third of the electorate. 
 He adds that the Democrats' bruising losses in 2004 were a byproduct of the party's failure to offer a ''comparable alternative'' to the Republicans' clearly articulated vision of a strong interventionist foreign policy, lower taxes and a conservative social-cultural agenda. While Mr. Schumer's party prevailed in '06, he says its message was essentially the ''negative image of the Republican message'' -- it was largely reactive.
 Mr. Schumer contends that the Republicans' ''ideological clock has run out,'' but adds that the Democrats need to stop playing defense and define what their own party stands for if they want to consolidate last year's victories. They need to learn from the Republicans, who are ''incredibly skillful at identifying clear issues that connect to their values.'' They need to come up with ''a successful construct for how to deal with the war on terror.'' They need to stop taking their cue in Washington from special-interest groups. And to counter the Republican media machine, they need to refine their message, create think tanks that will help shape the intellectual debate, and take advantage of ''the extensive Democratic and left-leaning 'netroots' '' to help ''identify and encourage viable candidates, like Jim Webb and Jon Tester, in the early stages of their races.'' 
 In the second part of this volume, Mr. Schumer proposes what he calls ''the 50 percent solution'' -- for instance: ''increase reading and math scores by 50 percent,'' ''reduce illegal immigration by at least 50 percent'' and ''increase our ability to fight terrorism by 50 percent.'' Like the book's title, this formulation not only feels like a glib, campaign sound bite, but it also does a disservice to the volume's more thoughtful and detailed proposals for dealing with complex matters -- like stemming the loss of American jobs to outsourcing and globalization by increasing federal education spending, and reducing American dependence on foreign oil in the short term by using means like drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, expanding the Energy Star appliance program and raising fuel-efficiency standards for cars. 
 Scattered here and there, between such wonky ruminations on legislative policy, are some lively personal asides about Mr. Schumer's campaigns -- most notably his successful underdog Senate race to unseat Alfonse D'Amato in 1998. These passages give the reader a glimpse of the grueling, decidedly unglamorous schedule of a politician, and the author's dogged approach to his job: Mr. Schumer, then a relative unknown running in the 1998 Democratic primary against Geraldine Ferraro and Mark Green, sitting in his political consultant's office closet, making endless phone calls to potential supporters; Mr. Schumer, the day after his primary victory, getting the pilot of the one-engine prop plane his campaign had hired to fly low so that his cellphone would work and he could call Ms. Ferraro and Mr. Green's top donors; Mr. Schumer staying in $29 rooms at Motel 6's during that '98 race to save money and buttonhole voters as they checked out in the morning.
 Along the way, Mr. Schumer describes two tests for the prospects of any political campaign: ''If you are able to talk about the things you want to talk about, and if the news coverage reflects those things, you'll win. If the coverage is about other things -- maybe an opponent's attack, maybe a self-inflicted gaffe or maybe an unexpected event -- you'll probably lose.'' 
 And: ''If you do everything right, and your opponent does everything right, who will win? If it's you, that means the race is in your hands.''

HEADLINE: On Being Partisan

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
American politics is ugly these days, and many people wish things were different. For example, Barack Obama recently lamented the fact that ''politics has become so bitter and partisan'' -- which it certainly has. 
 But he then went on to say that partisanship is why ''we can't tackle the big problems that demand solutions. And that's what we have to change first.'' Um, no. If history is any guide, what we need are political leaders willing to tackle the big problems despite bitter partisan opposition. If all goes well, we'll eventually have a new era of bipartisanship -- but that will be the end of the story, not the beginning.
Or to put it another way: what we need now is another F.D.R., not another Dwight Eisenhower. 
 You see, the nastiness of modern American politics isn't the result of a random outbreak of bad manners. It's a symptom of deeper factors -- mainly the growing polarization of our economy. And history says that we'll see a return to bipartisanship only if and when that economic polarization is reversed.
 After all, American politics has been nasty in the past. Before the New Deal, America was a nation with a vast gap between the rich and everyone else, and this gap was reflected in a sharp political divide. The Republican Party, in effect, represented the interests of the economic elite, and the Democratic Party, in an often confused way, represented the populist alternative.
 In that divided political system, the Democrats probably came much closer to representing the interests of the typical American. But the G.O.P.'s advantage in money, and the superior organization that money bought, usually allowed it to dominate national politics. ''I am not a member of any organized party,'' Will Rogers said. ''I am a Democrat.''
 Then came the New Deal. I urge Mr. Obama -- and everyone else who thinks that good will alone is enough to change the tone of our politics -- to read the speeches of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the quintessential example of a president who tackled big problems that demanded solutions.
 For the fact is that F.D.R. faced fierce opposition as he created the institutions -- Social Security, unemployment insurance, more progressive taxation and beyond -- that helped alleviate inequality. And he didn't shy away from confrontation. 
 ''We had to struggle,'' he declared in 1936, ''with the old enemies of peace -- business and financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sectionalism, war profiteering. Never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today. They are unanimous in their hate for me -- and I welcome their hatred.''
 It was only after F.D.R. had created a more equal society, and the old class warriors of the G.O.P. were replaced by ''modern Republicans'' who accepted the New Deal, that bipartisanship began to prevail.
 The history of the last few decades has basically been the story of the New Deal in reverse. Income inequality has returned to levels not seen since the pre-New Deal era, and so have political divisions in Congress as the Republicans have moved right, once again becoming the party of the economic elite. The signature domestic policy initiatives of the Bush administration have been attempts to undo F.D.R.'s legacy, from slashing taxes on the rich to privatizing Social Security. And a bitter partisan gap has opened up between the G.O.P. and Democrats, who have tried to defend that legacy. 
 What about the smear campaigns, like Karl Rove's 2005 declaration that after 9/11 liberals wanted to ''offer therapy and understanding for our attackers''? Well, they're reminiscent of the vicious anti-Catholic propaganda used to defeat Al Smith in 1928: smear tactics are what a well-organized, well-financed party with a fundamentally unpopular domestic agenda uses to change the subject.
 So am I calling for partisanship for its own sake? Certainly not. By all means pass legislation, if you can, with plenty of votes from the other party: the Social Security Act of 1935 received 77 Republican votes in the House, about the same as the number of Republicans who recently voted for a minimum wage increase. 
 But politicians who try to push forward the elements of a new New Deal, especially universal health care, are sure to face the hatred of a large bloc on the right -- and they should welcome that hatred, not fear it.

HEADLINE: New India Accords With Russia Include More Nuclear Power Plants

BYLINE: By AMELIA GENTLEMAN

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Jan. 25 

 BODY:
India sealed a wide-ranging package of agreements with Russia on Thursday, the first day of a summit meeting intended to demonstrate that their longstanding relationship had not deteriorated as a result of India's growing engagement with the United States. 
 In a joint statement issued after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia met with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India, Russia offered to build four new nuclear power plants in India, in addition to the two reactors it is already building here.
 ''Energy security is the most important of the emerging dimensions of our strategic partnership,'' Mr. Singh said. ''Russia's position as a global leader on energy issues is widely recognized.''
 As India's economy booms, the prospect of growing energy shortages has become a major driver of its foreign policy. Describing Russia as a ''special friend'' of India, Mr. Singh added that despite the ''sea change'' that had occurred in international affairs over the past decade, ''Russia remains indispensable to India's strategic interests.''
 This was Mr. Putin's first visit to India since the United States agreed to cooperate with India on its civilian nuclear power program last year, and the Indian government was at pains to show that the agreement had done nothing to dilute the warmth of India's affection for its historic partner, Russia.
 Mr. Singh went to the airport to meet the Russian leader as he stepped off his plane, a pointed gesture of respect previously extended only to President Bush and King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia.
 Mr. Putin will be the guest of honor at India's Republic Day celebrations on Friday. Much of the weaponry on display will be Soviet-made, a testament to the earlier close friendship between the countries in the 1970s and 1980s.

HEADLINE: Running On Empty

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Sorry to repeat myself, but I have the same reaction to this year's energy proposals in the State of the Union that I had to last year's. President Bush had the opportunity to launch America on a transformative new path for clean, efficient power. He had a chance for a ''Nixon to China'' moment -- as the Texas oilman who leads us into a greener future. Instead, he gave us ''Nixon to New Mexico'' -- right direction, but not nearly far enough. 
 As I read the president's remarks, listened to the tepid public reaction and looked at his latest polls, which show Mr. Bush to be wildly unpopular, it seemed to me that the American people basically fired George Bush in the last election. We're now just watching him clean out his desk. Both his energy proposals and his recent Iraq surge were about the best he could muster, given his pink slip. 
The problem is that he is going to be cleaning out his desk for another two years, and Americans deserve better. I would love to see Democrats put that something better on Mr. Bush's desk -- regarding both energy and Iraq.
 ''The stakes on Iraq and on climate change are way too large for us all to be just couch potatoes waiting for the messiah to come in 2009,'' said Fred Krupp, president of Environmental Defense. ''That is not an option. Yes, it would be entertaining, but we need leadership on these issues, and we need it now.''
 On energy -- no, the president's proposals were not just beanbag. His call to reform CAFE mileage standards for U.S. cars ''shifts the debate from whether to compel U.S. automakers to build more fuel-efficient vehicles to how much they should do so,'' notes a strategy consultant, Peter Schwartz. And his call for a nearly fivefold mandatory increase in the production of ethanol and other alternative fuels for cars and trucks also changes the debate from whether to how much, and which fuels. 
 But the devil will be in the details. Will liquefied coal be one of those alternatives -- which could add to global warming -- or only non-fossil-fuel alternatives? On mileage standards, U.S. automakers will lobby the White House very hard for the smallest possible change. Will they get their way? If so, there isn't much here.
 The really bold, transformative -- and popular -- initiative Mr. Bush should have offered would either be a national cap-and-trade system for controlling CO2 emissions by utilities, manufacturers and autos, or a carbon tax. Both would create economic incentives for us to get rid of appliances, buildings and cars that emit a lot of CO2 and to invent and purchase those that don't.
 But there is no reason that the Democrats could not right now put a cap-and-trade bill on Mr. Bush's desk themselves by spring, Mr. Krupp said, ''and I think Bush would sign it.'' 
 It is not enough for Democrats to just hold hearings on climate change. They need to use their new power to change the climate. Not only would the public be with them, but so would big business. A coalition of America's best companies -- like General Electric, DuPont, Duke Energy, Alcoa, Caterpillar -- and environmentalists just issued a ''call to action'' for a national cap-and-trade program to limit greenhouse gas emissions.
 On Iraq: talking to some of our senior military lately, I've been struck by how concerned they are about the new Bush buildup against Iran. Before we have even won one war in Iraq, the Bush team seems to be courting another with Iran. I am all for brandishing the stick with Iran, but it should be for the purpose of gaining leverage for a diplomatic dialogue with Iran and Syria about Iraq.
 ''When your house is burning, you don't go looking to start a fire in the next house,'' said Vali Nasr, author of the ''The Shia Revival.'' Right now, he adds, everything should be subordinated to trying to salvage Iraq. 
 Let the troop surge be accompanied and reinforced by what the Baker-Hamilton commission proposed: a regional conference that puts Syria, Iran, Jordan and Saudi Arabia around a table with Iraqis to try to stabilize the place. And that requires that America brandish carrots and sticks with all the parties. If a real regional conference doesn't work, then Democrats who want to just set a date to withdraw will have an even stronger case because we will truly have tried everything. But let's try everything: a surge of diplomacy, not just troops. 
 Let the Democrats put that on the president's desk. Just as the business community would support a real climate initiative, I think the U.S. military would support a real diplomatic conference. Bush gave America's voters the reasons to fire him. Democrats need to give voters the reasons to hire them -- for the long haul.

HEADLINE: Aid Conference Raises $7.6 Billion for Lebanese Government

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 25 

 BODY:
Led by Saudi Arabia and the United States, international donors from more than 30 countries on Thursday pledged $7.6 billion in aid for Lebanon, in a bold effort to try to prop up the government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora.
 But even as Mr. Siniora was shaking hands and thanking world leaders in Paris for exceeding the conference's goal of $5 billion, there was chaos back in Lebanon. Four people were shot dead and 150 wounded in clashes between groups supporting the government and protesters aligned with the Hezbollah-led opposition. Both sides appealed for calm. 
The clashes in Lebanon this week, which came just as Mr. Siniora sought to present his country as ripe for investment, were another embarrassment to the prime minister, who has been fighting to keep his government afloat. The political faction led by Hezbollah and backed by Iran and Syria has been calling for his resignation for more than two months. 
 Lebanon is a battlefield in a larger proxy war. The United States, its Sunni Arab allies and Europe, all represented at the conference, are on one side. Iran and Syria are on the other, backing Hezbollah as it seeks to increase its power. They have been giving an estimated $40 million a month to Hezbollah and other groups in Lebanon, analysts say. The money available to rebuild towns and communities damaged in Hezbollah's war with Israel last summer is seen as pivotal to winning the support of the Lebanese people. 
 Saudi Arabia, which is seeking to counter the rising influence of Iran in the Muslim world, led the pledges for the government on Thursday with a promise of $1.1 billion in loans and grants. The United States pledged $770 million in loans and grants, bringing to $1 billion the amount it has pledged to the government of Mr. Siniora since September. 
 The donors in Paris took pains to deflect criticism that their aid pledges were solely meant to prop up Mr. Siniora. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, when asked whether the United States pledge was contingent on Mr. Siniora remaining in power, deflected the question.
 Mr. Siniora, seated beside Ms. Rice during an early morning news briefing, quickly interjected, ''No conditions, no conditions.'' Ms. Rice replied that the money was for the Lebanese people.
 ''Clearly this is a package that is for Lebanon, and that is extremely important to understand,'' she said. ''Lebanon is a democracy. That said, Lebanon is also undertaking some important economic reforms that are critical to making any of this work, and it's not at all unusual that donors expect that those reforms are going to continue, in fact, as the donor community responds to the needs.''
 When pressed later on whether the American funds would be cut off if Hezbollah gained control of the Lebanese government, she said she did not want to discuss ''hypotheticals.''
 ''As you know, Hezbollah is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S.,'' she said.
 The European Union offered $522 million in loans and other aid, while France separately promised $650 million in loans. 
 The conference, in the Kleber Conference Center near the Arc de Triomphe, had a somewhat surreal air. One after another, foreign dignitaries at a conference table announced, in French, Arabic and English, how much money they were willing to put forward.
 ''Be brief, be good and be generous,'' President Jacques Chirac of France, the host, exhorted the group before the event. 
 The World Bank offered $1 billion in loans, grants and other aid. The European Investment Bank offered $1.2 billion, and the Islamic Development Bank followed with $250 million.
 Lebanon is hobbled from the economic and political impact of the Israel-Hezbollah war, and reconstruction efforts have been burdened by the country's $41 billion public debt.
 On Tuesday, groups opposing Mr. Siniora's government essentially shut down the country, staging protests in Beirut, blocking roads with burning tires and setting off clashes that killed three people and left more than 130 wounded. Thursday's clashes added to the burdens of Mr. Siniora, whose survival thus far, Lebanon analysts say, is attributed not only to his support from about half of the country, but also to his strong international support.
 Even with the $7.6 billion in donations and pledges, Mr. Siniora will still return to Lebanon with a battle on his hands as he tries to establish an international tribunal that could eventually implicate Syria in the assassination of Rafik Hariri, a former Lebanese prime minister who was an outspoken critic of Syria.
 Syria occupied Lebanon for 30 years but was forced to withdraw its troops after Mr. Hariri's death. The United States has accused Syria and Iran of trying to bring down the Siniora government to wreck plans for the creation of an international tribunal to try suspects in the case.

HEADLINE: Spitzer to Outline Plans For Cuts in Health Spending

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 25 

 BODY:
Gov. Eliot Spitzer will preview his first executive budget in a speech on Friday afternoon, laying out his plan to rein in Medicaid and other health care spending, setting the stage for a battle with politically powerful health care providers and unions. 
 The governor's budget is widely expected to offer a sharp break from Albany's spending practices of recent years, and Medicaid, at roughly $46 billion, is by far the largest part of the budget and the one many believe is most in need of rethinking. 
The full details of the governor's proposal will be disclosed on Wednesday when he presents his executive budget to the Legislature, but among his proposals, according to people who have been briefed on the plan, will be revamping the way hospitals and nursing homes receive nearly $500 million a year for workforce recruitment and retention. 
 Those changes would address a formula that was worked out several years ago as part of a deal that involved Gov. George E. Pataki and S.E.I.U./1199, the powerful health care workers' union, in what some have criticized as a backdoor maneuver to grant raises to union workers. The overall amount is likely to be cut and the way the money is allocated revised. The Spitzer administration is seeking to ensure that Medicaid dollars are used for Medicaid patients and are not used as a general subsidy for health care providers. 
 The governor will also seek to cut or eliminate the annual inflation adjustment to Medicaid payments to hospitals and nursing homes, which costs more than $300 million a year, a step Mr. Pataki attempted unsuccessfully in the past. 
 Mr. Spitzer will also continue to reorganize the Department of Health, in part by creating a new office of long-term care, as the administration looks for ways to drive down the cost of long-term care and chronic illness, and is likely to centralize the department's information technology efforts. Both plans were reported by Crain's New York Business on Thursday and confirmed by someone who has been briefed on the plan. 
 The governor will also continue efforts to get cheaper prices when the state buys drugs, possibly by centralizing purchasing in a single entity and also by seeking to change the way prices are negotiated with drug companies. 
 His proposals are likely to be received with hostility by health care providers and unions, coming on the heels of a state plan to close hospitals and the Bush administration's proposal for new cuts in health care. 
 ''It's going to be a battle in Washington on trying not to lose that money, and a battle in Albany not to lose that money,'' said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association. ''Hospitals by and large break even in New York, so any money that is extracted is like pulling teeth.''
 ''We've extended our hand to the executive branch,'' he added. ''We'll see how it goes.''
 Mr. Spitzer also wants to push through a package of proposals to fight health care fraud that he supported as attorney general. One of the changes would expand the Martin Act to encompass health care, a statute he used to great effect to pursue securities fraud. Such proposals are likely to be taken up outside the budget process, however. 
 Mr. Spitzer's first budget is expected to demonstrate that he will try to take a more fiscally conservative tack than did George E. Pataki in the later years of his Republican administration, though Mr. Spitzer, a Democrat, will be dealing with the same legislative leaders. 
 Paul Francis, the new budget director, said in a recent interview that he was struck that many subsidies were ''not directly related to patient care,'' adding, ''At the end of the day, the government can only afford to do so many of those without raising taxes.'' 
 The new deputy secretary for public safety, Michael A. L. Balboni, a former state senator, said in a recent interview that Mr. Francis told him the budget would be ''tighter than you've ever seen.''
 Steep cuts to health care could set up a fight pitting the governor against the Legislature, hospitals and powerful unions like S.E.I.U./1199. A spokeswoman for 1199 declined to comment, but the union could be a troublesome foe for the Spitzer administration because of its considerable political contributions and close ties to the Republicans who control the Senate. The union has endorsed a Republican, Maureen O'Connell, in her bid to fill Mr. Balboni's Long Island Senate seat in a special election next month. 
 The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, has said ''the Senate will not support gratuitous cuts to health care.''
 Mr. Spitzer's team is likely to need the health care cuts as it struggles with a number of competing agendas -- reining in overall spending while substantially increasing funds for education and lowering property taxes, and also extending health care coverage to all children in the state. 
 ''Historically, the first year of a governor's term is the year where you make the toughest decisions, so everyone's preparing themselves for what will be a very tight budget,'' said Blair Horner, the legislative director for the New York Public Interest Research Group. ''Look at his promises. He's not going to raise taxes but spend billions of dollars more on programs. That has to come from the existing budget. People understand this.''

HEADLINE: Mayor Projects Huge Surplus Fed by Boom In Real Estate

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN; Diane Cardwell and Ray Rivera contributed reporting.

 BODY:
With New York City's treasury flush with unexpected revenue from an extraordinary surge in the real estate market, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg projected yesterday that the city would have a $3.9 billion surplus to carry over into its $57.1 billion budget next fiscal year, allowing him to cut taxes and set aside money for future expenses.
 The city's flush financial state was buoyed by a forecast yesterday showing tax revenues for the current fiscal year coming in $2 billion higher than was predicted just two months ago.
The good news has defied widespread predictions of a downturn in the local economy, and is a startling reversal of Mr. Bloomberg's first two years in office, when, faced with the city's gravest fiscal crisis since the '70s, he raised taxes and cut spending. 
 Since 2005, tax revenues have been cascading in at surprisingly high levels, a phenomenon reflected in the quarterly financial plan updates the mayor is required to present. In addition to the projected surplus of $3.9 billion for the fiscal year ending June 30, the plan forecasts a $1.4 billion surplus next year; both sums will be rolled over into the following years. 
 In a City Hall news conference, the mayor attributed the exceptionally large surpluses to a boom in property transfer taxes, including mortgage recording taxes, which can generate millions of dollars when large properties change hands. All told, the city expects to collect $2.9 billion in such taxes this year, compared with $902 million in the fiscal year Mr. Bloomberg took office. 
 The mayor warned that the city had become ''very dependent'' on the transfer taxes, and that the revenues from property sales could drop sharply once the market cools. ''When that starts to slow down, that's not going to be great for us,'' he said. 
 In the new budget, the sixth of his administration, Mr. Bloomberg has relaxed somewhat the fiscal discipline he demonstrated a year ago, when he insisted on using most of a near-record surplus to set up a health trust fund for retirees, pay off debts, and finance some capital projects without having to borrow. 
 Mr. Bloomberg said the spending plan reflected a responsible balance between prudence and generosity. He announced last week a one-year, $750 million cut in property taxes, and $250 million in other tax cuts. Yesterday, he announced that he would set aside, out of next year's budget, $1.4 billion to reduce future deficits and $500 million toward a trust fund for the health benefits of city retirees. The mayor has already put $2 billion into the trust fund, which was created last year.
 ''The people of New York City have every reason to be happy,'' the mayor said, before quickly adding, ''The ways to be happy long term, however, is to not go out and spend everything you have on one night of food and a few drinks.'' 
 The mayor went through a litany of statistics showing the economy's remarkable recovery from the decline after the 9/11 attack. Mr. Bloomberg took office less than four months after the attack.
 The city's population is estimated to be at an all-time high of 8.2 million. Wages have grown every year since 2002. Wall Street bonuses hit a record level, $25.1 billion, last year, lifting income tax receipts and fueling the city's service sector. Tourism is booming, as are hotel occupancy and room rates. Vacancy rates in office buildings are near historic lows, driving commercial rents up.
 And yet, the mayor warned that the city, which has so far seemed insulated from the national economic slowdown, cannot escape it. He cited projections showing home sales, which peaked in 2005, continuing to slide until 2009. He predicted that job growth would start to weaken this year, and Wall Street profits next year.
 Assuming the one-year property tax cut is extended -- which the mayor warned might not be feasible -- the city would have deficits of $2.6 billion in the 2009 fiscal year and $3.7 billion in the 2010 fiscal year, when the mayor is to complete his term. 
 Perhaps the greatest long-term threat to the city's fiscal health is the relentless growth in the largely uncontrollable cost of pensions, health care for city employees and retirees, the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and interest on municipal debt. ''The fact remains that we still spend more than we take in,'' the mayor said. ''We have to some day grow our way out of that problem.''
 Some fiscal conservatives have urged the mayor to be more aggressive in taking on public-sector unions to rein in the budget. The mayor recently reached contract agreements with the United Federation of Teachers and with the largest union of city workers, District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. Those contracts are a major reason controllable expenses -- essentially, the cost of employees and contractors -- are rising about 7 percent this fiscal year, to $18.9 billion from $17.7 billion. 
 The mayor reiterated yesterday his call for Albany to stop making pensions of city workers more generous against the city's wishes. He also expressed support for a fifth pension tier, which would mean less generous retirement benefits for future city workers. The unions would be certain to resist such a move, and it is not clear how much the mayor intends to push the idea. 
 Diana Fortuna, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-backed research organization that advocates fiscal restraint, said she would give the new budget plan a ''moderately strong grade,'' and called Mr. Bloomberg more prudent than many of his predecessors.
 ''The continuous surprise is that the city's economy is continuing to pour money into the city's budget,'' she said. ''These are unusual times when the challenge is not to balance the budget but to decide where to put the money.''
 Although Ms. Fortuna called for making the property tax cut permanent, she criticized the mayor for not devoting more of the surpluses to paying down long-term debt. ''We're still carrying debt for the $2 billion we borrowed after 9/11 to balance the budget,'' she said. ''Now that we're doing better, couldn't we pay off these debts?'' 
 Ronnie Lowenstein, director of the city's Independent Budget Office, said the strength of the real estate market and Wall Street profits has endured far longer than anyone expected. ''It's unusual to be in a situation where the city is so flush with cash that it's looking ahead to transfer billions of dollars not just to next year, but the year after as well,'' she said.
 She warned that the transfer taxes are at ''a level that, even a year ago, we would have considered unsustainable.''
 In another sign that he has become less restrained, the mayor announced this week that he would incorporate into future budgets roughly $62 million in programs that he has traditionally proposed cutting and which are typically later restored by the City Council in the final budget adopted in June. ''We're obviously very gratified,'' the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, said yesterday. 
 As he is required to do every other year, the mayor presented a preliminary 10-year capital plan yesterday. The $77.3 billion plan covers the 2008 to 2017 fiscal years. More than one-third, or $28.4 billion, will be spent on building or renovating schools. The plan also includes $52 million to shore up fragile retaining walls around the city, $44 million for an overhaul of the New York Aquarium at Coney Island and $40 million for electronic voting machines.

HEADLINE: Option to Rent: Great New Jersey Views, Near All Transportation 

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON; David W. Chen and Richard G. Jones contributed reporting.

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
The New Jersey Turnpike has long been the subject of song and an object of scorn. And now Gov. Jon S. Corzine, who earned a reputation as a shrewd negotiator on Wall Street, is thinking seriously about leasing it out, banking on the hope that it and two other toll roads could fetch as much as $30 billion and hold the key to solving some of the state's nagging fiscal difficulties. 
 Mr. Corzine's need to secure a fiscal Hail Mary pass is evident: budget talks are looming, and other states, including neighboring Pennsylvania, are interested in leasing their own toll roads, which could create stiff competition for investors' dollars in this emerging market. He is also mindful that any deal will have to be sold to wary voters.
Following recent leases of toll roads in Chicago and in Indiana, New Jersey is among two dozen states that have either formed partnerships with private groups or passed legislation paving the way for such agreements. But as lawmakers from California to Virginia have discovered, efforts to take toll roads, prisons, lotteries and other state assets private can quickly become mired in political quicksand. 
 Polls show that voters in New Jersey oppose the idea, and powerful lobbying groups, from commuters and trucking companies to environmentalists and public employee unions, are also skeptical.
 But the biggest complaint is that to recoup their huge up-front payments and generate returns of 10 percent to 15 percent a year, private operators are winning the right to raise tolls faster than public agencies would have. In the case of the Garden State Parkway, for instance, where tolls have been unchanged for 17 years, a sharp increase would be inevitable. 
 Some opponents said that they were concerned that the proceeds from these deals would be used to plug immediate financing needs instead of meeting long-term needs.
 ''New Jersey has a long track record of using short-term fixes for long-term budget problems,'' said Phineas Baxandall, a senior analyst for tax and budget policy at U.S. PIRG, a federation of state government watchdogs, ''If they spend the money in the first 10 years, the question is what happens in Year 11.'' 
 So as Mr. Corzine and his advisers press ahead on deciding on whether and how to structure a deal, the cross-fire in New Jersey, home to some of the country's most heavily traveled toll roads and heftiest state deficits, is already so messy that it threatens not just to bruise the governor but also his fellow Democrats, who face re-election in November.
 ''New Jersey has its back to the wall in an acute way and Corzine doesn't have a lot of options,'' said John Foote, a senior fellow at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, who studies making highways private. ''He knows this will not be a politically popular decision.''
 Despite the pitfalls, long-term lease agreements for toll roads, perhaps the most lucrative source of funds for governments these days, are increasingly common. In 2005, Chicago received $1.8 billion from investors to run the 7.8-mile Skyway for 99 years. Last year, Indiana signed a 75-year lease on the 157-mile Indiana Toll Road, which brought in $3.8 billion. 
 Mr. Corzine, a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, who made his name selling debt on Wall Street, is eager to come up with an arrangement before the state's new fiscal year begins on July 1, people who have recently spoken with him say.
 The governor will move one step closer to the ability to lease the roads as early as next week, when State Senator Raymond J. Lesniak is expected to introduce a bill that would authorize him to begin negotiating a deal on roads like the turnpike.
 Kris Kolluri, the commissioner of the Department of Transportation, said that while Mr. Corzine checks daily to see how his advisers' analysis of a possible lease is going, ''We're engaged in a thoughtful discussion instead of rushing to the market.'' 
 The governor is aware of the potential value of highway leases, which would bring billions of dollars. And some of that cash could be invested until it is needed, earning hundreds of millions of dollars in interest income every year. But the governor is also sensitive to the growing backlash.
 For instance, critics worry about agreements that can make it harder for states to build new interchanges and roads to meet future needs. They point to the Transportation Authority in Orange County, Calif., which in 2003 had to buy back the express lanes it leased to a private operator because of a noncompete agreement that prohibited it from improving an adjacent toll-free road.
 ''We are ill-equipped in government to adequately predict what the world will look like with the time horizons associated with these agreements,'' said Assemblyman John S. Wisniewski, chairman of the Transportation Committee, who, like the governor, is a Democrat, but is a leading opponent of leasing roads.
 And environmentalists say that commuters who opted to avoid toll roads would flood some local streets.
 The private operators who lease toll roads become responsible for maintenance, so issues like when and how often snow must be plowed must be included in lease agreements.
 Not surprisingly, the prospect of higher tolls is unpopular among New Jersey drivers. A recent Fairleigh Dickinson University poll found that 54 percent of those surveyed said that leasing the 148-mile turnpike was a bad idea. 
 And a Quinnipiac University poll made public on Wednesday showed that a clear majority of respondents were opposed to selling or leasing the turnpike or the Garden State Parkway, even if it would reduce debt and provide property tax relief. 
 ''Garden State motorists have little love for the turnpike or the parkway, but they want to keep these famous -- or infamous -- toll roads in public hands,'' said Clay F. Richards, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. The Atlantic City Expressway could also be leased out.
 Mr. Corzine was well aware of such opposition when he acknowledged those concerns in his State of the State address.
 ''The challenge,'' he said, ''is the risk that we receive too low a price for the assets, we set terms and conditions that do not sufficiently protect the state's or the public's interest or, worst of all, our reinvestment choices squander the proceeds.''
 If the state cannot include a ''reasonable and predictable schedule'' for letting the private operator raise prices, he added, no deal will be done. The governor also promised to allocate funds from any deals for debt relief and capital investment, not tax rebates and quick fixes.
 Opponents say Mr. Corzine would be passing the buck if he let private operators raise tolls that he cannot or will not raise himself. They also question the way toll increases are often structured in lease agreements with private operators. They say companies are asked to limit increases for a few years but are then free to raise tolls much faster later on -- by which time the politicians who approved the arrangement are out of office.
 As drivers in Chicago and Indiana are learning, toll increases are typically linked to growth in consumer prices, or gross domestic product. But those indexes often rise faster than wages do.
 In Chicago, many of the drivers who use the Skyway are from out of state, and many of the drivers on the Indiana Toll Road are interstate truckers -- two groups that have less political sway than local drivers. But in New Jersey, the turnpike and the 173-mile-long Garden State Parkway-- the state's main arteries-- are used not just by truckers and out-of-state commuters, but also by hundreds of thousands of state residents every day.
 For all the handwringing in New Jersey about such an arrangement, its tolls are less than half the national average. Still, state legislators have been reluctant to raise them or gasoline and motor vehicle taxes.
 But Mr. Corzine insists that inaction can no longer be an alternative. The state's debt load, about $30 billion, is roughly equal to its annual operating budget. And five months before the fiscal year ends on June 30, the state is already staring at about a $2 billion deficit.
 With numbers this large, Mr. Corzine is expected to try to get the most he can, by seeking to lease the three toll roads as part of one package, which according to Philip Villaluz, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, could bring the state about $30 billion.
 But investment funds may have trouble coming up with that much capital. ''Everyone's hyping up this deal,'' said one banker involved in infrastructure deals, ''but no one is asking how it gets done.''

HEADLINE: Ford Chief Sees Small as Virtue And Necessity

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., Jan. 25 

 BODY:
Just 10 months ago, William Clay Ford Jr. vowed that his auto company, despite its mounting losses, would ''reclaim our legacy'' in the American car market and ''emerge stronger than we've ever been.'' 
 But there is a new message coming out of the chief executive's office at Ford. Alan R. Mulally, recruited last fall from Boeing to run Ford, has signaled that the bigger-is-better worldview that has defined Ford for decades is being replaced with a new approach: less is more.
Instead of insisting that Ford reverse its slide, Mr. Mulally says that Ford will become much smaller. Its forecasts show it may fall from second to fourth place this year in the American market, behind General Motors, Toyota and Chrysler.
 The hiring of Mr. Mulally, leaving Mr. Ford as chairman, was the first instance of any Detroit carmaker's reaching outside the industry for a leader. And Mr. Mulally has broken with tradition in a hurry. He flew to Japan to meet with top executives of its toughest competitor, Toyota, to seek their advice on ways to streamline Ford's manufacturing operations. 
 When asked about his priorities for fixing Ford, Mr. Mulally said in an interview this week, ''At the top of the list, I would put dealing with reality.''
 It is a harsh reality. On Thursday, Ford reported that it had the worst year in its history in 2006, posting a loss of $12.7 billion. In the last three months of the year, it lost $5.8 billion. 
 A big part of that was related to one-time charges from worker buyouts. But Ford's losses are also accelerating because of falling sales of its big S.U.V.'s and pickups and its inability to sell vehicles without offering costly rebates.
 One Wall Street analyst, Jonathan Steinmetz, calculated that Ford's ''terrible'' 2006 performance was equal to a loss of $4,700 a vehicle. Earlier this decade, Ford earned profits of that size on its big vehicles, a time when it held almost a quarter of the American car market.
 Ford, whose market share dropped to 17.5 percent last year, is in the middle of shedding 44,000 workers, a third of its total staff. It is also closing 16 plants, and has said it does not expect to make any money in North America until 2009. By then, it expects to sell only about 14 percent of the cars and trucks purchased in the United States.
 Mr. Mulally is trying to be both optimistic and pragmatic, creating a sense of urgency while reassuring his anxious workers that the company has a future. 
 Mr. Mulally is in a honeymoon period and has escaped any blame for Ford's poor results last year, even though the worst performance came last quarter when he was in charge. Ford executives in the past have also made similar claims about breaking with tradition, installing new ways of working and accepting reality.
 In the end, Mr. Mulally will be judged as much by Ford's success or failure in the marketplace as for his management techniques. 
 ''The whole thing boils down to the product that's being sold,'' said Jan K. Brueckner, a professor of economics at the University of California, Irvine. ''We can do everything. We can build great computers, put men on the moon. Why can't we design cars that appeal to people?''
 Some analysts also said that Ford's financial results could get worse before they got better, meaning Mr. Mulally might have to wait years to show improvements. ''Ford will suffer the most severe market share decline among the Big Three in 2007,'' Brian Johnson, an auto analyst with Lehman Brothers, wrote in a research report Thursday. ''We expect Ford's decade-long share loss to accelerate in 2007.''
 Mr. Mulally is learning what a difficult tightrope he must walk in managing expectations amid the dire news. 
 As Ford announced its record loss Thursday, he acknowledged that the company might pay bonuses to some executives despite its dismal financial results. It did not pay bonuses in 2005, when Ford performed far better than it did last year. 
 The issue is likely to touch a nerve with the United Automobile Workers, but Mr. Mulally said bonuses might be needed ''to make sure we are paying competitive wages and benefits,'' an explanation Detroit executives have offered for years in the face of union grumbling.
 Mr. Mulally is used to such grumbling, though, having faced off with unions during his 37 years at Boeing.
 And to his eye, there are other remarkable similarities between Ford and Boeing.
 Boeing bets billions to develop new aircraft. And Ford, under Mr. Mulally, has literally mortgaged the company, pledging as collateral things like factories, its headquarters and the blue Ford oval trademark to raise $25 billion in financing.
 If Mr. Mulally is feeling strained, he is not showing it. ''We have the money and plans in place,'' he said Thursday.
 Despite his lack of automotive experience, Mr. Mulally said his years running a big manufacturer, and his technical background, have prepared him for the challenges facing Ford. 
 He has made quick changes to the way the company is managed. He demands weekly progress reports from his executives to reach the goals in the turnaround plan, called the Way Forward, that the company set last year before he arrived. 
 Instead of discussing business plans monthly or semiannually as they used to, executives now visit Mr. Mulally's office every Thursday. 
 There, they analyze things like gasoline prices, manufacturing methods and new automobiles from Ford and its competitors.
 The in-depth sessions are a contrast to executives' previous efforts to explain away bad news, said Donat R. Leclair, Ford's chief financial officer.
 ''The difference I see now is that we're actually committed to hitting the numbers,'' Mr. Leclair said Thursday. ''Before, it was a culture of trying to explain why we were off the plan. The more eloquently you could explain why you were off the plan, the more easy it was to change the plan.''
 Mr. Mulally may be getting up to speed quickly, but he occasionally has to ask for definitions of automotive jargon -- like a ''brown field plant,'' referring to an existing factory that the company might upgrade, rather than a ''green field plant,'' meaning one that will be built new. 
 And he has persisted in calling the automaker the Ford Company, akin to the Boeing Company, when everyone here calls it Ford or Ford's, a tribute to the founding family (its actual name is the Ford Motor Company).
 Mr. Mulally's hiring is, in a sense, a nod to Ford's past, considering it built airplanes along with automobiles in its early years. The Ford Tri-Motor became one of the first planes to be purchased by the nation's fledgling airlines, and was used in 1930s movies starring Shirley Temple and Jean Harlow.
 The similarities between the companies have made it much easier than he expected to lead Ford. ''I've been through this movie before,'' he is fond of saying in interviews. 
 Mr. Mulally likens his business plan to the checklists that pilots must go through before each flight. ''It is very analogous to flying because you've got to know where you're going and you've got to know where you are so you can take corrective action to get back on that plan,'' he said.
 Mr. Mulally even sees a similarity in the upheaval that affected both industries in the 1970s, when airlines had to deal with deregulation and auto companies faced new competition from Japanese automakers in the aftermath of two energy crises. 
 Deregulation ''meant that each of the airlines now was going to be able to compete like never before, and the consumer would decide'' who would survive, Mr. Mulally said. In the same fashion, foreign competition also means ''the customer gets to decide,'' he said. 
 In the same way that he now is trying to map out Ford's future lineup, he had to take a similar gamble at Boeing on what its future would be: would airlines want to buy bigger and faster planes, or more-nimble medium-size aircraft that could be flown on the shorter flights favored by low-fare carriers both in the United States and abroad?
 He convened a meeting of executives from 57 airlines to ask whether they wanted to see Boeing design a new superfast plane, nicknamed the Sonic Cruiser, or proceed with development of a more fuel-efficient jet that the airline called the Dreamliner. 
 By a 57-to-0 vote, they opted for the Dreamliner, officially the 787, which since has become one of Boeing's fastest-selling planes, along with the 737.
 Mr. Mulally made ''a huge strategic decision there that really laid out the next 20 years of manufacturing competition, and I think Boeing got it right,'' said Professor Brueckner, an expert on transportation who has been writing about airlines for more than two decades.
 There are echoes in Detroit of Mr. Mulally's smaller-is-better thinking. G.M. is in the middle of its own revamping plan and Chrysler is preparing a plan of cutbacks that will be unveiled next month.
 This month, the G.M. vice chairman, Robert A. Lutz, known for his love of flashy designs, said G.M. would not mind yielding several points of market share to its rivals, if it meant the company would become more profitable. 
 At Ford, Mr. Mulally may have more success than his predecessor, Mr. Ford, who was seen as reluctant to break from tradition despite his private frustration over failing to halt the company's decline, said David E. Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich.
 ''By bringing in someone from the outside, it conveyed a sense of urgency in the company,'' Mr. Cole said. ''Bill Ford is a nice guy and if he said the sky was falling, people would look at him and say, 'He doesn't mean it.' ''

HEADLINE: A Triangle Equal to the Sum Of Its Hoops

BYLINE: By DAVE CALDWELL

 BODY:
THE gentle hills of the Triangle region of North Carolina are spangled with the prim brick McMansions of migrant techies lured by opportunity and temperate weather -- almost any day is good for squeezing in 18 holes. Out on the wandering back roads, tall pines still cast thin shadows, turning a sunny-day drive into a sparkling strobe-light show. Just roll down the window to air out your soul. The Triangle, bounded by the cities of Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill, is an easy place to live and an even easier place to visit. Refill your sweet-tea glass and sit a while. 
 But at this time of year, an earlier immigrant from the North slices its pleasant homogeneity into three. The pulsating indoor game of college basketball takes over, dividing loyalties and generating friction. In the Triangle, even if you are not a fervent fan, you must share the deep regional certainty that basketball is really, really important. 
The Triangle has three universities, and each of them -- Duke in Durham, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and North Carolina State in Raleigh -- has won at least one National Collegiate Athletic Association championship since 1982, when a skinny freshman named Michael Jordan helped the University of North Carolina win a national title. All are fine educational institutions that become even finer in Carolina when their basketball teams win. The women's basketball teams win a lot on Tobacco Road, too, though they don't pack in fans as the men's teams do. The women's teams at Duke and North Carolina, are No. 1 and 2, respectively, in the latest national poll. 
 March Madness starts around January on Tobacco Road, after these schools have completed the nonconference portions of their schedules -- think Psych 101 -- to dive into the Psych 322: Advanced Cognitive Development-level of Atlantic Coast Conference play. Students, fans and the area's legions of alumni dress in red (North Carolina State), royal blue (Duke) or sky blue (North Carolina) even when they are not at games. 
 You, too, are invited. Warning: Bring your wallet to feed to lurking scalpers or brace yourself to bid for tickets at an online warehouse like eBay before you arrive. (A pair of tickets to one of the two annual Duke-North Carolina games -- rituals of a deep rivalry -- can sell for well over $1,000.) Or skip the battle to get into the arena entirely and settle in with a domestic draft at one of the campus-area pubs at game time. 
 Each school has its places: Playmakers in Raleigh for North Carolina State, for example, or Satisfaction, a pizza joint in downtown Durham, for Duke. Four Corners near the North Carolina campus is named for the strategy made famous by Dean Smith, coach of the Tar Heels from 1961 to 1997 (record against Duke: 59 wins; 35 losses). ''We put the volume up for the Duke game,'' said the manager, Sara Givens-Thomas, ''so people can root against them.''
 The games themselves, particularly Duke vs. North Carolina, are passionate. The arenas seem pressure packed, as if the roofs would blow off at any moment. Students, many with their faces painted in school colors, stand for whole games and taunt, in colorful language, the opponents and the officials. 
 ''You feel like you're really close to the action,'' said Michelle Stansbury, a senior majoring in cultural anthropology at Duke. 
 Home-team players are revered. In the bookshops on Franklin Street in Chapel Hill, which runs next to the sprawling, tree-lined University of North Carolina campus, you can pick up a literary best seller or a used economics text and then select from racks of jerseys screen-printed with 50 -- the number worn by Tyler Hansbrough, the sophomore star forward. (Asked how it felt to be such a celebrity, Mr. Hansbrough, who just turned 21, shrugged and said, ''That's pretty much true for anyone on the team.'')
 Eight miles to the northeast, on the manicured campus of Duke University, an incongruous tent city called Krzyzewskiville was functioning one day early this month as impromptu housing for aspirants waiting in line for the limited number of free student tickets, which aren't given out until game days. Mike Krzyzewski is Duke's basketball coach -- he is bowed to by Duke students as he walks onto the court, and some fans wear chef's hats and aprons, a play on the pronunciation of his name: shuh-SHEF-ski.
 This line, for the game with North Carolina scheduled for Feb. 7, had formed on Jan. 2. Wearing a blue Duke ski cap and wrapped in a blanket, Ms. Stansbury sat in a lawn chair at the front of the line. She planned to switch off with friends and go to class and to Duke's other home basketball games -- the Duke student government has an elaborate list of rules for holding a place in line -- but she expected to ride it out. ''It's part of the Duke experience,'' she said cheerfully.
 It is an exclusive experience because Cameron Indoor Stadium (named for Eddie Cameron, a former basketball coach and athletic director) holds only 9,314. Any suggestion of a new arena, however, is always quickly squashed. Cameron is practically a temple to basketball, paneled and cozy on the inside, Gothic and stately on the outside, in the same Duke-Gothic architectural style that finds its highest expression at the campus chapel. Cameron's immaculate corridors, lined with displays of photographs and old uniforms, function partly as a museum. ''People who come to Duke want to see the chapel and Cameron,'' said Mitch Moser, the associate athletic director who is in charge of Duke basketball tickets. ''And not necessarily in that order.'' 
 For the games, the atmosphere has been scrubbed to the basics. Cheerleaders dance to pep-band music. Ads are in the corners. The refreshment stand is a place to get a snack, not a meal. Josh McRoberts, a Duke sophomore forward, said, ''We know we play in a special place.'' 
 The students kick-start the zaniness by jumping up and down, and it does not take long for their elders to join in. Midway through the first half of a game against Temple in early January, students pointed to the upper seats and chanted, ''Crazy towel guy!'' A middle-aged man wearing a chef's hat stood and to raucous cheers spun a white towel over his head. 
 ''There's more energy here than anywhere in the country,'' Scott Eren, a sophomore political science major from Durham, said through deep-blue lips. In addition to blue face paint, he wore devil's horns. 
 One night later, three sophomores -- Brian Everhart, Alec Brinn and Steve McQuaid -- were painted a lighter shade of blue at the Dean E. Smith Center, a k a the Dean Dome, in Chapel Hill. The Tar Heels, No. 4 in the latest men's rankings, were beating the University of Pennsylvania, but Duke, 10th in the poll, was not far from the students' minds. ''Duke's uppity,'' said Mr. McQuaid, who wore a belt with ''Go Heels'' banner that lighted up like a theater marquee. ''They don't know anything about basketball. They're all from New Jersey, anyway.'' 
 Another dedicated fan, turning his head from the action only when approached for handshakes, was John Edwards, a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, who sat with his wife, Elizabeth, whom he met at the University of North Carolina School of Law, and their two youngest children.
 IF a Duke game is like a symphony, a North Carolina game is improvisational jazz. The Dean Dome seats a far bigger crowd than does Cameron -- 21,750 -- and has a show-biz ambience, with giant video screens and N.B.A.-like pregame music. Its current version of a basketball museum is a sports memorabilia room on the second floor, but an athletic center that's being built next door will have a basketball museum on the first floor. 
 North Carolina State's palatial 19,000-seat arena northwest of Raleigh has the look of a professional arena, with suites and well-padded red seats. Because the Wolfpack has not been as successful recently in basketball as its two neighbors, a game at North Carolina State, which is not among the top 25 teams this season, is usually easier to get into than one at Chapel Hill or Durham -- unless the University of North Carolina or Duke is the opponent. Those games are packed to the rafters. State is placing its hopes on a new coach, Sidney Lowe, who was the point guard on its last national championship team, in 1983. 
 All three Triangle towns have a life outside basketball, even in winter. Raleigh, the state capital, offers big-city amenities -- museums and galleries, the defending Stanley Cup champion Carolina Hurricanes and live music at the Hideaway BBQ and the Lincoln Theater. Durham has the Bulls, the minor-league baseball team made famous in the film ''Bull Durham,'' and a collection of lemurs at Duke. Chapel Hill draws high-end shoppers to A Southern Season, a huge luxury food emporium. 
 For a pregame restaurant meal, the Triangle offers choices, from the elegant Fearrington House's classic French cooking outside Chapel Hill to steaks in a Raleigh-area shopping center at a place called Jimmy V's. It's named for -- who else? -- the late Jimmy Valvano, the coach who led State to that national championship in 1983. 

HOME-COURT ADVANTAGES

In North Carolina, the Tobacco Road to the Final Four
 THE best way in and out of North Carolina's Triangle area is through the Raleigh-Durham airport, off Interstate 40 between the two cities. You will know this is basketball country because the airport has an Atlantic Coast Conference souvenir store and there is the Carolina Varsity Bar and Grill.
 Information on Triangle basketball is at the universities' sports Web sites: www.goduke.com; www.gopack.com; and www.tarheelblue.com.
 Franklin Street in Chapel Hill is the main thoroughfare for the North Carolina campus. Four Corners (919-968-3809) is at 175 East Franklin Street. Sit at the lunch counter at Sutton's Drug Store (159 East Franklin Street, 919-942-5161), which has been open since 1923, and try the Tar Heel turkey club for $5.29. 
 Hillsborough Street in Raleigh, the main drag next to the North Carolina State campus, offers slightly funkier choices. The medium -- better described as enormous -- Italian subs ($6.99) at Sub Conscious (3209 Hillsborough Street, 919-833-3495) are on fresh rolls. Playmakers (919-743-5544) is at 3801 Hillsborough Street. In Durham, Satisfaction (919-682-7397) is at 905 West Main Street.
 Hideaway BBQ (2210 Capital Boulevard, Raleigh; 919-828-5226) features country music. The Lincoln Theater (126 East Cabarrus Street, Raleigh; 919-821-4111) offers a variety of music.
 At the Fearrington House (2000 Fearrington Village Center, Pittsboro; 919-542-2121), a three-course French meal is $65. At Jimmy V's Steakhouse & Tavern (MacGregor Village, Cary; 919-380-8210) the 36-ounce porterhouse is $46.
 The Duke Lemur Center (919-489-3364; www.lemur.duke.edu), which gives refuge to a wide variety of endangered lemurs, lorises and bushbabies, has tours by appointment. 
 The Triangle is an excellent place to play golf year-round. The University of North Carolina's Finley Golf Course (919-962-2349) off Route 54 in Chapel Hill was redesigned by Tom Fazio in 1999. Tee times are accepted up to a week in advance. Greens fees are $45 to $77. DAVE CALDWELL

HEADLINE: Seeing Future Of Britain, And Blair, In the Snow

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 25 

 BODY:
As a subplot to the annual rite here of the World Economic Forum, there is what might be billed as the Little Britain show, or, perhaps more diplomatically, Britain's big picture writ small in the snows of Switzerland.
 Here, for instance, is David Cameron, the Conservative opposition leader, projecting himself for the first time on to this particular world stage of tycoons, politicians and power brokers as a spokesman on global issues as varied as climate change and terrorism. His appearance, unusual for British opposition leaders, was part of ''preparing for government,'' he said Thursday. 
If he sees himself as a national leader in waiting, so, too, does Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the Exchequer and presumptive heir to Tony Blair, here to talk about youth and education, though not in the same rooms as the prime minister himself.
 Then there is the question of whether Mr. Blair, due in Davos on Friday and Saturday, will find a niche to enable him to return here in the future in something resembling the postpolitical mode of Bill Clinton -- a player for the prestigious proscenium where big-bucks philanthropy and private foundations mingle to address the plight of Africa and the struggle against AIDS.
 ''He might not find it as easy as in the United States,'' said a British banker who spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not wish to give offense. ''There is not the same culture or money in Britain for that kind of foundation or that kind of philanthropy as there is in the United States.''
 Mr. Blair has said he will leave office sometime this year, but he has not said when. The latest betting is that it could be midsummer, with an announcement of his intentions sometime before that.
 The post-Blair era, of course, is not something that will be decided at Davos, although the prime minister will share a stage on Friday with such luminaries as Bill Gates, President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and Bono, the politically active rock star -- all potential partners in his postpremiership career. 
 But Mr. Blair is not giving any clues about where he will be circulating his resume. ''He gave the impression of someone who is not planning to go anywhere for some time,'' said an influential British executive who met Mr. Blair recently. Indeed, the official policy of 10 Downing Street, as articulated by Mr. Blair's aides, is that he is too busy being prime minister to start job hunting.
 When he does, though, he will be contemplating the kind of work that will pay off a big mortgage on a $7 million house in central London and maintain a globe-trotting existence. ''That will be no problem,'' the banker said. ''The American lecture circuit and a book advance should take care of things.''
 But Mr. Blair is expected to seek something beyond money. At 53, he is not contemplating retirement. The assumption is that he will seek a global role at the intersection of private money and public policy. There have been rumors -- unconfirmed -- that he could also seek a high-ranking position in the energy industry. 
 Mr. Blair has cast himself in office as a champion of Africa and a foe of global warming, though not everyone back home is quite prepared to grant him the kind of status that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gates -- and certainly Bono -- have carved out for themselves on the international circuit.
 Consider, for instance, Alistair Beaton, a British playwright whose feature-length drama was broadcast on British television this month, portraying a Mr. Blair who is reluctant to leave office, snubbed by his former friends and finally facing deportation to The Hague to face trial on war-crimes charges. 
 Was that not perhaps a little cruel a portrait, Mr. Beaton was asked in a telephone interview in London. ''It's not as cruel as the invasion of Iraq,'' he replied. Mr. Beaton has spoofed other politicians and does not find his actions at all in poor taste. ''Wars are in bad taste, not satire,'' he said. He acknowledged that Mr. Blair's destiny was not likely to resemble his play, titled ''The Trial of Tony Blair.'' ''In the real world I'm sure Blair is lining up a job that is influential, full of prestige and worth a lot of money,'' he said.
 There is no shortage of contacts here at Davos. Mr. Cameron pointed out at a meeting with reporters on Thursday that in less than 24 hours, he had met the prime ministers of Pakistan and Egypt and Mohamed ElBaradei, the chief of the United Nations' nuclear regulatory agency.
 Mr. Cameron promised a departure from Mr. Blair's approach, not just from his military policies, but also his dealings with the United States. ''It is good that Tony Blair has had a special relationship'' with America, he said. But in the prime minister's encounters at the White House, ''it has been questionable whether he asked the right questions and put forward the right views.''

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths KLEIN, JOHN A.

 BODY:
 KLEIN--John A., President and Chief Executive Officer of People's United Bank and its parent, People's United Financial, Inc. passed away January 25 at Yale-New Haven Hospital. He was 58 years old. John leaves his wife and high school sweetheart, Carla, to whom he was married for 37 years, and his two children and their spouses: Kristen Chiodo and her husband Chuck and Eric and his wife Allison. 
He had been looking forward to the arrival of Kristen and Chuck's baby -his first grandchild -who is due to be born in February. He is also survived by his sister Patricia and her husband Daniel Snow, of Norwalk, his brother Peter, of Florida, and his mother-in-law Almira Salomonsen, of Orange. John was born in Bridgeport on March 19, 1949. He grew up in Milford and graduated from Jonathan Law High School in 1967. He attended Columbia University and graduated from the University of Connecticut in 1971. John joined what was then known as People's Savings Bank, Bridgeport in December, 1971 as a management trainee. Later, while working full time at the bank, he attended the University of Connecticut Law School at night. Following his graduation from law school in 1977, he became the bank's first in-house lawyer and was appointed its General Counsel in 1984. Over the next fifteen years, he served in a variety of positions of increasing responsibility at People's United, culminating in his appointment as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the bank in 1999. During his eight year tenure as Chief Executive Officer, John focused his efforts on ensuring that the bank would be able to meet the challenges of banking in the twenty-first century, while maintaining its culture and community focus. He effectively steered the bank through the difficult economy of the early 2000s, and when the bank determined it was necessary to sell its credit card business, he successfully negotiated a sale that retained the jobs in Bridgeport. Last year, John led the bank's conversion to full public stockholder ownership. The bank's new holding company, People's United Financial, Inc., raised approximately $3.4 billion in the offering, making it one of the largest stock offerings in United States history. Most recently under John's leadership, the bank completed the acquisition of Chittenden Corporation, expanding People's United to approximately $22 billion in assets and more than 300 branches in six states. John was also Chairman of the Board of the People's United Community Foundation, which he believed reflected the bank's ongoing commitment to community betterment. In addition to his involvement with the bank's outreach, John held leadership roles with a broad array of community and business organizations. These included: the board of directors of Bridgeport Hospital and YaleNew Haven Health; the Bridgeport Regional Business Council; the Greater Bridgeport Area Foundation; and The Business Council of Fairfield County. John also was a board member of the Connecticut Bankers Association, the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, and a member of the Connecticut Bar Association. Inspired by the example of his wife Carla, a longtime teacher, John was an advocate of the importance of education and, particularly, public education. He believed that a strong public educational system is critical to Connecticuts long term success and prosperity, and, as a proud graduate of the University of Connecticut (and a devoted Huskies fan), he was an enthusiastic supporter of UCONN. John was dedicated to supporting research aimed at making a difference in the fight against esophageal cancer. Following his treatment at the University of Michigan, John and Carla worked with the university to establish the John A. and Carla S. Klein Family Research Professorship in Thoracic Surgery to support a faculty member whose research focuses on diseases of the esophagus. Calling hours will take place on Monday, January 28, 2008 from 4-8pm in the Abriola Parkview Funeral Home, 419 White Plains Rd., Trumbull, CT. A memorial service will take place on Tuesday, January 29, 2008 beginning at 11am at the Klein Memorial Auditorium, 910 Fairfield Ave., Bridgeport, CT. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be made to the University of Michigan in support of the John A. and Carla S. Klein Family Research Professorship in Thoracic Surgery. University of Michigan, Department of Surgery, 1500 E. Medical Center Dr., 2110 Taubman Center, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-5346. For travel directions and more information visit us at abriola.com.

HEADLINE: A Contrarian View: Save Less And Still Retire With Enough

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN

 BODY:
Could it be possible that you are saving too much for your retirement?
 Such an idea would fly in the face of almost every exhortation to a nation of spendthrifts that saving more is an imperative. After all, even as people are living longer, corporate pension plans and Social Security can no longer be relied on to ease most Americans through their retirement years. Fidelity, the nation's largest provider of workplace retirement savings plans, says the average 401(k) account balance is only $62,000.
Beyond that, the national savings rate -- the difference between after-tax income and expenditures -- is actually negative, government statistics show. 
 Nevertheless, a small band of economists from universities, research institutions and the government are clearly expressing the blasphemy that many Americans could be saving less than they are being told to by the financial services industry -- and spending more -- while they are younger. The negative savings rate, they say, is wildly distorted. 
 According to them, the financial industry, with its ostensibly objective online calculators, overstates how much money someone will need in retirement. Some, in fact, contend that financial firms have a pointed interest in persuading people to save much more than they need because the companies earn fees on managing that money.
 The more realistic amount could be as little as half the typical recommendation made by Fidelity, Vanguard or any number of other financial institutions.
 For a middle-income couple, that could mean trading $400,000 in retirement money for about $3,000 a year more during prime working years to spend on education or home improvement. ''For a middle-class household, that's a lot of money,'' said Laurence J. Kotlikoff, a Boston University economics professor, who is on the forefront of this research into spending and savings, and is selling his own retirement calculator.
 Andrew Behla is a case in point of someone who is not saving enough. Mr. Behla, a Los Angeles graphic designer and consultant, is at age 38 just starting to think about retirement. He and his wife, Michele Krolik, a payroll manager, together have just $70,000 squirreled away for their old age.
 ''I think we will have to save a lot more,'' he said, a point on which the economists and the financial planning industry would agree. Even so, the couple recently bought a house and put extra money they had into improving it, figuring that over their lifetimes it will add handily to their net worth. 
 But other people like Beverly Alexander, 49, an energy consultant in Marin County, Calif., might be able to slow down. Her financial planner has her retirement finances mapped out to age 105 (her parents are still alive in their 90s), a plan that gives Ms. Alexander, a former utility executive, the freedom to quit her corporate job and live on her consulting income.
 ''One reason I could retire,'' she said, ''was that I saved and I always lived below my means.''
 The findings of the economists are being met as most challenges to orthodoxy are: with stony silence or extreme umbrage.
 ''I count myself as deeply skeptical,'' said Christopher Jones, the chief investment officer at Financial Engines, a financial planning software company.
 The big financial services companies refused to comment on the research but they did say that their use of simple rules of thumb keeps the process of retirement planning less complicated, and thus, less daunting.
 John Rother, policy director with AARP, says the economists are ''not doing anyone a service because of the tremendous amount of effort it takes to get people to save.'' 
 Nevertheless, the loose confederation of well-regarded economists, who have not been working in concert, say their research points to the startling conclusion that many Americans are saving too much, not too little. Indeed, their studies of the savings and spending habits of the generation born between 1931 and 1941 revealed that at least 80 percent had accumulated more than enough wealth for retirement. While they have not studied the baby boom generation as closely, they believe that the greater wealth of that generation should also leave those retirees secure.
 A study last October by another group of economists, including two working for the Federal Reserve Board, found 88 percent of retirees age 51 and older had adequate wealth. 
 ''Even the most casual reading of the popular press will have you convinced that Americans are heading like lemmings over a cliff,'' said John Karl Scholz, an economics professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. ''Going into this, I had no idea that we'd find any results anything like this.''
 The argument between the sides is similar to the classic debate between the hardworking ants and lazy grasshoppers of Aesop's fable. The financial planning industry says saving, even too much, provides a safety net and peace of mind, and possibly a gift to heirs at the end.
 The economists answer that people would get more out of their money by using it when they are younger. ''There is risk in saving too much,'' Mr. Kotlikoff said. ''You could end up squandering your youth rather than your money.'' 
 Mr. Scholz said he and his co-authors of a study, ''Are Americans Saving 'Optimally' for Retirement?'' found oversaving across all economic and education levels and most ethnic or racial groups as well. (It found that Hispanics tended to save less.) Those who were not saving enough were usually missing their target by only a small amount. 
 The one exception to this optimism involves people who enter retirement single, either because their spouse died early, they divorced, or they never married. The studies found this group did not save enough. 
 ''If they are worried about end-of-life medical expenses or they don't mind leaving money to their heirs,'' Mr. Scholz said, ''then oversaving is fine.'' The dispute revolves around how financial planners determine how much a person should save. That amount will vary depending on age, income and assets. To simplify the calculations, computer programs resort to rules of thumb. 
 The starting point for most retirement plans is the so-called replacement rate. It says an American needs an annual income in retirement equal to 75 percent to 86 percent of what he or she earned in the final year of employment. Someone making $100,000 would typically plan for about $85,000 a year in retirement.
 Coupling that with a second industry rule of thumb that says retirees should spend no more than about 4 percent of their assets each year to make them last, a typical couple with that level of income should enter retirement with at least $2.1 million in assets, including 401(k)s, I.R.A.'s, stocks and bonds, real estate, cash value life insurance, pensions and Social Security benefits. 
 Not so, says Mr. Kotlikoff. It may be simple, but he argues it is more important to look at how people spend their income while working to determine how much they will need when retired. 
 Mr. Kotlikoff's calculations showed that Fidelity's online calculators typically set the target of assets needed to cover spending in retirement 36.4 percent too high. Vanguard's was 53.1 percent too high. A calculator offered by TIAA-CREF, one of the largest managers of retirement savings, was 78 higher than his calculation. 
 Fidelity's Retirement Quick Check calculator says that a 50-year-old person making $100,000 a year with $700,000 stashed in retirement accounts, saving $15,000 a year, would still fall short of the $2.8 million goal that would provide the necessary monthly retirement income of $7,408 that it sets. Its calculations do not include Social Security payments. 
 Fidelity actually recommends saving about $1,000 a month more. It also encourages this person to save more even when more than enough has been saved. It recommends putting away up to $9,749 a month on top of the $15,000 a year already being saved, an impossibility since that would more than consume the person's entire gross income.
 Mr. Kotlikoff's ESPlanner software, taking real estate holdings and life insurance into account, says the person could cut back on savings by $10,000 a year and still have enough for a monthly income of $6,000 at retirement, the amount his calculations deems adequate to live on given prior consumption patterns.
 Mr. Kotlikoff is trying to sell his software, called ESPlanner, to large employers as well as to the financial services industry. He has made no major sales so far. It is also available to individuals at www.esplanner.com for $150. 
 The financial planning industry prefers to characterize itself as cautious. William Ebsworth, chief investment officer of Fidelity Investments' Strategic Advisers division, which runs retirement programs, said, ''We take a very conservative approach,'' preferring to err on the side of having money left over at death rather than risk running out before then.
 ''We believe in the research we've done and that others have done that Americans aren't saving enough,'' he said.

 CORRECTION:
The front-page Your Money column on Saturday, about the possibility that people might be saving too much for retirement, misstated the parameters of a calculator from Fidelity Investments that helps consumers determine their future financial needs. Social Security payments are included -- not excluded -- in Fidelity's calculations.

HEADLINE: Private Eyes Turn to the Case of the Illegal Sublet

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT

 BODY:
The house was one of those stucco numbers that grow in the suburbs like crab grass. The woman in question was a cagey brunette suspected of chiseling her landlord. She had a rent-regulated apartment in Manhattan that she seemed to be subletting illegally for twice what she was paying, while sleeping in the stucco house just outside the city. 
 Bill Golodner idled his sport utility vehicle beside the curb a few doors down. He clipped a surveillance camera to the steering wheel and brought the house into focus. He ran a rough paw over his shaved head, switched on a camera concealed behind the third buttonhole of his dress shirt, then slipped out into the chill morning, heading for the front door.
Philip Marlowe, if he were around, might be doing rent-fraud cases, too. 
 These are busy times for private investigators in the real estate racket in New York City. Market-rate rents are in the exosphere. Denizens of the city's 1.1 million rent-regulated apartments have dug in, and landlords are shelling out serious money in search of grounds to dislodge rent-law violators and get a chance to push up rents when an apartment turns over to a new tenant.
 At the confluence of those crosswinds, a private eye can flourish. Investigators like Mr. Golodner sweep up whatever incriminating evidence can be used by building owners and their lawyers to show scofflaw tenants the wisdom of, say, relocation.
 Mr. Golodner and his partner, Bruce Frankel, both former New York City police detectives, say their firm has handled close to 500 real estate cases in the past year. They mine public records, plumb the depths of the World Wide Web, plant hidden cameras -- trawling for proof of illegal subletting, income-limit violations and the improper use of apartments for businesses, even prostitution and drug dealing.
 ''Everybody thinks landlords are bad and we can steal from them,'' said Mr. Frankel, a helicopter door gunner in Vietnam who later worked in the garment center and can still spot a tailor-made suit by the sleeve buttons alone. ''We live in a life of double standards. We have all these great people who go to work, donate to charities, talk about how the war is horrible -- but everybody still thinks it's O.K. to have the Robin Hood mentality.''
 Take the tenant who seemed to be allowing her Manhattan apartment to be used for illicit business. The owner of the building answered an ad for what Mr. Frankel and Mr. Golodner call a massage. Unexpectedly, he found himself in a building he owned. When Mr. Frankel and Mr. Golodner investigated, they say the found the tenant of record was paying $800 a month but living in Westchester County, while collecting $2,700 a month from the woman in the apartment selling her services. 
 Another woman claimed to be living in her rent-regulated West Village apartment, for which she paid about $1,500 a month, less than half the market rate. Mr. Frankel and Mr. Golodner say they found her in South Dakota, after her address surfaced in a public-records search because she had applied for a license to work in the gambling industry. They say they interviewed the lawyer who had helped her buy a house in the Badlands; they believe she was planning to hand over the apartment to her son, who was not yet living in New York. 
 Another private investigator, Nick Himonidis, founder of NGH Associates in Roslyn Heights, N.Y., recalled a case in which a tenant was operating an architectural office out of a rent-regulated apartment: three architects, support staff, cleaning crews. Two investigators from Mr. Himonidis's office made an appointment, talked to the architects and asked for a tour of the office. They captured the whole thing on hidden cameras.
 ''As a percentage of our business, our work for landlords as clients has probably gone from 5 percent to closer to 20 percent in the last 24 months,'' said Mr. Himonidis, who believes the rise in rents has made an owner more likely to call in an investigator. ''It simply might not have made economic sense 5 or 10 years ago. And now it does.''
 Samuel J. Himmelstein, a Manhattan lawyer who has represented tenants for 28 years, says the number of cases filed by landlords against tenants jumped in the late 1990s after the law was changed to make it easier for apartments to be deregulated once they become vacant. He said surveillance video tapes are increasingly the preferred standard of proof that a tenant is not living in his apartment -- or that someone else is.
 Mr. Himmelstein said: ''I get a lot of clients who get these suspicious phone calls. Someone will say, 'We have a case of wine someone wants to send you, where should we bring it?' '' As part of that ruse, Mr. Himmelstein explained, investigators would walk up to the client's other residence with a camera and videotape the client opening the door and accepting the case of wine. He said surveillance tapes now show up in about 20 percent of his cases. 
 Under the New York City rent rules, which cover half the 2.1 million rental apartments in the city, a tenant with a lease on a rent-regulated apartment must live in it at least half the year. He cannot sublet without the owner's permission and cannot charge more than the regulated rent. When the primary tenant moves out or dies, only family members already living in the apartment for at least two years have a right to take over the apartment.
 Owners are allowed to charge only a fraction of current market-rate rents. They can apply for deregulation only when an apartment's rent reaches $2,000 a month and either the tenant moves out or the existing tenant's household's income tops $175,000 for two years in a row. But if a tenant leaves, the owner can raise the rent for the next tenant by roughly 20 percent, and pass on part of the cost of any improvements made between tenants.
 Mr. Golodner himself lives in the rent-controlled apartment on the East Side of Manhattan where his father was born and died. He has worked as a bank teller, a meat cutter, a garage attendant and a paramedic, and was a police officer for 20 years. An occasional actor, he is working on a screenplay about a Jewish detective married to a Wiccan priestess. 
 ''I'm not one of these pansy P.I.'s that sits behind a computer,'' he said recently, mock-indignant. (He quickly volunteered that the line was lifted loosely from a private investigator in the movie ''Intolerable Cruelty.'')
 Two years ago, Mr. Golodner, 50, and Mr. Frankel, president of the board of his own condominium, formed Frankel Golodner & Associates. Half their business involves real-estate-related investigations, a niche Mr. Frankel, 61, discovered through his wife, who owns a real estate sales and management firm. But Frankel Golodner is full service -- everything from matrimonial and nanny investigations to ''executive protection,'' and ''corporate and event security,'' including ''explosive detection.''
 The case that took Mr. Golodner out of New York City last week and up the steps of the stucco house was in a suburb that Mr. Golodner and Mr. Frankel asked remain unnamed as a condition of allowing a reporter to accompany Mr. Golodner. It was a typical ''nonprime case'' of a primary tenant suspected of illegally subletting her apartment and living elsewhere. Mr. Golodner said he figured he already had enough evidence to make his case against the woman, who he said was paying less than $1,500 a month for her Manhattan apartment.
 He put his finger to the doorbell. High-pitched barking erupted inside -- the kind that comes out of small dogs with ribbons in their hair. Mr. Golodner planned to tell the woman he was an insurance investigator looking into an accident that had occurred on the street some months before. With any luck, the woman would get chatty and volunteer something revealing -- say, that she had lived there for years.
 But she was tough. She opened the door just a crack. The camera nestled near Mr. Golodner's solar plexus recorded nothing more than the crack in the door and an occasional glimpse of her hand. She seemed dubious about the accident story. When Mr. Golodner asked her casually how long she had lived in the house, she said she did not live there. She just stayed there with her boyfriend, she said.
 Back in the car, Mr. Golodner said he had was ready to write up a final report for the client, even though the woman had not tipped her hand. 
 He recalled an earlier surveillance that had gone better. Another nonprime tenancy investigation, another Manhattan apartment, another woman living outside the city. But when Mr. Golodner had played the insurance investigator, he said, that woman took the bait.
 ''Oh no, three months ago?'' he remembered her saying. ''I saw the whole thing! I'm here all the time. They use this road as a raceway.'' She had owned the house for 20 years, she volunteered; she had lived there for nine. And she had an office in Manhattan -- which, Mr. Golodner said, turned out to be the apartment in question.
 He chuckled.
 ''She wouldn't shut up,'' he said.

HEADLINE: For Former Foster Care Youths, Help to Make It on Their Own

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
When current and former foster children formed a group to help youths who had turned 18 and were ''aging out'' of the system, one of the first things they did was hold a luggage drive. 
 ''We saw that a lot of the kids were taking their clothes out in garbage bags,'' said Chilton Brown, 23, a former foster child who spent ages 3 to 18 as a ward of the state, bouncing around 15 family homes or group residences.
A life contained in green plastic bags: it is the kind of humiliating detail that hits home hardest among foster youths themselves. It is also a telling sign of how unprepared many of these 18-year-olds are to live on their own, without families, jobs or school diplomas to shore them up. 
 In part because of the increasing advocacy by foster youth groups like Mr. Brown's, many states are expanding efforts to help young adults prepare for life outside the system, offering transitional housing, education, medical care and mentoring as they step out on their own. States are also extending aid for extra years, in some cases to age 21 or even beyond. 
 ''We're finally seeing a recognition by public agencies that they have a responsibility to this population beyond the age of 18,'' said Gary Stangler, director of Jim Casey Youth Opportunities Initiative, a foundation in St. Louis that is helping to organize foster youth boards and offers matched savings accounts as well as job aid in 10 states. ''In our society, most 18-year-old kids aren't ready to be thrust into the world.'' 
 Long in the shadows, the plight of aging out foster youths -- some 24,000 a year nationwide who fail to be adopted and usually leave court-monitored care at 18 -- is gaining new attention, as youths speak out and research reveals the numbers who end up in homeless shelters, jail and long-term poverty. 
 California, spurred by the lobbying of the country's largest and most powerful group of former foster children, the California Youth Connection, plans to provide 1,200 transitional housing units, and support counseling, for young adults emerging from care. 
 In New York City, as part of a wider effort to fight homelessness, the state and city are creating 200 apartments for foster care veterans with special needs. Several private agencies are expanding their programs, as well. 
 Washington and Iowa have recently joined at least 17 other states, including New York, that allow youths under some circumstances to remain in foster care until age 21. The move keeps the youths under the protection of a court that can press for aid to which they may be entitled into their twenties but is not always offered by overwhelmed state agencies. 
 But a universal option to remain in foster care until age 21, which is supported by the American Bar Association and many experts, has been hampered by a lack of money. The large federal subsidies that help pay for the system's courts, lawyers and social workers are provided only up to the age of 18, or 19 for those finishing high school.In Illinois, where nearly half of foster children now stay to 21, the extra years are paid for by the state. Early studies by the Chapin Hall Center for Children at the University of Chicago indicate that those who remain are faring better than those who leave at 18. 
 But it is too soon, scholars say, to know how much difference all the new efforts will make in the lives of children who have suffered abuse or neglect and separations from their families. 
 In Michigan, nearly 500 youths age out annually, usually at 18. A study of 264 former foster children, released in October by psychologists at Wayne State University, showed how poorly many had fared. 
 Youths from Detroit and two surrounding counties who aged out in 2002 and 2003, mainly African-American, were surveyed three and a half years after they left care. Seventeen percent had stayed in the streets or in shelters for an average of two months each. Some 33 percent had spend long periods ''couch surfing'' with friends or relatives. 
 Four in ten were high school graduates. The average youth had been unemployed half the time since leaving care; most jobs were in fast food, averaging just $600 per month. More than one in four males had spent time in jail. 
 Under a 1999 federal law that provides some ''independent living'' assistance to age 21, many aged-out youths can get financial aid, including up to $1,000 to help rent an apartment and up to $5,000 a year for those enrolled in college or training schools. 
 ''If it weren't for these programs, I'd probably be in a shelter and I'd have to drop out of school,'' said Stacey Kline, 21, who left Detroit's foster system at 18. Ms. Kline has been an active leader in the city's youth boards and is now in college, hoping to someday run a home for aged-out youths. 
 Still, for Ms. Kline it has been two steps forward, one step back: she recently borrowed emergency money from the Jim Casey program to help her rent a new apartment after, she said, an angry ex-boyfriend vandalized her previous apartment.
 In other common patterns, many youths are eager to sever ties with the child welfare bureaucracy, some squander their limited aid and others are in no shape to take advantage of these benefits. 
 Michael Morris, 21, says he regrets forfeiting his transitional aid. Born to teenage drug users, he was in foster care in Detroit from the age of six months, drifting through dozens of private and group homes. 
 Though he had never even met his parents, Mr. Morris said, ''I wanted a family and I wanted to be with my parents no matter whether they were on drugs.'' Before he turned 18 and exited foster care, he met his sister and mother for the first time and decided to move in with his mother without the consent of the court, thus losing transitional rent and school subsidies. 
 He later joined one of the emerging foster youth boards in Detroit and received some matching money for what he saved while working as a security guard.
 But living with his mother did not last long. Mr. Morris then tried sharing apartments, but the roommates did not pay their share of the rent. He became unemployed and recently arrived at the crisis center of Covenant House in Detroit, where he shared a barren room with two other homeless youths.
 ''I hope to be out by March,'' Mr. Morris said. ''I got a good lead on a job at Popeye's,'' he added, which would pay $7.25 an hour. Through the matched savings program, he hopes to rent his own apartment and enroll in community college. 
 The growing advocacy by foster children themselves has done more than anything else to draw the attention of state and national officials, said Robin Nixon, director of the National Foster Care Coalition. 
 In Michigan, Marianne Udow, director of human services, said one of her first acts after taking office in January 2004 was to meet with youth boards to ask for advice. 
 ''I left that meeting feeling that the whole system was broken,'' Ms. Udow said. The youth boards later issued 15 recommendations for improving the system and lobbied the governor and legislators. Some suggestions were accepted, including making sure that all foster children get a certified copy of their birth certificate and a Social Security card and help obtaining driver's licenses. 
 Other suggestions would be more costly and remain under discussion, including offering free college tuition, giving former foster children cars being auctioned by the state and giving all the option to remain in care to 21. 
 But the youths also made it clear they believed that the problems start when the state removes children from their parents -- sometimes too readily -- and moves them away from relatives, friends and familiar schools. 
 Their first recommendation was that foster youths should have a say whenever changes in their status were considered. Their second was to provide them help maintaining ties with their birth families and hometown friends. 
 The state created a task force with youths on every panel. One top recommendation, the automatic extension of Medicaid coverage to age 21, has just been put into effect. The State Housing Development Authority has also allocated $3 million for rent subsidies, whose recipients will also be eligible for regular mental health and other services. 
 At the same time, Ms. Udow said, the state is working to reduce the frequency with which children are removed from their parents and trying to keep more children with relatives and in the same schools. The state is in settlement talks with the advocacy group Children's Rights, which brought a suit accusing Michigan of providing inadequate protection and support to children in its care. 
 For the hundreds who have joined, the youth boards, with their weekly meetings and election of officers, have offered personal breakthroughs as much as a way to influence policy. 
 ''When we come together it's like family,'' said Alice Harris, a 22-year-old mother of three children who lived in a home for unwed mothers when she entered foster care, then ran away at 16 and survived on the streets for more than a year. 
 More recently Ms. Harris has lived with a boyfriend, received welfare and become certified as a nurse's assistant. She has become heavily involved with her local youth board in central Detroit, getting elected as an officer and lobbying in the state capital. 
 When she attended her first board meeting two years ago, she said, ''I didn't want to leave.''
 ''We were just gossiping, and I made friends, some of them worse off than I was.''
 Chilton Brown, who says he ''acted out'' during his 15 years in foster care, has benefited from the new aid programs in Michigan but also illustrates how hard it can be to turn things around. 
 Mr. Brown gained confidence as a public spokesman, especially for the special challenges facing gay youths like himself, and has worked as a trainer of new foster parents. He entered Wayne State University with financial aid and aspirations to become a social worker. He took advantage of the matched savings program to buy a car. 
 But he has also lost a series of jobs, could not keep up payments on his car, lost his home when a relative moved away and has missed the last two semesters of college. He has spent the last three months living in Covenant House. 
 ''I got too adapted to having other people take care of me,'' he said in the sparse double room he shares. Now Mr. Brown's belongings are stuffed into one suitcase, and two large plastic shopping bags.

HEADLINE: One NATO Is Not Enough

BYLINE: By Joseph R. Nunez. 
Joseph R. Nunez, an Army colonel, is the chairman of the art of war department at the Strategic Studies Institute, United States Army War College.

DATELINE: CARLISLE, Pa. 

 BODY:
IN international relations, leadership often involves getting allies and friends to do things they have not done but need to do. For example, one challenge facing America is to get more European countries to do heavy lifting in Afghanistan, where British, Canadian, Dutch and American troops are bearing the brunt of battles with Taliban forces. This needs to happen if NATO is to make good on its commitments in Afghanistan, which rightly have wide international support and legitimacy. 
 But the larger issue stemming from that overstrained mission is that NATO is not enough. Like the one strong horse that carries load after load, NATO is getting tired of having to serve as the proxy both for the United Nations and feeble regional organizations. While I am not, of course, authorized to speak in an official capacity, I have some thoughts, based on personal experience, on how to ease NATO's burden. 
The sad truth is that there will be ever more failed states requiring long-term multinational intervention. NATO should not be expected to be everywhere. While it has evolved to handle new missions beyond Europe in the 21st century, it is not a bottomless well of troops. 
 NATO leaders should be asking this question: What are the other regions of the world prepared to do to handle the next likely conflagrations, be they in Sudan, Fiji, Congo, Somalia, Bolivia, North Korea or Nepal? We must get much more creative about preserving stability at such fault lines. Too many interventions, like the African Union's in Darfur, are done in an ad hoc and episodic manner; little wonder they usually fail. 
 What we need are more permanent regional security and defense organizations, supported by major powers. It is in the basic national interest of both the local states and the big nations, never mind any high-minded values. While states may have legitimate concerns about things like sovereignty, the alternative to constructive cooperation is the wildfire of anarchy, which spreads beyond borders and burns far too many. 
 The efforts of powerful Western countries to aid regional organizations' efforts in humanitarian assistance, peacekeeping and nation-building -- which increased after the United Nations proved, in situations like Somalia during the early 1990s, to be incapable -- have been inconsistent. Many arrogant policymakers continue to argue, in effect, that ''superpowers don't do windows.'' Many major powers continue to focus their military programs on conventional warfare. The problem is that conventional wars these days are few, while failed states are many.
 Rather than rely on regional groups to coalesce on their own, the United States and its allies should work to create a minimum of six additional security and defense organizations patterned on NATO -- one each for North America, South America, Africa, the Asia-Pacific region, South Asia and the Middle East. Headquarters for these organizations might be, respectively, in Colorado Springs, Brasilia, Johannesburg, Beijing, New Delhi and Amman, Jordan. But troops would be trained in all states that joined. 
 Each of these new alliances would have to be prepared to rapidly deploy at least a brigade-level force -- about 6,000 troops with ground, sea and air capacities -- anywhere in its sphere of influence. They would also have to have diplomatic and economic teams to move in after the fighting and get the government and markets of the affected country restarted. 
 Considering the vast scope of each of these six regions, the individual contributions required from the members would be fairly meager, and the richer and more populous states could be expected to supplement the offerings of their less advantaged neighbors.
 Each of these new organizations would need at least one big power as a member; this economic and military linchpin would be expected to provide the trained personnel, equipment and money to begin the enterprise. Obviously, the United States would play that role in the North American group; but it and the European and Asian powers might have to take leading roles in some alliances that were geographically distant. This shouldn't be a stumbling block: after all, NATO spans the Atlantic. 
 Of course, all of these new alliances would need the blessing of the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, and their efforts would be coordinated through the organization's Department of Peacekeeping Operations. The secretary general should be expected to welcome the arrangement: it would relieve his organization of its role in centrally planning operations and creating interim forces after conventional combat stops, at which it has floundered repeatedly.
 Yes, creating these new alliances will mean that many states will have to change their approach to internal security and defense. But in this age of globalization, countries will have to be as flexible and cooperative on security matters as they have been on trade pacts. 
 In the end, two facts will drive many states to sign up for regional security organizations: the current system is largely dysfunctional, and joining would give each member greater international standing. For now and for the future, NATO is not enough.

HEADLINE: Labor Union, Redefined, For Freelance Workers

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Herding freelancers is a bit like herding cats. Both are notoriously independent.
 Nonetheless, Sara Horowitz has figured out a way to bring together tens of thousands of freelancers -- Web designers, video editors, writers, dancers and graphic artists -- into a thriving organization.
Ms. Horowitz has founded the Freelancers Union, offering members lower-cost health coverage and other benefits that many freelancers often have a hard time getting. 
 A former labor lawyer, Ms. Horowitz intends to form a forceful advocacy group for freelancers and independent contractors, the most mobile members of an increasingly mobile work force. In addition, she is trying to adapt unions to a world far different from yesteryear, when workers often remained with one employer for two or three decades. 
 ''This really is about a new unionism,'' she said, ''and what it means is to bring people together to solve their problems.'' 
 Having signed up 40,000 freelancers from the New York area, she is now planting her group's flag across the nation, hoping to herd far more of the nation's 20 million freelancers and independent contractors into her union.
 ''These workers are the backbone for so many industries vital to our nation's economy -- I.T., financial services, the arts, advertising and publishing,'' she said. ''Yet these same workers are not afforded simple job protections or a social safety net.''
 By creating a new type of union for nontraditional workers, Ms. Horowitz hopes to help revive the labor movement. Its membership has slipped to just 7.4 percent of the private-sector work force, down from one-third in 1960. 
 Unlike traditional unions, the Freelancers Union has no intention of bargaining with employers. Still, Ms. Horowitz says her group's main goal is identical to that of all unions -- providing mutual aid, in this case health benefits, to their members.
 ''More and more people are not going to get their benefits from an employer,'' Ms. Horowitz said. ''Our ultimate goal is to update the New Deal. It is to create a new safety net that's connected to the individual as they move from job to job.''
 Jennifer Lebin joined the Freelancers Union while living in Manhattan after seeing one of its subway ads that say, ''Welcome to Middle-Class Poverty.'' Ms. Lebin, a political consultant, bought the group's health coverage and paid $20 to attend a union-sponsored seminar offering tax advice to consultants and independent contractors.
 Ms. Lebin, who has moved to Chicago, expressed disappointment that she could no longer use the union's health plan -- doctors in Illinois are not part of the network. ''If there is a way that the Freelancers Union could offer the same benefits to members outside the New York area, I'd sign up in a heartbeat,'' she said.
 The Freelancers Union, which sells benefits a la carte, hopes to offer health benefits in 10 states by the end of this year. It is already offering its discounted disability and life insurance nationwide. 
 More than 14,000 freelancers in the New York area have bought its health insurance, generally for about $300 a month, some 40 percent below what they would normally pay elsewhere. The organization has also used its group purchasing power to help freelancers obtain discounted dental, disability and life insurance. 
 Membership in the Freelancers Union is free. To finance itself, the group uses an entrepreneurial model: it earns modest commissions on the benefits that its members buy.
 Robert Bruno, a professor of labor relations at the University of Illinois at Chicago, praised the group's innovative approach, although he said it could not replace traditional unions. 
 ''This needs to be part of labor's repertoire,'' Professor Bruno said. ''To the degree it helps to reshape what we've come to understand what a labor organization is, it's all to the good.''
 Ms. Horowitz, 44, won a MacArthur genius award in 1999 after she established Working Today, a group based in Brooklyn that focused on providing benefits to New Yorkers in flexible work arrangements. She founded the Freelancers Union in 2003, with a more ambitious vision. 
 The group intends to do advocacy work just like a labor union. In New York, it is backing legislation to let freelancers obtain unemployment insurance. Even if freelancers are laid off after working for an employer for two years, they cannot receive unemployment benefits because they are considered independent contractors.
 Some members do not expect the group to play the role of a traditional union.
 ''Unions represent members in negotiating wages and benefits,'' said Barbara Scott, an artist in Berlin Center, Ohio. ''I don't see the Freelancers Union functioning that way. I see it as a networking tool.''
 Bobby Ambrose, a graphic designer in Chicago, disagreed.
 ''I was hoping that they would be like a labor union,'' Mr. Ambrose said. ''There are a lot of situations that freelancers face regarding pay rates and job hours, like when you're doing full-time work when you're only hired to be part time. It would be nice if they could push to make things better.''
 Several traditional unions are studying the freelance union's progress, perhaps to borrow some ideas on organizing nonunion workers and offering benefits.
 ''The labor movement,'' Ms. Horowitz said, ''went from guilds through mutual aid societies through craft unions and through industrial unionism. You're not going to persuade me that there is not going to be a new form of unionism. The story's not over on what we're creating.''

HEADLINE: O.K., Financial Planners, Grab a Calculator and Let's Get Started

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN

 BODY:
The only way to know whether you have saved enough for retirement is, when you suck in your last breath, for someone to show you your bank statement. 
 And you smile.
Until then, you'll have to depend on financial planners and software. 
 In all the debate over whether Americans are saving too much or too little, there is considerable agreement on a few things. For instance, it pays to start saving early because the power of compounding, especially in a tax-free account, means you'll have more money later. The other advice that everyone gives the nod to is that you need a plan and you need to revisit that plan every year. 
 Start with the calculators provided by a company that manages 401(k) plans and individual retirement accounts. Fidelity discovered that just doing that is intimidating for the majority of people. It created a really simple one called myPlan Snapshot, which is available to anyone on the main page of fidelity.com. It asks five simple questions that require no research or digging up old brokerage statements to answer. 
 The result is a simple graph showing what you need and how close you are to getting there. Then it offers to take you to a more sophisticated analysis, called Retirement Quick Check, that requires about 30 minutes of effort. 
 Both of those calculators, like most offered by financial services companies, use industry-accepted rules of thumbs to determine how much you need to save. ''One of the downfalls of an online calculator is they take middle-ground assumptions,'' said Geoff Brooks, senior vice president for retirement services at HSBC, the financial services company. So the advice is not finely tailored. 
 When you are comfortable with retirement planning, you need to take a step further. The two hardest things for most people to figure out on their own is how long they will live in retirement and how much risk they should take in their retirement investments. The industry's rule of thumb for determining longevity is add two years to what your parent of the same sex lived, if, of course, that parent died of a natural cause. But that rule needs to be stretched if you are fit and active and dad was not (and not terribly helpful if your parents are still living). 
 ''People are underestimating longevity consistently,'' by about five years on average, Mr. Brooks said. ''It is that kind of thing that undermines the planning.''
 Determining risk tolerance is important because, said Christopher Jones, chief investment officer for Financial Engines, ''if you take less risk, you need to save more.''
 The retirement calculator at FinancialEngines.com, which costs $150 to use for a full year, helps solve that problem. It runs what is called a Monte Carlo simulation to give you an idea of what the risks are. You are presented with a series of portfolios containing different kinds of investments and the probability of meeting your retirement goals through each one. 
 For example, a rich person can afford to take less risk and could be in safe government bonds like Treasury inflation-protected securities or TIPS. What does it matter if a rich person's money does not double in a decade; she's already rich. But a poor person has to take the higher risk of investing in stocks. He needs the money and actually has less downside risk than he thinks. Why? He didn't have that much to lose. A well-designed program or a well-informed planner up on the latest economic research can sort this out. 
 The research by Laurence J. Kotlikoff, a Boston University economics professor, adds another dimension to retirement planning. He argues that most current calculators overestimate the amount of savings needed because they rely on the rules of thumb rather than an analysis of spending habits.
 Mr. Kotlikoff's ESPlanner software, which he sells for $150 at esplanner.com, springs from that work. Like FinancialEngines, it requires considerable effort by the user. It asks for a lot of financial details about investments, life insurance and even your Social Security contributions. 
 When it has all the information, ESPlanner presents a series of graphs and charts that offers recommendations. It also runs Monte Carlo simulations so you can adjust the types of investments you make. 
 ''Everyone is different,'' Mr. Kotlikoff said, ''and the small ways they are different makes a difference in how they plan to save and spend.''

HEADLINE: A Breadwinner Rethinks Gender Roles 

BYLINE: By M.P. DUNLEAVEY

 BODY:
WHEN my son was born last fall, my husband and I had a plan. After a short maternity leave, I would continue to work, and he would quit his job to take care of the baby.
 I didn't think of myself as becoming the breadwinner; I had always earned the higher income. The fact that my mate would have a job at home, just not a paying one for now, didn't bother me.
The main hurdle, we assumed, would be figuring out how to afford the shift from two incomes to one. That has turned out to be the least of our problems. The real challenge is navigating the kinds of financial and emotional issues that you can't enter into a calculator or plug into a spreadsheet. 
 Like so many women raised at the tail end of feminism's first wave, I assumed that my spouse and I would enjoy a relationship based on equality. Equality is an overworked word, but to me it meant sharing the income, chores and child care. 
 So when my husband asked me the other day, ''Did your concept of 'equality' ever include supporting the family?'' I had to admit that my answer was no.
 I wanted it to be yes. If men could provide for their wives and families, as they have traditionally in many cultures, why shouldn't women feel just fine about assuming that role themselves? Why didn't I?
 To put it simply, because we're not there yet, says Kathleen Gerson, a co-author with Jerry A. Jacobs of ''The Time Divide: Work, Family and Gender Inequality'' (Harvard, 2004). ''We are all quite comfortable with the dual-earner household. It's become a cultural template,'' she said. ''But for some reason we hit a roadblock when it comes to single-income households where the single earner is a woman.''
 According to Ms. Gerson's research, the number of households where the wife is the sole earner, from 1970 to 2000, jumped from about 4.1 percent to over 7 percent, and has grown since then. That does not include women who are the primary earners in their families.
 A 2003 survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated that about a third of wives earned more than their husbands. And about 43 percent of household income overall was earned by women, according to a 2003 study by the Families and Work Institute, a group in New York.
 This data doesn't begin to reveal the uncomfortable situation that breadwinner women are in: How to renegotiate expectations for everything from who manages the money to who does the laundry -- when you're C.F.O. of the household.
 When I say uncomfortable, I'm trying to be polite. The women I know in these shoes are seething -- with uncertainty, resentment, anxiety and frustration. The patterns that seem ''normal'' when the husband is the breadwinner don't hold up when women earn most or even all of the income.
 That is partly because ''men have a sense of esteem, of identity that comes with being the provider,'' says Barbara Risman, professor of sociology at the University of Chicago. ''Women don't get the same identity benefit -- there's a sense that one has a double burden.''
 Take my own situation: I'm supporting the family economically -- my husband is supporting us domestically. While I write, he cooks, cleans, shops and takes care of our son. It sounds like an idyllic 21st-century twist on the old ''Father Knows Best'' scenario. Yet I alternate between pride in our arrangement -- and terror that I'll be the breadwinner forever.
 DOES the fact that he's doing so-called women's work have so little value in my eyes -- or am I afraid of how others might view a man whose contribution can't be measured in dollars? Am I a Susie homemaker wannabe because I sometimes pray my husband will decide to go to law school and earn a good living?
 That sounds petty -- especially because, with deepest thanks to my husband, I'm earning a good living. But for many frustrated women, financial power hasn't created the balance they were hoping for, and they're still working what the sociologist Arlie Hochschild dubbed ''the second shift.'' As one breadwinner friend of mine put it, quoting an old Enjoli perfume commercial about a woman who ''can bring home the bacon/fry it up in a pan'': ''I didn't think I'd have to serve the bacon and clean the pan, too.''
 And I didn't think I'd feel so guilty, or derelict in my womanly duties, when my husband is quick to comfort our fussy 4-month-old -- or reminds me where we keep the muffin tin. Or that I'd feel so much chest-tightening pressure when I monitor our bills -- or remind myself that if I don't sign us up for life insurance, nobody will. Because it's my job.

HEADLINE: Sales of New Homes Rise for 2nd Month

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 26 

 BODY:
New-home sales increased in December for a second consecutive month, raising hopes that the worst of the housing downturn is coming to an end.
 The Commerce Department reported Friday that sales last month rose 4.8 percent after a 7.4 percent rise in November. 
Those two increases, however, were not enough to salvage the full year, which had sales of 1.06 million units, down 17.3 percent from 2005. That was the biggest decline since 1990, when sales fell 17.8 percent.
 The housing bust has come after a boom in which sales of both new and existing homes set records for five consecutive years. Helped by the lowest mortgage rates in four decades, the sales surge was bolstered by investors buying in hopes of reselling the properties for quick profits. Analysts attribute the declines in 2006 to a cooling of that speculation. 
 The median price of a new home sold in 2006 rose 1.8 percent, to $245,300, compared with a 9 percent gain in 2005.
 David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, said he looked for home prices to remain depressed in 2007 as builders try to reduce high levels of unsold homes.
 He said his organization's January survey of builder sentiment showed continued use of incentives to clear the backlog, with 60 percent of builders surveyed offering optional items like kitchen upgrades or decks at no charge, compared with 41 percent at the beginning of 2006.
 Other incentives include paying closing costs, which 52 percent of builders said they did, compared with 31 percent a year earlier, and paying buyers' financing points on loans, something 30 percent said they did.
 The report on new homes came after a report on Thursday that sales of existing homes fell 8.4 percent last year, to 6.48 million units, the biggest decline since 1989.
 New-home sales in December rose in all parts of the country except the West, which posted a 4.4 percent decline. Sales rose 27.3 percent in the Northeast, 26.6 percent in the Midwest and 0.3 percent in the South.
 Regarding another sector of the economy, the Commerce Department said orders to factories for big-ticket manufactured goods rose in December by 3.1 percent, the largest gain in three months, giving hope that manufacturing will not be seriously affected by the slowdown in housing.
 The increase was led by demand for commercial aircraft and the biggest increase in orders for cars and trucks in more than two years. 
 Excluding transportation, these orders increased 2.3 percent, the best showing in that category since March and better than analysts had expected.
 For all of 2006, new orders rose 7 percent, compared with an 8.6 percent increase in 2005.

HEADLINE: Not Much Market for Worry Beads in the Executive Suites 

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
To chief executives, the threat of global warming seems very real in Asia, but not in the United States or Russia.
 A survey of chief executives around the world, released at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this week, found widespread optimism about profits and nearly universal complaints about excessive regulation of business. 
 Over all, 40 percent of the chief executives surveyed said they were either somewhat concerned or extremely concerned about global warming. But in the United States, the figure was less than half as high, only 18 percent. By contrast, the figure was 49 percent for chief executives in China, 60 percent for South Korean chiefs and 70 percent for Japanese bosses.
 ''Asian C.E.O.'s see global warming as worth worrying about,'' commented Samuel A. DiPiazza, the chief executive of PricewaterhouseCoopers, which conducted the poll via phone and face-to-face interview from September to December of last year.
 Referring to a surprisingly warm winter in this ski resort, he added, ''Maybe the North American C.E.O.'s will notice there is a lot more green outside than snow.'' A snowstorm soon arrived, however.
 Russian executives were even less worried than the Americans. Just one of the 31 Russians interviewed admitted to having a moderate concern about global warming, and none said they were extremely concerned.
 Within Western Europe, the figures were all over the place. Italian bosses voiced less concern than Americans, but more than half of the German chief executives said they were worried. 
 The survey of 1,084 executives also asked if companies were devoting resources to dealing with global warming. Around the globe, 46 percent of the companies said they had spent some money, but in the United States the figure was just 26 percent.
 There may be some cultural differences at work, at least in terms of what chief executives think is expected of them. American chief executives were hesitant to say they were extremely concerned about any of the 17 risks they were asked about, perhaps thinking that to admit such concerns would be to acknowledge they were not on top of the situation. Only two issues -- overregulation and dealing with low-cost competitors -- were of extreme concern to as many as a quarter of the American chief executives.
 Japanese chief executives, on the other hand, say they are concerned about almost everything. A majority of Japanese chiefs are extremely concerned by most of the issues. 
 One issue of relatively little concern in Europe and the Americas -- but of considerable concern in Asia -- is the risk of a downturn in major economies. That risk is of extreme concern to only 8 percent of German executives, 18 percent of British bosses and 15 percent of those in the United States. In Latin America, the figure is just 7 percent. In Russia, it is 10 percent.
 But in South Korea, 87 percent of companies say they are extremely concerned about such a downturn, as are 61 percent of Japanese companies and 45 percent of Chinese bosses. Those who have prospered from exporting to Europe and America are not completely sanguine that the good times will continue.

HEADLINE: Arena Fit for Quinnipiac's Ambition

BYLINE: By JEFF HOLTZ

 BODY:
Last Saturday, New Haven Coliseum, once home to the popular but long ago dismantled Knighthawks of the American Hockey League, was demolished in favor of downtown redevelopment.
 But a week later, several miles to the north in Hamden, a new chapter in Connecticut's hockey history is being written. Quinnipiac University, a private college with 7,400 students, will open the $52 million TD Banknorth Sports Center on campus.
 The center has two arenas, one with 3,200 seats for hockey and another with 3,500 seats for basketball. And while the center's first event is a sold-out basketball doubleheader today, the men's hockey game tomorrow at noon against Holy Cross, also sold out and to be broadcast on ESPNU, is probably the weekend's main event. 
 For Quinnipiac, the move from Northford Ice Pavilion, a typical suburban rink a town away that they shared with high school teams and youth leagues, was well timed. In its second season in the Eastern College Athletic Conference -- which includes Cornell, Harvard, Dartmouth, Colgate and Yale -- Quinnipiac began the weekend in first place with an 8-3-3 conference record (11-8-4 over all) and ranked No. 20 in the USCHO.com/CSTV poll.
 Last season, the team finished 20-18-1 over all and in ninth place in the league at 8-13-1. Quinnipiac beat Harvard and Dartmouth in its first conference games. 
 Coach Rand Pecknold, who took over a Division II program with midnight practices and barely enough players in 1994, said the team's offense was largely responsible for the turnaround.
 ''We've got three lines with a lot of high-end players who can score,'' he said. ''We still need to improve on defense, but that's a good problem to have. There are a lot of college teams out there that are having trouble scoring.''
 Pecknold said that before talk of a new arena, he mostly had to settle for one-dimensional players. Lately, however, he has been able to bring in premium prospects like Brendan Wong, who was first in the league with 17 goals and is considered one of the best freshmen in the nation; Bryan Leitch, who was last season's conference rookie of the year; and Jamie Bates, a junior forward.
 ''It's been great to talk about this place, show kids pictures of it and bring them up here while it was being built,'' Pecknold said of the new arena. ''But now we're going to have groups of recruits at these games this week. It's going to be a big sell for us.''
 Jack McDonald, Quinnipiac's athletic director, said he expected the other homes games this week, Tuesday night against Harvard and Friday night against Yale, would be sellouts, too. At least 2,500 tickets have been sold for each of the team's remaining eight home games.
 McDonald said the building's modern training areas, locker rooms, offices and 135-seat private reception room would draw not only fans, but also top recruits and the country's top teams from other conferences to play there.
 ''It's going to allow us to host some of the biggest names in college hockey, like Minnesota, Boston College and Boston University,'' he said. ''It's also going to allow us to be on televised games that will get us seen all over the world.''
 Steve Hagwell, the conference's commissioner, said the new arena was partly why the league admitted Quinnipiac two years ago. He also said he was not surprised the team was doing well.
 ''They've won championships in other conferences, and they've been to the N.C.A.A. tournament,'' Hagwell said. ''Some people may have thought it would take them time, but their history said otherwise.''
 Rich Coppola, the sports director at WTIC-TV, the Fox affiliate in Hartford, said he thought Quinnipiac has made great strides in a short period. ''In some ways, it's similar to the way UConn women's basketball grew,'' he said.
 Yale plays in front of good crowds at the 3,400-seat Ingalls Rink near its campus in downtown New Haven. ''It will help develop the rivalry between Yale and Quinnipiac,'' said Steve Conn, a spokesman for Yale's athletic department, referring to the new arena.
 Reid Cashman, Quinnipiac's captain and a senior defenseman from Red Wing, Minn., said the buzz about the arena has energized the team.
 ''The other day we were walking to class and we saw the students waiting in a line that went from the gym to the library to buy tickets,'' said Cashman, a two-time All-American and a nominee for this year's Hobey Baker award, given to the best player in college hockey. ''We've been hearing about this all year.''
 McDonald said everything coming together was the result of good planning by the administration. 
 ''We'd like to be a national contender, and all of the pieces are in place,'' Cashman said. ''And someday, when the puck bounces right and the penalties are at minimum, maybe we can get to the pinnacle of college hockey.''

HEADLINE: Preparations Set, Giuliani Now Faces a Big Choice 

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS; Richard Perez-Pena contributed reporting from Bretton Woods, N.H.

 BODY:
Rudolph W. Giuliani, who developed a national reputation for decisive and reassuring leadership after 9/11, now faces the odd challenge of having to reassure some supporters that he can be decisive about a very different issue: running for president.
 Even as his fellow Republican John McCain and fellow New Yorker Hillary Rodham Clinton have all but formally declared their candidacies, Mr. Giuliani has proceeded more cautiously.
Since last month, he has formed an exploratory committee, more aggressively recruited a campaign staff and moved to divest himself of one of his companies. And he is now visiting New Hampshire, home to the first primary, for the second time in three months. But he has studiously avoided making a public commitment to run. 
 Asked recently in Delaware about his political plans, he offered an ambiguous reply: ''I think the biggest question you have to ask is, 'Can you really lead the country?' If I believe that I can do it, then I will, and if I don't, then I'll support somebody else.'' 
 He ducked the question again yesterday, telling reporters in Bretton Woods, N.H., that he would not be rushed by contenders who are already entering the race. ''You should do it when you feel it's the right time,'' he said.
 Despite the delay, his aides argue that the accelerated pace of early primaries next year actually benefits a well-established figure like Mr. Giuliani -- much, they say, as his national stature will enable him to close whatever gaps now exist in fund-raising and organization. 
 Frank Luntz, a Republican consultant who is not now working for any of the presidential campaigns, described Mr. Giuliani as ''the only candidate who can set his own timetable, because he is so established in the minds of the voters.'' 
 Nonetheless, doubts have been raised about the proverbial fire in his belly. Some New Yorkers in particular recall his decision to quit the Senate race against Mrs. Clinton in 2000 after running for months and raising millions of dollars but never formally declaring his candidacy.
 Mr. Giuliani, already hobbled then by a messy separation from his wife, withdrew after finding that he had prostate cancer. But he was also ambivalent about the prospect of being a legislator.
 Wrestling then with which course of medical treatment to pursue, he said on the day he withdrew: ''And about the decision to run: I was almost in the same position, not being able to make it, which has never really happened to me. I've always been able to make decisions.'' 
 David Garth, a media consultant who helped steer the Giuliani mayoral campaigns, said that while he had no reason to doubt a candidacy this time, ''it's a question of where his head is, as it was in the Senate race.'' 
 Michael R. Long, chairman of the New York State Conservative Party, voiced uncertainty.
 ''He called me before Thanksgiving just to touch base and said he'd like to talk, and I haven't heard from him since,'' Mr. Long said. ''We went through this in the United States Senate race. Whether he pulls the trigger or not, I don't know.''
 Fred Siegel, a Cooper Union historian and Giuliani biographer, dismissed the analogy to 2000. ''The question is there in Washington,'' Mr. Siegel said, but ''I think it's mistaken.''
 Mr. Giuliani's aides maintain that he is being held to a standard different from that of other prospective candidates who have not formally declared. And anyway, they say, his ambivalence, whether real or merely perceived, may well vanish soon. Mr. Giuliani, who will address the Republican State Convention in New Hampshire today, is to travel to California and South Carolina next month, and supporters in New Jersey are preparing to announce endorsements next week. 
 California and New Jersey are two of a number of populous states that are expected to shift their 2008 primaries to February, very early in the campaign season, and South Carolina's comes even earlier, a week after New Hampshire's.
 ''Folks who believe he is not running do so at their own peril,'' said Michael DuHaime, former political director of the Republican National Committee, who is heading Mr. Giuliani's exploratory effort.
 ''There is a spin out there that the campaign is further behind than it is, that Rudy may not be serious, and that is being done deliberately to keep us from certain fund-raisers,'' said Mr. DuHaime, a native New Jerseyan who begins working for Mr. Giuliani full time next week.
 Kieran Mahoney, a Republican consultant in New York who is working for another presidential prospect, former Gov. James S. Gilmore III of Virginia, said he had been unconvinced of a Giuliani run until recently, when the former mayor stepped up the pace of hiring a campaign staff and reports emerged that he had taken steps to sell the biggest division of his consulting business.
 ''Stop listening to what they say and look at their behavior,'' Mr. Mahoney said of potential candidates in general. ''Giuliani is, in fact, an active participant in the marketplace in terms of scooping up talent and making business decisions that are economically injurious and politically positive. I have been a skeptic. I am now a believer.''
 Even Mr. Giuliani himself, though continuing to demur, did drop a hint or two in New Hampshire yesterday, saying at a Chamber of Commerce dinner that he might return later this year to play golf, or for other reasons.
 Some consultants to Mr. Giuliani's rivals, and even some of his supporters, say that given the campaign's relatively late start, his inner circle may be overconfident about his ability to build a respectable war chest by March 31, the first of the deadlines for reporting campaign contributions. A poor sum then would make it all the harder to attract further donations, and, with more candidates now choosing not to participate in the federal campaign financing system, the importance of fund-raising has increased, as has competition for the millions at stake.
 Already, Mr. Giuliani is being measured against a 140-page game plan drafted by a member of his campaign staff last fall. That document, which Giuliani advisers say was stolen from them, set a fund-raising goal of at least $25 million by the end of March, but some potential fund-raisers and donors whom it identified have already enlisted in support of other candidates.
 Asked about the $25 million figure, Mr. DuHaime, who did not join the campaign until after the document was drafted, replied: ''What is important to us is we have a strong number in that first period, and I'm not going to put the number out there publicly. We're certain we're going to have enough money to be competitive.''
 In New Jersey, where two fund-raisers have been scheduled and a spectrum of local politicians are expected to endorse Mr. Giuliani next week, one supporter, Steven E. Some, said that he had worked in five presidential campaigns and that ''selling Rudy is the easiest sell I've ever had in my life.''
 ''I have no doubt whatever that he's in this for the long term,'' said Mr. Some, a veteran political consultant. ''I've never had anyone come up to me to raise any doubt about whether he's going to go the course.''
 Still, an underlying perception exists, and is being stoked, that Mr. Giuliani has not committed himself to a campaign, in part because he is reluctant to relinquish the lucrative consulting business that he founded after he left the mayor's office five years ago. Referring to Mr. Giuliani's exploratory activity, Harold M. Ickes, a longtime adviser to Mrs. Clinton, said, ''I thought he was just advertising so he can increase his fees.''
 Mr. Mahoney, the Republican consultant, acknowledged that one challenge facing Mr. Giuliani would be determining how to expand his political base rightward.
 ''In order to become the mayor of New York City,'' Mr. Mahoney said, ''you have to do things that are not wholly consistent with being the Republican nominee for president.''

HEADLINE: NATO Allies Wary of Sending More Troops to Afghanistan

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Jan. 26 

 BODY:
America's European allies on Friday remained noncommittal about sending additional troops to Afghanistan, even as the Bush administration sought to inject new energy into the NATO mission against the Taliban by offering more American soldiers and money.
 Officially, the language at a NATO meeting here on Friday reflected resolve and commitment toward Afghanistan. NATO ''is stepping up its game in Afghanistan on all fronts,'' said Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, the alliance's secretary general. ''The fact that you saw so many people from the international community sitting around the table is a strong message itself.''
But beyond the sound bites, the realities that have troubled the NATO mission in Afghanistan since the 26-member trans-Atlantic alliance took command last year remained on display. France and Germany continued to limit their combat role; both countries have refused to deploy troops in the south of the country, where Taliban forces are strongest. Germany's Parliament has yet to approve a proposal to send six Tornado reconnaissance jets to the south. 
 Meanwhile, Prime Minister Romano Prodi of Italy is battling allies in his own government who oppose the Afghan mission and want the government to set a deadline for withdrawing the country's 1,800 troops. While Mr. Prodi's government passed a measure on Friday to renew financing for Italy's troops in Afghanistan, it did so without the support of all of Mr. Prodi's coalition partners, and Italian officials said it was unlikely that Mr. Prodi could rally support for any increase in troops.
 The United States sought to lead by example, as Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who called for the Brussels meeting in the hope of spurring more action from the Europeans, told the assembled ministers that President Bush would ask Congress for $10.6 billion in additional financial assistance for Afghanistan. 
 Bush administration officials said on Thursday that the Pentagon would extend the Afghan tours of 3,200 American soldiers. Ms. Rice added that beyond the extension of the tours, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates would further expand the number of American troops, ''partly through extra forces.''
 ''Every one of us must take a hard look at what more we can do to help the Afghan people,'' Ms. Rice said, according to a State Department statement. ''We need additional forces on the ground -- ready to fight. And we need to provide greater support for the development of Afghan institutions, especially its security forces.''
 American officials say that Taliban fighters are mounting increasingly brazen cross-border attacks from Pakistan and that they are preparing to resume attacks in the spring, as they have done every year since the American invasion deposed the Taliban in 2001. 
 ''If there is to be a 'spring offensive,' it must be our offensive,'' she said. ''It must be a political campaign, an economic campaign, a diplomatic campaign, and, yes, a military campaign.''
 But that military campaign remains about 15 percent short of what American and NATO commanders say they need on the ground to fight the Taliban. 
 The 3,200 American troops whose departure has been delayed would bring the American force level in Afghanistan to around 24,000. About half of those are part of the NATO mission in Afghanistan, while the other half are engaged in American-led counterterrorism operations. About 20,000 soldiers from other NATO countries are also deployed in Afghanistan.
 Britain has the second-largest contingent of soldiers in Afghanistan, with 6,000 troops. 
 NATO said Friday that an alliance airstrike destroyed a Taliban command post in southern Afghanistan, killing a man suspected of being a senior militant leader. Also on Friday, a suicide bomber blew himself up outside the offices of an aid group in Helmand Province, wounding a policeman and two others. 
 American and NATO officials are now pinning their hopes for troop increases on a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Seville, Spain, next month. Mr. de Hoop Scheffer, the NATO secretary general, said he was ''relatively optimistic'' that more troops would be forthcoming. 
 ''Everybody understands that it's vital that we achieve our goals this year,'' said Richard A. Boucher, the assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian affairs. 

Afghan Lawmaker Is Killed
By The New York Times
 KABUL, Afghanistan, Jan. 26 -- An Afghan lawmaker was shot to death on Friday while he was walking from his home to a mosque for Friday Prayer, officials said.
 The lawmaker, Maulvi Mohammad Islam Mohammadi, 67, was from the northern province of Samangan. The reason for the killing was unclear, and no one immediately claimed responsibility, but there were fears among legislators that the attack might have been politically motivated.
 According to election law, when a member of Parliament dies the candidate who had the next-highest vote tally becomes the successor.
 ''It is a danger signal for the Afghan members of Parliament if the political competition causes the terror'' for lawmakers, said Fawzia Kofi, the deputy speaker of Parliament.

HEADLINE: Canada Will Pay $9.75 Million to Man Sent to Syria and Tortured

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

DATELINE: OTTAWA, Jan. 26 

 BODY:
Maher Arar, the Canadian software engineer who was detained by American officials in 2002 and deported to Syria, where he was jailed and regularly tortured, will receive 11.5 million Canadian dollars ($9.75 million) in compensation from the Canadian government, under a settlement announced Friday.
 The compensation ends a lawsuit brought by Mr. Arar and follows a recommendation from a judicial inquiry into his case. That inquiry said the expulsion to Syria was caused by false assertions made by the Canadian police to United States officials, saying that Mr. Arar was an Islamic extremist linked to Al Qaeda. 
Mr. Arar, traveling on a Canadian passport, was pulled aside by immigration agents in New York as he changed planes on his way home to Ottawa from Tunisia. He was instead flown to Syria, his birthplace.
 The Canadian judicial inquiry cleared Mr. Arar of any terrorism connections in September 2006, and concluded that anonymous Canadian officials had orchestrated a defamation campaign against him after his return from Syria in October 2003.
 As he announced the settlement on Friday, Prime Minister Stephen Harper offered a formal apology to Mr. Arar and his family for their ''terrible ordeal.''
 Mr. Arar, whose career was destroyed by the episode and who has suffered emotional problems since returning to Canada, said the government's apology was more important for him than the financial settlement.
 ''The government of Canada and the prime minister have acknowledged my innocence,'' Mr. Arar told a news conference. ''This means the world to me.'' 
 After apologizing, Mr. Harper renewed calls for the United States to remove Mr. Arar from its terrorist watch list. ''Canada fully understands and appreciates and shares the United States' concerns with regard to security,'' he said. ''However, the Canadian government has every right to go to bat when it believes one of its citizens has been treated unfairly by another government.''
 The case has strained the otherwise cordial relationship between Mr. Harper's Conservative government and the Bush administration.
 Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales and Michael Chertoff, the homeland security secretary, have told Canadian officials that Mr. Arar is still on the watch list because of independent information about him obtained independently by law enforcement agencies in the United States.
 After reviewing a confidential file concerning Mr. Arar, however, Stockwell Day, Canada's public safety minister, said that it contained ''nothing new'' that justified blocking Mr. Arar from entering the United States.
 This week, David H. Wilkins, the United States ambassador to Canada, publicly rebuked Mr. Day. ''It's a little presumptuous for him to say who the United States can and cannot allow into our country,'' Mr. Wilkins said at a news conference in Edmonton, Alberta.
 Mr. Arar has been unemployed since his ordeal in Syria, where he had been held for 10 months in a 3-by-6-foot cell and beaten repeatedly, often with a frayed electrical cable.
 According to Mr. Harper, the settlement amount was based on an estimate of what a court would award Mr. Arar, and includes about $850,000 for legal costs. 
 Mr. Arar said: ''I wish money could buy my life back. That's my biggest wish.''
 He has also sued American officials and agencies. A United States District Court judge in Brooklyn dismissed the suit last February, largely on jurisdictional grounds, but the decision is being appealed.

HEADLINE: Spitzer Sees Health Savings; Hospitals Call Them Cuts 

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 26 

 BODY:
Gov. Eliot Spitzer said on Friday that he would seek billions of dollars in Medicaid and health care cost savings when he unveils his first executive budget on Wednesday. 
 But while he repeatedly used the word ''reform'' in a speech here, hospital groups heard the word ''cut.'' That dissonance will probably set the stage for what could be a fierce battle in the Legislature over the governor's plan.
''For too long, we have financed the health care system we have, not the health care system we need, so we're left pumping billions of dollars into a broken system,'' Mr. Spitzer said. ''What went wrong is that health care decision making became co-opted by every interest other than the patient's interest.'' 
 Among the governor's proposals were eliminating the annual inflation adjustments on Medicaid payments to hospitals and nursing homes and substantially changing the way the state subsidizes health care providers and graduate medical programs. 
 ''New York spends more on hospitals and nursing-home care than any state in the nation,'' he said. ''This spending is unsustainable and unwise.''
 He said his administration would seek to save $200 million annually by taking steps to reduce Medicaid prescription drug costs and overhaul the Department of Health. He said he would also follow up on his campaign pledge to provide coverage for the state's 400,000 uninsured children. 
 The proposals sent shudders through some corners of the health care world. 
 ''These are many of the same budget cuts that Governor Pataki proposed, and they were rejected because, frankly, they aren't reforms,'' said Daniel Sisto, the president of the Healthcare Association of New York State. 
 ''By his tone today, he intends to make it a serious fight,'' he said. ''The Legislature knows that these cuts, now two decades old, do not constitute reform. I'm working on the assumption we can persuade them to reject them.''
 But many were pleased by what they heard, from fiscal conservatives who have called for an end to Albany's spending growth to health care advocacy groups. 
 ''We think he is taking a very bold step and putting New York in the lead in the nation in terms of providing health care coverage for children,'' said Donna Lawrence, executive director of the Children's Defense Fund New York.
 Edmund J. McMahon, the director of the Empire Center for New York State Policy, an affiliate of the policy group the Manhattan Institute, said, ''I think he set exactly the right tone. The patient-first premise is exactly where we need to be, and I think it's a very positive step.''
 Mr. Spitzer said the state was paying far more on graduate medical education than other states -- $77,000 per medical resident compared with $21,000 in California. 
 ''We discovered that many of those dollars are going to pay for phantom residents and doctors who don't even exist,'' he said. 
 Mr. Sisto said he objected to what he called the ''prosecutorial rhetoric'' in the governor's speech and his description of past deals. 
 ''We should be having a policy debate about the future, not lamenting the past,'' he said.
 Mr. Spitzer specifically criticized a 2002 deal involving Gov. George E. Pataki and 1199 S.E.I.U. United Healthcare Workers East that was used in part to provide raises for health care workers. ''As a result of this deal, well over $3 billion alone was pumped into the health care delivery system with little or no accountability,'' he said. A spokeswoman for the union did not return calls seeking comment.
 Kenneth E. Raske, the president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, said, ''Cuts to me do not spell reform, particularly when the hospital sector is not at all driving the increases in Medicaid.''
 Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, a Manhattan Democrat who is chairman of the Assembly's Health Committee, said getting the proposals through the Legislature would ''depend on a lot of the details.''
 ''Some of the Medicaid cuts will create problems, but I think the policy directions are terrific,'' he said. ''There is certainly an enormous amount here that I will fight very hard to enact.''

HEADLINE: Mr. Bush's Oil Security Blanket

 BODY:
One of the stranger and so far unexplained items in President Bush's energy program is his proposal to double the capacity of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, to 1.5 billion barrels, over the next 20 years. The proposal carries a $65 billion price tag -- one of several reasons Congress should question Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman closely when he comes looking for the money. 
 The reserve's purpose is to provide an emergency supply of oil in the event of, say, a terrorist attack somewhere along the global oil supply chain or a natural disaster that sharply limits imports for a short time. The United States is highly vulnerable to such interruptions. It has only 3 percent of global oil reserves but accounts for 25 percent of consumption -- more than 20 million barrels a day, about 60 percent of it imported. The reserve now holds 55 days worth of net oil imports. After the increase, there would be an estimated 97 days of protection.
A larger reserve would seem to make sense in the post-9/11 world, and last year's energy bill did in fact authorize an expansion to one billion barrels. But is there nothing better to do with the money? Might it not be more usefully deployed developing alternative fuels or more efficient vehicles, thus reducing the nation's dependence on oil and its vulnerability to future shocks? 
 The $2.7 billion the administration proposes to spend on this project each year for the next 20 years is three times the amount that Congress authorized last year for the Energy Department's entire research and development program for alternative energy sources. It may be necessary to increase backup supplies. But the administration would be a lot more persuasive if it displayed a deeper commitment to programs that would provide lasting security by reducing Americans' consumption of oil, rather than just squirreling it away.

HEADLINE: A Lovely Parting Gift For Her Ex-Employer 

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
In her first public appearance since her well-publicized firing as Wal-Mart's top advertising executive, Julie Roehm resurfaced at the Reuters Newsmakers panel discussion on Super Bowl advertising in Times Square on Wednesday, and she quickly demonstrated that she had lost none of her ability to deliver pithy, quotable remarks. 
 Asked where she is considering moving now that she no longer works for Wal-Mart, Ms. Roehm replied, smiling, ''In a town that doesn't end in 'ville,' '' a sly reference to the rural home of her former employer, Bentonville, Ark.
Ms. Roehm made no mention that she had filed a lawsuit last month against Wal-Mart, accusing it of breach of contract and fraud in connection with her dismissal. Wal-Mart, in court papers filed in response on Jan. 18, denied her accusations. STUART ELLIOTT

HEADLINE: Awaiting The Day When Everyone Writes Software

BYLINE: By JASON PONTIN. 
Jason Pontin is the editor in chief and publisher of Technology Review, a magazine and Web site owned by M.I.T. E-mail: pontin@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
BJARNE STROUSTRUP, the designer of C++, the most influential programming language of the last 25 years, has said that ''our technological civilization depends on software.'' True, but most software isn't much good. Too many programs are ugly: inelegant, unreliable and not very useful. Software that satisfies and delights is as rare as a phoenix. 
 All this does more than frustrate computer users. Bad software is terrible for business and the economy. Software failures cost $59.5 billion a year, the National Institute of Standards and Technology concluded in a 2002 study, and fully 25 percent of commercial software projects are abandoned before completion. Of projects that are finished, 75 percent ship late or over budget.
The reasons aren't hard to divine. Programmers don't know what a computer user wants because they spend their days interacting with machines. They hunch over keyboards, pecking out individual lines of code in esoteric programming languages, like medieval monks laboring over illustrated manuscripts. 
 Worse, programs today contain millions of lines of code, and programmers are fallible like all other humans: there are, on average, 100 to 150 bugs per 1,000 lines of code, according to a 1994 study by the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. No wonder so much software is so bad: programmers are drowning in ignorance, complexity and error.
 Charles Simonyi, the chief executive of Intentional Software, a start-up in Bellevue, Wash., believes that there is another way. He wants to overthrow conventional coding for something he calls ''intentional programming,'' in which programmers would talk to machines as little as possible. Instead, they would concentrate on capturing the intentions of computer users.
 Mr. Simonyi, the former chief architect of Microsoft, is arguably the most successful pure programmer in the world, with a personal fortune that Forbes magazine estimates at $1 billion. There may be richer programmer-billionaires -- Bill Gates of Microsoft and Larry Page of Google come to mind -- but they became rich by founding and managing technology ventures; Mr. Simonyi rose mainly by writing code. 
 He designed Microsoft's most successful applications, Word and Excel, and he devised the programming method that the company's software developers have used for the last quarter-century. Mr. Simonyi, 58, was important before he joined Microsoft in 1981, too. He belongs to the fabled generation of supergeeks who invented personal computing at Xerox PARC in the 1970s: there, he wrote the first modern application, a word processor called Bravo that displayed text on a computer screen as it would appear when printed on page. 
 Even at leisure, Mr. Simonyi, who was born in Hungary and taught himself programming by punching machine code on Russian mainframes, is a restless, expansive personality. In April, he will become the fifth space tourist, paying $20 million to board a Russian Soyuz rocket and visit the International Space Station.
 Mr. Simonyi says he is not disgusted with big, bloated, buggy programs like Word and Excel. But he acknowledges that he is disappointed that we have been unable to use ''our incredible computational ability'' to address efficiently ''our practical computational problems.'' 
 ''Software is truly the bottleneck in the high-tech horn of plenty,'' he said. 
 Mr. Simonyi began thinking about a new method for creating software in the mid-1990s, while he was still at Microsoft. But his ideas were so at odds with .Net, the software environment that Microsoft was building then, that he left the company in 2002 to found Intentional Software. 
 ''It was impractical, when Microsoft was making tremendous strides with .Net, to send somebody out from the same organization who says, 'What if you did things in this other, more disruptive way?' '' he said in the January issue of Technology Review . 
 For once, that overfavored word -- ''disruptive'' -- is apt; intentional programming is disruptive. It would automate much of software development. 
 The method begins with the intentions of the people inside an organization who know what a program should do. Mr. Simonyi calls these people ''domain experts,'' and he expects them to work with programmers to list all the concepts the software must possess. 
 The concepts are then translated into a higher-level representation of the software's functions called the domain code, using a tool called the domain workbench. 
 At two conferences last fall, Intentional Software amazed software developers by demonstrating how the workbench could project the intentions of domain experts into a wonderful variety of forms. Using the workbench, domain experts and programmers can imagine the program however they want: as something akin to a PowerPoint presentation, as a flow chart, as a sketch of what they want the actual user screen to look like, or in the formal logic that computer scientists love.
 Thus, programmers and domain experts can fiddle with whatever projections they prefer, editing and re-editing until both parties are happy. Only then is the resulting domain code fed to another program called a generator that manufactures the actual target code that a computer can compile and run. If the software still doesn't do what its users want, the programmers can blithely discard the target code and resume working on the domain workbench with the domain experts.
 As an idea, intentional programming is similar to the word processor that Mr. Simonyi developed at PARC. In the jargon of programming, Bravo was Wysiwyg -- an acronym, pronounced WIZ-e-wig, for ''what you see is what you get.'' Intentional programming also allows computer users to see and change what they are getting. 
 ''Programming is very complicated,'' Mr. Simonyi said. ''Computer languages are really computer-oriented. But we can make it possible for domain experts to provide domain information in their own terms which then directly contributes to the production of the software.''
 Intentional programming has three great advantages: The people who design a program are the ones who understand the task that needs to be automated; that design can be manipulated simply and directly, rather than by rewriting arcane computer code; and human programmers do not generate the final software code, thus reducing bugs and other errors. 
 NOT everyone believes in the promise of intentional programming. There are three common objections. 
 The first is theoretical: it is based on the belief that human intention cannot, in principle, be captured (or, less metaphysically, that computer users don't know what people want). 
 The second is practical: to programmers, the intentional method constitutes an ''abstraction'' of the underlying target code. But most programmers believe that abstractions ''leak'' -- that is, they fail to perfectly represent the thing they are meant to be abstracting, which means software developers must sink their hands into the code anyway. 
 The final objection is cynical: Mr. Simonyi has been working on intentional programming for many years; only two companies, bound to silence by nondisclosure agreements, acknowledge experimenting with the domain workbench and generator. Thus, no one knows if intentional programming works.
 Sheltered by Mr. Simonyi's wealth, Intentional Software seems in no hurry to release an imperfect product. But it is addressing real and pressing problems, and Mr. Simonyi's approach is thrillingly innovative. 
 If intentional programming does what its inventor says, we may have something we have seldom enjoyed as computer users: software that makes us glad.

HEADLINE: Rehabilitating Robert Moses

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
FOR three decades his image has been frozen in time. The bulldozing bully who callously displaced thousands of New Yorkers in the name of urban renewal. The public-works kingpin who championed highways as he starved mass transit. And yes, the visionary idealist who gave New York Lincoln Center and Jones Beach, along with parks, roads, playgrounds and public pools. 
 This is the Robert Moses most of us know today, courtesy of Robert A. Caro's Pulitzer Prize-winning biography from 1974, ''The Power Broker,'' which charts Moses' long reign as city parks commissioner (1934-60) and chairman of the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (1946-68). A 1,286-page book that reads like a novel, it won a Pulitzer Prize and virtually redefined the biographical genre by raising the bar for contemporary research. Today it remains the premier text on the evolution of 20th-century New York, a portrait of a man who used his power without regard for the human toll. 
 But according to the Columbia University architectural historian Hilary Ballon and assorted colleagues, Moses deserves better -- or at least a fresh look. In three exhibitions opening in the next few days -- at the Museum of the City of New York, the Queens Museum of Art and Columbia University -- Ms. Ballon argues that too little attention has been focused on what Moses achieved, versus what he destroyed, and on the enormous bureaucratic hurdles he surmounted to get things done.
 With the city on the brink of a building boom unparalleled since Moses' heyday -- the reconstruction of Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn, an overhaul of the Far West Side, sweeping redevelopment downtown -- Ms. Ballon and other scholars argue that his legacy is more relevant than ever. 
 ''Living in New York, one is aware there has been no evident successor or successors to Moses,'' she said. ''There aren't master builders. Who is looking after the city? How do we build for the future?'' All around New York State, she suggests, people tend to take for granted the parks, playgrounds and housing Moses built, now generally binding forces in those areas, even if the old-style New York neighborhood was of no interest to Moses himself. And were it not for Moses' public infrastructure and his resolve to carve out more space, she argues, New York might not have been able to recover from the blight and flight of the 1970s and '80s and become the economic magnet it is today. 
 ''Every generation writes its own history,'' said Kenneth T. Jackson, a historian of New York City at Columbia who with Ms. Ballon edited ''Robert Moses and the Modern City: The Transformation of New York'' (W. W. Norton), the catalog accompanying the exhibitions. ''It could be that 'The Power Broker' was a reflection of its time: New York was in trouble and had been in decline for 15 years. Now, for a whole host of reasons, New York is entering a new time, a time of optimism, growth and revival that hasn't been seen in half a century. And that causes us to look at our infrastructure.''
 ''A lot of big projects are on the table again, and it kind of suggests a Moses era without Moses,'' he added. 
 As for Mr. Caro, 71, he said he was not informed of the exhibitions in advance, nor is he part of a symposium Thursday at the Museum of the City of New York or other panel discussions pegged to them. Asked how he felt about having been excluded, Mr. Caro said: ''When I am writing a book, I try always to give all sides a chance to express their viewpoint. I guess they didn't want my viewpoint expressed, and not inviting me is certainly an effective means of accomplishing that.'' 
 He will make a solo appearance at the museum on Feb. 11, but only because one of the exhibition's financers, the philanthropist Roger Hertog, argued that Mr. Caro should be included. 
 ''The exhibition elevates Moses' achievements to historic -- almost grandiose -- accomplishment, yet he's a complicated person,'' Mr. Hertog said. ''If you're going to really think about this, there is this looming presence, this thousand-pound gorilla, in the middle of the room, and it's Caro. His interpretation has to be heard as well.''
 Mr. Caro spent seven years on his book, conducting 522 interviews and combing thousands of personal and public documents. To scholars who take a revisionist approach, he urges caution. ''The enduring legacy of Robert Moses includes magnificent achievements, which I celebrated in 'The Power Broker,' '' he said. ''But it is also necessary to look at his overall impact.''
 He cited the ouster of more than half a million people from their homes in the Bronx, on Manhattan's Upper West Side, in Sunset Park in Brooklyn and on Long Island farms for the sake of new highways or ''slum clearance'': evictions that largely could have been avoided by using alternate routes and that in some cases helped create new slums. 
 ''His highways and bridges and tunnels are awesome all right, but no aspect of those highways and bridges and tunnels is as awesome as the congestion on them,'' Mr. Caro said. ''Congestion was always going to be inevitable in New York, but it could have been substantially less had he only combined his roads with the mass transit suggested by so many planners.''
 The institutions involved in the exhibitions say they never sought to whitewash Moses' legacy. ''We set out to come to terms with the enormity of Moses' achievements,'' said Tom Finkelpearl, executive director of the Queens Museum. ''I really anticipated that the show was going to be a major indictment of Moses, and I was genuinely surprised at the result.''
 Each of the exhibitions has a different emphasis. ''Remaking the Metropolis,'' which opens at the Museum of the City of New York on Friday, focuses on Moses' roads, like the Henry Hudson Parkway and the Cross Bronx Expressway; major buildings and monuments (Lincoln Center, the United Nations); and parks (the expansion of Riverside Park, East River Park and recreational spaces in Central Park). Opening Feb. 4 at the Queens Museum of Art (whose forbidding stone building Moses had built for the 1939-40 World's Fair), ''The Road to Recreation'' documents his expansion of roads and recreation in the 1930's: some 416 miles of parkways and 658 playgrounds. ''Slum Clearance and the Superblock Solution,'' which opens on Wednesday at the Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Art Gallery at Columbia University, focuses on Moses' ambitious 1950s urban renewal program. 
 In today's frenetic real estate market, some of those projects are now in the hands of private developers. ''Look at what is happening to Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town,'' Mr. Finkelpearl said, referring to the middle-class apartments that were recently sold, driving rents up. ''That is so out of the spirit of Moses and the public-mindedness of Moses.''
 The shows also document the Moses projects that were never built, like a controversial extension of Fifth Avenue through Washington Square Park, a bridge between the Red Hook section of Brooklyn and Battery Park, and two expressways, one slicing across Midtown and the other across Lower Manhattan.
 MS. BALLON, who spent three years on research for the exhibitions and catalog, said she came away clear-eyed about Moses' flaws, including his failure to grasp the social devastation caused by some of his projects. ''He was perfectly positioned to recognize how any one thing had multiple consequences, like clearing a slum,'' she said, yet ''he purposely chose to ignore these things.''
 But as she studiedthe archives and traveled the city, Ms. Ballon said, she ''became more and more interested in the tangible things he accomplished,'' feeling they were somewhat underrepresented in the Caro book.
 ''I wanted to investigate Moses with this emphasis on the physical form,'' said Ms. Ballon, who specializes in 17th-century European architecture as well as American urbanism and architecture of the 20th century. She said she was impressed by the majesty and durability of projects like Jones Beach's state park, with its costly brick and sandstone bathhouses; Orchard Beach in the Bronx, designed in a graceful crescent (after private bungalows were destroyed); and the city's vast and stately public pools. 
 ''The grandeur of those buildings -- all for the public,'' Ms. Ballon said. ''He executed 17 urban renewal projects in nine years. That's staggering.''
 At Kips Bay Towers, the architect I. M. Pei ''brought reinforced concrete construction to a new level of refinement,'' Ms. Ballon added, ''and the interior garden is a jewel.'' And even the Moses-era housing projects and public buildings that were once scorned as grim and soulless are winning some appreciation because they were built fast and built to last.
 At the same time the catalog she jointly edited includes some pointed criticism. Martha Biondi, a professor of African-American history at Northwestern, faults Moses' prominent role in supporting MetLife's decision to exclude blacks from renting apartments at Stuyvesant Town; Ms. Ballon notes his ''antidemocratic methods and indifference to community values.'' 
 As Mr. Jackson puts it, ''He looks like a pretty good public servant who was in many ways a jerk.''
 Yet Mr. Finkelpearl of the Queens Museum said the exhibition did not set out to make judgments on Moses' character. ''This show is not about Moses, the guy,'' he said. ''It's about what Moses did.''
 Mr. Caro, though, argues that drawing such a distinction is impossible. ''The man is inseparable from the story of the city of New York,'' he said. ''The city now is trying to come to grips with the problems he left.'' 
 Much of the city's current development seeks to redress Moses' legacy, including efforts to reclaim the West Side waterfront (where he built the Henry Hudson Parkway) for public use. To improve mass transit, the city is trying to extend the No. 7 line to 11th Avenue, as well as finally create a Second Avenue subway 50 years after Moses passed over that possibility by funneling hundreds of millions of dollars into roads and bridges for automobiles. 
 Similarly, a major redesign of Lincoln Center by the architects Diller, Scofidio & Renfro aims to open up that campus and make it more inviting, rather than what was originally envisioned: an ivory tower for the performing arts with its back turned on Amsterdam Avenue. 
 Economically and psychologically it has taken city planners decades to forge the resolve to break ground again on a substantial scale. ''We are in a period of time when we have finally overcome a fear of overdevelopment that was in part the result of Moses' excesses,'' said Daniel L. Doctoroff, the city's deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding. ''Part of the reason we haven't been able to do as much is because people overinterpreted the lessons from that period of time.''
 THOUGH the city is building big again, the process by which it's doing so is forever changed. Planners point out that whether a project is driven by the city, like the Javits Convention Center expansion; the state, which initially led efforts to redevelop the World Trade Center site; or a private developer, like the Related Companies' Time Warner Center (or any number of architecturally ambitious condominium projects), checks and balances now guarantee that no one planner can wield the power of Moses. 
 With his multiple hats and broad authority as parks commissioner and Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority chairman, Moses managed to steamroll community opposition and ignore preservation concerns. Today the Landmarks and Preservation Commission, established in 1965, reviews projects like the proposed 30-story tower by Norman Foster in the Upper East Side Historic District, whose height the commission rejected this month. The Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, adopted in 1975, ensures that a project undergoes a thorough public review process. 
 ''Can there be another time when you can get big projects done all over the city?'' Mr. Doctoroff said. ''I think the answer is yes, and we're in one now. Could you ever have one person who with imperiousness, with concentrated power, with lack of community input, could get things done? The answer is no.''
 Nonetheless ''with the exception of the stadium'' -- the Jets arena rejected for Manhattan's Far West Side -- ''there hasn't been a single project we have pushed through that hasn't been approved,'' he said of the city's pet projects. 
 ''This is by far the most ambitious development agenda since the 1930's, but we do it with ample public input to ensure that we get things done sensitively,'' Mr. Doctoroff said. ''We have really learned to listen very carefully.''
 And while Moses had no interest in aesthetics (which may be one reason he could move so quickly), the current city administration emphasizes design in its approval of projects, with standards imposed by officials like Amanda M. Burden, the city planning commissioner, and David Burney at the Department of Design and Construction. 
 The subtitle of Mr. Caro's book is ''Robert Moses and the Fall of New York.'' But ultimately, the exhibitions' organizers say, they felt it was important to judge Moses' impact on New York in the context of what happened across the nation during his tenure, like middle-class flight from cities and the construction of highways that spurred the rise of suburbs. 
 ''What was happening in Detroit and St. Louis?'' Mr. Finkelpearl said. ''Those cities died. Maybe the city was in decline, but not relative to other cities.''
 Ms. Ballon said: ''Moses was symptomatic of a larger historical pattern. What was happening in New York was not so different from what was happening in other places.'' 
 So if these exhibitions restore some of Moses' stature, will they have the opposite effect on Mr. Caro's? Not according to Mr. Jackson, who describes himself as a great admirer of Mr. Caro and uses ''The Power Broker'' in his courses on New York history. ''I wish I'd written the book,'' he said. But, he added, he also believes the times may call for a new take on Moses. 
 ''Did he get everything right?'' Mr. Jackson said. ''Of course not. He blazed a trail. Nothing stands forever. Not even 'The Power Broker.' ''

HEADLINE: Someone (Other Than You) May Own Your Genes

BYLINE: By DENISE CARUSO.

 BODY:
THE Food and Drug Administration's recent declaration that food from cloned animals is safe was a fresh reminder of how poorly the biotech industry and its regulators have managed the field's portfolio of innovation over the years. 
 A recent survey found that Americans overwhelmingly distrust government and industry to provide truthful information about biotech's risks and safety. Yet equally important as risk -- and more often overlooked -- are the public's equally real and unaddressed concerns about who is looking out for its interests as the genes of plants, animals and microbes, as well as entire organisms, become privatized through the patenting system.
Stephen Hilgartner of Cornell University said he believed that the economic and political challenges surrounding these so-called life patents would come to rival those of biotech risk, and he has come up with a sensible framework for starting a new conversation about them.
 From the moment the first biotech patents were granted in 1980, the industry was hailed as a new frontier -- uncharted territory where a new generation of scientist-inventors could reap the traditional rewards of innovation. 
 But even as the gold rush began, critics as varied as scientists and human rights advocates declared that biotech's new intellectual property frontier was already occupied. Claims of novelty and innovation as the basis for life patents, they said, disregarded the realities of not only nature, but also of research practices, democratic decision-making and global governance.
 These realities led Mr. Hilgartner, an associate professor in Cornell's science and technology studies department, to think about how society might deal with biotech discoveries outside the strict economic imperatives of intellectual property law. 
 The title of an intriguing paper he wrote on the subject, ''Acceptable Intellectual Property,'' is a wordplay on the well-known concept of ''acceptable risk'' -- that is, the level of risk a society considers acceptable, given existing social, economic and cultural conditions. 
 In other words, what level of intellectual-property protection is society -- not the biotech industry or its phalanx of patent lawyers -- willing to accept in exchange for the benefits of biotechnology? 
 With this question in mind, Professor Hilgartner began to investigate whether legal theories of real property, rather than innovation, might be a more useful way to think about who owns biotech inventions and what can be done with them.
 He notes that the law frames the ownership of property as a bundle of rights. People who ''own'' real estate actually own a set of expectations, relationships and obligations to various communities and regions. 
 Depending on the communities' rules, property owners may not be able to drill for oil, cut down trees or build new structures without permission, for example. They are obliged to prevent dangerous conditions, to pay for damages if they don't, and so forth. Communities are accountable in various ways to property owners as well.
 In contrast, there is no analog to this network of obligations for a patent holder. As Tim Hubbard, a Human Genome Project researcher, noted at a 2001 conference: ''If you have a patent on a mousetrap, rivals can still make a better mousetrap. This isn't true in the case of genomics. If someone patents a gene, they have a real monopoly.'' 
 This monopoly gives patent holders total control over patented genetic materials for any use whatsoever -- whether for basic research, a diagnostic test, as a test for the efficacy of a drug or the production of therapies. 
 Professor Hilgartner said patents don't just determine who will own new technologies and who has access to them. They also influence what technologies cost, whose cultural and ethical values they represent, and what aspects of the research and development process will be transparent -- and to whom.
 The degree of control that life patents grant their owners is of growing concern to scientists, human rights and patient advocates and ethicists. More than 20 percent of human genes have already been patented, and most of those patents are owned by corporations.
 Professor Hilgartner noted how this kind of control can play out in the real world. In the case of the Canavan disease patent, for example, a family afflicted by this rare genetic disorder initiated an effort to find the gene mutation responsible for the disease. They raised money, collected DNA samples and attracted researchers to the cause. 
 After a researcher found the gene in the late 1990s, he and his employer, Miami Children's Hospital, patented it and began charging royalties on a genetic test to screen for the disease -- despite the fact that they would never have found the gene without the efforts and the DNA samples of the afflicted.
 Patient groups filed suit in 2000, contending misappropriation of trade secrets by using their children's DNA without consent to obtain a patent. It took until 2003 for the parties to reach a confidential settlement; it allows certain laboratories to continue collecting royalties but lets institutions, doctors and scientists use the patented gene sequences without paying.
 There are many other examples of life patents causing public concern. One of the most important examples involves patents on food crops and cloned animals. These patents have a growing potential to cede control of the world's food supply to biotech patent holders. 
 Important questions must also be answered about who can legitimately ''own'' or control our personal genetic information. And no one has yet been able to address economic, social and legal questions raised by the patenting of genetic resources taken from developing countries.
 This month, for example, Peruvian farmers protested against the biotech giant Syngenta, which genetically modified a common potato variety so that the potatoes are sterile unless a chemical is applied.
 Risk concerns aside, farmers say they want to know why the company can charge a premium for adding a few new genes to a potato variety -- yet they cannot, in turn, demand a royalty from Syngenta for using the ''property'' that they and their ancestors have been ''genetically modifying,'' by traditional means, for centuries. 
 Biotech companies are also amassing huge patent portfolios by tapping the genetic diversity found in volcanoes, rain forests and deep sea hydrothermal vents. They collect DNA from micro-organisms they find, patent it, and sell access to the gene sequences to pharmaceutical, agricultural, chemical and industrial companies.
 Only rarely do such companies voluntarily work with indigenous communities to come to mutually agreeable terms for these kinds of activities. There has been much international protest as a result, but very little concrete action to change the situation. 
 These concerns may sound like the nattering of nabobs to those who believe the present system of protecting intellectual property is acceptable. But like it or not, a large and powerful infrastructure has declared that patents are crucial for getting discoveries out of the lab and into the market, and it will not change on its own. 
 NEVERTHELESS, that does not change the larger reality that Professor Hilgartner describes: that decisions about intellectual property are about much more than simply finding ways to stimulate and reward innovation. 
 They directly affect what technologies make it to the marketplace. They determine who is accountable for biotech products and processes, under what circumstances, and how they affect everyone.
 Shifting the terms of the debate from patents and innovation to the rights-based framework that Professor Hilgartner has proposed may not be an immediate solution. But it is certainly the most direct route to a more democratic and inclusive conversation about intellectual property concerns as biotech marches on.

HEADLINE: The Maestro Of Spaghetti Westerns Takes a Bow

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

DATELINE: ROME 

 BODY:
FOR many filmmakers through the years, a certain kind of pilgrimage to Rome leads to the opulent parlor of the composer Ennio Morricone. It's the place where he has discussed grand concepts and crucial details, and often unveiled new themes on the piano, for the distinctive film scores he has written over the past four decades, from ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' to ''The Mission.'' There are more than 400 of them, though he hasn't kept count. 
 Next Saturday Mr. Morricone, 78, makes his long-overdue American concert debut with 200 musicians and singers at Radio City Music Hall. It is the beginning of a triumphal month in the United States that will also include festivals of his films at the Museum of Modern Art and Film Forum, and the release of a tribute album, ''We All Love Ennio Morricone'' (Sony Masterworks), with performances from Bruce Springsteen, Renee Fleming, Herbie Hancock, Enya and Metallica, among others. On Feb. 25 he will be presented with an honorary Academy Award for lifetime achievement, atoning for past omissions. After five nominations, he has never won. 
Massimo Gallotta, the promoter who is producing the concert, has been working for more than a year to present Mr. Morricone's American debut. ''It was strange for me that Morricone had never performed here in the past,'' Mr. Gallotta said. ''He agreed right away. And then I was lucky about the Oscar, the CD, everything.''
 Mr. Morricone has given concerts periodically in Europe, including a December performance that drew 50,000 people to the Piazza del Duomo in Milan. At Radio City he will lead the 100-piece Roma Sinfonietta orchestra, along with the 100-member Canticum Novum Singers.
 Everyone except Maestro Morricone, as he is called in Rome, considers him startlingly prolific. Along with his hundreds of film scores, he has composed a sizable body of concert music like ''Voci dal Silencio'' (''Voices From the Silence''), a cantata he wrote in response to ''the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 and all the massacres of humanity all over the world,'' he said. He will be performing that work on Friday at the United Nations, at a concert welcoming the new secretary general, Ban Ki-moon. 
 ''The notion that I am a composer who writes a lot of things is true on one hand and not true on the other hand,'' he said in an interview at his home, speaking in Italian through a translator. ''Maybe my time is better organized than many other people's. But compared to classical composers like Bach, Frescobaldi, Palestrina or Mozart, I would define myself as unemployed.''
 Maestro Morricone is a flinty, pragmatic character, but one who marvels at what he called ''the strange miracle of music.'' He looked like a bespectacled businessman, wearing a sport jacket, dark trousers, white shirt and tie. He greeted any generalizations about his work with a shrug, or a terse, ''That is up to the audience to decide.'' But through the years he has created music that is as memorable as the films it accompanies, and sometimes more so. 
 Audiences respond to the operatic sweep of themes like the ones he wrote for ''Cinema Paradiso'' and ''Once Upon a Time in America.'' Musicians prize the ingenuity of his writing: the unexpected harmonic turns, the odd meters (even in tunes that seem to be marches), the use of silence and wide spaces between instruments. Meanwhile hipsters and producers delight in the almost sardonic themes he wrote for films like ''Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion'' and the striking, sample-ready timbres he has invented. 
 For ''1900'' he wrote a score that encompasses Italian folk songs and dance music as well as symphonic arrangements. ''He is someone with two identities,'' said Bernardo Bertolucci, that film's director. ''One is the composer of contemporary music, and the other is this composer of big epics, this popular music for movies. All his life he has been trying to nourish one identity with the other one, and it is as if the two voices were enriching each other. He has a great capacity of harmonizing in himself.'' 
 Maestro Morricone's parlor, in a palazzo with a view of the Campidoglio hill in the center of Rome, is a Baroque room so large that the grand piano is almost lost amid the lavishly ornamented chairs, couches and tables. A small silver frame holds a family photo full of children and grandchildren. (He has three sons and a daughter; one son, Andrea, is a composer, and another, Giovanni, is a film director.) 
 At one corner of the room, a doorway leads into the office where Mr. Morricone writes his music. An unobtrusive movie screen, big enough for some multiplexes, can unroll down one wall of the parlor. On the other walls an antique tapestry of the abduction of the Sabine women is flanked by surreal, turbulent 20th-century paintings full of striking colors and brooding shadows. 
 The room's mixture of elegant history and menacing modernity echoes the qualities that have made generations of directors -- from Sergio Leone with ''A Fistful of Dollars'' to Terrence Malick with ''Days of Heaven'' to Roland Joffe with ''The Mission'' to Giuseppe Tornatore with ''Cinema Paradiso'' and ''Malena'' -- seek out Mr. Morricone. 
 He composes not at the piano or on a computer but at an imposing desk in his writing studio, amid shelves of books, LPs, CDs, tapes and DVDs. On a coffee table supported by a realistic rhinoceros is a neat stack of score paper with all the parts for an orchestra written in pencil: Mr. Morricone's next batch of soundtracks.
 His extensive background in classical music can be heard in his swelling love themes and in his meticulous orchestrations, which can suggest the stateliness of the 18th century or the eerie dissonances of the 20th. Unlike younger film composers who create their music as studio recordings rather than manuscripts, or who hand off their themes for others to arrange, Mr. Morricone writes full scores and conducts them himself. 
 ''He doesn't have a piano in his studio,'' said the director Barry Levinson, who commissioned Mr. Morricone for ''Bugsy,'' a soundtrack nominated for an Academy Award. ''I always thought that with composers, you sit at the piano, and you try to find the melody. There's no such thing with him. He hears a melody, and he writes it down. He hears the orchestration completely done.'' 
 Mr. Morricone grew up playing trumpet like his father, who worked in jazz bands and opera orchestras; sometimes Ennio substituted for him at gigs. While studying trumpet and composition at the Conservatorio di Santa Cecilia in Rome, Mr. Morricone was also arranging and sometimes writing pop songs. His film scores invoke centuries of popular music, from tarantellas and polkas to psychedelia, lounge pop and avant-garde jazz. 
 Mr. Morricone has also experimented constantly with timbre, using surf-rock guitar or jew's harp, panpipes or synthesizer, wordless voices or exotic percussion. For the beginning of ''Once Upon a Time in the West,'' he persuaded the director, Mr. Leone, not to use conventional instruments at all: just amplified ambient sounds, from the creak of a swinging sign to the screech of an arriving train. 
 He pushes instruments to the extremes of their ranges and dynamics, and voices too. For ''Navajo Joe,'' he drew yowls and shrieks from the singers he hired. ''When they finished recording, they were crying because what had been done sounded so terrible to them,'' Mr. Morricone said with satisfaction. 
 His approach, he said, reflects his education and his era. ''I have studied the expressive methods of the entire history of musical composition,'' he said. ''At times I turn more toward light music, at times I turn more toward serious music. I mingle things, and sometimes I turn into a chameleon. We are living in a modern world, and in contemporary music the central fact is contamination, not the contamination of disease but the contamination of musical styles. If you find this in me, that is good.'' 
 In the films that established his reputation in the 1960s, the series of spaghetti westerns he scored for Mr. Leone, Mr. Morricone's music is anything but a backdrop. It's sometimes a conspirator, sometimes a lampoon, with tunes that are as vividly in the foreground as any of the actors' faces. The sound of an ocarina, the humble potato-shaped ceramic flute, made his name in the 1960s in the theme for ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.'' 
 That theme was typical Morricone: a tenacious melody put across by an unlikely, unpretty, arresting combination of instruments. ''I always follow an idea,'' he said, ''and if an idea tells me I've got to use strange combinations of instruments, then I do what works.'' For Mr. Morricone the plan was simple. ''I wanted to differentiate three timbres -- the good, the bad and the ugly,'' he said. ''A silver flute, sounding sweet, is the good. The ocarina is the ugly. And the bad is the voices of two men singing together, off key. 
 ''I should not be revealing this,'' he continued. ''These are family secrets.''
 Metallica has been using ''The Ecstasy of Gold,'' from the same movie, as its entrance music since 1983, and performs its own version of the piece on the new tribute album. 
 ''To me his music is just absolutely inspirational, corny as that may sound,'' said James Hetfield, Metallica's singer and guitarist. ''He has taken so many risks, and his music is not polished whatsoever. It's very rude and blatant. All of a sudden a Mexican horn will come blasting through and just take over the melody. It's just so raw, really raw, and it feels real, unpolished. You hear mistakes in it, and that's just great -- if they are mistakes. Who knows? There's so much character in it, and I appreciate that in such a polished world of soundtracks.'' 
 After he became known for Mr. Leone's spaghetti westerns, Mr. Morricone went on to write for every imaginable genre: crime films like ''The Untouchables,'' historical epics like ''Burn!,'' horror movies like ''The Thing,'' art films like ''Teorema,'' even an occasional comedy. He has worked with virtually every major Italian director after Fellini, as well as a long international list. 
 Mr. Morricone chooses his commissions based almost entirely on his trust in the director, he said. ''Sometimes I read the script, sometimes I read the main part of the story, and sometimes I just watch the film when it's done and that's it,'' he said.
 ''When you work in cinema, you can't exclude anything,'' he added. ''Lately I have scored a film, and the film had not been shot yet. It was just being shot, and I just heard the director's story of the film. This is not as negative as it seems to be, because it gives the composer the possibility to just express music -- music and only music.''
 Mr. Levinson said that unlike many film scorers, Mr. Morricone does not want to hear the temporary music many directors use while shooting. He watches a movie without accompaniment and takes notes, sometimes coming up with themes immediately. ''They usually give you less time than necessary, but I usually ask for a month,'' he said. ''When I have to compose I have no holidays. I write every day. And Saturday and Sunday are even better, because the phone doesn't ring that much.'' 
 Mr. Morricone is wary of having too much music in a film. ''It's useless,'' he said. ''After a while the audience loses track, and you cannot appreciate the psychological idea and aim that the music has.'' 
 He often presents himself as the servant of the director and the film. ''Time is the element they have in common, music and cinema,'' he said. ''You have to take into account the actors, the plot, the intention of the director and the story you are going to score.''
 But he is more than a functionary. His own personality, what he has called a ''musical calligraphy,'' comes through. ''A composer is conditioned by the film, but he has to find a way to overcome these limits,'' he said. ''And how does he do this? Through his musical culture, through his great passion for musicians of the past. And doing it time after time, little by little it becomes a style.''
 Is his own story in the music? ''That's a romantic idea of composing, that there is autobiographical inspiration in things,'' he said. ''Some composers, perhaps, they see a woman and say, 'I'm going to write something extraordinary because I'm thinking of her.' ''
 And has that happened to him? He scowled. ''Niente,'' he said emphatically. ''Never.''

HEADLINE: 7 Months, And Still No Rate Cut

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
TALK of a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut began spreading almost from the moment of the last rate increase, in June, but it is now sounding more like urban legend than economic analysis. 
 The Fed stopped raising short-term rates last summer and is expected to hold firm again on Wednesday, yet it has continued to warn of the risks of inflation and offered few, if any, hints of a cut. Wall Street got a reality check when the employment report a month ago showed surprising strength, and one market strategist expects another dose of uncomfortable economic facts on Friday, in the next update on jobs.
A Bloomberg News poll of economists predicts 140,000 net new jobs in January, down from 167,000 last month. Edward E. Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, warns that stocks and bonds may sell off if, as he anticipates, the final figure is closer to 200,000.
 ''If the number is stronger than expected and we get a '2' handle, the markets won't be too happy with it,'' he said. ''It would definitely bury any expectations still out there that the Fed's next move will be an easing one anytime soon.''
 Mr. Yardeni noted that in past economic growth spurts, 200,000 new jobs a month was routine. But that has changed, he said.
 ''At the Fed there's a perception that somewhere between 100,000 and 150,000, there's a number consistent with an economic expansion that's quite mature and an unemployment rate that's close to full employment,'' he said.
 But Mr. Yardeni contends that the economy has more room to maneuver, that jobs can be added at a faster pace without a worrisome rise in wage inflation. He expects his belief to be put to the test this year. He thinks that unemployment, now at 4.5 percent, will decline to 3.5 percent, a level unseen since 1969.
 ''Most economists subscribe to the theory that there's no trade-off between unemployment and inflation,'' he said. ''You can have an even tighter labor market and better-than-expected economic growth without inflation.''
 But Mr. Yardeni said that stronger job reports would worry the markets unless a certain handful of economists made clear that they held to the same theory.
 ''I'm entitled to my opinion,'' Mr. Yardeni said, ''but at the end of the day what matters is what they think at the Fed.''

DATA WATCH -- Other items on a busy economic calendar include the Institute of Supply Management's snapshot on Thursday of the nation's manufacturing activity in January. The Bloomberg poll predicts a slight increase, to a reading of 51.6 from 51.4 in December.
 The same day, reports on personal spending and income in December are expected to show increases. Income is estimated to have risen 0.5 percent, after a 0.3 percent gain in November. Spending is predicted to show a 0.7 percent increase, versus a November climb of 0.5 percent.

HEADLINE: Multitasking At Sundance: Haven't I Seen You Before?

BYLINE: By DENNIS LIM

DATELINE: PARK CITY, Utah 

 BODY:
THE Sundance Film Festival wraps up another frenzied edition Sunday, dispensing dozens of prizes among the competition. But anyone who made a sizable dent in the 60 or so American fiction features on view might be excused for thinking there was also an unofficial contest for hardest-working actor in American independent movies.
 As the days wore on, and the films began to blur together, the same faces kept popping up: Sam Rockwell as a harried soccer dad (''Joshua'') and an unstable born-again Christian (''Snow Angels''); Vera Farmiga as a young wife trying to get pregnant (''Never Forever'') and a mother with postpartum depression (''Joshua''); Justin Theroux as a narcissistic television star (''Broken English'') and a Spanish-speaking Jesus (''The Ten''); and the up-and-coming young actor Mark Webber as an angry, alienated misfit in dead-end suburbia (''Weapons'') and in a Nebraska football town (''The Good Life''). Among the others pulling double duty: Zooey Deschanel, Drea de Matteo, Samuel L. Jackson, Samantha Morton, Adam Brody, Liev Schreiber and Thomas Jay Ryan. 
The multitasking actor is not a new phenomenon here. If anything, it's something of a tradition. Mr. Rockwell had three films here in 1997. So did Parker Posey, who happens to be here this year with two films. In 2003 Patricia Clarkson arrived with three films and left with a special jury prize. The Sundance version of the parlor game Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, named in honor of the prolific actor, would be something like Three Degrees of, say, Steve Buscemi, also here this year with two films (three if you count his appearance as a talking head in a documentary about his friend, the Clash frontman Joe Strummer, who died in 2002).
 To the casual observer the impression is one of an insular club. But even for the heavyweights of the indie star system, the reality is not always so glamorous. It is tempting to romanticize the idea of the indie stalwart, but many of these actors are not staying small by choice. A glass ceiling still separates the indie and Hollywood spheres. And they may not even be cozily entrenched, given the constant pressure to get A-list names in indies and the corresponding trend toward stunt-casting. 
 Further complicating matters, an ever growing number of Hollywood A-listers regard Sundance as a kind of boutique spa where they can order up an image makeover. This year's biggest names: Michael Douglas (''King of California'') and Meryl Streep (''Dark Matter''). 
 Kerry Barden, a veteran casting director whose Sundance credits this year include ''Snow Angels'' and ''Never Forever,'' said recognizable stars had grown increasingly important even for smaller productions. During the indie heyday of the mid-1990s most of the standout films ''were not dependent on getting names,'' he said. ''It was just about getting the right actor.'' 
 ''But the market was different then,'' he continued. ''If you made a film for under $2 million, you were almost guaranteed your money back from video sales. Now you need names that can assure some kind of theatrical distribution deal.''
 ''And everyone wants last year's Academy Award winner,'' he added.
 Ms. Posey, casually deploying an appellation that has often been assigned to her in the news media, said: ''Being an indie queen, people think I have all these choices. Like I've just been sitting around waiting for the best indie film that I deem acceptable. There are a lot of independent films I've wanted to do that I haven't been cast in.''
 Even so, Ms. Posey has done plenty of subversive, inventive work on the margins of studio movies, from ''Scream 3'' to ''Superman Returns,'' even if the roles have not always been satisfying. ''I'm the character actor in Hollywood movies, the girl who has to be annoying so the guy can go to the other girl,'' she said.
 Speaking here on the morning after the premiere of Zoe Cassavetes's romantic comedy ''Broken English,'' in which she is, for a change, the girl who gets the guy, Ms. Posey pointed out that she had not been in a prestige indie film since 2002, with Rebecca Miller's ''Personal Velocity.'' Both ''Broken English'' and her other new Sundance film, Hal Hartley's ''Fay Grim,'' were shot in digital video on a relative shoestring. 
 ''It feels like financing is getting harder,'' said Mr. Buscemi, who has experienced the numbers game as both an actor and a director. ''They want to give less money, but you still have to get a star.'' He was at Sundance with his fourth feature as director, ''Interview,'' a remake of a talky chamber piece by the murdered Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh. Mr. Buscemi stars in it opposite Sienna Miller and also plays the lead in Tom DiCillo's paparazzi satire, ''Delirious.''
 The current economics of filmmaking make it more difficult than ever for unknown talent to break out. ''It's that old Catch-22,'' said Patricia DiCerto, the casting director on ''Joshua.'' ''You can't become a name until you have a lead role in a successful film, but you can't get a film until you're a name.'' 
 The stars of ''Joshua,'' Mr. Rockwell and Ms. Farmiga, were the highest-profile actors at this year's Sundance, each with a pair of lead roles in the dramatic competition. In that film, a witty haute-yuppie variation on ''The Bad Seed'' directed by George Ratliff, they appear together as a Manhattan couple terrorized by their creepily precocious 9-year-old. In David Gordon Green's bleak small-town drama, ''Snow Angels,'' Mr. Rockwell plays another troubled father, this time deranged by grief and excessive piety. Both roles are striking departures for an actor who has so far specialized in oddball comedy.
 ''In 'Snow Angels' you really get to chew the scenery,'' Mr. Rockwell said over coffee in his East Village loft a few days before heading to Sundance. ''And in 'Joshua' I get to be the straight guy, which is a nice change from all the weirdos I play.'' 
 Both of Ms. Farmiga's roles are notably unsentimental portraits of motherhood. In ''Joshua'' her depressive character must confront the possibility that her own child is bent on destroying her. ''I felt very close to her,'' she said of her character by telephone before Sundance. 
 The experience left her so drained that she considered pulling out of Gina Kim's torrid melodrama, ''Never Forever,'' in which her character deals with her Korean-American husband's infertility by paying a stranger to inseminate her. ''I didn't know if I had anything left to give, but I couldn't say no,'' she said. ''It was one of the most visceral love stories I'd ever read.''
 Ms. Farmiga is one of Sundance's most resounding success stories, having erupted from near obscurity three years ago with her performance in Debra Granik's ''Down to the Bone.'' 
 Mr. Rockwell was also discovered at Sundance, back in 1996 with ''Box of Moonlight.'' The last time he was at the festival was in 2001, for a short film. ''I went to try to get my mind off a girl, which didn't quite work,'' he said. But he did meet the directors Anthony and Joe Russo, who cast him in their 2002 film ''Welcome to Collinwood,'' which was being produced by George Clooney. That led to one of Mr. Rockwell's best-reviewed performances, the lead in Mr. Clooney's Chuck Barris biopic, ''Confessions ofa Dangerous Mind.''
 The rare indie character actor who has somehow managed to avoid Sundance all these years, Mr. Theroux is here for the first time, and in multiple capacities. He's a scene-stealing member of the ensembles of ''Broken English'' and ''The Ten'' but is more concerned with his role as a first-time director, with ''Dedication,'' a brisk romantic comedy starring Billy Crudup and Mandy Moore.
 Speaking a few days before his premiere, a nervous Mr. Theroux said he was not planning to sit through any of the ''Dedication'' screenings. At previews in New York, he realized, ''You start holding people to a viewing standard you would never adhere to.'' He added, ''Laughter will be bad, silence will be bad.'' 
 Like Mr. Rockwell, Mr. Theroux has played a villain in a ''Charlie's Angels'' movie. (''A blast,'' he said.) But more often than not, ''the bigger the film, the worse the part,'' he said. ''When you've done bad parts that are time-consuming on studio movies, you want to blow your brains out. For the guys who stay close to independent film, it's about creative necessity.''
 But there is also the issue of financial necessity. ''My accountant keeps telling me to take one for the bank account,'' Ms. Farmiga said. 
 Mr. Barden, the casting director, put it more bluntly: ''Most actors wouldn't be able to pay their rent if they just did indie movies.'' 
 Mr. Rockwell confirmed this. '' 'Matchstick Men' and 'Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' are paying my mortgage,'' he said, referring to two recent studio projects. ''Although now the studio movies aren't paying a lot either. A lot of that money goes to the A-list and not to guys like me.'' (He admitted that he nearly dropped out of ''Joshua'' when it looked as if he might get cast in a Coen brothers film.) 
 As for Ms. Posey, her notion of the artist's life is at once breezy and pragmatic. ''I just follow the jobs,'' she said. ''I freelance, basically, and whatever comes my way seems to be just in time to give me a paycheck.'' 
 Indie queen or no, she said, there's little point plotting a career path: ''No one is behind a desk putting pins in a chart, like indie, studio, indie, studio. The perception that I have control over it makes me laugh. It's all so out of my hands.''

HEADLINE: Now You, Too, Can Enter the World of 007 Finance

BYLINE: By JAMES PETHOKOUKIS

 BODY:
COMPARED with button-down stock jockeys at Fidelity or T. Rowe Price, hedge fund managers may be the James Bonds of the financial world. They have a reputation for being secretive risk takers who use an array of specialized financial weaponry like derivatives and short-selling. (No license to kill, of course, though their lightly regulated funds do allow managers tremendous, nonlethal latitude.) 
 But times are changing, and just as any spy buffs can Google up sophisticated techno-gadgets and have them sent directly to their homes, it's now possible for a do-it-yourself investor to tap a financial arsenal that was once readily available only to the pros. For good or ill, alternative investment vehicles like foreign currencies, commodities, real estate and private equity are landing in the hands of the masses.
Thomas Smicklas, 55, a retired high-school principal from Wadsworth, Ohio, says he is unimpressed with the performance of traditional mutual funds, so he has become a die-hard do-it-yourselfer. ''I act as my own hedge fund manager, which to me means being able to take additional risk,'' Mr. Smicklas said. 
 He hardly fancies himself an amateur George Soros, though. Mr. Smicklas has no wild dreams of breaking the Bank of England. And, for another matter, he doesn't want to risk accidentally blowing up his own portfolio. (Long-Term Capital Management's problems come to mind.) He says he just wants a spicier portfolio, keeping 75 percent of assets in stocks and bonds that he deems ''secure from fiasco,'' and 25 percent in more speculative investments. 
 Among the latter holdings are offbeat exchange-traded funds, like iShares MSCI Singapore Index; Claymore BRIC, which invests in Brazil, Russia, India and China; and PowerShares Water Resources, which focuses on water treatment and services companies. 
 Mr. Smicklas became interested in the water E.T.F. after he started thinking about various commodities during the oil-price surge last year. Water is a narrow slice of the stock market, and Mr. Smicklas acknowledged that without the E.T.F., he wouldn't have known where to start. ''I think the only water company I knew was Calgon,'' he recalled. Industry names like Insituform Technologies and Companhia de Saneamento Basico do Estado de Sao Paulo didn't jump to mind.
 With a good deal of research, Mr. Smicklas might have eventually found those companies and thoroughly analyzed them. Still, he had no way to gain access to private equity investments, which seemed to be the domain of American chief executives, Saudi princes or deposed foreign presidents -- not retired Ohio educators. 
 Well, what popped into Mr. Smicklas's e-mail box the other day? An ad for PowerShares Listed Private Equity Portfolio -- an E.T.F. that mimics the Red Rocks Capital Listed Private Equity Index. The Red Rocks index tracks public companies that make direct investments in privately held companies. 
 And just look at some of the offerings from Rydex Investments. In addition to E.T.F.'s tracking foreign currencies like the Australian dollar and the Swiss franc, Rydex offers ''alternative'' mutual funds like the Rydex Dynamic Strengthening Dollar and Dynamic Weakening Dollar funds. These invest in index swaps, options and futures contracts in order to double returns on the real-world performance of the dollar, with a bet on its direction. Before E.T.F.'s and funds like these, speculating in currencies probably would have required setting up a managed futures account at a brokerage firm.
 Currency, water and private equity E.T.F.'s? It sounds like the Wild West out there to Christine Benz, director of mutual fund analysis at Morningstar. ''Seems the E.T.F. industry is making a lot of the same mistakes that the fund industry made in the '90s when there were a lot of gimmicky, narrowly focused products that didn't belong in investors' portfolios,'' she said. 
 Like many investment experts, Ms. Benz says the average investor has enough of a task analyzing traditional stock and bond funds and doesn't need to complicate matters with a bunch of esoteric new products. 
 David Reilly, director of portfolio strategies at Rydex, has heard that sort of criticism before. He recalled reading a magazine recently in which a financial adviser called such niche products ''just another way to shoot yourself in the head.'' But Mr. Reilly contends that ''the data don't warrant that perception.'' He says, for instance, that funds that track the movement of the dollar against foreign currencies are great for diversification because they move independently of more common asset classes like stocks and bonds. ''They're not really correlated at all,'' he said.
 Lowering portfolio volatility and reducing downside risk through smart hedging is also the financial goal of Mark D. Wolfinger, author of a 2005 book, ''Create Your Own Hedge Fund.'' He advocates, for instance, using a simple covered-call strategy with E.T.F. options -- essentially selling a call option on an S.& P. 500 or Russell 2000 E.T.F. that you already own -- through the American Stock Exchange. (If your eyes are already beginning to bleed, be warned that this is probably the simplest strategy in the book.) This allows a hedger to collect a modest premium from selling the call as well as to receive a bit of downside insurance if the E.T.F. slips in price. 
 ''Before E.T.F.'s, one could not easily write covered calls on a diversified stock portfolio, unless one owned the entire index portfolio,'' Mr. Wolfinger said. ''That's a very awkward and expensive thing to do and requires lots of trading.'' 
 And as long as you're in a hedging frame of mind, remember that you can now hedge against real estate declines or speculate on the direction of housing prices. Last spring, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange started offering futures contracts pegged to housing price indexes in 10 major metropolitan areas, including New York, Chicago, Denver and San Diego. What's more, a new Web site, HedgeStreet, allows investors to trade contracts on economic statistics like 30-year mortgage rates or consumer prices.
 (For that matter, why not go to Intrade, an online betting site, where you can hedge the 2008 presidential election? If you're a Democrat, try betting Republican, so that if the vote doesn't go your way, you can take solace in the cash you make on election night.) 
 If you like the idea of Soros-like risk taking -- but are worried about go-it-alone strategies -- more and more mutual funds are offering trading strategies borrowed from hedge funds, like going both long and short on stocks. Ric Dillon, portfolio manager of the Diamond Hill Long-Short A fund in Columbus, Ohio, says the popularity of such funds really started growing after the Internet bubble burst in 2000. ''Investors started looking for a better return, really any return at all,'' he said.
 MR. DILLON says the major differences between his long-short mutual fund and a similar hedge fund he manages are that the mutual fund doesn't use leverage and will short up to only 40 percent of the fund. 
 But in both funds, he says, he uses classic Benjamin Graham-Warren Buffett value-investing analysis to find stocks that aren't trading at their intrinsic values, based on estimates of future cash flow. He shorts stocks trading above what he deems that intrinsic value, like Procter & Gamble, and buys those trading below, like Devon Energy. Diamond Hill Long-Short A has more than doubled the average annual return of the S.& P. 500 during the last five years, though the fund has a front-end load, or sales charge, of 5 percent.
 He urges caution in using aggressive trading strategies. Using an aphorism sometimes attributed to John Maynard Keynes, Mr. Dillon said, ''The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.'' 
 Not as catchy as ''shaken, not stirred,'' but certainly worth remembering.

HEADLINE: The Hard Rain That's Falling on Capitalism 

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
 You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
 They may call you doctor or they may call you chief
 But you're gonna have to serve somebody, yes indeed
 You're gonna have to serve somebody,
 Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord 
 But you're gonna have to serve somebody.
 Bob Dylan,
 ''Gotta Serve Somebody''
 A FEW evenings ago, my wife and I were standing in the kitchen of our home in Rancho Mirage, Calif., feeding our voracious hounds, when a song came on the radio. It goes, ''If only you believe in miracles, baby, so would I ''
Suddenly a flood of thoughts came into my head. I put on my swim trunks, and even though it was 42 degrees outside, I got into my superheated pool and swam, looking up at the stars, and this is what I thought:
 My whole life is a miracle so far. I live in glorious houses -- tar-paper shacks by hedge fund standards, but plenty for me. I have a great American-made car. Above all, I have the most wonderful wife and the handsomest son on the planet. 
 My parents had a great, super life. They went from obscurity and lower-middle-class status in the Great Depression to fame and fortune in the postwar period. Their good fate was attributable mostly to their genius and hard work, but also to two culprits usually criticized in the media: President Richard M. Nixon, who made my father famous and powerful, and variable annuities, which made him and my mom well-to-do. 
 Thanks to Nixon's appointing Pop as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and to TIAA-CREF selling Mom and Pop those annuities, their latter decades were happy and comfy. (In the interest of full disclosure, I am the honorary spokesman for the National Retirement Planning Coalition, one of whose many sponsors is the National Association for Variable Annuities.)
 All of the miracles of our lives are because of America and our ancestors' lucky, brilliant decision to move here from the desperation of Eastern Europe. All of it is thanks to the brave men and women who fought and died and bled on World War II battlefields like Anzio and Tarawa to keep us free, and to the framers of the Constitution.
 But it's also thanks to capitalism. I realized this as I swam back and forth in my pool looking up at the stars and the contrails. Under capitalism, my grandparents, my parents and I could be paid the value of what we produced.
 Their (our) income and position in life were (are) a function of what value we could add, not of the status of poor stateless Jews that we would have been in Europe.
 Capitalism values people as individuals according to contract, as we lawyers and economists learn, not according to the status of our birth. This in itself is a miracle.
 This miracle has been vibrant in the lives of hundreds of millions of Americans who have gone from nothing to something, thanks to the dynamics of capitalism. They have seen their pay rise and they have been able to convert their sweat and toil and creativity into capital by saving and investing in the stock market and becoming capitalists themselves -- myself. 
 The system of capitalism is wide open. If you have an idea, you can turn it into capital. 
 But, as I swam and watched the private jets' lights as they glided right above my head into Palm Springs International Airport, I had a chilling thought: in capitalism, the most fundamental building block is trust. 
 When yeoman farmers sent their savings to banks in London and Glasgow and Paris, they had to be able to count on it not being stolen. That was what allowed capital to be accumulated and deployed, and for the entire world economy to take off.
 When I see what the top dogs at all too many corporations are now doing to that trust, I feel queasy. Outrageous -- yes, obscene -- pay. Greedy backdating of stock options, which in my opinion is straight-up theft. Managers buying assets from their trustors, the stockholders, at pennies on the dollar, then forestalling competing bids with lockups and insane breakup fees. 
 These misdeeds and many, many more are hammer blows at the granite foundation of trust we built in the 1940s and '50s. How long democratic capitalism can survive these blows before it gives in and gives birth to revolution or to an out-and-out aristocracy, I am not sure.
 Empires come and go. Economic systems come and go. There is no heavenly guarantee that capitalism will last forever as we know it. 
 It's built on man's notion that he can trust his neighbor with his money, and that if the neighbor misbehaves, the law will chase him and catch him, and that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom, that even the nobles get properly handled (Bob Dylan again) once they have been caught. 
 If that trust disappears -- if the system is no longer a system for the ordinary citizen but only for the tough guys -- how much longer can the miracle last? 
 EACH day's newspaper, it seems, brings more tidings of unrestrained selfishness and self-dealing and rafts of powerful people saying it's good for us to be robbed if only we truly understood the system.
 The problem is, we're getting to understand it all too well. 
 And there is no one in Washington -- absolutely no one -- to help.

I am planning a trip this May from Detroit to Nuuk in Greenland. Air Greenland serves Nuuk, via Copenhagen, but I hear that the carrier will start direct flights from Baltimore in May. I am unable to get confirmation of this from any source, including Air Greenland. If it is true, how do I book a flight? --Elsa M. Shartsis, Huntington Woods, Mich.
 
 Air Greenland (www.airgreenland.com), Greenland's national airline, announced last summer plans for a new direct route from Baltimore-Washington International Airport to Kangerlussuaq, on Greenland's west coast. Updated information is now on the Web site.
The flights will be offered in each direction every Friday beginning May 25; during the summer, June 11 to Aug. 20, flights are on Mondays as well. The restricted round-trip economy fare is $1,100; flexible economy, $1,600; and flexible business class, $2,600. Flights may be booked by sending an e-mail message to airgreenlandres@aviareps.com, or by calling (877) 245-0739 in North America.
 You may want to consider a five-day package from Baltimore called ''Arctic Capital: Nuuk,'' with departures every Monday from June 11 to Aug. 20. The tour may be booked on the Air Greenland Web site or through other tour operators in the United States and Canada (see the Web site for contact information). Price per person in a double room is $3,075 (single room, $3,285). This includes round-trip economy fare from Baltimore to Nuuk (via Kangerlussuaq); one night at the Hotel Kangerlussuaq, with a welcome dinner and breakfast; three nights at Hotel Hans Egede in Nuuk, in a standard room, with breakfast; guide service; and all local taxes. Excursion options include a cruise to an ice fjord and a helicopter tour. 
 Other Air Greenland tours include five days based in Ilulissat, with a boat excursion through iceberg-filled waters and a four-day trip based in Kangerlussuaq to see a herd of musk ox, a glacier and the ice cap. 
 Alternatively, Air Greenland flies from Copenhagen to Kangerlussuaq or Narsarsuaq. Air Iceland (www.airiceland.is) flies from Reykjavik (Keflavik International Airport) in Iceland to Kulusuk, on the east coast (round-trip fare for dates in May are about $465) and on to Nuuk.
 Icelandair (www.icelandair.com) flies from Baltimore-Washington to Reykjavik. Expect to pay about $930 for a round trip. ROGER COLLIS

A sociologist joins the debate on financial incentives for organ procurement.

 BODY:
LAST BEST GIFTS
 Altruism and the Market 
 for Human Blood and Organs.
 By Kieran Healy.
 193 pp. University of Chicago Press.
 Cloth, $50; paper, $20.
Organ transplants are at once the most amazing and frustrating of medical miracles. A new kidney or heart can cure someone who would otherwise die or, even in less than ideal circumstances, extend life and improve well-
 being. The surgical skill and pharmaceutical innovation required to make transplantation work are wonders of human ingenuity. 
 But there is still no such thing as a truly new organ. Unlike insulin or artificial hips, organs so far cannot be successfully manufactured. They come only pre-owned, usually from young, healthy people who have died suddenly in traumatic accidents that destroyed their brains. Rainy weekends increase the organ supply. Helmet laws reduce it. The more than 94,000 Americans on the waiting list for organs are, in effect, waiting for someone else to die so that they can live.
 This grisly calculus posed enormous cultural problems for early transplant advocates, as Kieran Healy, a sociologist at the University of Arizona and a contributor to the blog Crooked Timber, notes in ''Last Best Gifts.'' ''Public ambivalence about transplantation was overcome, in part, by arguing that donation was the 'gift of life,' '' he writes. ''The success of this idea now makes it more difficult to garner support for a market for organs.'' By emphasizing altruism, transplant advocates gave comfort to the bereaved, conferring meaning on a tragic event and justifying what might otherwise seem like desecration. This early success helps explain why, even in the face of a critical shortage of organs, many leaders in the transplant field oppose any financial incentives for organ donors, including tax credits or payment toward funeral expenses. 
 The ''gift of life'' story is useful but, according to Healy, oversimplified. Shaped by a strongly anticommercial ideology, it places too much emphasis on the division between giving and selling. It doesn't acknowledge the diverse ways in which people define the social meanings of exchange, regardless of whether money is involved. The fable of heroic altruists also misleadingly emphasizes the motives of the donor (or the donor's family) over the system in which the decision to give or not takes place. ''The voluntary donation of human goods is an organizational accomplishment,'' Healy argues.
 Just as businesses in the same industry may have different rates of profit, organ procurement organizations -- the regional groups charged with managing cadaver organs -- have different rates of success in persuading families to part with the organs of their loved ones. Some of those results depend on regional characteristics, from population density (which makes it easier to get organs to recipients quickly) to race (blacks, for example, are somewhat less likely to donate organs or support the idea of donation more generally). But along with such basic organizational differences as budget and number of referring hospitals, environmental differences like these account for only about half of the variation. Clearly something more -- call it ''management'' -- is at work.
 Consider the South Carolina Organ Procurement Agency, which has increased its donation rate by 83 percent since 1997. The agency not only expanded its field staff from eight to 21, it changed its methods. ''The person who explained to families that their loved one was brain dead, and who spent a considerable amount of time (perhaps a whole day) helping them with this realization, was no longer the person who requested consent for donation,'' Healy writes. This separation of roles may sound like common sense, but it requires organizational insight into the emotional state of donor families.
 As an economic sociologist, Healy adds important dimensions to the intensifying debate over organ procurement. He reminds both advocates and opponents of markets that commercial transactions are embedded in social structures and as likely as any other exchanges to have social meaning. To succeed, incentives must show sensitivity to those meanings. A direct payment to a funeral home, for example, could honor a donor family's decision without making them seem to profit from their loved one's death. Or healthy adults could make binding contracts to be organ donors if they die in the right circumstances, with life insurance paid for by transplant centers, the government or a private foundation going to their heirs.
 The book's major shortcoming is its failure to address the fastest growing source of organs: living donors. More than two-thirds of the people on the national waiting list -- about 68,000 -- need kidneys. There are nowhere near enough brain-dead accident victims to fill that demand, regardless of family beneficence or organizational efficiency. Fortunately, nobody has to die to supply a kidney. They can come from living donors, who can live perfectly normal lives with a single kidney and who now account for nearly 40 percent of all kidney transplants. With the kidney shortage at crisis proportions, the debate over financial incentives is really a debate over whether living adults should be allowed to sell their own organs or, at the least, receive a tax credit or some other indirect compensation.
 Although he barely mentions living donors, Healy's sociological message resonates through that debate. Financial incentives would operate within complex organizational structures, as well as contract and liability law. Bureaucratic institutions, notably hospitals and insurers, would shape the environment in which transplants take place. Many kidney sellers would still have humanitarian motives. ''The idea that markets inevitably corrupt,'' Healy writes, ''is not tenable precisely because they are embedded within social relations, cultural categories and institutional routines.'' Commerce isn't 
 antithetical to culture; it is part of it.

DATELINE: BEDFORD, N.Y. 

 BODY:
LYNN BIEDERMAN, 44, says this about her mother: ''Had we not been mother and daughter, our paths would never cross.''
 Ms. Biederman lives in a woodsy part of northern Westchester County, in a big house full of comfy, country-style furniture. Though she has a full life with her husband of 20 years and their two teenagers, and her work as a children's book writer and part-time librarian, she loves to slack off, pad around the house, eat in, sleep late. ''I would do anything to stay in bed, in a room as dark as a cave, for as long as possible,'' she says.
Her mother, Judith West Edelman, a wealthy businesswoman who refuses to give her age (''If I have to tell you, the story's off''), lives on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in a 40th-floor apartment with a spectacular view of the East River, rooms full of spare modern furniture and lots of unshaded windows that let the light pour in at dawn -- which is when she gets up seven mornings a week to work out at her gym. 
 The daughter, who's in fine shape (5 feet 3 inches, 112 pounds), once made the mistake of using her mother's personal trainer. ''I was like, 'Lou, why you giving me so much weight?' He says: 'What do you mean? Your mother does more reps at a higher weight and she never complains.' ''
 The daughter seeks to avoid conflict. The mother relishes a fight. (She interrupted our interview to take a call about a woman she is battling in her co-op over an allegedly oversized dog.)
 The daughter prefers quiet getaways and hates the Hamptons. The mother likes fancy restaurants, has a big house in the Hamptons and loves the scene.
 The daughter is a Democrat, the mother a Republican.
 The daughter served me home-baked vanilla cake warm from the oven and homemade cappuccino; the mother's uniformed maid served herbal tea from tea bags and low-fat cookies from the health food store.
 The mother is punctual and has no time for fiddle-faddle; the daughter's constantly late because she fiddle-faddles. One of the mother's favorite sayings is, ''Fast walker, fast thinker.'' One of the daughter's is, ''What's the rush, Mom?'' 
 The daughter believes her children are entitled to an explanation. The mother believes her own two children and her four grandchildren should not be overindulged. One of the mother's quippy sayings to silence children: ''Why? Because it's a letter in the alphabet.''
 The daughter works at home. She knows her 14-year-old daughter's taste in food, clothes and books and loves shopping for her.
 The mother works in an office -- once an assistant to the late Milton Petrie, the renowned women's clothing retailer, she is now president of Westco, her retail fixture business. The mother was too busy working to go with the daughter to pick out a wedding dress and sent her mother-in-law, the grandmother. 
 For years the mother and daughter had a guarded relationship. Many of the daughter's best friends are women who aren't close with their mothers.
 The mother was too consumed by work to make women friends. ''I liked to talk business, and not many women did,'' she says. ''Even as a kid, I was a loner. I began to see myself as not friendly or having social skills. I'd say, 'So what, I make a million dollars a year.' ''
 But in the last few years, things changed between mother and daughter. They grew close. There was no epiphany, they agree. The mother's quippy saying for this is: ''I suppose it's an accumulation of two-way streets.'' Each woman realized she'd fallen into the same trap.
 ''I strove to be the opposite of my mother,'' the daughter says.
 And the mother? ''I grew up hungry to be different from my mother.''
 Seeing the problem helped break the cycle.
 The mother grew up poor in Dallas. She says her father, a traveling salesman, was a ''brutal'' bully. ''I saw my mother being pushed around. I myself was. My mother, poor thing -- any friends she had were losers in life. So I had to figure out for myself what kind of woman I wanted to be. No one was going to push me around. I saw very quickly a woman couldn't have a voice without economic independence.'' Her first glimpse of what she wanted came during an after-school job at a Dallas department store. ''Those Neiman Marcus women, that was the life I wanted. It stoked the fire.''
 Even though her husband, Sanford Edelman, is a successful businessman, she has never lost her fear of being dependent and has never slowed in her career. She continues to work when most her age would retire. This is how she explains her unrelenting morning workouts: ''A pretty woman has a better chance in business. I used anything I had at my disposal to get the job done.''
 When she worked with Milton Petrie (estimated at his death in 1994 to be worth nearly a billion dollars), she says: ''My viewpoint consisted of myself as a career success. It never occurred to me I could ask to get out early for my kids. Having my mother-in-law go for the wedding dress with Lynn worked for me. I realize now it's a pretty narrow way to live.
 ''If you never had a fur coat, you never had a two-carat diamond or made $100,000, it seems like a big deal.''
 What changed? ''Once you get those things, it's not a big deal. I didn't have a good relationship with my mother. I didn't want to die feeling I didn't have a good relationship with my children. I didn't want to perpetuate a legacy. Where does it stop?''
 For a while, the daughter says, she wouldn't let her mother back in: ''She saw I had something with my children. She'd say, 'I probably wasn't as great a mother as you' and I'd let it hang there.''
 And then, several years ago, the daughter began writing a novel for young adults and realized the mother character she'd created -- nicknamed the Captain -- was too harsh to be believable. As she rounded out the character, she grew to have empathy for her mother's hard life.
 They disagree about who reached out first. ''I threw the baton out, and she grabbed it,'' the daughter says.
 Says the mother: ''I worked on being a more accepting mother. If I want to say something, I let it go a day or two before bringing it up. Like negotiating in business.''
 Over Christmas, the two families went for a week to Buenos Aires to celebrate the mother's secret milestone birthday. ''The day after we flew back, Mom was in the gym at 7,'' the daughter says. ''I couldn't move.'' Asked what she loves about her mother, she says: ''It took a lot of guts for my mom to change. There's not a thing she wouldn't do for me.''
 As for the mother, she has a quippy saying to cover her half: ''Sometimes the chicken can learn from the egg.''

HEADLINE: Calls and Fliers Delay Vote on Gunmaker's Plan

BYLINE: By ERIN DUGGAN

 BODY:
The Yonkers City Council delayed a vote on a gunmaker's request to expand its plant in Lincoln Park after nearby residents received fliers saying a larger plant would lower property values and pose a potential target for terrorists. 
 The vote was put off after the mayor's office received 20 calls and a dozen residents showed up at a council meeting on Tuesday night in response to fliers that warned neighbors that Kimber Manufacturing wanted to expand its gun manufacturing plant.
The council had planned to vote on whether to deem Kimber's proposal a ''regionally significant project,'' a step necessary for the state to approve the company's inclusion in the Empire Zone tax-break program.
 Kimber, which makes high-end handguns, rifles and shotguns for recreational users and the military, is partly situated in an Empire Zone and needs the council's approval to receive tax benefits, said Frank J. Rubino, the city's corporation counsel. The company said the expanded plant would add 50 jobs; the plant now has about 110 employees.
 The author of the flier, Kevin Gorman, a 32-year resident of Lincoln Park, said he believed the plant could be targeted by terrorists and predicted that houses near the Empire Zone could lose their value or, if the plant expanded even more, could be taken by the city through eminent domain.
 ''I fear for my neighbors and fear for my family,'' said Mr. Gorman, who said he worked in the Department of Homeland Security before retiring recently.
 David Simpson, a spokesman for the mayor, Philip A. Amicone, rejected those fears, saying the gun plant has been there since the 1980s, with few complaints from neighbors. 
 ''Most people who live in that neighborhood don't even realize that facility is there because they've been such a good neighbor,'' Mr. Simpson said. 
 Mr. Simpson said the outcry over the plant's expansion was based on misinformation and a knee-jerk reaction to firearms. 
 ''You wouldn't be calling me if a manufacturing facility making Pop-Tarts wanted to add 50 jobs,'' he said.
 A spokesman for Kimber did not return a call.
 Because Empire Zones were designed to aid economically depressed areas, much of Yonkers is included in the program. The tax breaks have been awarded to a range of businesses, from a limousine service and an auto collision repair shop to a woodworking design store, Mr. Rubino said. 
 The City Council could vote on the issue at its next meeting, scheduled for Feb. 13. ERIN DUGGAN

HEADLINE: Looking in the Toolbox and Seeing Art 

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO

 BODY:
For four decades, John Hechinger ran a hardware and home supplies chain founded by his father in 1911. In 1978, as part of an expansion, he moved the corporate headquarters to suburban Washington, D.C. Soon after, he began collecting art to humanize the somewhat sterile building. Believing in the relationship between the tools his company made and the work that artists produced, he hoped the art would inspire his workers.
 Mr. Hechinger died in 2004, but the collection he established has continued to grow through acquisitions overseen by International Arts & Artists, a Washington-based traveling exhibition service that was given control of the collection after his death. 
Touring nationally since 2001, ''Tools as Art: The Hechinger Collection'' has touched down at the Katonah Museum of Art, filling the museum's main exhibition galleries with 64 works by almost as many artists. It is surprisingly poetic, optimistic and intriguing. 
 Tools have a small but appreciable place in art history, mostly in the context of labor imagery. Prehistoric cave paintings in France and Spain have schematic diagrams of primitive implements, evidence of the first stirrings of human tool making, and scenes of peasants working the soil are found throughout ancient art. Farming returned as a popular theme in art, beginning with medieval paintings and prayer books, like the Book of Hours, and continuing on through the 19th century.
 But it was not really until the 20th century that tools became the subject of artworks. As Sarah Tanguy, curator of the Hechinger collection, points out in the exhibition catalog, depicting tools became for artists a ''means to bridge the gap between art and life, and to address the shifting definition of perception.'' She is right, though it may also have had something to do with questioning the traditional artistic process as an act of creation, an act of making. 
 Art critics do not talk much about craftsmanship these days, preferring to dwell on ideas or the clever statements an artist seeks to convey. This is largely because of Marcel Duchamp, who was probably the first artist to make an artwork out of real tools. With his ready-mades, beginning in 1914-15, he claimed the right of anyone to become an artist by choosing an object and putting it in a gallery. Among his early ready-mades was a snow shovel.
 Several artists in this exhibition share Duchamp's anarchic values, like Arman, the late French artist who made sculptures using mass-produced tools like wrenches, handsaws, pliers and paintbrushes. (He is also known for his public-destruction artworks, like dynamiting a sports car.) Shown here is ''Blue, Red, Brown'' (1988), something between a painting and a collage -- thick stripes of paint end in paintbrushes, stuck to the canvas. 
 Similarly, Tracy Heneberger uses hardware-store materials like hinges to concoct adorably original, elegantly constructed sculptures, and the Chicago-based, self-taught artist known only as Mr. Imagination makes shadowy, masklike portraits using paintbrushes and found materials. There is something very African about the paintbrush portraits, though the artist's sources of inspiration include Christianity, world affairs, politics and popular culture.
 In addition to paintbrushes and hammers, saw blades are popular, both as subject and material for artists. Ken Butler and Donald Lipski employ saw blades in assemblage sculptures that tend toward minimalism. Several artists also use the blades as a painting surface, including Jacob J. Kass, Howard Finster, Lou Horner, Oleg Kudryashov, Rico Solinas, Wim Delvoye and John Schlesinger. Others make replicas of handsaws out of paper and wood.
 Mr. Finster, who was born in Alabama in 1916 and died in 2001, was one of America's best-known folk artists. The exhibition catalog tells us that he experienced visions from an early age and was later to become a revivalist Baptist preacher. He ''heard the call'' to paint ''sacred art'' only in 1976, subsequently cranking out crudely evangelical paintings and sculptures, commonly linking words and images. Shown here is a painted Stanley handsaw from 1990, dealing with the history of tools.
 There are also older, historical works of art, including a lush black-and-white photograph of a New York hardware store, a sign in the front window advertising a sale on tools. Berenice Abbott took the photograph in 1938 as part of a government-sponsored project to document the city and its inhabitants. It makes for a splendid period piece, the store's owner having lined the window and pavement outside the store with all manner of items and implements.
 If Abbott sought to convey a wealth of detail about the subjects she documented, Walker Evans, her contemporary, was interested in economical, precise images that conveyed elegance, simplicity and restraint. So it is with ''Wrench'' (1955), part of a series of photographs titled ''Beauties of the Common Tool'' that was originally published in Fortune magazine. It is a chilly, no-fuss, front-on portrait, the tool stripped and reduced to its bare essentials. 
 Evans introduced this series of photographs on the beauties of the common tool to readers of Fortune with a brief essay, in which he stated what Mr. Hechinger seemed to know all along: ''Almost all basic small tools stand, aesthetically speaking, for elegance, candor and purity.''

HEADLINE: With Fort Closing, Towns Ponder a 1,126-Acre Windfall 

BYLINE: By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI

 BODY:
WHEN Gerald J. Tarantolo, the mayor of Eatontown, N.J., places a price tag on the 452 acres of land his town hopes to acquire when Fort Monmouth closes, he is not exaggerating.
 ''Hopefully, $1 will be able to pay for it,'' he said. ''After all, we do have a long history with Fort Monmouth.''
 The fort -- established in 1917 as Camp Little Silver and renamed in 1925 in honor of Revolutionary War soldiers who died in the battle of Monmouth Court House -- is scheduled to close by Sept. 20, 2011, part of an effort to cut military spending. 
 When the fences come down, Eatontown and the neighboring Monmouth County boroughs of Oceanport and Tinton Falls could inherit and divide 1,126 acres of Fort Monmouth property within their borders. 
 Mr. Tarantolo and the other mayors, Lucille Chaump of Oceanport and Peter Maclearie of Tinton Falls, are considering how best to use the property, which not only would alter their existing landscapes but could also have a major economic impact. 
 The Fort Monmouth Economic Revitalization Planning Authority, a 10-member panel that includes the three mayors, must approve plans for the land. The authority is required to make its decision by Dec. 8.
 ''With this additional land, Eatontown will grow by 11 percent,'' Mr. Tarantolo said. ''The initial mind-set is to just expand on what we already have, but that might not be the way to pursue this. By growing, you run into a lot of problems, like providing new schools, enlarging your police force and maybe even expanding the Public Works Department.''
 According to Mr. Tarantolo, Eatowntown's piece of the Fort Monmouth pie would include 486 units of vacant military housing, an 18-hole golf course, a football complex with a track and a 20-lane bowling center.
 While Eatontown and Oceanport hope to share a fitness center that includes an indoor swimming pool, a gymnasium, a weight room and two racquetball courts, Oceanport's potential bonanza includes a marina and a parade ground that could be used for general recreation.
 ''We've hired a planner to help us look at this space,'' said Ms. Chaump, who said she expected 419 acres. ''We're going to have town meetings to discuss housing, open space, commercial space, traffic and anything else regarding this expansion.''
 With Oceanport receiving the smallest parcel -- roughly 252 acres, including an outdoor swimming pool -- Mr. Maclearie said his preference ''would not be to expand but to keep the extra land as open space.''
 The mayors want the federal government to turn over large areas -- a combined 352 acres -- through what is called a public benefit conveyance, or as Ms. Chaump put it, ''a 100 percent discount.'' Although the remaining 774 acres would belong to the towns, the Defense Department would seek fair-market value from anyone who wants to build there. 
 Ms. Chaump said that if the planning authority approves handing over the land to the towns, the Fort Monmouth Open Space and Recreation Resources Group -- which plans open-space use and which the three mayors belong to -- will decide how best to maintain the additional land.
 The towns, along with any government agency or nonprofit group seeking free or reduced-price facilities, have until March 8 to make their best pitches for the land.
 Mr. Tarantolo said his $1 bid would be accompanied by a reminder that since the late 1950s, Eatontown has ''accepted the responsibility of paying the bill to educate the children of military dependents.'' 
 He said that if the land conveyance occurs, all three towns ''will really need professional land consultants to help us through this transition.''
 ''Essentially, when Fort Monmouth closes, it will become three towns, and we must all figure out how we will reuse this land,'' he said. ''We all have a lot of studying to do.''


CORRECTION-DATE: February 4, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about plans for the property at Fort Monmouth, N.J., after it is closed misidentified the borough that would receive the smallest parcel, of 252 acres, and whose mayor prefers to keep the land as open space. It is Tinton Falls -- whose mayor is Peter Maclearie -- not Oceanport.

HEADLINE: With Apologies, Nuclear Power Gets a Second Look 

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland 

 BODY:
FEW subjects seem less suited to the intoxicating air of the World Economic Forum's annual conference than nuclear energy. Aging, expensive, unpopular, and still vulnerable to catastrophic accidents, it is the antithesis of the kinds of cutting-edge solutions that beguile the wealthy and well intentioned, who gather each winter in this Alpine ski resort.
 And yet nuclear energy is suddenly back on the agenda -- and not just here. Spurred on by politicians interested in energy independence and scientists who specialize in the field of climate change, Germany is reconsidering a commitment to shut down its nuclear power plants. France, Europe's leading nuclear power producer, is increasing its investment, as is Finland. 
 At a time when industrialized countries are wrestling with how to curb carbon dioxide emissions, nuclear energy has one indisputable advantage: unlike coal, oil, natural gas, or even biological fuels, it emits no carbon dioxide. That virtue, in the view of advocates, is enough to offset its well-documented shortcomings.
 ''It has put nuclear back into the mix,'' said Daniel C. Esty, director of the Center for Environmental Law and Policy at Yale University. ''We're seeing a new balancing of the costs and benefits.''
 But being in the mix does not mean nuclear energy will shove aside fossil fuels any time soon. In a way, the revival of interest in nuclear power illustrates the lack of palatable choices to combat global warming.
 Renewable energy, while growing steadily, has limitations. Windmills don't turn when the wind isn't blowing; solar power and geothermal energy are not yet economical enough; hydroelectric dams can be disruptive themselves. 
 That leaves nuclear power as a ''clean'' alternative to fossil fuels. It already generates one-sixth of the world's electricity, but it fell out of favor in the West two decades ago after the Chernobyl and Three Mile Island accidents. The previous German government, in fact, pledged to shut down its last nuclear power station by 2022. 
 But now Germany has also committed to deep reductions in carbon dioxide emissions in the next decade, and its new chancellor, Angela Merkel, rekindled the debate over nuclear energy by saying, ''We should consider what consequences it will have if we shut off our nuclear power plants.''
 That comment was a reference to Europe's increasing vulnerability as an importer of foreign fossil fuels. Just as the United States worries about disruptions in the supply of Middle East oil, Europe worries about Russia's penchant for using its gas and oil pipelines as a political weapon. 
 In a recent report, Deutsche Bank declared that Germany's energy policy was untenable. ''Far from reducing carbon emissions and securing future energy supplies,'' it concluded, ''current policies would increase both emissions and Germany's dependence on foreign gas imports.''
 Even in the United States, which has not ordered cuts in carbon dioxide emissions, there are more voices in favor of building nuclear plants. ''The question is, how do we produce enough electricity?'' said James E. Rogers, the chief executive of Duke Energy Corporation, a major energy supplier. ''We need to put our money on nuclear.'' 
 Critics point out that nuclear reactors are astronomically expensive, and take a decade or more to build, even if environmental groups fail to block construction altogether. 
 Given the entrenched opposition in parts of Western Europe and America, some experts say that if the world does turn to nuclear power, most of the new plants will be in China, India and other developing countries. 
 They also point out that the issue of security cuts both ways. Building more plants may reduce a country's reliance on imported oil and gas, but it also creates more targets for terrorist attacks. And there is the nuclear fuel cycle: North Korea and other countries are already suspected of diverting enriched uranium to try to make nuclear weapons. Those dangers would only multiply with an increase in the global demand for nuclear power. 
 John P. Holdren, the director of the Woods Hole Research Center, said that if current economic predictions held, nuclear energy would have to generate one-third of the world's electricity by 2100 to curb the rise in carbon dioxide emissions. That would require a tenfold increase in the number of plants, to more than 3,000.
 To manage such a risk, Mr. Holdren said, the world would need a radically new regime for policing nuclear technology. One option would be international supervision of all nuclear plants. But is that realistic? Could all countries be treated equally?
 Right now, the United Nations is demanding that Iran suspend its enrichment of uranium, to forestall the possibility that it might be used for a weapons program. It would be, at the least, awkward for European countries to plunge back into nuclear energy at the same time that European diplomats are demanding that the Iranians scale back their nuclear ambitions.
 With so many downsides, even advocates acknowledge that nuclear power should play only a partial role in the energy mix -- and then only for an interim period, until it is replaced by newer technologies.
 Of course, there is another alternative: energy efficiency. But under the snow-capped peaks of Davos, the idea of simply turning down the thermostat has not yet caught on.

HEADLINE: Health for Society's Sake

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 In ''What's a Pound of Prevention Really Worth?'' (Economix column, Jan. 24), David Leonhardt says ''the economic gains from preventive care are sometimes exaggerated.'' Perhaps so, but the reason he cites -- that the cheapest patients are the ones who die quickly without much medical care -- is economically myopic. 
It is myopic because it neglects economic gains outside the health care system. In fact, society suffers a great economic loss when one of its productive members dies prematurely. These economic losses are recognized by our legal system in cases of wrongful death where damages are tied to lost future earnings. 
 Consider an example on a more tragic scale: the AIDS epidemic in Africa has not been economically devastating because of the high cost of treatment. Rather, most of the economic consequences stem from the loss of millions of productive members of society.

HEADLINE: The Lottery's Next Big Loser: Illinois

BYLINE: By Edward Ugel. 
Edward Ugel is the author of the forthcoming ''Money for Nothing: One Man's Journey Through the Dark Side of America's Lottery Millions.''

DATELINE: BETHESDA, MD. 

 BODY:
THE other day I saw a headline indicating that Illinois was about to get out of the lottery business. At first I was cheered; it seemed that Illinois and I had something in common. Having made my living for the past decade exploiting lottery winners -- and recently having repented my ways -- I hoped the state had simply grown tired of profiting from its citizens' weaknesses. 
 But as I read the article, it turned out that Illinois isn't acting on moral principle, but in fact succumbing to the lure of easy money that has brought so many lottery winners to ruin. 
The state's plan is to turn over the running of the lottery for the next 75 years to private investors in exchange for a huge sum up front -- perhaps $10 billion. Indiana is considering following suit. The states seem to think they can do more with the money if they get a big balance all at once, albeit less money than the lottery would earn them over time. I understand that line of thinking. 
 In essence, Illinois wants what virtually every lottery winner wants: the money up front. Although now some lottery winners can take a large lump sum right away (of course, much less than the supposed value of the winning ticket), for years they were paid their jackpots in annuities over 20 or 25 years. There's a major difference between getting a million dollars right away and getting 20 annual checks for $100,000 or so. Yes, both amounts are considered fair, but the lump sum is much preferable: you don't have to wait to buy your mansion, or (more prudently) you can invest it, earn interest on it, and be protected against inflation. 
 I worked for a company that searched out winners who didn't have the option to receive their winnings in a lump sum or had chosen not to, and who then had spent themselves into short-term debt and needed money before the next annual payment. We were happy to buy their future payments in exchange for quick cash, at a handsome profit to ourselves. 
 Believe me, these financially lost winners were the rule, not the exception. There are databases overflowing with the identities of winner after winner who won seemingly huge amounts of money only to find themselves destitute (and sometimes dead). 
 At the core, all these people acted as if they had received the money up front rather than over time. You may scoff, but do you think you could win the lottery and wait patiently for 20 years while your ship comes in? Good luck. 
 And now the Illinois officials are acting just like any spendthrift winner who's being paid over time. Like many of my former clients, Illinois is selling its future in order to fortify its present. But an individual who burns through his lump sum in a few years will bear the consequences of his actions. That's not the case for Illinois: the officials who would enjoy the $10 billion windfall will be out of office decades before the 75 years is up. And instead of giving up annuities of ever shrinking value, as a lump sum winner does, Illinois is giving up an ever growing stream of revenue -- the state's lottery revenue increased 15 percent from 2003 to 2005.
 State officials seem to think they can make smart decisions with the $10 billion. But I worry that these politicians are making a decision that will allow them to spend freely and leave nothing behind for the next folks. And because (in theory at least) a goodly portion of lottery revenues usually goes to the schools, we should all be concerned about states looking for the quick payoff. 
 Trust me: I spent many years doing nothing but singing the praises of the lump sum option. I could sell it because I truly believed that the lump sum was the correct choice for any and all lottery winners, and I still do. But a $10 billion lump sum to officials who will be out of office decades before the deal runs its course raises all sorts of questions about unforeseen consequences. 
 I got out of the lottery industry because it and I had had enough of each other. It's a legitimate business, but it is an unseemly one -- no one who spends any real time in it comes out smelling like a rose, myself included. So the state of Illinois isn't the only party here that should take warning: the private equity funds that are sniffing around the deal should also think twice -- nobody is immune to lottery fever.

HEADLINE: I Saw a Playhouse, My Daughter Saw a Jail 

BYLINE: By RONALD BERGER. 
Ronald Berger, a historian, lives in upstate New York.

 BODY:
MY year-old grandson, Leo, wraps his arm around my neck as we leave the diner in Barre, Vt., where his mother, Anna, and my wife are having breakfast. Because Leo will not stop throwing utensils across the table, I offer to take him to a nearby hardware store to explore an environment where he cannot wreak as much havoc. 
 After a protracted and chaotic adolescence, our younger daughter, Anna, has just begun her final year of college. This boy with flax-blond hair and light blue eyes is her gift to the family she has been trying to flee for the last decade. Toy cars, real trains and mechanical objects of all sizes fascinate Leo. He and I spend our time together exploring lumberyards, railroad depots and any highway department that possesses a road grader, an excavator or a dump truck.
As we enter the hardware store, the middle-aged woman working the cash register says: ''Oh, my Lord. Can I hold that baby?'' After Leo completes his first romantic conquest, we move toward merchandise he cannot destroy: metal fasteners, plastic pipes and rope. But when I am distracted for a moment, he takes a large two-socket switch from a waist-high bin. 
 ''Hey buddy,'' I whisper, returning the socket to the shelf, ''This stuff is dangerous.'' I point to the plugs, junction boxes and fluorescent lights, saying, ''This is hot.'' 
 He lays his head against my shoulder and smiles sweetly. I don't want to make my grandson fearful, but I feel the need to protect him. 
 When we reach wood products, I let him examine things more freely. ''I built your mommy a playhouse one summer,'' I say. That summer, in my attempt to turn our suburban quarter-acre lot into child's paradise, I learned how to dig posts, pour cement, hang floor joists, work with oil-based paints and frame walls. 
 But during the months I worked on it, Anna, who was nearing 10, began to turn her back on childhood. By the time I completed the playhouse at summer's end, she wouldn't have been caught dead in it. 
 A year earlier, we had gone to London for six months. Anna, who didn't understand why she could not have as much freedom as her 16-year-old sister, had demanded the right to explore our neighborhood by herself and to wander through Hampstead Heath, a wilderness that is almost the size of Central Park, with the new (and more liberated) friends she had made there. 
 When we returned home to upstate New York, Anna, now in fourth grade, began producing prize-winning short stories and science projects. We felt lucky to have such an accomplished -- if rather mutinous -- daughter. 
 The first signs of genuine teenage rebellion appeared when she was 11, on a weeklong raft trip in Idaho. Egged on by a 16-year-old girl from the suburbs of Los Angeles, Anna began shadowing the teenagers who spent their evenings smoking exotic hand-rolled cigarettes among the ponderosa pines that surrounded our campsites.
 Later that year my wife and I took a six-month academic sabbatical in Berkeley, Calif., and pulled Anna from school to do so. When we returned, the dynamic of her former friendships had changed and she found herself excluded, whereupon she quickly fell in with a crowd of outcasts on the lookout for new recruits. 
 Soon teenagers wearing purple eye shadow, spiked dog collars and black leather could be found in our house at all hours. Anna began ignoring curfews, refusing to tell us where she was going, and coming home in strange cars.
 I had spent years as a whitewater guide in the Adirondacks, and Anna had loved being there with me, even serving as my assistant several times. Thinking a return to that life might be the cure for her rebelliousness, I took her to the Adirondacks for a rafting trip. But every time I gave her instructions, an interaction that in the past had demonstrated our closeness, I now got a sullen stare, the kind that said that I did not understand or respect her. 
 How does this happen? How does a child who spends her early life glued to your hip suddenly turn into a person who seems convinced that you were put on earth simply to frustrate her ambitions and dreams?
 Of course, I understood her feelings. My own father and I had had a distant relationship in which much of what I received from him was withering criticism. Unable to appreciate my father's frustrations and limitations, which included periodic unemployment and debilitating illnesses, I had spent my own teenage years retreating from his dissatisfaction and rage. 
 But I was going to be a different kind of father, one who would use reason, not rage. Even so, I didn't fully see that my hopes for Anna would not automatically become her hopes. I didn't understand how futile and naive was my goal of a trouble-free adolescence for my younger daughter.
 When Anna met a boy who confirmed her suspicion that suburbia was pure hell and her parents little more than well-mannered jailers, our troubles escalated.
 He was a brilliant student and talented cellist, but he had dropped out of high school, left his family and lived in abandoned apartments, doorways and, eventually, a cardboard box in the woods. Tall, gaunt, silent, poetic and spellbindingly intense, he soon welcomed our daughter as part of his posse. They roamed the city together, two lost souls in search of romance and trouble.
 ATTEMPTING to rescue her, we sent Anna to a wilderness camp in Wyoming with the hope that she would embrace the values we thought we had failed to instill in her. When she returned a month later, bronzed, thin and marathon-fit, she set up a tarp in our yard. ''I can't live in the house anymore,'' she said. ''Not after being in the mountains.''
 Anna slept outside for seven weeks, from Labor Day until late October, when persistent rain finally drove her indoors. During those weeks, I would go to our back door every night around 11 and stare at her sleeping form in the darkness, 20 yards from the house. Somewhere out there, less than a half-mile away, was another child, this one living in a cardboard box. He and I were locked in a terrible struggle, one that I knew he would win.
 He had everything going for him: limitless energy, a willing accomplice and a pure, uncomplicated contempt for everything I believed in -- my fierce attachment to family, in particular. I was the embodiment of everything he despised, the guardian of obsolete behaviors and values, a dimwitted, overprotective and confused dinosaur who could not grasp the significance of reggae, rap, tattoos, tongue studs and ripped clothing. It would be no contest.
 Anna, now 16, began staying away from home for days on end. Just as a thick fog began to blanket our neighborhood one Friday evening, she came back one last time.
 I met her on the front stoop. She was leaving for good, she said, and simply wanted to be able to retrieve her clothes. I said then exactly what you should not say in such circumstances: ''You're not going anywhere until you come inside and talk to us about it.'' The scene became increasingly surreal as her friends at the car began chanting, ''Let Anna go! Let Anna go!'' 
 I continued to insist that she come in and talk, but she screamed, ''You can't deny me my clothes!'' before finally fleeing to the car and speeding off. Six weeks later, school administrators, citing her record of truancy and disobedience, expelled her.
 Anna would take to the road for two years, traveling with her boyfriend out West and elsewhere, working odd jobs to survive. Then she would attend college for two years before dashing off again, this time with a new boyfriend, commencing what would be another two-year stint on the road.
 Though she had physically rejected us, she didn't let go -- far from it. Throughout these years, she called us every few days to keep us abreast of her activities. I suspect she needed to know we cared about her. For us the calls were worrisome, painful, but better than nothing, I suppose.
 It took some time for us to see the situation as it really had been. I didn't know what was at the root of Anna's rebellion, and perhaps I'll never know. But I do recognize that we failed in how we were only able to see the part of her that was reacting to us, not the child who was growing up much too quickly and was still terribly afraid.
 I COULD not admit until much later that no matter how understanding I claimed to be, I had behaved as though Anna were my surrogate, her behavior a reflection of my parenting skills, her beliefs a mirror of my ideals, her goals a product of my ambition. 
 I may have said that I wished to set her free, but it was always my agenda that I hoped she would follow, my efforts as a father she would eventually acknowledge and admire. I had avoided repeating the mistakes of my father, but I had made different ones. When Anna finally settled down in northeast Vermont, she found a person to share her life with and a reason to begin her own family.
 And as grandchildren often do, Leo has shaken up our dynamic and given us all an excuse to see one another more often and in situations of real love and appreciation. He doesn't know the gift he brings, but the rest of us are well aware.
 As Leo and I explored the hardware store that morning, I pointed out the equipment that he would need to help his parents build their new home. ''It will be just like that playhouse I built for your Mommy,'' I told him. ''But much better.''
 Our chore finished, a bag of tools in hand, Leo and I march back to the now-crowded diner. 
 Anna smiles at us. ''You roughnecks have fun?'' 
 As Leo leaps into her arms, I place beside her the tools I bought to help her and her family build their new cabin in the woods.

HEADLINE: Merging the Old With the New In a Washington Suburb

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

DATELINE: GREENBELT, Md. 

 BODY:
THE old section of this city in Prince George's County, built by the federal government for affordable housing during the Depression, is not a gated community. Yet the way Phillip Payette describes it, it might as well be.
 ''I don't have to leave too much,'' said Mr. Payette, a self-employed illustrator who works from his home, a 1937 brick town house with a slate roof. ''But I don't like to go too far anyway.''
A glance at his surroundings may explain this homebody tendency. From his door, an oak-lined path curves past a row of well-kept attached homes, to a small commercial center where he can shop, see movies or swim. Nearby, farmland, reached past parks and ponds, offers dirt roads for rides on his mountain bike.
 Even though Capitol Hill is 12 miles away, and the city border of Washington even closer, here it is leafy, walkable and clean, evoking the European-style ''garden city'' that it was built to resemble. 
 Yet, as much as old Greenbelters praise their neighborhood, they criticize the very un-Greenbelt way their city has allowed the haphazard development of some of its land.
 Shopping centers like the Beltway Plaza Mall have replaced tobacco farms and forests, and the roads that lead to them, like Kenilworth Avenue, are frequently clogged with traffic. So is Interstate 495, the Beltway, which roars nearby.
 To make matters worse, crime is also a problem. With about 22,000 residents, Greenbelt had 158 reported robberies and 247 stolen cars in 2006. Most of those incidents, police records show, took place at Springhill Lake, a 2,900-unit building that is among the East Coast's largest apartment complexes. 
 Now, in a city where us-versus-them tensions already run high, old Greenbelters are bracing for a wave of newcomers, courtesy of two developments, whose combined total will almost double the number of homes in the city.
 For the first project, a $750 million plan from the Apartment Investment Management Corporation calls for tearing down Springhill Lake, a 157-acre property that the developer already owns, and replacing it with 5,800 homes and 10,000 square feet of commercial space. Around 35 percent of the units will be owner-occupied and the rest will be rentals, according to the developer. 
 The second, Greenbelt Station, is a $2 billion proposal from Metroland Development for 2,200 homes and 2.7 million square feet of commercial space across a 130-acre lot that is now mainly a gravel pit and parking lots. The development will also abut a train station that serves lines of Washington's Metro and MARC, Maryland's commuter train.
 ''You can live, work and shop there,'' said Walter H. Petrie, the chairman of Petrie Ross Ventures, which is a partner in Metroland Development. ''We're basically building a new town.''
 To do so, Mr. Petrie and his architects said they studied old Greenbelt. Its collection of homes and shops, separated with bands of greenery, has design elements in common with a modern ''lifestyle center,'' with its open-air commercial districts, central squares and small parks. Mr. Petrie is currently building four other lifestyle centers in Maryland, he said.
 Greenbelt Station will also emphasize pedestrians over cars, featuring wide sidewalks lined with benches and plantings.
 That developers found inspiration so close to their work site is a coincidence not lost on planners. ''One of the best examples in the country of a walkable development is right across the street,'' said Chad Williams, the planner coordinator for Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, which must approve both development proposals. ''It's cyclical how the older ideas rise again.'' 
 In both projects, lighting will play a major role. While the glare can't be too harsh, developers said, it also must be bright and direct enough to deter criminals. This is of particular concern in Springhill Lake. Lighting choices will be weighed seriously so the new complex doesn't have as many shadowy, trouble-prone corners as the current one, said Patti Shwayder, a senior vice president for the Apartment Investment Management Corporation.
 ''The security of our buildings is very important to us,'' she said.
 In comparison to its neighbors, old Greenbelt, with 1,800 units, is small. About half of the units along its fishhook-shaped plot of land are owned by a co-op, which bought them from the federal government in the early 1950s. Recent listings put their prices at $210,000 to $315,000 for two-story homes with 1,000 square feet.
 In addition, for a fee of about a $400 a month, maintenance workers will empty trash cans, trim hedges and patch roofs.
 Scattered among them are rentals, built in the 1960s, and single-family homes that went up in the 1990s.
 Despite the effect that thousands of new residents could have on their neighborhood, old Greenbelters generally support the two new projects.
 For its part, Greenbelt Station will contribute ball fields, a community center and a pool to the city (promises that resulted from an eight-year battle, including a lawsuit). 
 And if Springhill Lake's crime-prevention tactics pay off, residents say, it will be an improvement on the original.
 ''It's better to have owner-occupied units than the rentals, which attract more transients,'' said Sylvia Lewis, the co-op's president, who has lived in the same two-bedroom house since 1968. ''It will be better.''
 To hedge her bets, though, this fall, Ms. Lewis started the Greenbelt Community Foundation, which will provide grants of $500 to $2,500 for local not-for-profit groups working to improve the city, in line with old Greenbelt's utopian values, she said
 ''Our ideals are very fragile,'' Ms. Lewis said, ''and they have to be strengthened with every new generation.'' 
 Greenbelt isn't the only Roosevelt-era planned neighborhood facing development pressure. Greenhills, Ohio, which was also built in 1937, faces perhaps a more severe threat.
 In the last few years, developers in Greenhills have torn down 20 of the neighborhood's original 700 homes to make way for larger ones, said Deborah Mills, president of the Greenhills Historical Society, which opposes the teardowns. Unlike the homes in Greenbelt, those in Greenhills are owned by the town, which can decide their fate.
 ''They've torn down the International style homes and replaced them with ones that would fit on the South Carolina shore,'' Ms. Mills said.
 In some ways, controversy has followed these ''green'' enclaves since Rexford Guy Tugwell, head of President Roosevelt's Resettlement Administration, dreamed them up as a way to offer families state-of-the-art rental housing, close to major cities, where unemployed adults might find work. (Greenhills is outside Cincinnati, while Greendale, a third such community, is a suburb of Milwaukee.) 
 Ardent free-market capitalists criticized the government's involvement in the real estate business. The $10 million price to build Greenbelt was also called expensive. 
 Local Maryland farmers even worried that the workers for the project would steal their apples, according to Jill St. John, curator of the Greenbelt Museum.
 Michael Sorkin, a New York-based architect who grew up in Washington, has included elements of garden cities like Greenbelt in his work for cities in the United States and abroad.
 For him, the New Urbanist trend, which favors highly compact developments that resemble urban downtowns, owes a debt to neighborhoods like Greenbelt, which efficiently uses its space, he said.
 ''The urban crisis of the moment is sprawl,'' he said, ''So I'm glad that the idea of the garden city has not yet run its course.''

HEADLINE: With Fort Closing, Towns Ponder a 1,126-Acre Windfall 

BYLINE: By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI

 BODY:
WHEN Gerald J. Tarantolo, the mayor of Eatontown, N.J., places a price tag on the 452 acres of land his town hopes to acquire when Fort Monmouth closes, he is not exaggerating.
 ''Hopefully, $1 will be able to pay for it,'' he said. ''After all, we do have a long history with Fort Monmouth.''
 The fort -- established in 1917 as Camp Little Silver and renamed in 1925 in honor of Revolutionary War soldiers who died in the battle of Monmouth Court House -- is scheduled to close by Sept. 20, 2011, part of an effort to cut military spending. 
 When the fences come down, Eatontown and the neighboring Monmouth County boroughs of Oceanport and Tinton Falls could inherit and divide 1,126 acres of Fort Monmouth property within their borders. 
 Mr. Tarantolo and the other mayors, Lucille Chaump of Oceanport and Peter Maclearie of Tinton Falls, are considering how best to use the property, which not only would alter their existing landscapes but could also have a major economic impact. 
 The Fort Monmouth Economic Revitalization Planning Authority, a 10-member panel that includes the three mayors, must approve plans for the land. The authority is required to make its decision by Dec. 8.
 ''With this additional land, Eatontown will grow by 11 percent,'' Mr. Tarantolo said. ''The initial mind-set is to just expand on what we already have, but that might not be the way to pursue this. By growing, you run into a lot of problems, like providing new schools, enlarging your police force and maybe even expanding the Public Works Department.''
 According to Mr. Tarantolo, Eatowntown's piece of the Fort Monmouth pie would include 486 units of vacant military housing, an 18-hole golf course, a football complex with a track and a 20-lane bowling center.
 While Eatontown and Oceanport hope to share a fitness center that includes an indoor swimming pool, a gymnasium, a weight room and two racquetball courts, Oceanport's potential bonanza includes a marina and a parade ground that could be used for general recreation.
 ''We've hired a planner to help us look at this space,'' said Ms. Chaump, who said she expected 419 acres. ''We're going to have town meetings to discuss housing, open space, commercial space, traffic and anything else regarding this expansion.''
 With Oceanport receiving the smallest parcel -- roughly 252 acres, including an outdoor swimming pool -- Mr. Maclearie said his preference ''would not be to expand but to keep the extra land as open space.''
 The mayors want the federal government to turn over large areas -- a combined 352 acres -- through what is called a public benefit conveyance, or as Ms. Chaump put it, ''a 100 percent discount.'' Although the remaining 774 acres would belong to the towns, the Defense Department would seek fair-market value from anyone who wants to build there. 
 Ms. Chaump said that if the planning authority approves handing over the land to the towns, the Fort Monmouth Open Space and Recreation Resources Group -- which plans open-space use and which the three mayors belong to -- will decide how best to maintain the additional land.
 The towns, along with any government agency or nonprofit group seeking free or reduced-price facilities, have until March 8 to make their best pitches for the land.
 Mr. Tarantolo said his $1 bid would be accompanied by a reminder that since the late 1950s, Eatontown has ''accepted the responsibility of paying the bill to educate the children of military dependents.'' 
 He said that if the land conveyance occurs, all three towns ''will really need professional land consultants to help us through this transition.''
 ''Essentially, when Fort Monmouth closes, it will become three towns, and we must all figure out how we will reuse this land,'' he said. ''We all have a lot of studying to do.''


CORRECTION-DATE: February 4, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about plans for the property at Fort Monmouth after it is closed misidentified the borough that would receive the smallest parcel, of 252 acres, and whose mayor prefers to keep the land as open space. It is Tinton Falls -- whose mayor is Peter Maclearie -- not Oceanport.

HEADLINE: If the Time Is Right, Oil and Water Can Mix

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP

DATELINE: BEDFORD, N.Y. 

 BODY:
LYNN BIEDERMAN, 44, says this about her mother: ''Had we not been mother and daughter, our paths would never cross.''
 Ms. Biederman lives in a woodsy part of northern Westchester County, in a big house full of comfy, country-style furniture. Though she has a full life with her husband of 20 years and their two teenagers, and her work as a children's book writer and part-time librarian, she loves to slack off, pad around the house, eat in, sleep late. ''I would do anything to stay in bed, in a room as dark as a cave, for as long as possible,'' she says.
Her mother, Judith West Edelman, a wealthy businesswoman who refuses to give her age (''If I have to tell you, the story's off''), lives on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in a 40th-floor apartment with a spectacular view of the East River, rooms full of spare modern furniture and lots of unshaded windows that let the light pour in at dawn -- which is when she gets up seven mornings a week to work out at her gym. 
 The daughter, who's in fine shape (5 feet 3 inches, 112 pounds), once made the mistake of using her mother's personal trainer. ''I was like, 'Lou, why you giving me so much weight?' He says: 'What do you mean? Your mother does more reps at a higher weight and she never complains.' ''
 The daughter seeks to avoid conflict. The mother relishes a fight. (She interrupted our interview to take a call about a woman she is battling in her co-op over an allegedly oversized dog.)
 The daughter prefers quiet getaways and hates the Hamptons. The mother likes fancy restaurants, has a big house in the Hamptons and loves the scene.
 The daughter is a Democrat, the mother a Republican.
 The daughter served me home-baked vanilla cake warm from the oven and homemade cappuccino; the mother's uniformed maid served herbal tea from tea bags and low-fat cookies from the health food store.
 The mother is punctual and has no time for fiddle-faddle; the daughter's constantly late because she fiddle-faddles. One of the mother's favorite sayings is, ''Fast walker, fast thinker.'' One of the daughter's is, ''What's the rush, Mom?'' 
 The daughter believes her children are entitled to an explanation. The mother believes her own two children and her four grandchildren should not be overindulged. One of the mother's quippy sayings to silence children: ''Why? Because it's a letter in the alphabet.''
 The daughter works at home. She knows her 14-year-old daughter's taste in food, clothes and books and loves shopping for her.
 The mother works in an office -- once an assistant to the late Milton Petrie, the renowned women's clothing retailer, she is now president of Westco, her retail fixture business. The mother was too busy working to go with the daughter to pick out a wedding dress and sent her mother-in-law, the grandmother. 
 For years the mother and daughter had a guarded relationship. Many of the daughter's best friends are women who aren't close with their mothers.
 The mother was too consumed by work to make women friends. ''I liked to talk business, and not many women did,'' she says. ''Even as a kid, I was a loner. I began to see myself as not friendly or having social skills. I'd say, 'So what, I make a million dollars a year.' ''
 But in the last few years, things changed between mother and daughter. They grew close. There was no epiphany, they agree. The mother's quippy saying for this is: ''I suppose it's an accumulation of two-way streets.'' Each woman realized she'd fallen into the same trap.
 ''I strove to be the opposite of my mother,'' the daughter says.
 And the mother? ''I grew up hungry to be different from my mother.''
 Seeing the problem helped break the cycle.
 The mother grew up poor in Dallas. She says her father, a traveling salesman, was a ''brutal'' bully. ''I saw my mother being pushed around. I myself was. My mother, poor thing -- any friends she had were losers in life. So I had to figure out for myself what kind of woman I wanted to be. No one was going to push me around. I saw very quickly a woman couldn't have a voice without economic independence.'' Her first glimpse of what she wanted came during an after-school job at a Dallas department store. ''Those Neiman Marcus women, that was the life I wanted. It stoked the fire.''
 Even though her husband, Sanford Edelman, is a successful businessman, she has never lost her fear of being dependent and has never slowed in her career. She continues to work when most her age would retire. This is how she explains her unrelenting morning workouts: ''A pretty woman has a better chance in business. I used anything I had at my disposal to get the job done.''
 When she worked with Milton Petrie (estimated at his death in 1994 to be worth nearly a billion dollars), she says: ''My viewpoint consisted of myself as a career success. It never occurred to me I could ask to get out early for my kids. Having my mother-in-law go for the wedding dress with Lynn worked for me. I realize now it's a pretty narrow way to live.
 ''If you never had a fur coat, you never had a two-carat diamond or made $100,000, it seems like a big deal.''
 What changed? ''Once you get those things, it's not a big deal. I didn't have a good relationship with my mother. I didn't want to die feeling I didn't have a good relationship with my children. I didn't want to perpetuate a legacy. Where does it stop?''
 For a while, the daughter says, she wouldn't let her mother back in: ''She saw I had something with my children. She'd say, 'I probably wasn't as great a mother as you' and I'd let it hang there.''
 And then, several years ago, the daughter began writing a novel for young adults and realized the mother character she'd created -- nicknamed the Captain -- was too harsh to be believable. As she rounded out the character, she grew to have empathy for her mother's hard life.
 They disagree about who reached out first. ''I threw the baton out, and she grabbed it,'' the daughter says.
 Says the mother: ''I worked on being a more accepting mother. If I want to say something, I let it go a day or two before bringing it up. Like negotiating in business.''
 Over Christmas, the two families went for a week to Buenos Aires to celebrate the mother's secret milestone birthday. ''The day after we flew back, Mom was in the gym at 7,'' the daughter says. ''I couldn't move.'' Asked what she loves about her mother, she says: ''It took a lot of guts for my mom to change. There's not a thing she wouldn't do for me.''
 As for the mother, she has a quippy saying to cover her half: ''Sometimes the chicken can learn from the egg.''

LYNN BIEDERMAN, 44, says this about her mother: ''Had we not been mother and daughter, our paths would never cross.''
 Ms. Biederman lives in a woodsy part of northern Westchester County, in a big house full of comfy, country-style furniture. Though she has a full life with her husband of 20 years and their two teenagers, and her work as a children's book writer and part-time librarian, she loves to slack off, pad around the house, eat in, sleep late. ''I would do anything to stay in bed, in a room as dark as a cave, for as long as possible,'' she says
.Her mother, Judith West Edelman, a wealthy businesswoman who refuses to give her age (''If I have to tell you, the story's off''), lives on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in a 40th-floor apartment with a spectacular view of the East River, rooms full of spare modern furniture and lots of unshaded windows that let the light pour in at dawn -- which is when she gets up seven mornings a week to work out at her gym. 
 The daughter, who's in fine shape (5 feet 3 inches, 112 pounds), once made the mistake of using her mother's personal trainer. ''I was like, 'Lou, why you giving me so much weight?' He says: 'What do you mean? Your mother does more reps at a higher weight and she never complains.' ''
 The daughter seeks to avoid conflict. The mother relishes a fight. (She interrupted our interview to take a call about a woman she is battling in her co-op over an allegedly oversized dog.)
 The daughter prefers quiet getaways and hates the Hamptons. The mother likes fancy restaurants, has a big house in the Hamptons and loves the scene.

HEADLINE: With Fort Closing, Towns Ponder a 1,126-Acre Windfall 

BYLINE: By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI

 BODY:
WHEN Gerald J. Tarantolo, the mayor of Eatontown, N.J., places a price tag on the 452 acres of land his town hopes to acquire when Fort Monmouth closes, he is not exaggerating.
 ''Hopefully, $1 will be able to pay for it,'' he said. ''After all, we do have a long history with Fort Monmouth.''
 The fort -- established in 1917 as Camp Little Silver and renamed in 1925 in honor of Revolutionary War soldiers who died in the battle of Monmouth Court House -- is scheduled to close by Sept. 20, 2011, part of an effort to cut military spending. 
 When the fences come down, Eatontown and the neighboring Monmouth County boroughs of Oceanport and Tinton Falls could inherit and divide 1,126 acres of Fort Monmouth property within their borders. 
 Mr. Tarantolo and the other mayors, Lucille Chaump of Oceanport and Peter Maclearie of Tinton Falls, are considering how best to use the property, which not only would alter their existing landscapes but could also have a major economic impact. 
 The Fort Monmouth Economic Revitalization Planning Authority, a 10-member panel that includes the three mayors, must approve plans for the land. The authority is required to make its decision by Dec. 8.
 ''With this additional land, Eatontown will grow by 11 percent,'' Mr. Tarantolo said. ''The initial mind-set is to just expand on what we already have, but that might not be the way to pursue this. By growing, you run into a lot of problems, like providing new schools, enlarging your police force and maybe even expanding the Public Works Department.''
 According to Mr. Tarantolo, Eatowntown's piece of the Fort Monmouth pie would include 486 units of vacant military housing, an 18-hole golf course, a football complex with a track and a 20-lane bowling center.
 While Eatontown and Oceanport hope to share a fitness center that includes an indoor swimming pool, a gymnasium, a weight room and two racquetball courts, Oceanport's potential bonanza includes a marina and a parade ground that could be used for general recreation.
 ''We've hired a planner to help us look at this space,'' said Ms. Chaump, who said she expected 419 acres. ''We're going to have town meetings to discuss housing, open space, commercial space, traffic and anything else regarding this expansion.''
 With Oceanport receiving the smallest parcel -- roughly 252 acres, including an outdoor swimming pool -- Mr. Maclearie said his preference ''would not be to expand but to keep the extra land as open space.''
 The mayors want the federal government to turn over large areas -- a combined 352 acres -- through what is called a public benefit conveyance, or as Ms. Chaump put it, ''a 100 percent discount.'' Although the remaining 774 acres would belong to the towns, the Defense Department would seek fair-market value from anyone who wants to build there. 
 Ms. Chaump said that if the planning authority approves handing over the land to the towns, the Fort Monmouth Open Space and Recreation Resources Group -- which plans open-space use and which the three mayors belong to -- will decide how best to maintain the additional land.
 The towns, along with any government agency or nonprofit group seeking free or reduced-price facilities, have until March 8 to make their best pitches for the land.
 Mr. Tarantolo said his $1 bid would be accompanied by a reminder that since the late 1950s, Eatontown has ''accepted the responsibility of paying the bill to educate the children of military dependents.'' 
 He said that if the land conveyance occurs, all three towns ''will really need professional land consultants to help us through this transition.''
 ''Essentially, when Fort Monmouth closes, it will become three towns, and we must all figure out how we will reuse this land,'' he said. ''We all have a lot of studying to do.''


CORRECTION-DATE: February 4, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about plans for the property at Fort Monmouth, N.J., after it is closed misidentified the borough that would receive the smallest parcel, of 252 acres, and whose mayor prefers to keep the land as open space. It is Tinton Falls -- whose mayor is Peter Maclearie -- not Oceanport.

HEADLINE: Our Beef With Texas

BYLINE: By Andy Horowitz. 
Andy Horowitz, a lecturer in history at Yale, is the director of the New Haven Oral History Project.

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN 

 BODY:
SURELY a town founded in Texas in 1850 and named Athens is no stranger to grandiose historical claims. Still, a bill introduced by Betty Brown, a member of the Texas House of Representatives, declaring Athens ''the original home of the hamburger'' seems awfully foolish, especially to those of us here in New Haven, home to Louis' Lunch, true birthplace of the hamburger sandwich. And though it would be easy to make a case for more pressing concerns, I am glad that Mayor John DeStefano Jr. has taken the time to defend New Haven's claim on national television.
 The facts of the case have been certified by the Library of Congress: Louis Lassen, who founded Louis' Lunch in 1895, was the first person to put ground steak between two pieces of bread (the hamburger bun had not yet been invented -- the restaurant still serves its burgers on toast) and thus altered the course of American culinary history. He did that in 1900. Athens, which also claims to have ushered in the ''modern age of the black-eyed pea euphoria'' (whatever that means), can trace its claim to the hamburger only as far back as 1904. 
Those facts may be well known, but as the city dusts itself off from the implosion last Saturday of the monolithic New Haven Coliseum, built in 1972 as the capstone to the city's nationally recognized urban renewal program, it is worth remembering the Lassen family's role in preserving an earlier era in the city's history. 
 In the 1950s and 60s, redevelopers bulldozed hundreds of acres of tenements, small stores and city neighborhoods in the name of slum clearance. Louis' Lunch stood in the way of a proposed high rise, but Mr. Lassen's grandson Ken Lassen Sr. (who at 89 still samples the beef raw most mornings to ensure its quality) refused to make way for the wrecking ball. After years of wrangling and, rumor has it, the quiet intervention of some high-ranking federal officials, Ken convinced the city to relocate the Louis' Lunch building to its current home.
 The trouble was, the structure shared its fourth wall with a 19th-century tannery building that, like so much of the rest of downtown, was scheduled for demolition. In its new location, the lunchroom would need to be partially rebuilt.
 Ken was prepared. He had watched the residents and store owners of downtown New Haven get evicted, their buildings taken by the city through eminent domain. After the bulldozers came, he wandered through the streets, collecting from the rubble one brick from each demolished business -- one brick, he'll tell you, for every tear that was shed. 
 He rebuilt Louis' Lunch from the remains of a past that the city planners thought was obsolete. Old-timers in New Haven still come to Louis' Lunch so that Ken can point out a brick from their building. It's not a memorial, exactly, but the pieces of old memories reconstructed into something new.
 Today, we recognize urban renewal as a sad period in our city's history. We can respect, even envy, the bold optimism that earned New Haven the nickname the Model City, but we reject the Modernist supposition that new buildings alone would fix all urban problems. The city planners' top-down view, divorced from what all those places meant to people, was no way to see what needed to be fixed or what did not need fixing in the first place. We mourn what was lost.
 It is right for the mayor to stand up for Louis' Lunch and the Lassens now, because the city owes them one. Ken knew, long before City Hall seemed to, that cities are made by men and women, every day, their significance built out of the memories that give the bricks of the city their meaning. 
 When interviewed recently about the dispute over the home of the hamburger, Jeff Lassen, Ken's son, said it wasn't about business, it was about family and history -- ''and we know we're right.''
 Let us not stop defending our city's history. Let us not stop boasting of Eli Whitney and his cotton gin, of A. C. Gilbert and his Erector Set, or of how Buffalo Bill Cody carried a Winchester rifle, built with pride in New Haven. Let us not even stop boasting about how New Haven native Charles Goodyear invented the rubber tire, even though it was by accident. 
 And for the love of everything good, let us not stop boasting about those landmarks that need no memorials, because they are still alive and with us. Let us celebrate Frank Pepe's pizzeria, which still turns out the thin-crust pizza it perfected more than 80 years ago. Let us celebrate also Yale University, founded by New Haven residents in 1701. Let us rejoice about ground beef, cooked in century-old vertical ovens, served between two slices of toast with tomato and onion and served here, first. And let us rejoice in the city we have made and sustained for ourselves and one another.
 In other words, we appreciate Ms. Brown's sentiment, but Athens needs to find its own thing.

HEADLINE: With Fort Closing, Towns Ponder a 1,126-Acre Windfall 

BYLINE: By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI

 BODY:
WHEN Gerald J. Tarantolo, the mayor of Eatontown, N.J., places a price tag on the 452 acres of land his town hopes to acquire when Fort Monmouth closes, he is not exaggerating.
 ''Hopefully, $1 will be able to pay for it,'' he said. ''After all, we do have a long history with Fort Monmouth.''
 The fort -- established in 1917 as Camp Little Silver and renamed in 1925 in honor of Revolutionary War soldiers who died in the battle of Monmouth Court House -- is scheduled to close by Sept. 20, 2011, part of an effort to cut military spending. 
 When the fences come down, Eatontown and the neighboring Monmouth County boroughs of Oceanport and Tinton Falls could inherit and divide 1,126 acres of Fort Monmouth property within their borders. 
 Mr. Tarantolo and the other mayors, Lucille Chaump of Oceanport and Peter Maclearie of Tinton Falls, are considering how best to use the property, which not only would alter their existing landscapes but could also have a major economic impact. 
 The Fort Monmouth Economic Revitalization Planning Authority, a 10-member panel that includes the three mayors, must approve plans for the land. The authority is required to make its decision by Dec. 8.
 ''With this additional land, Eatontown will grow by 11 percent,'' Mr. Tarantolo said. ''The initial mind-set is to just expand on what we already have, but that might not be the way to pursue this. By growing, you run into a lot of problems, like providing new schools, enlarging your police force and maybe even expanding the Public Works Department.''
 According to Mr. Tarantolo, Eatowntown's piece of the Fort Monmouth pie would include 486 units of vacant military housing, an 18-hole golf course, a football complex with a track and a 20-lane bowling center.
 While Eatontown and Oceanport hope to share a fitness center that includes an indoor swimming pool, a gymnasium, a weight room and two racquetball courts, Oceanport's potential bonanza includes a marina and a parade ground that could be used for general recreation.
 ''We've hired a planner to help us look at this space,'' said Ms. Chaump, who said she expected 419 acres. ''We're going to have town meetings to discuss housing, open space, commercial space, traffic and anything else regarding this expansion.''
 With Oceanport receiving the smallest parcel -- roughly 252 acres, including an outdoor swimming pool -- Mr. Maclearie said his preference ''would not be to expand but to keep the extra land as open space.''
 The mayors want the federal government to turn over large areas -- a combined 352 acres -- through what is called a public benefit conveyance, or as Ms. Chaump put it, ''a 100 percent discount.'' Although the remaining 774 acres would belong to the towns, the Defense Department would seek fair-market value from anyone who wants to build there. 
 Ms. Chaump said that if the planning authority approves handing over the land to the towns, the Fort Monmouth Open Space and Recreation Resources Group -- which plans open-space use and which the three mayors belong to -- will decide how best to maintain the additional land.
 The towns, along with any government agency or nonprofit group seeking free or reduced-price facilities, have until March 8 to make their best pitches for the land.
 Mr. Tarantolo said his $1 bid would be accompanied by a reminder that since the late 1950s, Eatontown has ''accepted the responsibility of paying the bill to educate the children of military dependents.'' 
 He said that if the land conveyance occurs, all three towns ''will really need professional land consultants to help us through this transition.''
 ''Essentially, when Fort Monmouth closes, it will become three towns, and we must all figure out how we will reuse this land,'' he said. ''We all have a lot of studying to do.''


CORRECTION-DATE: February 4, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about plans for the property at Fort Monmouth, N.J., after it is closed misidentified the borough that would receive the smallest parcel, of 252 acres, and whose mayor prefers to keep the land as open space. It is Tinton Falls -- whose mayor is Peter Maclearie -- not Oceanport.

HEADLINE: For Hevesi Prosecutor, 'One Standard of Justice'

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 27 

 BODY:
P. David Soares, the Democratic district attorney here, has clashed at various points in his two years in office with the mayor, the police chief, the sheriff and the County Legislature. He has assailed the war on drugs as a failure that ''provides law enforcement officials with lucrative jobs'' and called prison building an American ''economic development strategy.'' 
 Now Mr. Soares, 37, is taking on one of the most durable political machines in America: the elected officials of Albany, where built-in incumbency and a ''pay-to-play'' system have created a culture in which at least 10 state lawmakers have been investigated, indicted or convicted in recent years.
While Gov. Eliot Spitzer has been the most prominent voice calling for change, it was Mr. Soares who sent tremors through Albany by pressuring former State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, a fellow Democrat, to plead guilty to a single felony charge and to resign last month. Since then, Mr. Soares said his office has received numerous tips about wrongdoing in state government. 
 Perhaps most worrisome for the capital: his efforts to look into corruption are now being aided by a partnership with Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo, creating what could be a potent check on legislative abuses in a newly reform-minded Albany.
 ''This historically has been an office that was very much a part of the local political establishment,'' Mr. Soares said recently about the Albany prosecutor's office, which has jurisdiction over crimes in the capital. ''I come to this job with a certain independence and therefore I feel much more comfortable in looking at these cases.''
 Much of the groundwork for the Hevesi case was laid out by the State Ethics Commission and the attorney general's office, but it was Mr. Soares (pronounced soars) who decided to pursue it as a felony investigation. Mr. Soares's predecessor, Paul A. Clyne, prosecuted high-profile cases, but the more notable, including cases against former Assemblyman Roger L. Green and J. Michael Boxley, a former top Assembly aide, ended with misdemeanor pleas. 
 The Hevesi case reinforced Mr. Soares's pledge to bring ''one standard of justice'' to the office. Although a Democrat in a Democratic-run county, he is also an outsider in a city led by older white men, a native Portuguese speaker from Cape Verde, off the western coast of Africa, who moved to Pawtucket, R.I., at age 6. He graduated from Cornell and then Albany Law School.
 ''Politically, my environment's a toxic environment, O.K.?'' Mr. Soares said in an interview. ''These are people that do not forget and have not forgotten.''
 From a seafaring culture, he has decorated his office with images of sailboats. He has a fullback's build and dresses in conservative suits, but also wears a wristband with the word ''one'' on it, part of an antipoverty campaign popular with celebrities -- ''I'm a big U2, Coldplay fan,'' he explained.
 Before his 2004 election, he was an obscure junior prosecutor frustrated with his former boss, Mr. Clyne. Then he decided to do the unthinkable: run against his supervisor, and the local Democratic machine.
 He told Mr. Clyne he was going to run against him, which led to a seven-minute conversation, Mr. Soares said. ''First five, he laughed and didn't think to take me seriously, and the next two were firing me.''
 Mr. Clyne, who now assists district attorneys in the state, declined to comment.
 A bitter and expensive campaign followed. Wealthy backers of drug law reform, including a group linked to the billionaire financier George Soros, rallied support for Mr. Soares. That angered local politicians, including the longtime Albany mayor, Gerald D. Jennings, who complained that interests from New York City were interfering in the election. 
 In a recent interview, Mr. Jennings said: ''I don't have a lot of contact with David. I expect him to do the job he was elected to do.''
 His iconoclastic behavior as district attorney has certainly led some to see him as a hero ready to take on state government, while others see a zealous young prosecutor intent on making a name for himself.
 Relations with law enforcement officials frayed last year when Mr. Soares delivered a speech in Canada highly critical of American drug policy, saying the war on drugs ''provides law enforcement officials with lucrative jobs'' -- a comment that he later apologized for making, while not backing off from the essence of his criticisms. 
 ''I took great offense at that,'' said James L. Campbell, the Albany county sheriff. ''I'm in my 41st year of law enforcement, 16 as sheriff, 24 with the state police, and I have had people I work side by side with killed in this war on drugs, so I really was offended by it, but he did apologize for it.''
 His ability to take on corruption in state government was limited until recently. Last year, he created a public integrity unit to pursue such cases, but he had only two lawyers and one investigator working both local and state matters. Adding to his problems has been a feud with the County Legislature, which recently tried to strip him of his investigator.
 Along came Mr. Cuomo, the new attorney general, who pledged to bolster the district attorney's efforts with lawyers and investigators from his much larger office. The deal has benefits for Mr. Cuomo as well -- giving his own office more teeth on such cases and access to criminal grand jury proceedings -- and a prosecutor with jurisdiction. 
 ''In opening the newspapers for the past several weeks, you see scandal after scandal involving state government,'' Mr. Cuomo said recently, adding that corruption cases were ''a higher priority than probably ever before.''
 Mr. Soares said he was cautious about the Hevesi case at first, because the initial complaint was delivered to his office by Mr. Hevesi's political opponent, J. Christopher Callaghan, with cameras in tow. But Mr. Hevesi's admissions that he had used state workers to chauffeur his wife, and scathing reports from the State Ethics Commission and the attorney general's office, provided a road map for conviction, and Mr. Soares insisted on a felony plea. 
 ''You had to ask yourself, if this was a guy who worked at Dunkin' Donuts, and this happened to a guy that worked at Dunkin' Donuts, what would we be doing?'' he said. ''And if the answer is he's got to plea to this charge, he's got to pay restitution, he's got to leave his job, then what's good for the guy at Dunkin' Donuts is also good for the state comptroller.'' 
 In fact, Mr. Soares's entry into the political world similarly reflected more pedestrian concerns. The central issue in the 2004 race for district attorney was the Rockefeller-era drug laws, which sent many drug offenders away to prison for decades. 
 Mr. Clyne was a vocal supporter of such laws, while Mr. Soares became an outspoken advocate of easing them and felt the district attorney's office eschewed alternatives to locking people up. He was assigned to be the community prosecutor -- essentially presenting a public face for the office -- but felt his efforts to reach out were undermined. 
 The roots of Mr. Soares's feelings on drug policy go back to his youth. 
 In Pawtucket, his father worked as an electrician and carpenter. Though he and his three sisters have done well, his older brother has struggled with drugs and crime. 
 ''He had brushes with the law as early as the age of 14, in and out of reform school, in and out of state prison,'' Mr. Soares said, adding, ''my mother had to be the lady in the audience watching her son be arraigned.''
 Eventually, his brother was deported. 
 ''I think what was frustrating for his family, and for David,'' said Joao Goncalves, a close friend of Mr. Soares's who also grew up in Pawtucket, ''all the other siblings turned out just fine, but his brother was the bully in the neighborhood, he went down a different path.'' 
 Mr. Soares, he said, ''sees the reality of people, and sees that there are some good people that make some really bad decisions and there are bad people that make some really bad decisions as well.''
 Perhaps the same can sometimes be said of politics. Mr. Soares seems intent on making his mark.
 ''In the wake of our most recent state prosecution, I think more people are beginning to take note,'' he said. ''We do have tremendous jurisdiction and ability to help this governor with his reform agenda.''

HEADLINE: Nonprofit Groups Draw a Line at Some Donors

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
In the wake of the 2004 tsunami that devastated shorelines around the Indian Ocean, the relief group Doctors Without Borders won plaudits for its decision to halt fund-raising for the disaster once it had collected enough donations to accomplish the mission it had set for itself.
 Other relief organizations raised as much as they could and consequently faced criticism from French and British regulators and others for being unable to spend all of it expediently. 
 Doctors Without Borders, a French medical charity, has long practiced an unusual form of discipline that may cause other nonprofits to squirm. For more than a decade, it has politely declined financial support from corporations whose activities conflict with its mission and principles, recently adding some medical device makers and biotechnology companies. 
 It even declines money such companies make to match donations from their employees. ''We're not making moral judgments,'' said Alyssa Herman, director of development at the organization's New York affiliate. ''The policy is really an effort to avoid potential conflicts or barriers to our mission.''
 Nonprofit circles have been buzzing lately over a two-part series in The Los Angeles Times highlighting conflicts between the goals of the Gates Foundation and the activities of some companies in which it invests. 
 Foundations and charities have long confronted such questions. A few years ago, some museums and other organizations were fighting questions over their acceptance of donations made by corporate leaders tainted by scandals, like L. Dennis Kozlowski, the Tyco International executive who gave millions to the Whitney Museum of American Art, and Kenneth L. Lay, the Enron founder, whose name adorned facilities and programs in Houston and Aspen, Colo.
 Doctors Without Borders is not alone, though its policy may be the most stringent. Last year, the American Diabetes Association adopted a tougher policy to govern its relationship with food and drug companies, and many charities prohibit the acceptance of gifts from tobacco companies and their subsidiaries.
 Critics note, though, that beyond tobacco, such policies are usually nuanced. The American Heart Association, for instance, does not allow wine and alcohol companies to use its brand for marketing and image-building purposes, but it will accept money raised on its behalf through wine auctions and tastings. 
 Similarly, it does not allow the use of its name or logo by candy and chocolate makers but will accept money from them ''as long as no strings are attached,'' said David Livingston, the heart association's corporate secretary and counsel. 
 About 18 percent of the association's revenues in the year that ended June 30, 2006, came from companies, compared with about 7 percent of the $122 million the American unit of Doctors Without Borders raised in 2005. 
 ''Corporations are not per se bad,'' Mr. Livingston said. ''They have different interests than we do, but where our interests overlap and where doing so would not have an impact on our integrity and credibility, we think it's appropriate to work with them on behalf of what we do.''
 As the number of charities rises at a much faster pace than giving, it is difficult for any nonprofit group to look a gift horse in the mouth. ''It's a very thorny subject,'' said Diana Aviv, president and chief executive of the Independent Sector, a trade association representing about 550 nonprofit organizations. ''Where do you draw the line? Some of our largest foundations were created by individuals who have been described as robber barons. Should charities look askance at that money?''
 Rushworth M. Kidder, president of the Institute for Global Ethics, said he did not think a blanket prohibition on gifts from corporations was necessary but that charities should be thinking more about the issue. ''We're a nonprofit, and we have drawn the line, for instance, with some foundations that are clearly aligned with a political position,'' he said. ''We're here to help people understand how to think, not what to think, and to the extent that people see us as coming from a particular position because of the money we receive, it dilutes out mission.'' 
 The Doctors Without Borders policy has existed informally since the early 1990s, Ms. Herman said, and was formally approved by the board later that decade. The organization does not solicit or accept funds from any companies or their foundations that derive income from tobacco, alcohol, weapons, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, biotechnology, oil, mineral, gas and other extractive industries, like diamond mining.
 ''To take money from an economic entity whose influence goes beyond the economic to influence politics and government in the areas where we work could complicate the negotiations we have with governments, rebel groups and others,'' said Nicolas de Torrente, executive director of the Doctors Without Borders affiliate in the United States. 
 Mr. de Torrente noted, for example, the far-reaching influence of diamond mining in Western Africa, and of the oil industry in Nigeria and Sudan. ''You'll often hear of oil companies trying to set up clinics, but we are there just to do humanitarian work, not to promote or help anyone with their image,'' Mr. de Torrente said.

HEADLINE: CASINOS REAPING ANTI-BLIGHT CASH

BYLINE: By SERGE F. KOVALESKI; Jo Craven McGinty contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Seven years after New Jersey legalized gambling in 1977, state lawmakers created an agency called the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority to redirect some casino revenue to blighted areas in Atlantic City and across the state. 
 But the agency, contending that the gambling industry's success is a critical component of the state's economic health, has handed about $400 million back to the casinos themselves, a sum that accounts for more than 20 percent of the money it has committed since its inception.
That approach began in 1994 and continued as gambling competition from other states intensified, Atlantic City's chief legislative proponent expanded his political power, and the state eliminated the Department of the Public Advocate, which had criticized the agency's move to distribute money to the casinos. 
 The authority has subsidized construction of 13,000 hotel rooms in the city, 800 of them planned for a tower under construction at the Trump Taj Mahal. The agency spent $3.7 million for an IMAX theater to be built at the Tropicana Casino and Resort, where its grants also helped finance three floors of elegant stores, restaurants and a spa. An additional $26 million went to help build the House of Blues and to spruce up the facade at Showboat. 
 The agency has also pitched in for ''parking lot beautification'' at Showboat and road signs for Resorts and the Taj Mahal. And in 2005 it put $4.5 million toward express weekend train service between Manhattan and Atlantic City, to be provided by a partnership involving the Borgata, Caesars and Harrah's, in conjunction with New Jersey Transit.
 ''That C.R.D.A. money is being used to grow the industry, protect the financial well-being of the state of New Jersey and keep the development of Atlantic City rolling forward,'' said Thomas D. Carver, executive director of the reinvestment authority. ''The growth of the industry, and the addition of more rooms, relates directly to the continued development of Atlantic City as a resort destination, not just for gaming but for entertainment and other attractions as well.''
 But David Sciarra, who helped to write the legislation that created the reinvestment authority while working as a deputy public advocate, said that giving the money to the casinos ''really goes against the very purpose of C.R.D.A.''
 ''It was not set up to finance industry-related projects because the industry clearly has the resources to do that on its own,'' said Mr. Sciarra, who now runs a nonprofit group in Newark to help disadvantaged students. ''This is a betrayal of the very promise that was made to the citizens: That the casinos would have a social responsibility to invest a small percentage of their revenue through the C.R.D.A. to help make sure residents, especially the poor, had better housing and neighborhoods.'' 
 Established by the State Legislature in 1984, the reinvestment authority takes in money based on the casinos' gambling revenues. The casinos, already required to pay 8 percent of their gross to the state's Casino Revenue Fund -- which pays for programs to help the elderly and people with disabilities -- can choose to put an additional 2.5 percent in that pot or to pay 1.25 percent to the reinvestment agency. All have chosen the reinvestment route, which involves smaller payments. 
 The reinvestment authority has doled out $1.8 billion since starting operations.
 In its initial years, the authority focused largely on developing affordable multifamily housing in the dilapidated Inlet section of Atlantic City, spending an estimated $130 million on the effort. Now, including the aid to the casinos, Atlantic City has received more than 80 percent of the money over two decades, though grants and loans have been scattered throughout the state, going to Y.M.C.A. branches, senior centers, war memorials, housing developments, sports facilities and run-down neighborhoods.
 But despite the authority's disbursements, Atlantic City continues to grapple with blocks of dilapidated buildings and seamy motels that draw drug dealers and prostitutes, all within the shadows of towering, brightly lighted casinos.
 In the past dozen years, a string of changes to the law that were championed by State Senator William L. Gormley, the gambling industry's leading backer in Trenton, and some steps taken by the development authority have directed hundreds of millions of dollars back to the casinos to expand their operations.
 The reshaping of the agency's mission has come as a result of a number of factors, not least the increasing influence commanded by Mr. Gormley, a skilled and maverick legislator who has pinned the rejuvenation of Atlantic City to the vitality of its casinos. Then there is the political and economic might of the gambling industry, which generated a record $5.2 billion in revenue last year and paid $417.5 million in taxes into the Casino Revenue Fund. 
 The changes at the authority were put into motion around the time that the State Legislature, then dominated by Republicans, abolished the Department of the Public Advocate, which had spoken out against efforts by the gambling industry to broaden the reinvestment authority's scope to include investments in casinos. At the time, Republicans said that the public advocate's office had become too aggressive and liberal and had outlived its usefulness. Under Gov. Jon S. Corzine, a Democrat, the department was re-established last year.
 Senator Gormley, an Atlantic County Republican who has served in the Legislature since 1978 -- the year the first casinos opened -- and is retiring from the Legislature after his current term, says the Atlantic City casinos have needed the money from the reinvestment authority to expand and diversify. 
 That, he says, assists them in competing with slot parlors and video lottery terminals in New York State, Delaware and Pennsylvania and from Indian casinos in Connecticut and New York. 
 He said that from 1990 to 1993, virtually no new hotel rooms were built in Atlantic City, ''and in order to become a convention destination, you needed more hotel rooms.''
 The legislation that created the reinvestment authority says the agency's purpose is ''to maintain public confidence in the casino gaming industry as a unique tool of urban redevelopment'' for Atlantic City and ''to directly facilitate the redevelopment of existing blighted areas and to address the pressing social and economic needs of the residents'' of Atlantic City and New Jersey. 
 The first significant changes in the direction of the reinvestment authority came in 1993, when the Legislature, trying to address an anticipated shortage of hotel rooms in Atlantic City, required the agency to make $100 million available for casinos to add rooms. Three years later, the law was amended again to make an additional $75 million from the agency available for more rooms. The casinos were to accommodate convention visitors with the new rooms.
 ''We needed an incentive because we had enjoyed exclusivity on the East Coast and knew gaming was going to expand in other jurisdictions, and that the Atlantic City casinos could take their capital dollars somewhere else,'' Mr. Gormley said. ''Not to take away from the mission of the C.R.D.A., but if we were just a town of $9 buffets, buckets of quarters and free bus tickets to Atlantic City, we wouldn't have grown and C.R.D.A. revenue would have fallen flat, at best.''
 Nancy K. Wattson, the chief financial officer of the reinvestment authority, said that with the casinos getting money back from the agency, legislation required them to continue to provide contributions to the agency for 50 years, rather than 25 years. 
 The casino reinvestment authority is the only agency of its kind in the United States, according to Roger Gros, editor of the magazine Global Gaming Business. 
 Meg Worthington, a township council member in Galloway Township for the last 21 years, said that her community, nine miles from Atlantic City, struggled to accommodate the growth the casinos have brought. Its population has increased to 40,000 from 12,000 in 1984. But, she said, the township has been unable to obtain any money from the reinvestment authority to help it cope.
 ''I don't begrudge the gaming industry for trying to find ways to grow, but there needs to be a more holistic approach to growth,'' Ms. Worthington said.
 After the push for hotel rooms, lawmakers in 2001 created tax incentives for the gambling industry to provide more retail and entertainment amenities. In connection with this, the reinvestment authority offered cash inducements, committing $89 million for new retail and entertainment areas at the Tropicana and Caesars, and one that is planned for the Trump Plaza. 
 In 2003 and 2004, other legislation set up a $30 million fund for expansion at casino hotels and a $60 million fund for more nongambling projects at casinos, using special taxes levied on the casinos. 
 As for the weekend express train service from New York, which is expected to begin this year, Ms. Wattson said that the reinvestment authority had stipulated that one-quarter of the seats be made available to the public, rather than exclusively for people booked by the casino sponsors. 
 Larry Mullin, the president and chief operating officer of the Borgata, said that just over a year ago, the authority mentioned that some of its money might be available for the project, which involves buying eight new rail cars. ''We were willing to fund our portion, but the fact that there were C.R.D.A. dollars available, why wouldn't we take advantage of that?'' Mr. Mullin said.
 Fred Buro, the president and chief operating officer of the Tropicana, said that the gambling industry in New Jersey was facing new challenges and that the additional capital provided by the reinvestment authority was a positive step.
 ''This mission must be ever-evolving; nobody has a crystal ball,'' he said. ''Sometimes it is difficult for any business to allocate more capital beyond the business plan, so C.R.D.A. is saying, 'We are here to help.' ''

HEADLINE: Restoring Dignity to Sitting Bull, Wherever He Is

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY

DATELINE: STANDING ROCK RESERVATION, S.D. 

 BODY:
Here, on a snow-dusted bluff overlooking the Missouri River, rests Sitting Bull. Or so it is said.
 Stand before the monument and see the pocks left in the granite by bullets. Notice where the nose was replaced after vandals with chains and a truck yanked the bust from its pedestal. Spot where the headdress feather was mended after being shot off. And wonder, along with the rest of the Dakotas:
 Is Sitting Bull here? 
 The 12-foot monument rises where Sitting Bull is supposedly buried and where he certainly once felt at home; where the steel-blue clouds of winter press down upon the hills of dormant grass; where nothing moves but a solitary bird in flight, and the whinnies of a distant horse sound almost like an old man's rueful laughter.
 It all seems fitting, even the vandalism, given how this world-famous American Indian has never received the respect in death that was often denied him in life. Now two men are trying to pay that respect, in late but earnest installments.
 As one of them, Rhett Albers, collects another beer bottle discarded near the base of the monument, the other, Bryan Defender, gazes up at the bust of Sitting Bull. As always, the face of stone gives away nothing.
 Maybe in the end it does not matter where the holy man actually rests, says Mr. Defender, who is Hunkpapa Sioux. Like the man whose history he honors. 
 Sitting Bull. Distinguished as a warrior against rival tribes and American soldiers. Served as spiritual leader for the Indian victory at Little Bighorn. Refused to accept white encroachment. Surrendered. Was imprisoned. Toured briefly with Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. Then, at age 59, was killed during a botched arrest in 1890, an arrest rooted in the belief that he supported a growing movement of resistance among the Sioux.
 The government buried him in Fort Yates, on the North Dakota side of this sprawling reservation that straddles the Dakotas. There, in what was then a predominantly white military community, his grave site became little more than a weedy lot. 
 Then, in 1953, some Chamber of Commerce types from the small South Dakota city of Mobridge executed a startling plan. With the blessing of a few of Sitting Bull's descendants, they crossed into North Dakota after midnight and exhumed what they believed were Sitting Bull's remains. One photograph from that strange night depicts a Mobridge mortician supervising the exhumation; he holds a cigarette in one hand and a human femur in the other.
 The men raced back 55 miles to bury the remains on this bluff, across the river from Mobridge. They scoffed at North Dakota's contention that they had taken the wrong bones, and justified their actions by saying that Sitting Bull had been born near here and that the sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski would soon create a more fitting monument to him. And would having Sitting Bull's remains help tourism in Mobridge? Well, of course. 
 Up in Fort Yates, the state eventually unveiled a plaque that left vague the whereabouts of Sitting Bull's remains (''He was buried here but his grave has been vandalized many times''), while on this bluff across from Mobridge, the area around the monument became a place to dump used tires, to have a beer party, to shoot off a gun -- sometimes into the granite.
 ''People would say, 'Party at Sitting Bull!' '' Mr. Albers recalls. ''It was a joke.''
 The site's poor condition vexed Mr. Albers, 45, an environmental consultant, and Mr. Defender, 35, who runs the reservation's solid-waste-removal operation. That irritation turned to embarrassment when a visiting foreign-exchange student asked Mr. Albers to see the monument dedicated to the famous Sitting Bull.
 So, two years ago, the men bought the monument and its 40-acre parcel from a private owner for $55,000. They mowed the grass, trucked away 50 cubic yards of debris and established a nonprofit corporation with plans to recoup their expenses and establish a cultural and educational center.
 They also came up against the still-emotional question of where the great Indian leader truly rests. Not long ago, someone scrawled a message across the granite pedestal: ''Sitting Bull is not buried here!''
 A drive through the reservation, from Mobridge to Fort Yates, is a drive through an undulant moonscape of stillness, disturbed only by the dance of an occasional horse. Here, unemployment among the 11,000 people is nearly 80 percent, and the challenge of restoring a sense of self-identity cannot be addressed alone by revenue from the two modest casinos.
 In an office in Fort Yates sits Ron His Horse Is Thunder, the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and a great-great-great grandson of Sitting Bull. A lawyer by training, tall and lean, he expresses support for the Mobridge effort to honor his ancestor in a manner befitting the man. But when asked whether he believes Sitting Bull is buried on that bluff, he slowly shakes his head no.
 Then where is Sitting Bull? 
 LaDonna Brave Bull Allard, a tribal historian and storyteller who is overseeing improvements to the Fort Yates grave site, tries to explain. ''A person like Sitting Bull was never meant to just die and disappear,'' she says.
 Yes, but where is he?
 Smiling patiently, the woman opens her arms and spreads her hands.

HEADLINE: Study of Immigrants Links Lighter Skin And Higher Income

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: NASHVILLE, Jan. 27 

 BODY:
Light-skinned immigrants in the United States make more money on average than those with darker complexions, and the chief reason appears to be discrimination, a researcher says.
 The scholar, Joni Hersch, a professor of law and economics at Vanderbilt University, looked at a government survey of 2,084 legal immigrants to the United States from around the world and found that those with the lightest skin earned an average of 8 percent to 15 percent more than similar immigrants with much darker skin. 
''On average,'' Dr. Hersch said, ''being one shade lighter has about the same effect as having an additional year of education.'' 
 The study also found that taller immigrants earned more than shorter ones, with an extra inch of height associated with a 1 percent increase in income.
 Other researchers said the findings were consistent with other studies on color and pointed to a skin-tone prejudice that went beyond race.
 Dr. Hersch took into consideration other factors that could affect wages, like English-language proficiency, education, occupation, race or country of origin, and found that skin tone still seemed to make a difference in earnings. That meant that if two similar immigrants from Bangladesh, for example, came to the United States at the same time, with the same occupation and ability to speak English, the lighter-skinned one would make more money on average.
 ''I thought that once we controlled for race and nationality, I expected the difference to go away,'' Dr. Hersch said, ''but even with people from the same country, the same race, skin color really matters.'' 
 Although many cultures show a bias toward lighter skin, she said her analysis showed that the skin-color advantage was not based on preferential treatment for light-skinned people in their country of origin. The bias, she said, occurs in the United States.

POWER, FAITH, AND FANTASY
 America in the Middle East, 
 1776 to the Present.
 By Michael B. Oren.
 Illustrated. 778 pp. 
 W. W. Norton & Company. $35.
Around the time of the War of Independence, America's main contact with the Middle East consisted in trading Caribbean rum for Turkish opium. It's hard not to wish, reading the epic story of this 230-year relationship, now usefully condensed into a single well-researched volume, that things could have remained as simple as the swapping of your recreational poison for mine.
 But things never were quite so simple. Even then the potential for friction loomed as large as the possibility of mutual gain. Before the end of the Napoleonic wars, Christian sailors risked capture and enslavement by Muslim pirates from the Barbary ports of Algiers, Tunis and Tripoli. Governments could either front protection money, cough up ransom or threaten force. 
 America tried all three approaches, and its erratic policy echoes with sad familiarity in the 21st century. We find the same wrangling in Washington between those who counsel appeasement (the cheaper, saner option) and those who demand armed action (the more glorious); bickering among Western capitals over whether to act singly or in concert (Thomas Jefferson tried to corral a coalition, but Congress balked); and daring strikes carried out with near-fatal clumsiness (an attempt to blockade Tripoli led to the capture, in 1803, of the U.S.S. Philadelphia and its 308-man crew, and a subsequent, heroically farcical attempt to free them by effecting regime change).
 Michael B. Oren, an American-born Israeli scholar and the author of a well-received study of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, recounts such exploits with admirable detachment. ''Power, Faith, and Fantasy'' is hugely ambitious, drawing on hundreds of original sources to create a finely balanced overview of this enormously complex subject. Out of understandable necessity, the later chapters, dealing with more recent times and America's role as a superpower, preoccupied with a multilayered and often contradictory agenda in the Middle East, grow sketchier and less conclusive.
 Yet it is a diverting tale over all, full of forgotten twists and memorable characters. Who remembers now, for instance, that the Statue of Liberty was initially conceived by her French sculptor as an Egyptian peasant girl, intended to adorn the entrance to the Suez Canal? Or that the first Zionists to settle in Palestine were in fact American Protestants, who planted successive, ill-fated colonies aimed at ''restoring'' the Holy Land to Jews, so that their subsequent conversion to Christianity would speed the Second Coming? Or that Civil War veterans officered Egyptian campaigns in Sudan and Abyssinia? Or that before landing in North Africa during World War II, the United States Army dropped leaflets advertising the arrival of ''Holy Warriors ... to fight the great jihad of freedom''? 
 Some of these episodes may sound trivial or obscure, but Oren cleverly weaves them into the overarching themes of his title. Consider America's missionary effort. The printing of native-language Bibles, and the founding of schools, clinics and three universities, in Cairo, Beirut and Istanbul, that remain among the best in the region, failed to win more than a trickle of converts. Yet a hundred years of American mission work produced some unexpected change.
 It was, in part, the missionary doctors' reputation for altruism that persuaded the Saudi king to offer his oil patch not to British, but to American prospectors. And while the proto-Zionist restorationist movement faded to the fringes of Protestant preaching -- at least, until its revival by some modern evangelicals -- a sentimental attachment to the ancient Hebrews infused the religious upbringing of Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson, the two presidents who did most to cement American ties with Israel.
 Such underlying trends have seldom been so well explored, but Oren occasionally overstates their importance. Truman's own words reveal that ''faith'' was perhaps a secondary motive behind his crucial decision to back the creation of Israel. ''I have to answer to hundreds of thousands who are anxious for the success of Zionism,'' Oren quotes Truman as explaining. ''I do not have hundreds of thousands of Arabs in my constituents.'' 
 Important context is missing from some of the book's pages. Oren artfully touches on Middle Eastern influence on American popular culture, from the hootchy-kootchy dance to Camel cigarettes, but tends to dissociate this from the wider Western tradition of Orientalism. There is much gory detail about the Armenian genocide, but scant mention of the fact that Ottoman Turkey faced repeated invasion by a Russia whose czars, disastrously for the Ottomans' Armenian subjects, claimed leadership of all Orthodox Christians. At several junctures, Oren paints Europe as stubbornly resistant to American policy, without adequately substantiating the charge or explaining European motives. We hear nothing of how America's fateful, post-World War I decision to restrict immigration helped push desperate Jewish refugees toward Palestine.
 While correctly noting the peculiar mix of cultural disdain and romantic fascination that has marked American attitudes to Muslim Middle Easterners, Oren curiously declines to distance himself from some unflattering views. We hear, for instance, of an 18th-century diplomat whose ''experience had taught him that in the Middle East power alone was respected,'' as if this were a quality unique to the region. And a hint of distaste sometimes infuses his language. The landmass of the Middle East curves ''scimitar-like through Arabia.'' Elsewhere, Oren speaks blithely of ''nameless Middle Eastern thugs'' and ''the ubiquity of Arab terror.'' Such shopworn phrases tend to compound, rather than dispel, preconceived notions of the Middle East as a kind of unfathomable Badland.
 Commendably, in a work of such scope, there are very few errors of fact or omission. Yet, as a reserve major in the Israeli Army, Oren ought to know that Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon was not provoked by the P.L.O. ''regularly striking'' at Galilee. Yasir Arafat's group was certainly an elemental threat to the Jewish state, but had actually been observing a long, American-brokered cease-fire before Ariel Sharon's drive to Beirut. It is also odd that the author hardly touches upon the influence of the pro-Israel lobby, or on the issue of United States financial and military aid to Israel, factors undeniably crucial to any understanding of America's involvement with today's Middle East.
 Oren mostly avoids the temptation to seek historical parallels to modern events. The occasions when he succumbs reveal the peril for historians of this habit. Toward the book's conclusion, for instance, he avers that ''by protecting themselves from Middle Eastern threats while simultaneously trying to assist native people, U.S. forces in Iraq were, in effect, revisiting the earliest American involvement in the region.'' Surely, as we now know, the threat to America posed by Saddam Hussein's Iraq was more fantastical than real, until, that is, American forces hit the ground there.
 Such subtle reinforcement of America's self-image as an innocent among Middle Eastern sharks mars an otherwise exemplary work. This is a pity, since, as Oren amply illustrates, it is America's failure to be clear and honest about its own motives, as much as its serial failure to interpret the Middle East, that has so often befuddled relations with the region.
