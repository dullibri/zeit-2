HEADLINE: The Republican Glasnost

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Senator Marco Rubio won the Jack Kemp Foundation's Leadership Award earlier this week. In his speech accepting the award, he sketched out his Republican vision. Some of the policies he mentioned were pretty conventional for someone of his party: limiting regulations, approving the Keystone XL Pipeline. Some were less conventional, at least as the Republican Party has recently defined itself: creating more community health centers, investing in more teacher training, embracing Pell grants.
But the speech really began to sing toward the end. Rubio made an oblique rebuttal to some of the Republican gaffes during the campaign: ''Some say that our problem is that the American people have changed. That too many people want things from government. But I am convinced that the overwhelming majority of our people just want what my parents had: a chance.'' 
Then he recalled an episode: ''I was giving a speech at a fancy hotel in New York City. When I arrived at the banquet hall, I was approached by a group of three uniformed employees from the hotel's catering department. They had seen my speech at the Republican convention, where I told the story of my father the banquet bartender. And they had a gift for me. They presented me with this name tag, which says, ''Rubio, Banquet Bartender.''
As he was telling this story, Rubio motioned to some of the service staff at the Kemp dinner. They stopped to listen to him. ''It all starts with our people,'' Rubio continued. ''In the kitchens of our hotels. In the landscaping crews that work in our neighborhoods. In the late-night janitorial shifts that clean our offices. There you will find the dreams America was built on. There you will find the promise of tomorrow. Their journey is our nation's destiny. And if they can give their children what our parents gave us, the 21st-century America will be the single greatest nation that man has ever known.''
People at the dinner say that there was a hushed silence for a second as Rubio concluded with this refrain. Then a roaring ovation swelled and filled the room.
The Republican Party has a long way to go before it revives itself as a majority party. But that speech signifies a moment in that revival. And I would say the last month has marked a moment.
Over the past month, the Republican Party has changed far more than I expected. First, the people at the ideological extremes of the party have begun to self-ghettoize. The Tea Party movement attracted many people who are drawn to black and white certainties and lock-step unity. People like that have a tendency to migrate from mainstream politics, which is inevitably messy and impure, to ever more marginal oases of purity.
Jim DeMint, for example, is leaving the Senate to go lead the Heritage Foundation. He is leaving the center of the action, where immigration, tax and other reforms will be crafted, for a political advocacy organization known more for ideological purity and fund-raising prowess than for creativity, curiosity or intellectual innovation.
Second, politics is being reborn. For a time, Republican candidates like Richard Mourdock of Indiana proudly declared that they didn't believe in compromise. Political activists spent more time purging deviationists than in trying to attract new converts.
But that mania has passed. There are increasing signs that House Republicans are willing to unite behind Speaker John Boehner so he can cut a deal to avert the ''fiscal cliff.'' There has been an epidemic of open-mindedness as Republicans try to win minority votes and create a version of their party that can be competitive in states like Connecticut and California.
Finally, there has even been some shifting of economic values, or at least in how the party presents those values. The other speaker at the Kemp dinner was Representative Paul Ryan, who spoke about how to alleviate poverty. He didn't abandon any of his fundamental beliefs, but he framed those beliefs in a more welcoming way and opened up room for growth and new thinking.
The obligations to combat poverty, Ryan said, are beyond dispute. ''The real debate is how best we can meet them. It's whether they are better met by private groups or by government -- by voluntary action or by government action. The truth is, there has to be a balance. Government must act for the common good, while leaving private groups free to do the work that only they can do.''
Like Rubio, Ryan projected a more balanced and attractive vision. He spoke with passion about those who long to rise.
The Republicans may still blow it. If President Obama is flexible and they don't meet him partway, Republicans would contribute to a recession that would discredit them for a decade. But they are moving in the right direction and moving fast. These are first steps, and encouraging ones.

HEADLINE: U.N. Envoy Is Seeking a Deal to Oust Assad From Syria

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON and ELLEN BARRY; Michael R. Gordon reported from Dublin, and Ellen Barry from Moscow.

 BODY:
DUBLIN -- With the support of the United States, the United Nations special envoy on Syria is mounting a diplomatic push for a brokered agreement that would lead to the ouster of the country's president, Bashar al-Assad, and the installation of a transitional government.
The envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, convened an unusual three-way meeting on Thursday night at a Dublin hotel with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov. 
After the 40-minute meeting, Mr. Brahimi said his goal was to ''put together a peace process'' that would build on discussions that the United States and Russia had in June but which quickly collapsed.
Mr. Brahimi and senior American and Russian officials plan to meet again in several days to see if they can agree on specifics of a negotiating approach that might end the 20-month conflict, which has killed more than 40,000 Syrians.
With Mr. Assad's fortunes looking bleaker and persistent worries that the Syrian leader is considering using his chemical arsenal, the hope on the American side was that the Russians might throw their weight behind Mr. Brahimi's effort.
''Events on the ground in Syria are accelerating, and we see that in many different ways,'' Mrs. Clinton said before the meeting, alluding to reports on chemical weapons developments. ''The pressure against the regime in and around Damascus appears to be increasing.''
The United States is in a race to prevent the military developments in Syria from outpacing the nascent arrangements for a political transition. But daunting questions remain, including the possibility that the Russian position has not fundamentally shifted and the absence of any indication that Assad government loyalists and the Syrian opposition are interested in negotiating a transitional arrangement with each other.
''The longer Syrian violence continues, the more extremists benefit,'' the American ambassador to Syria, Robert Ford, said in remarks at a Washington event organized by the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a nongovernment group.
The goal of the United States is to cobble together an answer to the ''day after'' questions. That is, who would govern Syria if Mr. Assad were finally deposed? And how can the international community reduce the risk of a downward spiraling sectarian and ethnic bloodletting that might spill over Syria's border and enable radical Islamists to emerge as a potent political force?
Each of the several elements to the American strategy is challenging in its own right, and they require synchronization in the weeks ahead.
The United States is trying to shape and broaden the Syrian opposition so that it can play a major role in a political transition should Mr. Assad be driven from power. Mrs. Clinton has hinted that the United States will recognize the Syrian opposition as the legitimate political representative of the Syrian people at a meeting next week in Marrakesh, Morocco -- assuming that the opposition continues to flesh out its organization and political structure.
Britain, France, Turkey and the Gulf Cooperation Council have already formally recognized the group.
Recognition by the United States would be more than symbolic. The hope is that the group becomes a mechanism for channeling aid inside Syria and governing territory that it liberates from the Assad government.
''For the first time, there is a national opposition leadership,'' Mr. Ford asserted in his appearance on Thursday. ''Finally, people on the inside are working with those on the outside.''
The United States is also moving to designate the Nusra Front as an international terrorist organization, a move that has pros and cons since the group is made up of some of the most experienced fighters against the Assad government. But the United States wants to isolate the group politically from the rest of the opposition during a transition, because the front is seen by experts as affiliated with Al Qaeda.
Lastly, the Obama administration is trying to get the Russians on board to revive last June's Geneva discussions with them and the United Nations that collapsed. The United States had thought those talks would lead to Mr. Assad's relinquishing power and a United Nations Security Council resolution threatening economic sanctions and, in theory, military action under Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter, but the Russians later interpreted the talks differently.
Forging a common American and Russian position, American officials believe, would leave Iran as the only major international supporter of the Assad government and encourage government loyalists to abandon Mr. Assad.
The focus of Thursday night's talks, which took place on the margins of a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, was, Mr. Brahimi said, how ''to put together a peace process that will be based on Geneva.''
''We haven't taken any sensational decisions,'' he added. After the talks ended, Mr. Lavrov caught a flight to Moscow, presumably to brief President Vladimir V. Putin and plan Moscow's next moves. Russia has cast its support for Mr. Assad as a principled stand against Western-led interventions in the region. But Russian officials now appear to be thinking more seriously about a transition.
A lawmaker with the dominant party, United Russia, told visiting British legislators on Thursday that although Russia wants to see the Assad government rule effectively, ''time shows that this task is beyond its strength.''
Russia is also eager to protect its strategic interests in Syria, fading traces of the Soviet Union's strong foothold in the Middle East. In talks with opposition figures, officials have raised the issue of its modest naval facility at the port of Tartus, Russia's last military base outside the former Soviet Union. It is almost certainly eager to continue its defense contracts with Damascus because their loss would hurt important players in the defense industry who have already been battered by the Arab uprisings.
Because Russia has few lines of communication with the rebel groups now in the forefront of fighting in Syria, as discussions of a transitional arrangement begin, it hopes to increase the role of the domestic opposition groups it has strong ties with, analysts here said.
And on Monday came the first official statement about helping Russian citizens leave Syria -- a nearly impossible task, since tens of thousands of Russian women have married into Syrian families and are scattered with their children throughout the country.

HEADLINE: Yesterday's Tomorrows, Full of Rosy Visions

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN

 BODY:
We are not terribly interested in the future these days. We are preoccupied with repairs, restorations, reparations, reformations -- attempts to redo or reconceive the past. That is where we look for blame and where we look for promise. The future? Well, who is to say that it will not be more of the same until the past is fixed? Progress is a word best used in scare quotes.
Perhaps.
Take a look at the new exhibition at the Museum of the City of New York, ''Designing Tomorrow: America's World's Fairs of the 1930s.'' It surveys six World's Fairs, in Chicago (1933-4), San Diego (1935-6), Dallas (1936), Cleveland (1936-7), San Francisco (1939-40) and New York (1939-40). They were seen by tens of millions of Americans. They offered visions of unalloyed progress, lives of increased ease, an exhilarating future. There would be robotic companions like Elektro (who could walk, talk and smoke a cigarette); there would be soaring spires and sleek cable cars; there would be new materials and new possibilities. And all this was being promised during the Depression's worst years, on the eve of the century's most traumatic global war. 
That is why, in recent decades, those glossy World's Fair promises tended to be seen as just so much hokum, an ideological magic trick: watch the glittering spectacles and you won't notice what is really going on. Corporations and governments joined in self-promotional alliances. Chicago's exhibition was called ''Century of Progress,'' New York's was ''Building the World of Tomorrow.'' General Motors promised a veritable ''Futurama'' of progress.
The American Can Company, the National Cash Register Company, DuPont, Texaco, Valvoline, Chrysler and Ford all offered inspirational demonstrations of the powers of corporate innovation.
It was all a smoke screen, surely. Was there any hint that there were problems that Bakelite toaster handles, automated cow-milkers and air-conditioned coaches could not solve? The real world was kept at bay. Yet at the New York fair, after the Hitler-Stalin Pact in 1939, the Soviet pavilion was leveled and the ''American Commons'' took its place, becoming, we learn, ''a site for patriotic rallies.''
So a little skepticism about the commercial utopian promise is necessary, and if you look closely you can find that warning here as well, when we are told that ''corporations assumed the mantle of public saviors.'' There is also a photograph of a ramshackle Jim Crow-style schoolroom from rural Mississippi in which a black teacher is showing her impoverished pupils the New York fair's symbols of technological progress, the Trylon and Perisphere, a jarring image of the ideal's limits.
But you can also see something else. This exhibition, an import from the National Building Museum in Washington, where its curators were Laura Schiavo and Deborah Sorensen, has been expanded and altered by Jessica Lautin at the City Museum, putting more weight on New York and drawing on the museum's collection of drawings and materials from the 1939 fair's Board of Design.
The result seems to break with the temper of our times: it is essentially celebratory. It takes the promise of progress seriously. And it tells us that in the midst of the '30s -- that bleak decade -- these fairs foreshadowed the world of postwar America, with images of highways and suburbia, demonstrations of nylon stockings and televisions, and glimpses of a coming era of prosperity.
And there isn't a scare quote in sight.
The leap from the '30s fairs to postwar America is not all that far. The show points out that industrial designers and architects set the aesthetic tone of these celebrations, including the designer Henry Dreyfuss, whose Democracity diorama in New York was a utopian celebration of a futuristic city divided into specialized districts linked by highways. (Dreyfuss also designed the first unified telephone handset in a model used until 1950.)
New York's Trylon and Perisphere were created by Wallace K. Harrison and J. André Fouilhoux; Harrison later played a key role in designing the United Nations, the Metropolitan Opera House and the Time-Life Building. Examples accumulate: these fairs brought populist modernism into the American vernacular. The exhibition might have put this aesthetic in an international context as the historian Robert W. Rydell does in his contribution to the valuable catalog, but the domestic transformation is clear.
You can see it here too in the fairs' imagined homes of the future: individual rooms took on multiple functions, ornament was stripped away, and the lugubrious weight of pre-modern furnishings was lifted, creating economical designs that soon became the standard for postwar suburban developments.
At the same time corporate innovation was transforming private life. Automobile companies expanded the possibility of individualized transportation with new luxuries and dramatized the allure of the still-nascent national highway system. Manufacturing was turned into theatrical magic; the General Motors pavilion in Chicago included a working Chevrolet assembly line, observed by a thousand spectators at a time.
We also see an excerpt from a film made by Westinghouse for the New York fair, showing a fictional family, the Middletons, making their way through the pavilion. In one scene three generations of Middleton women watch Mrs. Drudge frenziedly washing a sink full of dishes as Mrs. Modern leisurely watches them scrubbed in a new dishwasher; an announcer chronicles the duel in a style later familiar in 1950s game shows.
This comes across now as dated and slightly comic, but the accumulation of such small innovations, shrinking the home's time-consuming jobs, helped lead to social transformations we take for granted. And while General Motors was self-interestedly presenting a utopia for cars, potential passengers didn't require unusual convincing about the possibilities.
And legacies? The remains of these fairs can still be sampled in San Diego, Dallas and New York, where monumental relics could be sets for old sci-films; they are grand, ambitious, playful. And while Robert Moses did not fully succeed in transforming a Queens waste dump (described as ''the valley of ashes'' by Fitzgerald in ''The Great Gatsby'') into what Moses called the Versailles of America -- ''unique among parks of the world'' -- Flushing Meadows-Corona Park remains, as does the rest of his landscape: the Grand Central Parkway, the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge and (from later decades) remnants of the 1964 World's Fair, built on the same site. We learn too that the city's first major airport -- later named La Guardia -- also has its ties to the 1939 fair. Postwar, there were even hopes that the park would become the United Nations' home.
Not all this, the exhibition acknowledges, is to be unambiguously welcomed. And as Robert Bennett's essay in the catalog points out, two generations of city planners and designers rebelled against the fairs and their modernist fantasy (a ''dishonest mask of pretended order,'' Jane Jacobs railed). But those rebellions often show their own prescriptive uniformity.
This exhibition could have made an even more compelling case had it been more expansive; its compressed, graphic style crams together images without easy identification. But it makes clear that the fairs had a power that was separate from their aesthetic vision or their notions of the futuristic city. Their power was emotional, spurred by their ambition and aspiration -- an excitement at the very idea of what might be possible. After the war, that excitement helped remake American life.
Today could such fairs be possible with similar effect? The passions of aspiration seem confined to the realms of technology. But you can't look at this exhibition of exhibitions and not feel nostalgic for the future.

HEADLINE: A Long Island Clan With a Big Question

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
''The Fitzgerald Family Christmas'' manages the considerable feat of interweaving the personal dramas of nine members of a boisterous Irish-American clan into a coherent mosaic with a streamlined narrative drive. This meditation on forgiveness in the season of glad tidings may lose some steam as it speeds to very predictable places, but it doesn't turn into a tear-stained greeting card plastered with tinsel and stale peppermints.
This comfortably lived-in movie, written and directed by Edward Burns, offers a textbook example of screenwriting concision. Volumes of information and drama are conveyed with minimal dialogue in a tone so relaxed and offhand you hardly notice the painstaking craftsmanship that went into it. 
Mr. Burns shuffles this dense material with the dexterity of a card shark. The pace, although swift, is never rushed. The writing and acting give you vivid enough tastes of the characters -- there are seven children, two parents, and assorted spouses, lovers and friends -- so that each registers as a singular flavor.
The ensemble includes some of the same actors from Mr. Burns's directorial debut in 1995, ''The Brothers McMullen,'' which won an Independent Spirit Award for best first feature and the grand jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival. Together, the actors convincingly evoke the familial and social bonds connecting working-class Irish-Catholic Long Islanders.
If ''The Fitzgerald Family Christmas'' revisits the world of ''The Brothers McMullen,'' the names have changed, and Mr. Burns is stouter and ruddier than he was 17 years ago. He plays Gerry Fitzgerald, the self-appointed peacemaker and surrogate father figure of a quarrelsome, high-spirited brood of grown-up children he tries to corral for the 70th birthday of their mother, Rosie (Anita Gillette). That birthday falls two days before Christmas, and Rosie, who doesn't like birthdays, seems not to mind when her children find reasons not to attend.
Gerry, his mother's darling, owns a nearby tavern and has lived at home since an unspecified tragedy related to Sept. 11. Twenty years earlier his father, Jim (Ed Lauter), abandoned the family. Now Jim, who is broke and ailing, is pestering Gerry to persuade Rosie to allow him to join the family for Christmas dinner. When Jim walked out, leaving her to rear the last four of the seven children by herself, she vowed he would never set foot in her home again.
Rosie may be resilient and feisty, but Ms. Gillette's wonderful performance recognizes the depth of her stored-up hurt and anger. She is reluctant to believe Jim's claim that he is dying of pancreatic cancer and has only months to live.
Besides Gerry, the more sharply etched characters include his new possible sweetheart, Nora (Connie Britton), the serene caregiver for a friend of Rosie's; and his hot-tempered brother Quinn (Michael McGlone), who fancies younger women. A sister, Sharon (Kerry Bishé), gravitates toward older men, the latest of whom, nicknamed F X (Noah Emmerich), is a wealthy playboy with a house in the Hamptons.
The others include Gerry's frightened youngest brother, Cyril (Tom Guiry), who is just out of rehab and faces an uncertain future; his sister Connie (Caitlin Fitzgerald), whose abusive, unemployed partner, J J (Dara Coleman), explodes when she tells him she is pregnant; Erin (Heather Burns), her father's favorite, who has married outside the Roman Catholic faith; and an imperious oldest sister, Dottie (Marsha Dietlein Bennett), who has left her husband to hook up with her much younger gardener (John Solo).
The Fitzgeralds' collective problems aren't much worse than those of any other large family. And the movie's attitude is mostly nonjudgmental. Its moral fulcrum is the question only Rosie can answer: Should she allow Jim back into the fold? As that is debated throughout the film, with all points of view taken into account, ''The Fitzgerald Family Christmas'' addresses the meaning of family ties with a bracing emotional honesty.

HEADLINE: Lawsuit Challenges Ranbaxy's Rights to Generic Drug

BYLINE: By KATIE THOMAS

 BODY:
The Swiss drug maker Novartis had been bracing all year for the day in late September when Diovan, its top-selling blood pressure drug, would lose patent protection and a cheaper generic version would become available.
But September has come and gone, and now, nearly three months later, there is still no generic alternative to Diovan on the market. The Food and Drug Administration has not given final clearance to Ranbaxy, the generic drug maker that won the exclusive right to sell the drug for the first six months after its patent expired.
Now a competing generic company, Mylan, is suing the F.D.A. to force the agency to revoke Ranbaxy's exclusive rights and allow Mylan to begin selling the drug. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for Friday in federal court in Washington. Mylan is exclusively selling a related drug, a combination of Diovan and a diuretic, whose patent protection also expired in September. 
The delay in approval of generic Diovan has proved to be an unexpected bright spot for Novartis, since Diovan brought in more than $1.9 billion in United States sales last year, according to the health care research firm IMS Health. ''It's like extra cash,'' said Kim Vukhac, an analyst for Crédit Agricole.
But it represents another setback for Ranbaxy, which is operating under a federal consent decree and last month recalled more than 40 lots of generic Lipitor after discovering that the pills may have contained tiny glass particles. Ranbaxy has since halted all production of the drug, and the company told The Wall Street Journal this week that it believed the cause was splintered glass from the lining of a tank at a plant in India.
A spokeswoman for the F.D.A. declined to comment on why it had failed to approve Ranbaxy's generic Diovan, known as valsartan, saying federal law prohibited her from commenting on pending applications. She also declined to comment on Mylan's lawsuit.
In court papers, Mylan described the F.D.A.'s actions as ''arbitrary, capricious and unlawful'' and said the agency should not have granted Ranbaxy the sole right to sell the drug. Under federal law, a company that is the first to successfully challenge a patent and show it can make a drug is granted a six-month exclusivity period that is highly prized in the world of generics. But the law requires that those companies receive approval from the F.D.A. within 30 months, and in this case, Ranbaxy did not get approval until four months past the deadline.
The agency grants exceptions to the 30-month rule if procedures or requirements change significantly after a drug maker files its application, and in the case of Ranbaxy, it said that the rules for manufacturing Diovan had changed during that period. But Mylan has argued that the F.D.A. did not explain its reasoning and that the rule change was proposed long before Ranbaxy reached its deadline.
A spokeswoman for Mylan declined to comment. Ranbaxy said in a statement that it planned to begin selling the drug as soon as it received approval from the F.D.A.
Ms. Vukhac said Mylan had a litigious history, noting that last year, the company unsuccessfully challenged Ranbaxy's exclusive right to sell generic Lipitor on the grounds of previous manufacturing violations. It also sued Teva this year over its right to exclusively sell a generic version of Provigil, the antidrowsiness drug, in a case that was later settled.

HEADLINE: Hands Off the Internet!

BYLINE: By JERMYN BROOKS

 BODY:
A chorus of human rights groups, diplomats, companies and technologists has achieved something remarkable. They are shining a media spotlight on the most boring international conference you have never heard of: an obscure gathering of governments called the World Conference on International Telecommunications, or W.C.I.T.
Campaigners and companies alike are concerned by the prospect of authoritarian states using the opaque processes of diplomacy to grab greater control over the Internet. Governments, now meeting in Dubai, will update a global telecommunications treaty under the auspices of a U.N. agency, the International Telecommunication Union, or I.T.U. But in a world where most governments have long since lost their monopoly over cross-border communications, top-down structures are not suitable forums for making difficult decisions about Internet policy. 
Decentralized by design, the Internet is a network-of-networks, much of which is built and operated by the private sector. As the Internet's social, economic and political significance has grown, so have government efforts to control it. Some governments urge that the telecommunications treaty, last updated in 1988, should be expanded to support those efforts.
From my perspective as a free expression and privacy advocate, the most problematic of the proposals to be presented in Dubai concern topics like cybersecurity, cybercrime and online identification. Expanding the treaty to address these challenges would begin to bring the Internet under the purview of the I.T.U. Some proposals imply taking away authority from the variety of venues where Internet governance currently takes place -- a constellation of technical standards bodies and other organizations that include more than just governments in their decision-making processes. Unlike governments, which tend to prioritize their own political interests when making policy, the groups involved share a general commitment to maintaining the technical efficiency of the Internet. They also use transparent processes that are open to scrutiny.
Many governments, companies and civil society groups, particularly from developing countries, feel that they are insufficiently represented in the Internet governance ecosystem. The Internet was developed in the United States, and the existing governance institutions like the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers and the Internet Engineering Task Force often include greater participation from companies, governments and individuals in the developed world. These institutions should do better at reaching out to constituencies across the global community. Individuals and governments should join them and work to improve them.
As advocates for a free and open Internet come together in Dubai to push back against the most alarming proposals, they should also work together to find solutions and seek reforms that would ensure a genuinely inclusive approach to governing the Internet.
The conference is just one in a number of venues where Internet policymaking will be contested. At other international gatherings, governments will continue to push an agenda of greater control over Internet. We have already seen this with the International Code of Conduct for Information Security proposed to the U.N. General Assembly by Russia, China, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.
It is a testament to the power of activists, companies and technical experts that the human rights implications of international telecommunications regulations are receiving attention from policymakers. But in an era in which many multinational technology companies have global footprints that rival diplomatic services, and where an NGO campaign can mobilize as many constituents as a national politician, participation by these groups should not be the exception to international diplomatic practices.
The recent U.N. Human Rights Council resolution affirming that the same rights that people enjoy offline also apply online was, in part, the product of extensive advocacy by voices from the global north and south alike. This was an important step that shows the positive potential for international cooperation on human rights and the Internet.
As a growing number of governments have recognized, we should seek to empower an inclusive set of stakeholders from outside government to participate in policy debates when considering the Internet. The growing significance of the Internet to development, commerce and human rights requires nothing less.
Importantly, the delegates in Dubai have chosen to open some portions of the conference to the public. This could be the first step toward lasting change. Activists and innovators alike have found common ground on the importance of human rights standards, stakeholder collaboration and transparency as minimum standards for future treaty negotiations. They must make their voices count, beginning but not ending in Dubai.
Jermyn Brooks is the Independent Chair of the Global Network Initiative.

HEADLINE: European Central Bank, Citing Uncertainty, Cuts Growth Forecast

BYLINE: By MELISSA EDDY and JACK EWING; Melissa Eddy reported from Frankfurt and Jack Ewing from Warsaw. Julia Werdigier contributed reporting from London.

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- Acknowledging that the economy is likely to remain weak well into next year, the European Central Bank sharply reduced its growth forecast for the euro zone Thursday, and left its main interest rate unchanged at a record low of 0.75 percent.
Meanwhile the central bank in Britain, which does not use the euro, also decided to hold its benchmark interest rate at a record low, amid indicators that the outlook for the British economy was dimming, largely because of troubles in the euro zone. The Bank of England kept the rate at 0.5 percent.
Mario Draghi, the E.C.B. president, cited economic uncertainty for the 17 euro zone countries in scaling back the bank's prediction outlook for 2013. Compared with a previous growth forecast of 0.5 percent of growth in gross domestic product for the currency bloc, he said growth at best was unlikely to exceed 0.3 percent. And the euro zone economy could even end up shrinking 0.9 percent next year, he said.
Among the risks that could hamper future growth, Mr. Draghi listed ''uncertainties about the resolution of sovereign debt and governance issues in the euro area, geopolitical issues and fiscal policy decisions in the United States.'' 
Yet he left room for the prospect of a return to more positive figures later next year, citing recent indicators showing increased business confidence in France, Germany and Italy.
In London on Thursday, the Bank of England not only held interest rates steady, but signaled no change in its economic stimulus program, which has called for purchasing £375 billion, or some $600 billion, in government bonds to pump more money into the economy.
The government had said Wednesday that it would take a year longer to bring Britain's budget deficit under control because the economic recovery had slowed, mainly because of troubles in the euro zone.
The Bank of England is evaluating its options to fuel the British economy, which is again running out of steam after emerging from a double-dip recession earlier this year.
Apart from its bond-buying stimulus program, known as quantitative easing, the central bank has also been helping banks access capital more cheaply to be able to lend more. Some economists said more stimulus might be needed to bring back more stable growth and allow the government to meet its debt reduction target.
''Given that economic data has weakened if anything over the last month or so, further quantitative easing remains in the cards,'' said Victoria Clarke, an economist at Investec in London.
The British economy is likely to shrink 0.1 percent this year before expanding 1.2 percent next year, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility, an independent agency. That compares with 0.8 percent growth predicted for this year in March and a 2 percent expansion for next year.
Some economists expect the Bank of England to restart its bond purchasing program early next year as a way to inject more money into the economy.
For the E.C.B., in a year where it has cut its rates to a record low, introduced a &#x20ac;1 trillion, or a $1.3 trillion, program of lending to banks and announced its willingness to purchase bonds from heavily indebted countries within the euro zone, the decision to leave the benchmark interest rate untouched seemed to reflect an eagerness to shift some of the burden of responsibility back to governments.
Mr. Draghi called it ''essential'' that countries continue restructuring their financial sectors and reduce their amount of public debt, but refrained from indicating that any further programs were in the offing to help ease the crisis, now entering its third year.
The E.C.B.'s benchmark rate has lost much of its power to influence market rates in troubled corners of the euro zone. Credit remains expensive in countries like Portugal and Italy because of lingering fear among lenders that the euro zone could splinter.
''There were no clear hints on unconventional measures of credit easing,'' wrote Elga Bartsch, a researcher with Morgan Stanley, in a note to investors. ''In fact, when asked about additional measures the E.C.B. could take, Mr. Draghi rattled through what the E.C.B. has done in the past and the positive impact that these measures have had.''
Among those successful programs was a decision to make cheap, three-year loans available to European banks, largely credited with helping to avert a banking crisis and lowering borrowing costs for countries like Italy and Spain. The bank announced six more dates when banks would be able to borrow money in the first half of 2013.
Another mechanism that has helped stimulate lending has been the pledge to buy bonds of troubled countries to help contain their borrowing costs and remove fear of a euro breakup.
So far, the mere threat of E.C.B. bond buying has been enough to push down the borrowing of vulnerable countries like Spain and Italy. But many economists wonder how long the tenuous calm on debt markets can last, and speculation has mounted that Spain will be the first country to take advantage of the offer.
But Mariano Rajoy, prime minister of Spain, has said he wants assurances that his country's debt yields would be brought down if it were to participate. Mr. Draghi rejected any preconditions for entry into the bond-buying program, dubbed Outright Monetary Transactions, citing the stipulations for participation announced in September.
''The conditions under which the O.M.T. is going to be activated are very straight,'' Mr. Draghi said. ''They don't talk about negotiations or a certain interest rate or anything like that.''
Mr. Draghi also expressed confidence that European leaders would reach agreement soon on a unified regulatory framework for banks, but he insisted that such a system cover all 6,000 banks in the region -- a position that is sure to displease Germany, which wants to retain control over the small banks that do most of the lending in that country.
Inflation in the euro zone has fallen close to the E.C.B.'s official target of 2 percent, leaving room for a rate cut. Still, a cut would have been a surprise. The central bank ''has explained before that it thinks such a cut would have no impact on the economy as the transmission mechanism remains impaired,'' Marie Diron, an economist who advises the consulting firm Ernst & Young, wrote in an e-mail.
Mr. Draghi gave no clear indication whether a rate cut had been discussed among the central bankers, saying only that ''there was a wide discussion, but in the end, the prevailing decision was to leave the rates unchanged.''
Some members of the E.C.B. Governing Council may well have been concerned that a rate cut would use up one of the last policy weapons they have left.
''The E.C.B. is out of ammo,'' Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York, wrote Wednesday in his daily memo to clients. ''We cannot imagine what it might do at its meeting tomorrow that would make any difference.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Motherhood When Times Are Tough

BYLINE: By CHRYSTIA FREELAND | REUTERS

 BODY:
NEW YORK -- Which is the more powerful agent of social change: fear or sympathy? Women in rich and middle-income countries may soon find themselves enrolled in a real-life experiment testing this proposition. That is because birthrates are dropping in much of the world. Demographics may soon rocket to the top of the political agenda, demanding an entirely new way of thinking about women and motherhood and the economy.
One reason for the shift was, as it were, born in the U.S.A. That is because, for a long time, the United States has watched declining birthrates in places like Western Europe, Russia and even China with an air of superiority. The United States, lusty and fertile, was bucking the demographic trends. 
Then, last week, new data showed that in 2011, the U.S. birthrate fell to the lowest level ever recorded -- 63.2 babies per 1,000 women of childbearing age.
Crucially, immigrant women, whose fecundity had been holding up the U.S. numbers, opted out of the maternity ward in the greatest numbers. According to analysis done by the Pew Research Center, the birthrate for women born in the United States fell by 6 percent between 2007 and 2010. For foreign-born women in the United States, the drop was 14 percent. Among Mexican immigrant women, the rate plunged 23 percent.
This is a big change for the United States, bringing the birthrate in the country more closely in line with those of the rest of the developed world. The total fertility rate in the United States, a measure of the total number of children the average woman is likely to have, in 2011 was 1.89.
A recent study led by Joel Kotkin for the Civil Service College of Singapore found that the U.S. rate was edging toward European numbers: 1.54 for Greece, 1.48 for Italy and 1.5 for Spain. In rich Asian countries, including Japan and Singapore, the rate has fallen even more sharply. Even in many middle-income and poor countries, the level has fallen below the replacement rate of 2.1 -- to 1.89 in Vietnam and 1.9 in Brazil.
These figures, particularly the recent decline in the United States, have prompted a chorus of cultural lamentation.
Mr. Kotkin, for example, sees the falling birthrate as the central feature of what he calls ''post-familialism,'' a new form of social organization that prizes liberation, personal happiness and perhaps even a ''hip'' urban aesthetic over the more traditional values of community and self-sacrifice.
This cultural critique -- made, not accidentally, mostly by men -- misses the central fact about falling birthrates. They are, above all, driven by decisions by women. And, in the countries where we have seen birthrates drop, they are about decisions driven by women who face three defining facts.
First, women have the historically unprecedented power to control their own fertility.
Second, the old close-knit family and community ties that once supported child-rearing have been severed by industrialization and urbanization, and not much has emerged to take their place.
Third, women's economic circumstances have been transformed. Women in countries where birthrates have fallen tend to be richer than were previous generations with higher birthrates or their sisters in countries where the birthrate is still high.
But that shift masks some other important characteristics in the life of the middle-class woman in middle- and high-income countries.
She is more likely than ever to work -- and to need to work to maintain her family's middle-class status. She is also more likely to live in a society in which a great deal of time and money must be invested in each child to ensure his or her future success. And, particularly in Europe and the United States, family income has probably stagnated or increased only marginally over the past decade, and certainly since the recent recession.
It is tempting, particularly if you happen to be an affluent man, to frame any choice about childbearing in the lofty language of moral philosophy, to see it as a decision between valuing personal fun in the present over service in the interests of others -- one's children and one's society -- in the future.
But the truth is that for most women, children are the most delightful and luxurious of consumer goods. (Full disclosure -- I am the mother of three.) They are, however, expensive, both in terms of time and in terms of money, and more and more women in middle-income and upper-income societies are judging, with considerable sadness, that they simply cannot afford to have as many children as they would like.
This is where the question of fear versus sympathy comes in. For decades, feminists have been demanding that we come up with better ways for women to be both mothers and full members of modern society. That has often been dismissed as a ''women's issue.'' So we have not addressed it -- and now women are voting with their wombs.
Before long, we will collectively begin to appreciate that the future of our societies, and indeed of humanity itself, depends on finding a better, collective solution to this predicament.

HEADLINE: Bank of England Holds Interest Rates at Record Low

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
LONDON -- The Bank of England decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Thursday, a day after the government said Britain's economic outlook had worsened. 
Britain's central bank kept its main interest rate unchanged at a record-low 0.5 percent and also held its program of economic stimulus at £375 billion, or $600 billion.
The government said Wednesday that it would take a year longer to bring Britain's budget deficit under control because the economic recovery had slowed, mainly because of troubles in the euro zone economies.
The Bank of England is evaluating its options to fuel the British economy, which is again running out of steam after emerging from a double-dip recession earlier this year.
Apart from its bond-buying stimulus program, known as quantitative easing, the central bank has also been helping banks access capital more cheaply to be able to lend more. Some economists said more stimulus might be needed to bring back more stable growth and allow the government to meet its debt reduction target.
''Given that economic data has weakened if anything over the last month or so, further quantitative easing remains in the cards,'' Victoria Clarke, an economist at Investec in London, said.
Britain's economy is likely to shrink 0.1 percent this year and grow 1.2 percent next year, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility, an independent agency. That compares with 0.8 percent growth predicted for this year in March and a 2 percent expansion for next year.
Some economists expect the Bank of England to restart its bond purchasing program early next year as a way to pump more money into the economy.
George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, said Wednesday that his austerity plan was still on track but that the economic recovery was ''taking time.'' Problems in the euro zone economies, slowing growth in China and concern about a political impasse in the United States to deal with a possible fiscal crisis in January have weighed on Britain's already weak recovery, he said.
Fitch Ratings, the debt rating agency, warned Wednesday that missing the debt target weakened the credibility of Britain's fiscal framework, which supports its AAA debt rating. Fitch already has a negative outlook on Britain's debt rating, but a cut could make it more expensive for the government to borrow and more difficult to achieve its new debt goals.
Mervyn A. King, the governor of the Bank of England, warned last month that the troubles in the euro zone, which is Britain's biggest export market, and rising consumer prices would take their toll on the British economy. Growth will be ''sluggish'' in the near term and inflation will remain above the bank's target of 2 percent, he said. It currently is at 2.7 percent.
Mr. King, who is due to be replaced next summer by Mark J. Carney, his counterpart at the central bank in Canada, said previously that inflation had not slowed as much as the central bank had hoped, making recovery more difficult.

HEADLINE: Tapping Into the Potential of Stylish Living in Peru

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS GILL

 BODY:
LIMA -- In 2005, Marco Arellano and Robert Kelley were visiting with Mr. Arellano's family in the Peruvian capital and decided to look for an apartment in the city.
They were living at the time in a 2,000-square-foot, or 186-square-meter, three-bedroom ranch in Las Vegas, where property values were rising rapidly. But they knew Mr. Arellano's U.S. visa would expire in a few years, and even marrying his partner would not make any difference in his legal status.
In Lima, they found a building that was to be constructed overlooking the Huaca Pucllana pyramid in Miraflores, one of the city's most desired housing districts and a hub of tourist activity, with restaurants and shopping. 
''We purchased a small, 1,000-square-foot, two-bedroom condo apartment on the sixth floor, with a view,'' said Mr. Kelley, now a retired systems manager. ''The 2005 price was an amazing $51,000. With all our savings and scrimping, and some unexpected insurance money, we were able to purchase the property with no mortgage.''
It turned out to be a good decision.
''Now we see a complete reversal of fortunes,'' Mr. Kelley said. ''Our home in Lima has appreciated to almost three times its purchase price. The neighborhood is better than ever, and we are happy here with no mortgage. Taxes are low.''
They ended up selling the Vegas house some years ago at a loss. Today, ''small condos in Vegas are being sold for $50,000 to $60,000 as foreclosure properties that once sold for $200,000 new just a few years ago,'' he said. ''The world flipped.''
Real estate prices in Lima have risen 10 percent to 15 percent a year since 2006, according to Peru's Central Reserve Bank, though they still average around 20 percent less than in other capitals in the region, like Bogotá and Santiago.
''Given Peru's late start in its economic growth, our middle class was improperly formed,'' said Guillermo Castañeda-Echegaray, a managing partner of Corrales-Melgar & Castañeda-Echegaray, a law firm in Lima. ''Although there was a deficit of family homes, there was little development in this area due to restricted access to financing and high interest rates on mortgages.''
''Chilean investment brought on more investment from Colombia, Brazil, the U.S. and Europe, resulting in more companies being set up and more employment that strengthened middle-class income,'' he continued. ''This led, naturally, to the demand for more homes and, therefore, the exploding growth of housing development during recent years.''
Nearly every part of the city now has dozens of apartment buildings under construction, and in sought-after coastal districts like San Isidro, Miraflores and Barranco, a new glass tower is being built on nearly every vacant lot. In more suburban districts further inland, like San Borja and Surquillo, older houses are being torn down and turned into small buildings with anywhere from four to 20 units each.
While some in the news media have raised the possibility of a bubble, Mr. Castañeda-Echegaray disagrees, saying there is no speculation going on now.
''Peruvian banks are very careful when evaluating the risks in leveraging mortgages,'' he said. ''There are no mortgage brokerage firms or agents in Peru, and it is extremely rare to see more than one mortgage on a property.''
Thus far, the demand for housing in this city of nearly eight million is showing no signs of slowing, with buyers coming from the growing middle class, Peruvians returning home after years abroad and young people who are no longer taking the traditional path of living with their parents until marriage.
''Even though it's crazy that prices keep going up, there's always a buyer,'' said Nella Pinto, general manager of Peru Sotheby's International Realty. ''That's the market. Prices are still increasing. We still haven't hit the ceiling.''
Also, she noted, most new developments are selling out well before construction is completed.
Ms. Pinto said prices per square meter in San Isidro and Miraflores were $2,800 to $4,000 for new condominiums, or $260 to $370 per square foot, depending on the property and its proximity to parks and the Pacific Ocean.
In Surco, further inland, beside the Surco golf club, there has been a wave of new construction, and most buildings are averaging $2,300 to $2,500 a square meter. Even in the northern reaches of the city, called Los Conos, prices have been steadily rising and now cost $1,000 to $1,500 a square meter.
Most apartments in Lima are 100 to 200 square meters, or about 1,100 to 2,100 square feet, with prices for older properties about 10 percent to 15 percent less than for new builds.
Aside from a small number of buyers from neighboring countries like Argentina and Brazil, Peru is not attracting a burst of foreign investors looking to cash in on the appreciating values.
The investment environment is not as encouraging for nonresidents as it is elsewhere in the region. ''In Panama, buyers have so many incentives,'' Ms. Pinto said. ''That's something our government needs to work on.''
Foreign buyers must obtain a transaction permit from the Department of Immigration and pay a transfer tax of about 3 percent of the purchase price.
Nonresident homeowners must pay a 30 percent tax on resales, though foreigners may apply for resident status if they can prove they have lived in Peru legally for at least six months out of a 12-month period. The tax is only 5 percent for residents, though there are additional costs including a title check, and notary and registration fees that total around $1,500 for most high-end properties.

&#x2605; Geri Allen and Timeline / The Cookers (Wednesday) Ms. Allen, a wise and dynamic pianist, has been working for a while now with the group she calls Timeline, featuring a standard rhythm section and a tap dancer, Maurice Chestnut. For this performance, which will be broadcast on WBGO (88.3 FM) as part of ''The Checkout,'' she shares a bill with the Cookers, an all-star hard-bop crew -- its ranks include Eddie Henderson on trumpet, Billy Harper on tenor saxophone and Billy Hart on drums -- celebrating the release of a vibrant new album, ''Believe'' (Motéma). At 8 p.m., 92YTriBeCa, 200 Hudson Street, at Canal Street, TriBeCa, (212) 601-1000, 92ytribeca.org; $12 in advance, $15 on day of show. (Nate Chinen) 
Ben Allison Band (Saturday) A focused, productive composer, the bassist Ben Allison does something different on his most recent album, ''Action-Refraction'' (Palmetto): he covers songs by others, including P J Harvey and Neil Young. The exercise works, not least because of Mr. Allison's rapport with the guitarist Steve Cardenas and the banjoist Brandon Seabrook, who rejoin him here, in a band that also has Allison Miller on drums. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $10 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)
Peter Bernstein Trio (Friday and Saturday) Peter Bernstein, a crisp and soulful guitarist, has a longstanding rapport with his partners here, the pianist and organist Larry Goldings and the drummer Bill Stewart. The trio, which has a newish album on the Smalls Live label, first forged its fellowship with a weekly booking at Augie's, the Upper West Side haunt that preceded Smoke in the same room. At 8, 10 and 11:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, Upper West Side, (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com; $35 cover. (Chinen)
Big Band Holidays (Friday and Saturday) The Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra has a tradition of holiday concerts, and this year's edition looks promising: in addition to Wynton Marsalis, the orchestra's artistic director and most familiar soloist, the engagement will feature a pair of deeply soulful singers, Gregory Porter and René Marie. Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, Upper West Side, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; $28.50 to $120, sold out on Friday. (Chinen)
Johnathan Blake Quartet (Saturday) ''The Eleventh Hour'' is the appealingly energetic debut album by Johnathan Blake, a drummer of tumultuous force but firm control. The album, released on Sunnyside early this year, makes good use of a dual-saxophone front line with Mark Turner on tenor and Jaleel Shaw on alto. For this one-nighter he'll just have Mr. Turner (not a bad deal) along with the pianist Kevin Hays and the bassist Ben Street (ditto). At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street at Spring Street, SoHo, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; $20, $10 for members. (Chinen)
Zach Brock Quartet (Tuesday) Zach Brock is a young violinist with a singing tone and a modern but lightly rusticated style; he's also a Brooklyn resident by way of Chicago (his proving ground) and Lexington, Ky. (his hometown). After a series of small-batch releases on the Secret Fort label, he's ushering in ''Almost Never Was'' (Criss Cross), with that album's expert rhythm section: Aaron Goldberg on piano, Matt Penman on bass and Eric Harland on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Kips Bay, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $20 cover. (Chinen)
Justin Brown Standards Quartet (Friday) A drummer as well versed in state-of-the-art gospel as he is in modern jazz, Justin Brown has been making his mark as a sideman with peers like the trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire and the pianist Gerald Clayton. Here he explores a standard repertory in good and slightly mysterious company: the pianist Vijay Iyer, the bassist Harish Raghavan and the alto saxophonist Greg Osby. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, SoHo, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; $20, $10 for members. (Chinen)
EJSQ (Wednesday) The acronym stands for E. J. Strickland Quintet, a sure-footed post-bop band led by Mr. Strickland, a drummer, and featuring his twin, Marcus, on tenor saxophone. The group otherwise includes the alto saxophonist Godwin Louis, the pianist Luis Perdomo and the bassist Linda Oh. At 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, Upper West Side, (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com; $20 minimum. (Chinen)
Kenny Garrett Quintet (Tuesday through Dec. 16) Intensity has long been a hallmark for the alto saxophonist Kenny Garrett, and that remains true on ''Seeds From the Underground'' (Mack Avenue), his most recent album. It's a platform for a batch of strong new compositions -- probably Mr. Garrett's most tuneful effort since ''Songbook,'' in 1997 -- and a showcase for the same slashing postbop band heard here. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; $35 and $45 cover, $15 for students for select sets, with a minimum of $10. (Chinen)
Grass Roots (Thursday) This rough-and-ready avant-garde cohort -- the alto saxophonist Darius Jones, the baritone saxophonist Alex Harding, the bassist Sean Conly and the drummer Chad Taylor -- has a searing new album on Aum Fidelity, its self-titled debut. A mix of loosely sketched compositions (by all four members) and collective free improvisation, it embraces the lineage of 1970s free jazz, without succumbing to fixed nostalgia. At 7 and 8:30 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (347) 422-0248, barbesbrooklyn.com; $10 cover for each set. (Chinen)
Chico Hamilton (Sunday) Mr. Hamilton, one of jazz's great percussive colorists and chamber-minded bandleaders, turned 91 this fall, celebrating the occasion with a vivacious album, ''Revelation'' (Joyous Shout!). This is the last of three monthly shows at Drom, featuring his working band with Evan Schwam on reeds, Mayu Saeki on flute, Nick Demopoulos on guitar, Paul Ramsey on bass and Jeremy Carlstedt on percussion. At 7:15 p.m. (doors open at 6:30), Drom, 85 Avenue A, East Village, (212) 777-1157, dromnyc.com; $12 in advance, $15 at the door. (Chinen)
&#x2605; Roy Haynes Fountain of Youth Quartet (Tuesday through Dec. 15) At 87, Roy Haynes has lost little of his crisp pugnacity as a drummer, even less of his cavalier swagger as a bandleader and virtually none of his sartorial flash. His faithful sidemen in the Fountain of Youth Quartet, many years his junior, are the alto saxophonist Jaleel Shaw, the pianist Martin Bejerano and the bassist David Wong. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; $40 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)
&#x2605; John Hollenbeck Large Ensemble (Monday) The drummer and composer John Hollenbeck uses his namesake orchestra as a panoramic canvas, blending color and texture with an eye toward the sweeping view. He has a gorgeous new album, ''Songs I Like a Lot,'' due out on Sunnyside next month, featuring his arrangements executed by the Frankfurt Radio Big Band; here he has the Large Ensemble at his disposal, along with the album's two unerringly expressive singers, Theo Bleckmann and Kate McGarry. At 8 p.m., Roulette, 509 Atlantic Avenue, near Third Avenue, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, (917) 267-0363, roulette.org; $15, $10 for members, students and 65+. (Chinen)
Irabbagast Records Festival (Friday) The inexhaustibly creative young saxophonist Jon Irabagon has simultaneously released two albums on his new label, Irabbagast, including ''Unhinged,'' which he celebrates here. As on that album, he leads his band Outright!, a shrewdly caterwauling ensemble with Ralph Alessi on trumpet, Jacob Sacks on piano and Tom Rainey on drums. (Eivind Opsvik fills in here for John Hébert on bass.) At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $10 cover for each set, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)
Lage Lund Four (Sunday) The deftly imaginative guitarist Lage Lund has a recent album, ''Live at Smalls'' (SmallsLIVE!), that confirms his easy command in small-group settings. He'll have a different band here than on the album, retaining only the bassist Ben Street; Ed Simon (on piano) and Bill Stewart (on drums) capably fill out the roster. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; $20, $10 for members. (Chinen)
Medeski Martin & Wood (Tuesday through Dec. 16) This peripatetic groove machine recently passed the 20-year mark, with strong evidence that it hasn't grown complacent. Next week the band -- John Medeski on keyboards, Chris Wood on bass and Billy Martin on drums -- plays a residency with a different guest each night. On Tuesday their outside collaborator is the Senegalese hand drummer Aïyb Dieng; on Wednesday it's the guitarist Nels Cline. On Thursday it will be another visionary guitarist, Marc Ribot. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; $40 cover at tables, $30 cover at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)
&#x2605; Christian McBride Trio (Tuesday through Dec. 16) The deep, dark-maple tone that Christian McBride elicits from an upright bass is one of jazz's forthright pleasures, and so is the pleasure he seems to extract from it himself. He played a week at the Village Vanguard this time last year with a band that included the quicksilver young pianist Christian Sands, making his auspicious first appearance in the club. Next week both Christians appear in a trio with Ulysses Owens on drums. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; $25 cover, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)
Terrence McManus Trio (Friday) Terrence McManus, a guitarist drawn to abstract texture, features a second guitar player in this trio, the beguilingly fluent Ben Monder; he also features the drummer and percussionist Ches Smith, who knows how to create supple texture as well as clunky forward drive. At 8 p.m., Brooklyn Conservatory of Music, 58 Seventh Avenue, at Lincoln Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 622-3300, bqcm.org; $15. (Chinen)
The Music of Nina Simone (Friday and Saturday) Kim Nalley, a blues and jazz singer of strong projection, pays a visit from her home base of San Francisco, with a daunting set of shoes to fill. But she comes prepared -- listen to her album ''She Put a Spell on Me,'' from 2006 -- and has excellent company, including the saxophonist James Carter, who knows how to flatter a singer without tamping down his own radiant exuberance. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, Upper West Side, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; $55 and $65. (Chinen)
&#x2605; New Languages Presents: Music Factory (Friday through Tuesday) Equal parts conceptual-art marathon, sociopolitical statement and free-improv happening, Music Factory can plainly be described as a continuous 96-hour performance, featuring some five dozen musicians. Beginning at midnight on Friday, it will feature many configurations of improvisers in a project conceived by the multi-instrumentalist Alan Sondheim and organized with the saxophonist Jackson Moore. The industrial connotations of the title are purposeful: admission is pay as you wish (though advance tickets, $10 to $100, are available), and the actual hourly ''wage'' (based on the amount of money collected at the time of purchase) will be displayed, both on site and at newlanguages.org, where the event will be streamed. Eyebeam Art & Technology Center, 540 West 21st Street at 11th Avenue, Chelsea, (212) 937-6580, eyebeam.org, musicfactory.brownpapertickets.com. (Chinen)
New York Youth Symphony Jazz Band (Monday) The jazz arm of the estimable New York Youth Symphony appears in a hospitable room, attacking a cross-country repertory -- songbook standards like ''Indiana'' and ''I Left My Heart in San Francisco'' -- and featuring a genial grown-up star soloist, the trombonist Wycliffe Gordon. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; $30 cover, $10 for students, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)
Nós Novo (Tuesday) Led by James Shipp, a vibraphonist and percussionist, Nós Novo blends Celtic and Brazilian music with modern jazz (among other things). This engagement will be the group's second annual holiday special, mixing in Christmas songs with the regular repertory; as usual the lineup features two vocalists, Jean Rohe and Becca Stevens, along with Gilad Hekselman on guitar and Rogério Boccato on drums and percussion. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $10 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)
Ken Peplowski-Bucky Pizzarelli Quintet (Friday through Sunday) Ken Peplowski, a clarinetist and tenor saxophonist, and Bucky Pizzarelli, a guitarist, hail from different generations but share a brisk command of the swing and bebop traditions. Here they lead an estimable cohort of Derek Smith on piano, David Finck on bass and Chuck Redd on drums and vibraphone. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, Upper West Side, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; $30, $45 on Saturday, $15 students, with a minimum of $10. (Chinen)
David Sanborn (Friday through Sunday) An alto saxophonist synonymous with unctuous, gleaming crossover fare, Mr. Sanborn has been returning to his roots: the piquant soul-jazz of Hank Crawford and, by extension, Ray Charles. He returns to his regular New York perch with a band that includes Ricky Peterson on organ and piano, Nicky Moroch on guitar, Richard Patterson on bass and Gene Lake on drums. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; $45 and $55 cover at tables, $30 and $40 at the bar, with a $5 minimum; sold out on Friday at 8 p.m. (Chinen)
Manuel Valera and the New Cuban Express (Sunday) Mr. Valera, a Cuban pianist working within the modern-day New York Latin-jazz circuit, has a new album, ''New Cuban Express'' (Mavo), that presents his ideas clearly. He's working with most of the same musicians here: Yosvany Terry on saxophone and percussion, Tom Guarna on guitar, John Benitez on bass and Eric Doob on drums. (Paulo Stagnaro fills in for Mauricio Herrera on percussion.) At 9:30 p.m., Shapeshifter Lab, 18 Whitwell Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, shapeshifterlab.com; $12. (Chinen)
&#x2605; David Virelles (Wednesday) A freethinking Cuban pianist heard in excellent form with Steve Coleman, Chris Potter and others, Mr. Virelles belatedly celebrates the release of ''Continuum'' (Pi), his audacious debut, which includes all of the musicians found here: the saxophonist Román Filiú, the bassist Ben Street, the drummer Andrew Cyrille and the percussionist-poet Román Díaz. The ensemble's performance will be followed by a pair of D.J. sets, by Questlove and Tyondai Braxton. At 10 p.m., Drom, 85 Avenue A, East Village, (212) 777-1157, dromnyc.com; $10 in advance, $15 at the door. (Chinen)
Weasel Walter, Mary Halvorson and Peter Evans (Sunday) Mr. Walter, a blunt-force, spasmodic drummer, joins with Ms. Halvorson, an engagingly spiky guitarist, and Mr. Evans, a scarily proficient trumpeter; the trio, previously devoted to spontaneous inventions, features some premeditated form on its second album, ''Mechanical Malfunction'' (Thirsty Ear). At 9:15 p.m., Death by Audio, 49 South Second Street, between Kent and Wythe Avenues, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, entertainment4every1.net; $7. (Chinen)
A Peter White Christmas (Saturday) As on ''Peter White Christmas'' -- his second Christmas album, released five years ago -- the acoustic guitarist Peter White features the fellow smooth-jazz fixtures Mindi Abair (a saxophonist) and Rick Braun (a trumpeter) in this holiday package. It's also an act of synergy: Mr. Braun has his own Christmas album out this season, featuring his rat-packish singing (and a vocal cameo, on one track, by Ms. Abair). At 7:30 and 10 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (800) 745-3000, bbkingblues.com; $40 in advance, $45 day of show. (Chinen)
Steve Wilson Trio (Friday through Sunday) The alto and soprano saxophonist Steve Wilson combines economy and modernity in his playing, usually in the context of a quartet (or on one of his blue-chip assignments as a sideman). This engagement intriguingly puts him at the helm of a drummerless trio with two of his closest musical partners, the pianist Renee Rosnes and the bassist Peter Washington. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; $25 cover, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)
Phil Woods Quintet (Friday and Saturday) Some years ago the alto saxophonist and second-wave be-bopper Phil Woods released ''American Songbook II'' (Kind of Blue), a sharp and often sparkling album featuring compatriots like the trumpeter Brian Lynch, the bassist Steve Gilmore and the drummer Bill Goodwin. As has happened a few times since then, those players rejoin him along with the pianist Bill Mays. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; $30 and $40 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)
&#x2605; Miguel Zenón and Laurent Coq: 'Rayuela' (Friday through Sunday) Mr. Zenón, a soulful and searching Puerto Rican alto saxophonist and composer, recently teamed up with Mr. Coq, an articulate and painterly French pianist, on ''Rayuela'' (Sunnyside), an album directly inspired by the 1963 Julio Cortázar novel of the same name. They revisit those themes here, enlisting the same partners as on the album: the cellist and trombonist Dana Leong and the drummer and percussionist Dan Weiss. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set on Friday and Saturday, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Kips Bay, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $30, $25 on Sunday. (Chinen)

HEADLINE: The Forgotten Millions

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Let's get one thing straight: America is not facing a fiscal crisis. It is, however, still very much experiencing a job crisis.
It's easy to get confused about the fiscal thing, since everyone's talking about the ''fiscal cliff.'' Indeed, one recent poll suggests that a large plurality of the public believes that the budget deficit will go up if we go off that cliff.
In fact, of course, it's just the opposite: The danger is that the deficit will come down too much, too fast. And the reasons that might happen are purely political; we may be about to slash spending and raise taxes not because markets demand it, but because Republicans have been using blackmail as a bargaining strategy, and the president seems ready to call their bluff. 
Moreover, despite years of warnings from the usual suspects about the dangers of deficits and debt, our government can borrow at incredibly low interest rates -- interest rates on inflation-protected U.S. bonds are actually negative, so investors are paying our government to make use of their money. And don't tell me that markets may suddenly turn on us. Remember, the U.S. government can't run out of cash (it prints the stuff), so the worst that could happen would be a fall in the dollar, which wouldn't be a terrible thing and might actually help the economy.
Yet there is a whole industry built around the promotion of deficit panic. Lavishly funded corporate groups keep hyping the danger of government debt and the urgency of deficit reduction now now now -- except that these same groups are suddenly warning against too much deficit reduction. No wonder the public is confused.
Meanwhile, there is almost no organized pressure to deal with the terrible thing that is actually happening right now -- namely, mass unemployment. Yes, we've made progress over the past year. But long-term unemployment remains at levels not seen since the Great Depression: as of October, 4.9 million Americans had been unemployed for more than six months, and 3.6 million had been out of work for more than a year.
When you see numbers like those, bear in mind that we're looking at millions of human tragedies: at individuals and families whose lives are falling apart because they can't find work, at savings consumed, homes lost and dreams destroyed. And the longer this goes on, the bigger the tragedy.
There are also huge dollars-and-cents costs to our unmet jobs crisis. When willing workers endure forced idleness society as a whole suffers from the waste of their efforts and talents. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that what we are actually producing falls short of what we could and should be producing by around 6 percent of G.D.P., or $900 billion a year.
Worse yet, there are good reasons to believe that high unemployment is undermining our future growth as well, as the long-term unemployed come to be considered unemployable, as investment falters in the face of inadequate sales.
So what can be done? The panic over the fiscal cliff has been revelatory. It shows that even the deficit scolds are closet Keynesians. That is, they believe that right now spending cuts and tax hikes would destroy jobs; it's impossible to make that claim while denying that temporary spending increases and tax cuts would create jobs. Yes, our still-depressed economy needs more fiscal stimulus.
And, to his credit, President Obama did include a modest amount of stimulus in his initial budget offer; the White House, at least, hasn't completely forgotten about the unemployed. Unfortunately, almost nobody expects those stimulus plans to be included in whatever deal is eventually reached.
So why aren't we helping the unemployed? It's not because we can't afford it. Given those ultralow borrowing costs, plus the damage unemployment is doing to our economy and hence to the tax base, you can make a pretty good case that spending more to create jobs now would actually improve our long-run fiscal position.
Nor, I think, is it really ideology. Even Republicans, when opposing cuts in defense spending, immediately start talking about how such cuts would destroy jobs -- and I'm sorry, but weaponized Keynesianism, the assertion that government spending creates jobs, but only if it goes to the military, doesn't make sense.
No, in the end it's hard to avoid concluding that it's about class. Influential people in Washington aren't worried about losing their jobs; by and large they don't even know anyone who's unemployed. The plight of the unemployed simply doesn't loom large in their minds -- and, of course, the unemployed don't hire lobbyists or make big campaign contributions.
So the unemployment crisis goes on and on, even though we have both the knowledge and the means to solve it. It's a vast tragedy -- and it's also an outrage.

HEADLINE: Investors Trade Lightly Ahead of Jobs Report

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks rose on Thursday, a day ahead of the monthly jobs report, as a rebound in shares of Apple helped technology shares.
Traders were reluctant to bet heavily before the release on Friday of the Labor Department's employment report for November, and trading volume was lighter than normal. 
Investors are also keeping watch on the negotiations in Washington to see if lawmakers can reach a deal to avoid a series of spending cuts and tax increases beginning in January.
''The only stabilizing factor is that Apple is higher again, which is lending some support to the broader market,'' Donald Selkin, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York, said.
Apple climbed 1.6 percent to $547.24. The stock was coming off its biggest one-day drop in four years on Wednesday, which occurred on concerns about higher capital gains taxes in 2013 and the company's tablet computer market share.
The S.& P. technology index was the best performing of the S.& P. 500's 10 major sectors, gaining 0.8 percent.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 39.55 points, or 0.3 percent, to 13,074.04 at the close. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 4.66 points, or 0.33 percent, to 1,413.94. The Nasdaq composite index gained 15.57 points, or 0.52 percent, to close at 2,989.27.
Monthly payroll numbers, which will be released by the Labor Department before the market opens on Friday, are expected to show a sharp slowdown in jobs growth, though that is largely a result of Hurricane Sandy. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 7.9 percent.
Broader moves were limited, however, as traders focused on the fiscal debate in Washington. About three weeks remain before higher tax rates are to go into effect, an event that economists worry will curb economic growth. Legislators are trying to come up with a deal to avoid some of the negative effects on the economy while still reducing the budget deficit.
An S.& P. index of consumer discretionary shares gained 0.6 percent, lifted by Starbucks shares' advance of 5.7 percent to $53.70 after Baird upgraded the stock to outperform.
H&R Block climbed 5.1 percent to $18.26 after the company reported a quarterly loss that was narrower than expected.
Sirius XM Radio shares rose 0.7 percent to $2.79 after the company's board approved a $2 billion stock repurchase and declared a special dividend that gave a big payout to its largest shareholder, Liberty Media.
Shares of the navigation device maker Garmin jumped 5.7 percent to $41.99 after Standard & Poor's said it would add the company to the S.& P. 500. Garmin will replace R. R. Donnelley & Sons after the close of trading on Tuesday.
Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's 10-year note rose 2/32, to 100 12/32, and the yield was unchanged at 1.59 percent.

HEADLINE: Bills Placing Limits on Unions Advance in Michigan Legislature

BYLINE: By STEVEN YACCINO and MONICA DAVEY; Steven Yaccino reported from Lansing, Mich., and Monica Davey from Chicago. Steven Greenhouse contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
LANSING, Mich. -- As labor supporters crowded into the Capitol chanting their dismay, this state's Republican leaders announced on Thursday their intent to swiftly pass limits on unions in Michigan, a state with deep ties to organized labor.
''This is all about taking care of the hard-working workers of Michigan, about being pro-worker, about giving them the freedom to choose who they associate with,'' said Gov. Rick Snyder, explaining why he would support such a measure -- a shift in his position. 
Earlier in his term, he urged fellow Republicans not to bring the matter to his desk, saying it would stir too much dissension and was not on his agenda.
By Thursday evening, the House, controlled by Republicans, had approved part of a package of legislation that would ultimately bar workers from being required to pay union fees as a condition of employment. Two similar but separate bills passed the Senate, also held by Republicans.
If the entire package of legislation goes through, which could happen as early as next week, Michigan, the birthplace of the United Automobile Workers, would become the 24th state in the nation to pass such a ban, a designation that was once largely focused far from the Midwestern rust belt.
''To do this now is very poor timing,'' said James Settles Jr., a vice president for the U.A.W. ''Labor and management have been cooperating closely in the automobile industry and have really helped the industry recover,'' he said, adding at another point: ''Michigan is on the rebound, and right-to-work is going to be very divisive. This will add to the divisiveness in the state.''
Coming somewhat abruptly in the waning days of a final legislative session before new lawmakers arrive in January, the push here -- strongly opposed by labor leaders and Democrats, who say it is aimed at weakening unions -- arrives at a volatile time for labor issues in Michigan.
Last month, voters soundly rejected an amendment brought by labor leaders that would have enshrined collective bargaining rights in the State Constitution.
That proposal had irked Republicans who had long said a ban on required union fees would help the state lure new businesses, and the election outcome seemed to embolden the Republicans to come back with a push.
The effort in Michigan is only the latest in what has become a wave of renewed interest in such legislation over the last two years, particularly as states searched for ways to emerge from the economic downturn and attract new business.
Many supporters of the bill here cited neighboring Indiana, which this year became the first state in the Midwestern manufacturing belt to enact a ban and the first place anywhere to do so in a decade, as another reason to move forward now.
The Michigan legislation would affect workers in both private companies and public entities, although police officers and firefighters are excluded. About 17.5 percent of workers in Michigan are members of unions, state authorities said.
Around the Capitol, Republican lawmakers lauded the decision to push ahead, arguing that the move had been debated over many years here. Other states -- Missouri, perhaps, or Maine -- ought not be allowed to beat them in enacting such legislation, they said, thereby winning away potential businesses. ''This is not about Republicans versus Democrats,'' said Jase Bolger, a Republican and the House speaker. ''This is not about management versus labor. This does not change collective bargaining. This is not anti-union.''
But hundreds of union members vehemently disagreed, pouring into the Capitol rotunda, chanting and blowing whistles in opposition in the echoing halls. ''Union busting, it's disgusting!'' a group yelled.
''There wasn't a middle class in the history of the United States before the unions,'' said Gerald Florkowski, a retired assembly line worker from General Motors who drove from his home near Flint when he heard about the legislative push. ''It was just the rich and the poor,'' he said. ''Now we're going back to the rich and the poor.''
At points on Thursday, as news of the effort to pass a ban spread, tensions flared. Eight protesters were arrested, state police officials said, after several people rushed at troopers who were guarding the Senate chambers. At least one trooper used a substance similar to pepper spray in the crowd.
For a period in the afternoon, the police stopped allowing people to enter the Capitol, citing the potential for a safety risk, leaving another group of protesters outside.
Some Democrats objected to the closing and complained that Republicans were trying to rush the measures through -- in part, by changing the language in existing bills to avoid a process that might normally take weeks. Recognizing they had no chance of defeating the legislation, they tried to use procedural maneuvers -- offering amendments and calling for long readings of bills -- to slow the voting process.
''You have a better chance of jumping into the Lansing River and finding Nemo than you have of this bill doing anything to increase wages,'' State Senator Coleman A. Young II, a Democrat, told fellow senators from the chamber floor. ''It's fake. It's a joke.''
Political analysts in Michigan said there might be a practical reason for the sudden rush. While Republicans will continue to control both legislative chambers, their control of the House will shrink to an eight-vote majority in January when newly elected legislators take office, compared with an 18-vote majority now.
Late Thursday, members of the House approved part of the package on a vote of 58 to 52. No Democrats voted for the measure, but several Republicans opposed it.
Governor Snyder, who had long sidestepped the issue, saying the state had more important problems to tackle, said in an interview that he would not himself have chosen to bring up the issue even now.
''We've come to the point over the last few weeks and the last month or two where that issue was on the table whether I wanted it to be there or not,'' he said. ''And given that it is on the table, I think it is appropriate to be a good leader and to stand up and take a position on this issue.''

HEADLINE: Soaring Rents Drive a Boom In Apartments

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN and NELSON D. SCHWARTZ; Daniel Cadis contributed reporting from Houston.

 BODY:
Houston is better known for urban sprawl than dense apartment living. But as part of a national rush to capitalize on rising rents, developers there are building thousands of apartments like those south of downtown at Camden City Centre, where 268 units will open early next year in a complex that also has two swimming pools, billiards tables, a coffee bar and a fitness center.
As residential building recovers from a near standstill after the housing crisis, much of the momentum is coming not from subdivisions with green lawns and two-car garages but from rental apartments. Multifamily construction nationwide is two-thirds of the way back to its prerecession peak, while single-family home construction is still only about a third of the way back to its peak, said David Crowe, the chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders.
The multifamily construction recovery, fueled by young people who are striking out on their own, is strongest in the South and West, particularly in markets where job growth is picking up. Last month, the Commerce Department released data on new construction that showed new apartment complexes were going up at the fastest rate since July 2008. 
That has led to a fear of overbuilding. While rents are still rising, analysts say the steep increases between 2011 and 2012 are unlikely to be repeated as a surge of units are completed in the latter part of this year and will continue to come on the market early next year. Nationally, residential rents rose 4.2 percent in 2011, but only 3.6 percent so far this year, according to Axiometrics, a Dallas-based apartment market research firm.
Much depends on the fortunes of the job market, which industry analysts said would determine whether higher rents were sustainable.
''The real test is going to be what happens between now and April or May as we see all these new units introduced to the market,'' said Jay Denton, the vice president for research at Axiometrics.
Still, vacancies remain extremely low and the pace of building in recent years has not been quick enough to replace obsolete, decrepit or demolished units, said Mr. Crowe of the homebuilders group. He projected that it would be several years before supply was back to normal.
In Houston, from January to September, construction permits for multifamily housing increased by more than 70 percent over the same period a year earlier, according to data compiled by the homebuilders group. Permits for single-family homes, by contrast, increased by 25 percent. Shares of Camden Property, the real estate investment trust that is building Camden City Centre, were up about 20 percent over a year ago.
''The demand for building is all over the country, really,'' said Ric Campo, Camden's chairman and chief executive. ''We're seeing higher rents, faster lease-ups, lower construction costs -- everything you want to see. Part of it is there's just a pent-up demand for new product because we didn't build anything during the downturn.''
In Houston, where low housing prices have traditionally kept the cost of living down, Camden can rent a one-bedroom apartment for $1,450.
Houston is far from the only market where demand for rentals is at a fever pitch. Denver, Oakland, Seattle, Miami and Charlotte, N.C., where many of the condo projects that went bust have been converted to rentals, also appear at the top of lists by data collectors like Trulia, Zillow and Axiometrics.
The bulk of the apartments are not going to families who lost their homes to foreclosure, many of whom are renting single-family houses. Instead, the apartments are being rented by young people who had moved in with their parents during the recession, or simply had not yet moved out.
People in their early 30s, the age when many might look to buy a first home, are renting for longer periods of time, partly because mortgages are difficult to come by and partly because they have been unnerved by the turmoil in the housing market.
''That portion of the population is starting to grow again, but I think a lot of them, seeing what has happened, are not particularly enthralled with the idea of going out and buying a house,'' said Steve Blitz, the chief economist at ITG Investment Research.
Michael Hoffman, a 26-year-old electrical engineer, said he moved into a two-bedroom apartment in Camden City Centre a few months ago after living with his parents to save money.
''It was easier,'' he said of the rent-free arrangement with his parents. ''But I felt like I was missing out on my 20s.''
New household creation, for example when people move out on their own, slowed to a virtual halt during the recession, but it has begun to grow once more. Even so, there are still roughly the same number of homeowners as there were in 2004, Mr. Crowe said.
''All of the net addition to households since 2004 has been in rentals,'' he said.
There are still some two million doubled-up households waiting for the opportunity to split into two.
To cater to those younger customers, Camden and other apartment builders are developing smaller apartments in buildings with more lavish social spaces, Mr. Campo said.
Where once 60 percent of the units in a given complex had two bedrooms, now 80 percent have one bedroom, and some units are as small as 500 square feet, he said. Cities like New York and San Francisco are going even smaller, experimenting with microapartments between 200 and 300 square feet in an attempt to meet demand and curb rents.
Singles represent a large slice of new demand, said Doug Bibby, president of the National Multi Housing Council, which represents owners and developers. ''They don't want a single-family home with a picket fence in the suburbs,'' he said.
In fact, Mr. Bibby said, married couples with children make up under one in four households today, and will be under one in five households by 2020. Experts estimate that rental growth will continue to drive construction for at least a couple of years, though those increases will be tamed a bit as more supply becomes available.
Andy McCulloch, the head of residential research at Green Street Advisors, a real estate analysis firm, said it was a misconception that growing momentum in the single-family housing market would hurt the rental market.
''If the single-family market gets better it could help jobs, it could help incomes and you could see rent continue to rise,'' he said. Constraints on lending, Mr. McCulloch said, will also keep a lid on the number of new homeowners.
''If I was an apartment landlord, the only thing that would really freak me out from the buying side is the return of easy credit,'' he said. ''But that doesn't seem to be coming back anytime soon.''

HEADLINE: Obama's Tax Plan Still Spares Large Portion of Nation's Affluent

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL and BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
President Obama's insistence that marginal tax rates rise for families making more than $250,000 has convinced millions of affluent Americans that they are likely to be writing larger checks to the government next year.
But many of those families have no reason to fret.
A close look at the president's plan shows that a large majority of families making up to $300,000 -- as well as hundreds of thousands of families with even larger incomes -- would not pay taxes at a higher marginal rate.
Because the complexity of the tax code makes it difficult to draw clean lines, they are the beneficiaries of choices the administration has made to ensure that families earning less than $250,000 do not pay higher rates.
Some of those affluent households would pay higher taxes next year under other parts of the president's tax plan and increases imposed by the Affordable Care Act, but not under the centerpiece, the part most frequently promoted by the president and most bitterly opposed by Congressional Republicans. 
John Boudreau, the president of a Connecticut construction firm who expects to make about $300,000 this year, said that was a welcome surprise. He voted for Mr. Obama and said he was ready to pay taxes at a higher rate. But he would rather not.
''I'm willing to, but if it works that I'm not, so be it,'' he said. ''I will not be a person that's going to stick an extra check in my tax bill as my donation to my country.''
Unless the White House and Congress are able to reach an agreement, federal taxes are scheduled to rise sharply next year for a large majority of Americans. Tax cuts first passed in 2001 and 2003 under President George W. Bush are scheduled to expire. So are cuts passed during Mr. Obama's first term.
The president's plan would prevent most of the scheduled increase for those below an income threshold Mr. Obama generally describes as $250,000. The Senate has passed similar legislation.
But Democrats remain at loggerheads with House Republicans, who want to prevent scheduled increases for the most affluent households, too. And the parties disagree about how to prune federal spending.
The number that now divides the parties was introduced by Mr. Obama in 2007, in the early days of the presidential campaign, when he promised to extend the Bush tax cuts for families that made less than that amount. ''I can make a firm pledge,'' Mr. Obama said in September 2008. ''Under my plan, no family making less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase. Not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes.''
When policy makers talk about income, however, they do not mean the amount of money a family earns; they mean the portion subject to taxes. For those who itemize their tax deductions, the government does not tax interest payments on mortgages or charitable donations, among other things, up to certain limits. As a result, two families with the same incomes will most likely have different taxable incomes.
To guarantee that tax rates do not increase for any family making less than $250,000, the Obama administration proposed in 2009 to raise marginal rates on taxable income above roughly $230,000 -- because the minimum amount of income a family is entitled to shelter from taxation is roughly $20,000.
But the average amount families in that income range are entitled to shelter from taxation is much larger, closer to $60,000. In other words, families with taxable income of $230,000 on average earned about $290,000 in 2009.
''They wanted to be able to say that 'Absolutely nobody making less than $250,000 could possibly pay higher taxes under our plan,' '' said Robert S. McIntyre, the director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal advocacy group. ''So they had to assume the most ridiculous assumptions, that even if you're a childless couple with no itemized deductions making $250,001, your taxes still won't go up. They figured that if this couple existed and their taxes went up, somebody would find them and jump on 'em.''
Furthermore, to remain consistent with the president's original promise, the administration has adjusted the original numbers for inflation. When Mr. Obama says $250,000, the White House says he means ''in 2009 dollars.'' It is now proposing to raise marginal rates on families with taxable incomes above $246,000 -- meaning, on average, families earning more than about $305,000.
While the president has said that he wants to raise tax rates for the top 2 percent, only about 1 percent of taxpayers will face higher marginal rates, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a widely respected research group.
The restoration of the other provisions temporarily suspended by the Bush tax cuts, including limits on deductions and higher taxes on investment income, still would raise taxes for only about 32 percent of families with income from $250,000 to $300,000, according to an analysis by Citizens for Tax Justice. About 77 percent of families with income of $300,000 to $350,000 would face an increase.
Neera Tanden, domestic policy director for Mr. Obama's 2008 general election campaign, said the president might not have succeeded in rallying popular support for any tax increase if he had not made the $250,000 promise.
But Ms. Tanden, now president of the left-leaning Center for American Progress, said the administration should reconsider that commitment.
She co-authored a deficit-reduction plan released earlier this week recommending modest tax increases on households making as little as $100,000.
''We think it's reasonable to ask a couple more dollars from people who make $150,000,'' she said.
Some of the beneficiaries see good reasons their taxes should not rise.
''I wouldn't exactly say I'm disappointed,'' said Ryan Ruby, 36, of Bothell, Wash., after learning that the president's tax plan probably would not affect him even though he and his wife make $250,000 to $300,000 a year. ''I do think our tax rates should go up eventually, but right now I think the need for people to have disposable income to get the economy moving is probably more important than broadening the base.''
Most affluent households still will pay higher taxes next year for other reasons.
A two-year-old payroll tax break is scheduled to lapse at the end of this year. That would increase Social Security taxes by 2 percentage points on wage income below $113,700.
And the Affordable Care Act levies new taxes specifically targeting married couples earning more than $250,000 and singles earning more than $200,000 in adjusted gross income.

GRAPHIC: CHART: No Tax Increase for Many 'Wealthy' Families: President Obama says he wants married couples to pay higher taxes on income above $250,000. But his plan actually excludes most joint filers making less than $300,000 -- and many who make more -- because of political considerations and the difficulties of drawing clear lines through the complexities of the tax code.

Previews and Openings
'Bare' (in previews; opens on Sunday) This rock musical about sexual confusion and Shakespeare in a coed Catholic boarding school has been kicking around since the Clinton administration. There was an Off Broadway run in 2004, and there have been more than 100 other productions worldwide. The subsequent success of ''Spring Awakening'' and other like-minded shows may have paved the way for this retooled version, which is directed by Stafford Arima (''Carrie'') and choreographed by Travis Wall of ''So You Think You Can Dance.'' New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, baremusicalnyc.com. (Eric Grode) 
'Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas! The Musical' (opens on Thursday) Just like the indomitable Christmas spirit displayed by the Whos of Whoville, even minus their gifts and roast beast, this musical returns for another holiday appearance. Its former Broadway home is now playing host to another green baddie (the Green Goblin, in ''Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark''), so the 2006 musical has instead moved to Madison Square Garden. Jeff McCarthy, who also voiced yet another tuneful green cartoon critter (the dapper Michigan J. Frog), steps into the title role. Theater at Madison Square Garden, (866) 858-0008, thegarden.com. (Grode)
'Faust: A Love Story' (opens on Wednesday) Just a few weeks ago, the Brooklyn Academy of Music presented ''Donka,'' a global troupe's circus-inflected tribute to Chekhov. Now it's time for an Icelandic troupe's circus-inflected tribute to Goethe, this one set in a nursing home. Vesturport Theater was last seen around these parts in a ''Metamorphosis'' adaptation that had its central character climbing the walls; here it promises ''a vast net stretched over the audience.'' Harvey Theater, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org. (Grode)
'Glengarry Glen Ross' (in previews; opens on Saturday) The schlubby real estate salesmen in David Mamet's masterful 1984 drama depend on a sucker being born at least every minute. With only seven years having elapsed since the last revival, let's hope new audience members are sprouting up at a comparable rate. Al Pacino, who was so memorable as the agency hotshot in the 1992 film version, graduates to the role of the old lion Shelley Levene. The newest young lion: Bobby Cannavale. Daniel Sullivan, who directed Mr. Pacino in ''The Merchant of Venice,'' takes on that task again. Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Grode)
'The Great God Pan' (in previews; opens on Dec. 18) A young Brooklyn writer seems to have it all -- until the possibility of a dark childhood secret threatens to upend everything. It sounds like fairly well-traveled ground, but the fast-rising playwright Amy Herzog (''After the Revolution,'' ''4000 Miles''), along with a cast that includes Becky Ann Baker and Peter Friedman, should carve out some new vistas along the way. Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Grode)
'It's a Wonderful Life' (in previews; opens on Monday) If you think adapting a beloved film for the stage is tricky, try the radio. Here Irish Rep essentially tries both at once, retelling the 1946 Frank Capra classic in the context of a radio drama, complete with onstage sound effects. A cast of six will give voice to George Bailey, Clarence Odbody, the villainous Henry Potter and almost two dozen other characters. Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Grode)
'The Other Place' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Jan. 10) Sharr White's twisty drama earned Laurie Metcalf an Obie Award in 2011; now it and she are making a somewhat delayed transfer to Broadway, with two new actors (including Daniel Stern) joining them. Ms. Metcalf plays a renowned neurologist whose research may be hitting too close to home -- and that's about all that's safe to divulge about the plot. Joe Mantello directs, as he did in 2011. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, Manhattan, (800) 432-7250, mtc-nyc.org. (Grode)
'P.S. Jones and the Frozen City' (in previews; opens on Monday) Robert Askins's filthy sock-puppet comedy ''Hand to God'' was a surprise hit last year, and his follow-up play sounds similarly odd. P.S. Jones is the protagonist in this comic-book-style adventure story, and the utopian Frozen City is where his dimwitted brother is about to be deified. Soon the fate of three worlds rests in his hands, as fates tend to do in superhero quest narratives. New Ohio Theater, 154 Christopher Street, West Village, (800) 838-3006, terranovacollective.org. (Grode)
'Restoration Comedy' (in previews; opens on Monday) Last winter Ed Sylvanus Iskandar generated headlines at the Flea for directing all seven of Sophocles's extant plays in ''These Seven Sicknesses.'' Now Mr. Iskandar and the Bats, the Flea's always-game acting company, move forward two millenniums to take on Amy Freed's mash-up of two competing Restoration comedies, ''Love's Last Shift'' (apparently a big hit in 1696) and ''The Relapse.'' As with ''Sicknesses,'' the period-specific entertainment extends well beyond the playing time; expect burlesque at intermission, a Baroque musicale beforehand and cocktails more or less whenever. Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, theflea.org. (Grode)
'Thirteen Things About Ed Carpolotti' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) Jeffrey Hatcher's ''Three Viewings'' clearly has a fan in Barry Kleinbort, who has taken one of that play's three extended monologues and turned it into a full-fledged musical. Penny Fuller reprises her ''Three Viewings'' role of a newly widowed woman who learns plenty about her dead husband, little of it good. In addition to writing the book, music and lyrics, the industrious Mr. Kleinbort also directs. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Grode)
'Volpone' (in previews; opens on Sunday) Red Bull Theater doesn't mount that many full productions, but when it does, they tend to be memorably visceral takes on the classics. But it gravitates toward the grislier pockets of the canon, which makes this revival of Ben Jonson's 1606 comedy all the more surprising. Count on the likes of Stephen Spinella, Tovah Feldshuh and Alvin Epstein to provide the Jacobean giggles. Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 352-3101, redbulltheater.com. (Grode)
'Water by the Spoonful' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Jan. 8) It's not often that plays win the Pulitzer Prize before their New York debut, so Quiara Alegría Hudes's 2012 winner is eagerly anticipated. The second play in her Elliot Trilogy, following her 2007 work, ''Elliot, a Soldier's Fugue,'' follows the life of a young Puerto Rican veteran of the Iraq war and the two overlapping worlds -- one online, one real -- that keep him physically and psychologically afloat. Two ''Elliot'' veterans -- the actor Armando Riesco and the director Davis McCallum -- are on board for this one, too. Second Stage Theater, 305 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422, 2st.com. (Grode)
'What Rhymes With America' (in previews; opens on Wednesday) Through a series of beguilingly off-kilter plays with short titles (''This,'' ''Suitcase,'' ''[sic]''), Melissa James Gibson has emerged over the last decade as one of Off Broadway's freshest voices. She teams up once again with the director Daniel Aukin for this latest piece, about a father and daughter separated by a closed door. The four-member cast includes the recent Tony Award nominee Da'Vine Joy Randolph (''Ghost''). Linda Gross Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 279-4200, atlantictheater.org. (Grode)
'Working' (in previews; opens on Wednesday) This musical version of Studs Terkel's much-admired oral history of ordinary Americans has always been a collective effort; the 1978 Broadway premiere featured music and lyrics by everyone from Stephen Schwartz and Micki Grant to James Taylor. Since then it has added a pair of songs by the ''In the Heights'' Tony-winner Lin-Manuel Miranda, and that version is making its New York debut. Six actors, among them Donna Lynne Champlin and Jay Armstrong Johnson, perform no fewer than 36 characters. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Grode)
Broadway
'The Anarchist' They sure talk fancy in the clink these days. David Mamet's heavily embroidered slip of a play portrays a notorious convict (an excellent Patti LuPone) up for parole and at the mercy of a judgmental warden (a rote Debra Winger). During a polysyllabic 70 minutes, they discuss eschatology, phenomenology, etymology and, oh yes, criminology (1:10). John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, theanarchistbroadway.com. (Ben Brantley)
'Annie' James Lapine's revival of the singing comic strip from 1977 is merely serviceable. But its smiley-faced mixture of hope and corn scratches an itch in a city recovering from a recession and a hurricane. Theatergoers may feel the urge both to mist up and throw up, but Lilla Crawford is a nigh irresistible Orphan Annie. With Katie Finneran and Anthony Warlow (2:25). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'Bring It On: The Musical' An A-list of musical-theater artists -- Tom Kitt (''Next to Normal''), Lin-Manuel Miranda (''In the Heights''), Jeff Whitty (''Avenue Q'') and Amanda Green -- teamed to create this featherweight concoction inspired by the cult-fave movie about rival cheerleaders. The human pyrotechnics in the cheerleading sequences are the highlight (2:15). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Charles Isherwood)
'Chaplin: The Musical' Though Rob McClure does a graceful impersonation of the title character of this soppy bio-musical, the off-screen Charlie Chaplin is often missing in action, devoured by a swarm of man-eating clichés. This gray-toned sour-smell-of-success story, featuring vaporous songs by Christopher Curtis and directed by Warren Carlyle, takes those clichés very seriously (2:30). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'A Christmas Story, The Musical' An amiable, blessedly ungarish holiday musical for family audiences, faithfully adapted from the popular 1983 movie drawing on the writings of Jean Shepherd (2:20). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (877) 250-2929, achristmasstorythemusical.com. (Isherwood)
'Dead Accounts' As a prodigal son returned to Cincinnati from New York City, Norbert Leo Butz conjures fireworks out of very thin air in Theresa Rebeck's new comedy, directed by Jack O'Brien and featuring Katie Holmes. The play throws out many weighty subjects, but they all blur into a jet stream of semi-snappy dialogue before changing course and evaporating (2:00). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Elf' This stage musical based on the Will Ferrell movie returns to Broadway with Wayne Knight as the celebrity Santa, though he isn't around much. The production, like all the holiday-themed shows clogging New York theaters, has some funny moments, a couple of decent musical numbers and a lot of generic-feeling songs and synthetic sentiment. Jordan Gelber in the role of Buddy, the human raised as an elf who comes to New York to find his real father, never really finds a comfort zone for the sometimes awkward, sometimes perceptive character (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, elfmusical.com. (Neil Genzlinger)
'Evita' This just in: Eva Perón is still dead. That, anyway, is on the evidence of Michael Grandage's unsmiling revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's 1978 bio-musical, which feels about as warm-blooded as a gilded mummy. Elena Roger, Michael Cerveris and Ricky Martin are the stars of this earnest combination of requiem mass and history pageant (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, Manhattan, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'Grace' Craig Wright's cool, strangulated essay of a play about forms of faith isn't as intellectually unsettling as it means to be. But the cast (which includes Paul Rudd, Ed Asner and Kate Arrington) is very good under Dexter Bullard's direction. And Michael Shannon confirms his status as our most convincing interpreter of uneasy American manhood (1:40). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'The Heiress' Masterpiece Theater on Broadway. Moisés Kaufman's revival of Ruth and Augustus Goetz's sturdy war horse, starring a one-note Jessica Chastain, is lovely to look at, easy to follow -- and aside from a vivid supporting performance from Judith Ivey -- about as full of real life as an Olde New York Christmas window in a department store (2:45). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'The Mystery of Edwin Drood' A boisterous, well-cast revival of Rupert Holmes's Tony-winning 1986 musical, which gives the audience the chance to choose the identity of the killer of the titular hero. Chita Rivera lends an air of authentic glamour, Jim Norton is a cutup as the music-hall proprietor, and the young cast sings the lovely score with great skill (2:35). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'Newsies' This Disney musical -- adapted from the 1992 movie and inspired by the newsboy strike of 1899 -- markets Urchin Appeal with extra! extra! enthusiasm. Jeff Calhoun directs a cast of comely, if overgrown, ragamuffins. The largely interchangeable songs are by Alan Menken and Jack Feldman (2:20). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (866) 870-2717, newsiesthemusical.com. (Brantley)
'Nice Work if You Can Get It' Every now and then a bubble of pure, tickling charm rises from the artificial froth of this pastiche 1920s musical, directed by Kathleen Marshall and featuring songs by George and Ira Gershwin. But mostly the production, starring Matthew Broderick and Kelli O'Hara, registers as a shiny, dutiful trickle of gags and production numbers (2:30). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Once' This gentle musical, set in Dublin, about a love affair that never quite happens -- based on the 2006 movie -- inventively uses songs (by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova) and dance to convey a beautiful shimmer of might-have-been regret. Staged by John Tiffany and Steven Hoggett (''Black Watch''), the production stars the immensely appealing Steve Kazee and Cristin Milioti (2:15). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Peter and the Starcatcher' The most exhilarating and inventive example of story theater since the Royal Shakespeare Company's ''Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby.'' This production, about the boy who became Peter Pan, is an enchanted anatomy of the urge to defy gravity. Roger Rees and Alex Timbers direct (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' Pam MacKinnon's shattering 50th-anniversary revival of Edward Albee's hair-raising drama of marital discord stars an electrifying Tracy Letts (of ''August: Osage County'' fame) as George and Amy Morton (ditto) as Martha, ably supported by Carrie Coon and Madison Dirks as the young couple they use as cannon fodder. Not to be missed (3:05). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)

'Bad Jews' The wonderful Tracee Chimo (''Circle Mirror Tranformation,'' ''Bachelorette'') gives a sensational performance in Joshua Harmon's play, portraying a smart, funny and seriously abrasive young woman who is embroiled in a dispute with her cousin over who is entitled to a family heirloom (1:40). Black Box Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212) 719-1300, roundaboutunderground.org. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'The Boss' Regan, an Irish immigrant who builds himself into a ruthless shipping magnate, extorts a socialite into marrying him. In retaliation, his bride's brother whips Regan's workers into a strike. Regan cannot empathize with the countrymen he employs, impoverishes and once lived among, and he vows revenge. Dave Hanson's spectacular performance as the anti-hero parvenu gives this class-conscious revival from 1911 emotional and political relevance, particularly in the era of the 99 percenters (2:30). Metropolitan Playhouse, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 995-5302, metropolitanplayhouse.org. (Catherine Rampell)
'Chris March's Butt-Cracker Suite' The designer Chris March expanded his fan base as a popular ''Project Runway'' contestant and in his eccentric spinoff series, ''Mad Fashion,'' on Bravo. The most devoted of those fans may be willing to indulge him as the creator, director, designer, producer and tutu-clad star of this ''trailer park ballet,'' a campy alternative for those weary of the annual pilgrimage to see Tchaikovsky's ''Nutcracker.'' But while it looks to John Waters, Pee-wee Herman and Honey Boo Boo for inspiration, this low-rent pop-culture hash, choreographed by Ben Franklin, is far too tame to succeed as the trashtastic fun it aspires to be (1:20). Here, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 352-3101, here.org. (David Rooney)
&#x2605; 'A Civil War Christmas' Paula Vogel's play is a beautifully stitched tapestry of American lives set during the chilly winter of 1964. Characters include Abraham Lincoln (a dignified Bob Stillman) and his troubled wife, Mary Todd Lincoln (an affecting Alice Ripley) but also Mary Todd's dressmaker, a slave who purchased her freedom named Elizabeth Keckley (the fine Karen Kandel) along with soldiers on both sides of the conflict. It's a rare holiday entertainment that won't nauseate the adults, and should edify the children without boring them (2:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200, nytw.org, ticketcentral.com. (Isherwood)
'Cougar the Musical' Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of ''Menopause: The Musical'' and its ilk (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)
&#x2605; 'Disgraced' A stimulating, eloquent and bitingly funny new play by Ayad Akhtar about a corporate lawyer of Muslim origins (the excellent Aasif Mandvi of ''The Daily Show'') whose well-heeled life begins to unravel when he becomes involved in a court case involving an unjustly jailed imam (1:20). Claire Tow Theater, Lincoln Center, 150 West 65th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com, lct3.org. (Isherwood)
'Emotional Creature' This collage of songs, monologues and spoken-word pieces by Eve Ensler explore the problems facing young women around the globe, from sex-slavery to the plague of mean girls. Performed with vivifying passion by a talented young cast of six (1:30). Pershing Square Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Isherwood)
'Falling' The Martin family, in Deanna Jent's compact play, is trying to live a normal life despite the outsize presence of their severely autistic son, Josh (effectively portrayed by Daniel Everidge). When a Bible-toting grandmother visits, the emotional temperature rises, and with it Josh's potential for violence. Despite some implausible stacking of the dramatic deck by the playwright, ''Falling'' makes some sound points and invites further investigation into the disorder (1:15). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (800) 982-2787, ticketmaster.com. (Andy Webster)
'5 Lesbians Eating a Quiche' This frolicsome play, about a women's club in 1956, ventures into such heady excesses of absurdism, it deserves to be called Mama-ist. (Dada wouldn't do at all.) As written by Evan Linder and Andrew Hobgood, with Sarah Gitenstein directing, ''Quiche'' takes a giant leap from punning smirkiness into the outer space of nonsense (1:15). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Van Dam Street, South Village, sohoplayhouse.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Forbidden Broadway: Alive and Kicking' Gerard Alessandrini's essential satirical cheat sheet to Broadway musicals returns after a three-year absence, packing polished brass knuckles. A precisionist cast of four provides vocal cartoons as evocative as Al Hirschfeld's caricatures. This show not only tickles but also pierces the Achilles' heels of the productions under scrutiny (1:40). At the 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Forever Dusty' If Kristen Holly Smith turned up to your costume party in Dusty Springfield drag and started singing, there would be no mistaking the woman she was channeling. But doing a passable impersonation is a far cry from capturing the essence of one of the most distinctive female vocalists of all time, as this amateurish inflated cabaret act demonstrates. Written in by-the-numbers basics by Ms. Smith and Jonathan Vankin, and directed with minimal finesse by Randal Myler, this misconceived bio-musical is a soulless tribute to the platinum-haired, panda-eyed queen of white soul. She deserves better (1:40). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, foreverdusty.net. (Rooney)
&#x2605; 'Fried Chicken and Latkes' Rain Pryor, the daughter of the comedian Richard Pryor (who died in 2005), stars in this effervescent solo show, which recounts her upbringing in a biracial household (her mother is Jewish) in Beverly Hills, Calif. Ms. Pryor, who sings and portrays a range of characters (including, poignantly, her father in a spot-on impression) is an ebullient performer with a robust singing voice. She lives in Baltimore now, but her outsize personality is built for Broadway (1:30). Actor's Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Webster)
'Giant' Michael John LaChiusa's lush score for this adaptation of Edna Ferber's generation-spanning 1952 novel reaches for the clouds. But the countervailing weight of condensing a multitude of themes and plot points keeps pulling this show down to earth, and even threatens to bury it. Michael Greif directs an attractive cast led by Brian D'Arcy James and Kate Baldwin (3:15). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Brantley)
'Golden Child' The first production in the Signature Theater's season devoted to the work of David Henry Hwang is a revival of his 1996 play about a family in early-20th-century China grappling with the encroaching ideals of the West. Julyana Soelistyo, who starred in the original production as the young woman whose bound feet become a bone of contention, is a standout as the sternest and most recalcitrant of the three wives in the family (2:00). Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'Golden Age' Terrence McNally's comedy-drama, set backstage on the first night of the opera composer Vincenzo Bellini's last opera (''I Puritani''), is sadly hackneyed and contrived. Lee Pace plays the composer, and Bebe Neuwirth the famed singer Maria Malibran (2:30). City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, manhattantheatreclub.com. (Isherwood)
'The Good Mother' Gretchen Mol (''Boardwalk Empire'') plays the title role of a troubled young woman with man problems in Francine Volpe's murky, sluggish drama, directed by Scott Elliott for the New Group (1:40).

'If There Is I Haven't Found It Yet' Jake Gyllenhaal makes a very creditable New York stage debut as the stoner uncle of a troubled 15-year-old girl (Annie Funke) in Nick Payne's earnest, shaggy (and conceptually overwrought) story of global warming and domestic meltdown. Michael Longhurst directs a cast rounded out by Brian F. O'Byrne and Michelle Gomez (1:35).

'Love in the Time of Cholera' Directed by José Zayas and performed by an efficient four-actor crew, Caridad Svich's adaptation of the Gabriel García Márquez novel is pleasing but lightweight.

&#x2605; 'Mies Julie' The temperature never stops rising in Yael Farber's blistering drama, which resets Strindberg's ''Miss Julie'' in contemporary South Africa. But be advised: This is a fire that chills as it destroys. Hilda Cronje and Bongile Mantsai give full-immersion performances as the doomed lovers whose very identities come under siege. Ms. Farber directs, compellingly and mercilessly (1:30). St. Ann's Warehouse, 29 Jay Street, at Plymouth Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779, stannswarehouse.org. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Murder Ballad' A small but savvy musical that panders in style to those of us who lap up febrile accounts of fatal attractions. Julia Jordan and Juliana Nash's contemporary tale of a razor-edged love triangle knows exactly what it wants to do, and does it most efficiently, with a sexy four-member cast, directed by Trip Cullman (1:15). City Center, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Brantley)
'My Name Is Asher Lev' Aaron Posner's adaptation of Chaim Potok's novel feels like a well-made play from the era in which the story takes place -- the 1950s. Set in a Hasidic community in Brooklyn, this tale of an artistic prodigy has been directed with an attention to emotional nuance by Gordon Edelstein and features strong performances from its three-person cast: Ari Brand, Mark Nelson and Jenny Bacon (1:30).

'The Outgoing Tide' The Philadelphia playwright Bruce Graham examines right-to-die issues as reflected in the tough choices made by a retired trucking company owner facing encroaching dementia. Starring Peter Strauss, Michael Learned and Ian Lithgow, the play maps the man's emotionally fraught standoff with his wife of 50 years and their adult son as he seeks to atone for his mistakes while sparing himself further indignity. Well received in its regional engagements, the play is sensitively observed and affecting if somewhat pedestrian in Bud Martin's production (2:10). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Rooney)
&#x2605; 'The Piano Lesson' August Wilson's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, set in Pittsburgh in 1936, returns in a galvanizingly beautiful staging by Ruben Santiago-Hudson, featuring memorable performances virtually across the board.

&#x2605; 'Tribes' Nina Raine's smart, lively and beautifully acted play asks us to hear how we hear, in silence as well as speech. This British import considers the passive and aggressive forms of listening within an insular, intellectual family, whose members include a deaf son. David Cromer is the expert director (2:15). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Brantley)
'The Twenty-Seventh Man' Nathan Englander's stage adaptation of his crisp, economical short story (from the collections ''For the Relief of Unbearable Urges'') feels sadly bloated and static onstage, despite fine work from a first-rate cast that includes Ron Rifkin and Chip Zien (1:30).

'Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike' Nomenclature would seem to be fate for the title characters of Christopher Durang's sunny comedy about gloomy people. David Hyde Pierce, Kristine Nielsen and Sigourney Weaver portray three siblings (if not three sisters) whose parents burdened them with Chekovian names. Nicholas Martin directs this surprisingly mild-mannered work from a savage satirist (2:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'We Are Proud to Present a Presentation About the Herero of Namibia, Formerly Known as Southwest Africa, From the German Sudwestafrika, Between the Years 1844-1915' A group of six actors engage in tense rehearsals for a play about the first genocide of the 20th century in Jackie Sibblies Drury's inventive, superbly acted drama about the disturbing emotions stirred by their seemingly playful interactions (1:30).

'Be Careful! The Sharks Will Eat You!' In his one-man show, Jay Alvarez recounts his family's escape from Cuba in 1964, when he was just 4. Acting at least a half-dozen roles, Mr. Alvarez is an evocative taleteller when reliving the yearlong plans his father made that delivered as many as 30 refugees by boat to the United States. Despite the title, though, and to the play's disadvantage, he describes almost nothing of the 30-hour voyage itself (1:30). Stage Left Studio, 214 West 30th Street, Manhattan, stageleftstudio.net.

'Radio City Christmas Spectacular' After last year's update, this annual extravaganza returns with a paucity of new material. But the Rockettes are forever splendid: regal in their precision, radiant in their costumes, exuberant in their high kicks. Yes, there's a cheesy narrative thread, but also a new and fascinating look at Rockettes fashions through the decades. (It's the troupe's 85th year.)

'Ivanov' (closes on Sunday) Boredom comes in many flavors in Chekhov's early study of provincial lives, and darned if Austin Pendleton's production doesn't provide a different acting style for each one. The lusty comic energy of the show's first half peters out in the second. Ethan Hawke strips the gears of suffering in the title role; Joely Richardson is superb as his neglected wife (3:00).

'Radiance' (closes on Saturday) Set in 1955 with a detour back to 10 years earlier, Cusi Cram's play centers on an Air Force veteran desperate to bail on his commitment to appear on an episode of ''This Is Your Life.'' Elaborating on a curious real-life collision between one of the most momentous events in 20th-century military history and a now-quaint relic of American television, Suzanne Agins's production for the Labyrinth Theater Company dulls the conflict with fussy retro-styled treatment. Both the writing and the staging appear to be aping 1940s and '50s movie conventions, but the actors seem uncomfortable with the artifice. Only David Meyer's detailed set, a dive bar off Hollywood Boulevard, looks like the real thing (1:20). Bank Street Theater, 155 Bank Street, West Village, (212) 513-1080, labtheater.org. (Rooney)
'Scandalous: The Life and Trials of Aimee Semple McPherson' (closes on Sunday) Kathie Lee Gifford (yes, her!) wrote the book and lyrics for this dull musical about the life of the pioneering evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson.

'A Summer Day' (closes on Saturday) In her first New York stage appearance in more than a decade, Karen Allen is perfectly cast as a woman frozen in time in Jon Fosse's quietly brutal play, which turns a romantic cliché into an existential life sentence.

HEADLINE: Transportation Officials Ask Congress for Billions in Storm Recovery Effort

BYLINE: By RAY RIVERA

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- It will cost more than $7 billion to repair the damage that Hurricane Sandy did to the New York area's antiquated transit systems and billions more to upgrade the systems to withstand major storms in the future, officials from the region told a United States Senate panel on Thursday.
The subway stations, tunnels and tracks managed by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the nation's largest public transportation system, sustained the worst of the destruction, with estimated damage of more than $5 billion, Joseph J. Lhota, the authority's chairman said. 
''This figure represents just what we need to get the system back to where it was the day before the storm,'' Mr. Lhota said. Stressing that the region is relying on transportation networks that in some cases are more than a century old, Mr. Lhota and other transportation officials from New York and New Jersey said that it would cost substantially more to upgrade the systems to make them better prepared for storms that could come more frequently, and with greater intensity, with climate change and rising sea levels. ''It's critical that we make the critical investments we need to protect our system from future storms,'' Mr. Lhota said.
Securing money beyond the cost of immediate repairs could be difficult at a time when Congress and the Obama administration are jockeying over tax increases and spending cuts, the so-called fiscal cliff.
New York and New Jersey lawmakers testifying before a Senate Transportation Committee panel urged Congress to invest in transit infrastructure in the region, which accounts for more than 10 percent of the nation's gross domestic product and depends on mass transit more than any other area of the country.
''It's the life blood of New York,'' Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat, told the panel.
Mr. Lhota did not provide an estimate of how much more would be needed to upgrade the systems, but other speakers did.
James Weinstein, executive director of New Jersey Transit, provided the most detailed account yet of damage sustained by that system. The agency, he said, sustained an estimated $400 million in damage and would need $800 million more to make the system more resilient to future storms.
The damage included more than $100 million in damaged rail equipment, including rolling stock, and an additional $300 million to fix and replace tracks, wires, signaling, electrical substations and other equipment, Mr. Weinstein said.
New Jersey Transit has come under intense criticism from riders and officials for parking more than 300 passenger cars and locomotives in rail yards in Hoboken and Kearny that ended up under water during the storm.
But the Senate panel largely spared Mr. Weinstein of having to defend the agency's actions on Thursday. Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, a New Jersey Democrat and panel member who called the hearing, briefly raised the issue, but then seemed content to accept Mr. Weinstein's defense that it was the best decision based on forecasts and flood histories of the two locations at the time.
''It doesn't sound like there were a lot of choices to be made,'' Mr. Lautenberg said.
Mr. Weinstein could face tougher questioning next week in front of a hearing before the transportation committee of the New Jersey Assembly.
Joseph Boardman, the president of Amtrak, said the regional carrier was requesting $336 million in emergency federal funding. Of that amount, $60 million would be used to cover estimated operating costs caused by the storm, which flooded four of Amtrak's seven tunnels leading in and out of New York's Pennsylvania Station and damaged a major electrical substation in Kearny.
The remaining $276 million would be used to make improvements to strengthen the system. It would also be used to begin design and construction of Amtrak's plan to add two new tunnels under the Hudson River between New York and New Jersey.
Patrick J. Foye, executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said the authority was still assessing the exact costs of the damage, and what insurance might cover.
''But clearly our needs are enormous,'' he said. ''We are facing hundreds of millions of dollars in immediate repair costs, and billions more in mitigation and resiliency measures.''
The authority sustained substantial damage in addition to its airports, shipping terminals and tunnels, Mr. Foye said. But the Port Authority Trans-Hudson transit system, which carries some 77 million people between New Jersey and Manhattan each year, was hit the worst.
The PATH's Hoboken Terminal, which serves about 29,000 people every weekday, remains closed, and officials have not given an estimate of when service will be fully restored.

HEADLINE: Twenty Years Later, Nafta Remains a Source of Tension

BYLINE: By JULIÁN AGUILAR. 
jaguilar@texastribune.org

 BODY:
SAN ANTONIO -- Nearly two decades after a pact initiated here created the world's largest free trade area, economists are calling the North American Free Trade Agreement a resounding success, crediting it for fueling unprecedented trade and creating millions of jobs in the United States.
The agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada, ratified 19 years ago Saturday, also made two of Texas' land ports among the country's busiest and delivered a multi-trillion-dollar cumulative gross domestic product for its member countries.
But unions and consumer-advocacy groups say Nafta has had negative effects in Mexico and the United States. They say that resulting outsourcing and lower wages have hurt the United States' domestic economy and that Mexico's rural industries have destabilized.
As economists look to build on Nafta's momentum to improve trade relations between member nations, critics say they should look to past failures to avoid similar mistakes in the future. 
Nafta, which was enacted in 1994, eliminated existing tariffs on more than half of the exports from Mexico to the United States and gradually phased out remaining tariffs between all member countries.
The pact has benefited all three members. In 2010, the United States had $918 billion in two-way trade with Canada and Mexico, according to the office of Ron Kirk, United States trade representative.
Economists say that progress has come despite enhanced global security measures following the Sept. 11 attacks and an eruption of drug-related violence in Mexico. During a recent symposium here, economists and policy makers celebrated Nafta's success and brainstormed ways to build on it and bolster economic output. The symposium concluded with a clear message: the future is wide open.
''We must continue to build upon Nafta and think more as a region in order to be more competitive globally,'' said Gerónimo Gutiérrez, the managing director of the North American Development Bank, which was created by the governments of Mexico and the United States after Nafta's inception and helps finance and develop infrastructure projects on the border.
But critics of Nafta say ithas resulted in a loss of United States manufacturing and shipping jobs and in less production oversight. They say Nafta has also displaced Mexican agricultural workers into other sectors or forced them to immigrate illegally to the United States.
''There have been huge disparities in the number of people entering the work force and the number of jobs available,'' said Timothy A. Wise, the policy research director at the Global Development and Environment Institute at Tufts University. ''That resulted in the huge migration problem despite the increased enforcement.''
Supporters say Nafta was not conceived to solve domestic problems for any member country. Instead, they say, the growth in the nations' G.D.P.'s speaks to the pact's positive effects. They include the creation of six million jobs in the United States tied to Nafta policies, more than $500 billion in goods and services traded between the United States and Mexico, and the ports of Laredo and El Paso being among the United States' busiest.
Through September, about $172.5 billion in trade with Mexico passed through the Laredo port and about $65 billion through El Paso, according to United States census data analyzed by WorldCity, which tracks global trade patterns. Canada remains the country's top partner, with $462.3 billion in trade during the same time frame, ahead of China, which is at $389.7 billion and Mexico, with $369.5 billion.
''I don't think that Nafta was created to alleviate every single social problem in Mexico. It could not, and it has not,'' Mr. Gutiérrez said. ''I think that Mexico would be worse off if it wasn't for Nafta today.''
Public Citizen, a nonprofit advocacy group with offices in Washington and Austin, cites United States Department of Labor data to support what it says is a negative impact on the American work force because of rising imports or offshoring production.
In Texas alone, Public Citizen said, there have been almost 2,500 companies whose workers or union affiliates have filed petitions with the department for training or temporary assistance under its Trade Adjustment Assistance program.
Mr. Wise said that although Nafta had made Mexico a manufacturing giant, the pact provided examples of what countries with emerging economies should avoid. Free trade policies, commonly referred to in Mexico as neoliberalism, should be scrutinized less for the tariffs they eliminate and more for their use as development strategies, he said.
''It was a striking and dramatic failure compared to other countries that did not follow such paths,'' he said. Mr. Wise acknowledged Mexico's increase in manufacturing jobs, but he said they were not at the level needed to account for losses in other industries, like grain production.
''Foreign investment quadrupled. Trade over all tripled. So that's a measure of success,'' he said. ''What it didn't produce is jobs and development.''
The end result is that Mexico's growth rates were lower than other emerging economies that were in similar stages of development, he said. A key reason is that while foreign investment surged, domestic investment in Mexico dipped.
''When everybody touts the benefits of foreign investment coming in, they discount the fact that domestic investment was displaced,'' Mr. Wise said. ''Investment in the economy was well below the levels that were needed to stimulate dynamic growth. In China they are investing 35 percent dynamic growth, and economists say you need 25 percent or more. Mexico is at 19 percent.''
Robert Pastor, the director at the Center for North American Studies at American University, said job losses and gains under Nafta could be attributed to a universal element in global commerce: competition.
''Nafta or globalization increases competition, which, by definition, has winners and losers,'' he said. ''The people who lose are those who are not very well educated. This is true, not just because of trade but because of automation and technological change and of a lot of structural change in the economy.''
Mr. Pastor said that despite dire predictions, the largest influx of growth in jobs in the United States occurred after the pact's installation. ''The period of greatest growth in trade among the Nafta countries coincided with the period of the largest growth in employment, of jobs in the United States, 23 or 24 million jobs,'' he said. ''Now, I wouldn't credit Nafta for those creation of jobs, but you certainly can't say the impact was a loss of jobs.''
Mr. Pastor said the focus for member nations should expand.
''I think we should shift our vision away from Nafta,'' he said, ''and accept that it's complete and focus on the future.''
He said the need was to figure out how to get to a seamless market that would eliminate remaining tariffs.

HEADLINE: What's On Today

BYLINE: By KATHRYN SHATTUCK

 BODY:
8:15 P.M. (Cinemax) WANDERLUST (2012) Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd, above, star as Linda and George, out-of-work Manhattanites unable to sell their ''microloft'' in the West Village. They stumble onto Elysium, an ''intentional community'' in rural Georgia, where good vibrations -- and not a little smoke -- fill the air, and the only blackberries grow on trees. Established decades earlier by Carvin (Alan Alda), now in a wheelchair and battling memory loss, and his hippie friends, the commune is home to a touchy-feely, guitar-strumming collage led by Seth (Justin Theroux), a creepy Lothario. The group includes another New York dropout (Malin Akerman) and a novelist and nudist (Joe Lo Truglio) who wears the occasional sanitary pouch (like a hairnet, but lower) when he's crushing grapes for homemade wine. 
''Part of what gives this movie unexpected resonance is that Linda and George have joined only somewhat voluntarily,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times about this ''mostly funny comedy'' from David Wain. ''Linda and George don't burn with the yearning to travel that the title suggests, yet like other Americans seeking simplicity and maybe a chicken coop out back, they want off the road, at least for a while. There's something touching about this desire, though Mr. Wain doesn't let Linda and George fly their freak flags for long.'' Instead, she said, ''the filmmakers prefer penis jokes and, with Mr. Lo Truglio and Mr. Rudd's help, they provide plenty. Ms. Aniston and the other women (including Michaela Watkins as a desperate housewife) try to keep up, but 'Bridesmaids' notwithstanding, the women's liberation movement in comedy has yet to arrive on the big screen.''
7:30 A.M. (TMC) LA DOLCE VITA (1961) In Federico Fellini's classic take on contemporary Rome, Marcello Mastroianni stars as a freewheeling newspaperman, and Anita Ekberg (right), Yvonne Furneaux, Anouk Aimée and Magali Noël as the women in his life. Writing in The Times, Bosley Crowther called the film ''a brilliantly graphic estimation of a whole swath of society in sad decay and, eventually, a withering commentary upon the tragedy of the overcivilized.'' It is, he added, ''an awesome picture, licentious in content but moral and vastly sophisticated in its attitude and what it says.''
12:30 P.M. (Sundance) THE SEA INSIDE (2004) Javier Bardem stars as Ramón Sampedro, a former ship's mechanic fighting for the right to die after living as a quadriplegic for nearly 30 years, in this drama directed by Alejandro Amenábar, which won an Oscar for best foreign-language film. Mr. Bardem ''creates a complicated male character, volatile and witty, with a poet's soul,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The Times. But, he added, citing another of Mr. Amenábar's films, ''In the end, suspenseful narrative devices that worked so effectively in a gothic fantasy like 'The Others' feel contrived when applied to what's supposed to be a true story of life, death and the living hell from which Ramón finally escapes.''
8 P.M. (CW) NIKITA The season ends as Nikita (Maggie Q) and Michael (Shane West) capture an arms dealer (Isaiah Mustafa) who is buying a weapon-jamming device and find themselves in a life-threatening trap.
8:30 P.M. (13) NEED TO KNOW Scott Simon anchors this episode, which examines how the Texas Legislature has slashed financing of reproductive planning programs because conservative lawmakers say they encourage abortions. Pam Belluck, a science reporter for The New York Times, explores these programs in other states. And in the ''American Voices'' segment, Judy Norsigian, one of the authors of ''Our Bodies, Ourselves,'' provides a historical account of women's health policy debates.
9 P.M. (HGTV) CELEBRITY HOLIDAY HOMES Cheryl Burke of ''Dancing With the Stars,'' the gospel singer BeBe Winans, and Dee Snider of Twisted Sister have their dwellings decorated for the holidays by Emily Henderson, Danielle Colding and Meg Caswell, former winners of HGTV Design Star.
9 P.M. (CBS) CSI: NY The team sleuths around a 1920s-style speakeasy after one of its owners is murdered and $10,000 goes missing in this season finale.
11 P.M. (HBO Signature) THE FULL MONTY (1997) Robert Carlyle, Mark Addy and Tom Wilkinson play unemployed middle-aged steelworkers in Sheffield, England, who take it all off for a buck in this comedy directed by Peter Cattaneo, which received Oscar nominations for best director, best picture and best screenplay, and won for best original music. ''Brightly acted and casually hilarious, 'The Full Monty' exploits this gimmick in witty, trenchant ways that are always generous, never cruel,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The Times. KATHRYN SHATTUCK

HEADLINE: Going Beyond Carbon Dioxide

BYLINE: By DURWOOD J. ZAELKE and VEERABHADRAN RAMANATHAN. 
Durwood J. Zaelke is the founder of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development. Veerabhadran Ramanathan is a professor of atmospheric and climate sciences at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego.

 BODY:
Doha, Qatar
WE all know (or should know) by now that the carbon dioxide we produce when we burn fossil fuels and cut down forests is the planet's single largest contributor to global warming. It persists in the atmosphere for centuries. Reducing these emissions by as much as half by 2050 is essential to avoid disastrous consequences by the end of this century, and we must begin immediately.
But this is a herculean undertaking, both technically and politically, as the lack of progress at United Nations climate talks here this week attests. And even if we are able to do this over the next 40 years, we would not slow the rate of warming enough by midcentury to moderate consequences like rising sea levels, the release of methane and carbon dioxide from melting arctic permafrost, and a rise in extreme weather. 
There is, however, a short-term strategy. We can slow this warming quickly by cutting emissions of four other climate pollutants: black carbon, a component of soot; methane, the main component of natural gas; lower-level ozone, a main ingredient of urban smog; and hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, which are used as coolants. They account for as much as 40 percent of current warming.
Unlike carbon dioxide, these pollutants are short-lived in the atmosphere. If we stop emitting them, they will disappear in a matter of weeks to a few decades. We have technologies to do this, and, in many cases, laws and institutions to support these cuts. Moreover, President Obama has the executive authority to move ahead aggressively on these pollutants, as he did last year in ordering substantial reductions in auto and truck emissions. By doing so, he may persuade other countries to follow.
Such reductions, if they occurred worldwide, would have the potential to slash the rate of global warming by half by midcentury -- equivalent to wiping out the warming we have experienced over the last 50 years. These reductions would also prevent an estimated two to four million deaths from air pollution and avoid billions of dollars of crop loss annually, according to a study commissioned by the United Nations Environment Program and the World Meteorological Organization.
We can reduce black carbon emissions significantly in the next few decades by using particulate filters on cars and trucks and switching to low-sulfur diesel. By employing those strategies, California, for instance, has cut the warming effect from diesel emissions by nearly half since the late 1980s.
In addition, we can further reduce emissions of black carbon and carbon monoxide (which produces lower-level ozone) in the developing world simply by turning to efficient biomass cook stoves instead of using traditional mud stoves, by replacing kerosene lamps in villages with solar lamps, and by deploying modern brick kilns.
Methane emissions can be cut by nearly a third by reducing leaks from gas pipes, coal mines and hydraulic fracturing, by capturing methane from waste dumps, water treatment plants and manure, and by cutting emissions from rice paddies.
These reductions in methane, carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds would also significantly reduce lower-level ozone, which is another important climate-warming pollutant that is formed by the interaction of sunlight with other short-lived pollutants.
And HFCs, which are widely used in refrigerators, can be replaced with readily available climate-friendly refrigerants. Nearly 100 ozone-depleting chemicals have been phased out under the Montreal Protocol, an international treaty that took effect in 1989, and more than 100 countries support a shift to the safer HFC alternatives. Phasing down HFCs would provide climate protection many times greater than the current Kyoto climate treaty -- the equivalent of about 100 billion tons of carbon dioxide by 2050.
Many of these actions would improve public health and crop yields in the countries making the reductions, and perhaps encourage them to go further.
The Obama administration began an important effort to reduce these pollutants when Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton began the global Climate and Clean Air Coalition to Reduce Short-Lived Climate Pollutants earlier this year. Twenty-five countries are now participating, along with the World Bank, the European Commission, the United Nations' environment and development programs and several environmental organizations. To achieve global scale, the coalition must find ways to work with large developing economies, including those of China, India and Brazil.
Reducing short-lived climate pollutants is essential for slowing the pace of climate change in the near term. We can't forget about carbon dioxide. But this strategy would provide Mr. Obama the opportunity to show leadership at home by using his executive authority, and abroad by encouraging other countries to reduce these pollutants. His commitment could produce fast results and create a sense of urgent optimism that we need to solve the climate threat.

HEADLINE: In Shift of Jobs, Apple Will Make Some Macs in U.S.

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL and NICK WINGFIELD; Charles Duhigg and Quentin Hardy contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Apple plans to join a small but growing number of companies that are bringing some manufacturing jobs back to the United States, drawn by the growing economic and political advantages of producing in their home market.
On Thursday, Apple's chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, who built its efficient Asian manufacturing network, said the company would invest $100 million in producing some of its Mac computers in the United States, beyond the assembly work it already does in the United States. He provided little detail about how the money would be spent or what kinds of workers might benefit.
Apple, which long manufactured parts in the United States but stopped about a decade ago, has been under pressure to create more jobs here given its market power. It sold 237 million iPods, iPads, Macs and other devices in the year ended in September.
''I don't think we have a responsibility to create a certain kind of job,'' Mr. Cook told Bloomberg Businessweek. ''But I think we do have a responsibility to create jobs.'' 
Some analysts are hopeful that the move by a big, innovative company like Apple could inspire a broader renaissance in American manufacturing, but a number of experts remain skeptical.
''I find it hard to see how the supply chains that drive manufacturing are going to move back here,'' said Andre Sharon, a professor at Boston University and director of the Fraunhofer Center for Manufacturing Innovation. ''So much of the know-how has been lost to Asia, and there's no compelling reason for it to return. It's great when a company says they want to create American jobs -- but it only really helps the country if those are jobs that belong here, if it starts a chain reaction or is part of a bigger economic shift.''
Over the last few years, companies across various industries, including electronics, automotive and medical devices, have announced that they are ''reshoring'' jobs after decades of shipping them abroad. Lower energy costs in America, rising wages in developing countries like China and Brazil, quality control issues and the desire to keep the supply chain close to the gigantic American consumer base have all factored into these decisions.
''Companies were going abroad in pursuit of cost reduction, and it turns out there were a lot of unintended costs,'' said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial. ''America has been looking a lot more competitive lately.''
Even so, the impact on the American job market has been modest so far. Much of the work brought back has been high-value-added, automated production that requires few actual workers, which is part of the reason America's higher wages are not scaring off companies.
American manufacturing has been growing in the last two years, but the sector still has two million fewer jobs than it had when the recession began in December 2007. Worldwide manufacturing appears to be growing much faster, even for many of the American-owned companies that are expanding at home. General Electric, for example, has hired American workers to build water heaters, refrigerators, dishwashers and high-efficiency topload washers, but continues to add more jobs overseas as well.
Apple has not announced plans to move the complex, faster-growing portions of its product lines. Macs now represent a relatively small part of Apple's business, accounting for less than 20 percent of its nearly $36 billion in revenue in its most recent quarter. The company's iPad and iPhone products, which amount to nearly 70 percent of its sales, will continue to be made in low-cost centers of manufacturing like China, mostly on contract with outside companies like Foxconn.
Mr. Cook's statements suggested Apple was planning to build more of the Mac's components domestically, but with partners. He told Bloomberg Businessweek that the plan ''doesn't mean that Apple will do it ourselves, but we'll be working with people, and we'll be investing our money.''
Whether Apple's newly announced plan might help create other higher-paying jobs along the supply line depends on the nature of the manufacturing.
Other computer manufacturing has been trickling back to the United States after largely shifting overseas in the 1990s.
In October, Lenovo, the computer giant based in China, said it would begin making its Think-branded computers, including notebooks, desktops and some tablets, at a facility in Whitsett, N.C. The move will create 115 manufacturing jobs at the plant, the company said.
Mark Stanton, director of global supply chain communications for Lenovo, said that moving the jobs to the United States would allow Lenovo to offer faster turnaround times for its customers in North America than if the machines were coming from overseas, and that the company was not specifically creating the American jobs because of any political pressure.
''We're certainly not unaware of the economic situation and political environment,'' he said. ''It's an added benefit, but we didn't go in with that premise. We went in with a business case.''
The globalized model of the electronics industry was shaken last year by supply chain disruptions after floods in Thailand. The auto industry faced similar challenges after the tsunami in Japan. Not coincidentally, Ford recently announced that it was adding 1,200 jobs in Michigan, and foreign-owned auto manufacturers like Honda and Volkswagen have also invested in more hiring and training in Indiana and Tennessee.
For the most part, companies seem to be stepping up production in the United States for domestic customers, as opposed to exports, said Chad Moutray, the chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers. (Companies are moving their production closer to where their customers are in Europe, too. Five years ago, Hewlett-Packard supplied most of Europe's desktops from China, but today it manufactures in the Czech Republic, Turkey and Russia instead, according to Tony Prophet, senior vice president for operations for H.P.'s PCs and printers.)
But the United States is also becoming a more attractive place to manufacture goods destined for overseas markets. While the National Association of Manufacturers and other business groups complain about an antibusiness tax and regulatory environment in America, an international ranking from the World Bank on the ''ease of doing business'' placed the United States near the top of the list, and countries like Brazil, India and the Philippines near the bottom.
''If you ask how many days does it take to open a business, to get electricity, things like that, you realize there are a lot of reasons why the business environment is really much better here than in places where labor happens to be really cheap,'' said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities.
On Thursday, the White House said it was encouraging to see more big American companies bringing back manufacturing.
''Policy matters, and our country is pushing policies that encourage manufacturing, R.& D., infrastructure, skills and the support for growing supply chains,'' said Gene Sperling, director of the president's National Economic Council. ''I think what you want is a mutually reinforcing cycle, where basic economic trends that make the U.S. more competitive for manufacturing and for creating supply chains is encouraged and supported by policies that recognize those location decisions have broader spillover impacts that benefit the economy beyond specific companies.''

HEADLINE: Holiday Balls Of Fun

BYLINE: By DICK SCANLAN

 BODY:
Nearly 30 years ago, I spent an exorbitant $6 on a tiny Santa in a basket tied to a wooden red and white hot air balloon. I was newly in love, and it was our first Christmas together. When my partner died of AIDS, I vowed to keep our ornament collection going. And that's the only reason my new partner (17 years new), who is Jewish, agrees to cohabit each December with an elaborately decorated Christmas tree. Or rather trees. My sizable collection now requires a second tree, for dog ornaments only. Every year I vow not to buy any more ornaments, and every year I encounter irresistible offerings all over New York.
When friends who admire my treasure-laden trees ask for tips, I tell them to avoid the one-stop Christmas Shoppes. Instead, do what I do: search the boutiques that line the side streets of Manhattan and Brooklyn. Oh, and Bergdorf Goodman. 
MANHATTAN FAVORITES On the morning of Black Friday, I told my partner I was taking a stroll through NoLIta, knowing that my ornamental instinct was leading me to Elizabeth Street, where three shops carry select examples. I found a pair of elegant spheres, one in winter-white wool, and one in jute, at Haus Interiors ($10 each). Natural and raspberry-colored wicker were woven to create a ball-shaped basket at Thomas Sires that is homey and hip ($18). And Dinosaur Designs displayed eye-shaped ornaments made from synthetic resin in blue, green, gold and white ($30).
This homage to Surrealism inspired me to check out the works by another artist, Ian Trask, at Recession Art, several blocks away on Clinton Street. Using recycled materials like turquoise yarn and matchsticks, or mustard yarn and dismantled St. Patrick's Day jewelry, green beads and shamrocks, Mr. Trask turns Christmas balls into conversation pieces ($50). Very downtown.
TREE ORNAMENTS GROW IN BROOKLYN, TOO In a departure from my usual hunting grounds, I headed across the East River to Brooklyn, a borough that, ornamentally speaking, I know little about. By the time I was heading back for the Manhattan side, I had discovered another hot air balloon, at Commune ($19), a hair salon in Williamsburg that also sells Christmas ornaments. Makes sense: blow dryer equals hot air equals balloon.
THE TRENDS The New York obsession with what's hot and what's not extends to ornaments. Because I'm in it for the long haul, I pay little attention to a given year's ''must have'' ornament, but casual collectors could have a ball doing a theme tree. This year it's whales. There's a carved-wood whale ($14), a glass narwhal spouting gold glitter ($18) and a glass whale with chompers -- Moby Dick meets Austin Powers ($18) -- at Haus Interiors. Tabwa, an ornament lover's old reliable, has a painted papier-mâché whale ($18). Clay Wood & Cotton at the Grand Central Holiday Fair carries a blue serge plush narwhal with a beige tusk ($15).
THE FAIRS Most of what I find at the holiday fairs that spread out from South Street Seaport to Harlem is strictly for amateurs, but the one at Grand Central Terminal is a notable exception. I love Hut Studios' Photoshopped images of New York (the Pan Am Building, the Flatiron Building, the Roosevelt Island Tramway) decoupaged into 3-D ornaments ($30 to $45), as well as the two-dimensional top-of-the-Woolworth Building stunner that I picked up for my partner ($15) because he loves the Woolworth Building, and I want him to love the tree.
The Glass Haus features tiny clear glass snowmen that have been rolled while hot in shards of white glass to create a striking speckled effect ($38 to $48). In honor of Africa, where I've spent the last two summers, at Chibekeni Global Treasures I selected one of the ornaments made of dried monkey fruit from Malawi that's been vegetable-dyed to deep jewel tones ($12.50).
WINDOW SHOPPING I was on such a roll that I broke my cardinal rule and visited Bergdorf Goodman before Dec. 26, when its steep prices are slashed. Every year Bergdorf's creates a glass ornament in the image of Linda Fargo, its senior vice president for fashion and store presentation (those windows!).
Always the fashionista, this ornament changes its outfit annually; her 2012 look is a red dress and white fur jacket with matching hat ($58). James the Doorman, forever in his silver gray uniform, is also depicted in an ornament. Modeled after James Lopilato, who mans the 58th Street entrance, this figurine is a big seller ($46).
''I'm honored,'' said the real-life Mr. Lopilato, who will autograph your ornament if you ask him to. ''I've been in restaurants, and the kids recognize me: 'We have him on our tree!' ''
BALLERINAS, JELLYFISH, DOGS AND SNOWFLAKES The store at 78th Street and Broadway where I bought that first ornament is long gone, but one block over is More & More Antiques. No matter who you are or what you're into, there's an ornament for you. When I started shopping here many years ago, I felt unworthy of its offerings, but the owner, Steve Mohr, welcomed me with the smile of a kid on Christmas morning.
This year I flipped for a Degas ballerina ($39), a glass figurine that seems to capture the essence of Impressionism without being kitsch. There was also a translucent glass jellyfish that managed to look just like a jellyfish, but beautiful ($46). Usain Bolt, the Jamaican sprinter who broke an Olympic record and won three gold medals last summer, is represented here in a handblown, hand-painted ornamental tribute ($40).
My partner may not be the Ghost of Christmas Present, but he does love our dogs, and I'd have been in serious trouble if I came home sans something for the dog tree. I knew it the minute I saw it: a Jeff Koons balloon dog ornament at Mxyplyzyk ($9.95 -- a tiny fraction of what the real deal would cost). It even has an arty angle, which my partner likes. As I was debating whether to get it in red, green, gold or silver, William White, an event planner, approached.
''The perfect gift,'' he told me. ''I've been invited to a Christmas party, and the host has an actual Koons balloon dog sculpture.''
The sales clerk chimed in: ''A Koons balloon dog? We also have it in a Jell-O mold.''
Could this be the start of a new collection? Something my partner and I could do together? But I'd prefer a third Christmas tree. And I need one, especially after stumbling upon these at La Maison Supreme: Austrian goose eggs, hand-painted black and gold, and finished with faux pearls ($25), as well as a silver glass ball covered in a blue, hand-painted vine with iridescent, beaded flowers ($45) and a glass pine cone in gleaming teal ($57).
As if that weren't enough, Maison 140 has five styles of snowflake, all French and all fabulous ($18 to $25). Which leaves me dreaming of a white Christmas, and my partner dreaming of a new partner.

HEADLINE: The Baby Boom Bump

BYLINE: By KENNETH S. BAER and JEFFREY B. LIEBMAN. 
Kenneth S. Baer, a managing director of the Harbour Group, was a senior adviser and associate director at the Office of Management and Budget from 2009 until July. Jeffrey B. Liebman, a professor of public policy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, was acting deputy director and executive associate director at the O.M.B. from 2009 to 2010.

 BODY:
CONVENTIONAL wisdom calls the 2012 presidential race the ''demographic election,'' attributing President Obama's victory in large part to his commanding advantage among rapidly growing groups like Latinos and millennials.
But if demographics is destiny in politics, it is even more true for policy. Far from the headlines, the debate over the budget deficit, taxes and unemployment is being driven by large-scale changes in the American population -- and in this case, it's not the new demographics of the young that are important, but rather the old demographics of the baby boom.
For decades we have known that the retirement of the baby boomers would be a monumental event for the economy. But now that it's happening, many fiscal policy makers are acting as if the boomers are eternal teenagers and are turning a blind eye to how the boomers' aging changes how we should approach economic policy. And this affects two of the central issues of the negotiations: how much the government should spend and how we can cut unemployment. 
Consider the debate over spending. The Congressional Budget Office projects that if current policies continue, total federal spending will rise to 24 percent of gross domestic product in 2022. Republicans and Washington deficit hawks argue that this means spending is out of control, since over the past 40 years government spending has averaged 21 percent.
Their proposed solution is a cap on government spending as a percentage of the economy. Mitt Romney wanted to cap spending at 20 percent of G.D.P. Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, has proposed a cap of 20.6 percent with Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri. Just this week, Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, a 2016 Republican presidential aspirant, suggested an 18 percent cap.
These plans ignore the simple fact that you cannot repeal the aging of the boomers. The main reason expenditures are rising this decade is that spending on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid is increasing by a whopping 3.7 percent of G.D.P. as the baby boomers age and retire. This demographic fact also has been driving increases in disability insurance payments as more knees give way and backs give out.
These inexorable demographic changes mask the fact that over the past four years we have experienced historic levels of fiscal discipline. While there was a temporary and necessary spike in spending from the Recovery Act, annual appropriations actually declined by 1.4 percent a year between 2008 and 2012 in inflation-adjusted dollars -- after growing by 6.1 percent a year during the George W. Bush administration. Under the caps agreed to last year, discretionary spending is scheduled to reach its lowest level, as a share of the economy, since the Eisenhower administration.
This discipline, however, is being overwhelmed by demographic reality. We need to accept the fact that we simply cannot revert to historical norms in government spending and keep faith with commitments made to millions of aging workers.
But that is no excuse for inaction: in addition to the existing caps on discretionary spending, we need higher revenues along with slower spending growth in our social insurance programs.
Ignoring the economics of boomer retirement also distorts debates about the unemployment rate.
Despite the fact that the unemployment rate has dropped faster in the past year than at any time since 1995, Republicans say there has been no recovery in the job market, since the 150,000 jobs being added monthly are simply keeping up with population growth. They note that the employment-to-population rate has not recovered significantly and claim that the only reason the unemployment rate is going down is that people are giving up looking for work.
If this were the 1960s, they might have a case. But the children of the 1960s are now in their 60s, and are simply not as likely to want to be in the labor force as younger workers. The employment-to-population ratio is on a steady downward trend, regardless of the economy. The fact that the rate is flat is evidence that the labor market is recovering (though not fast enough).
With more than 200,000 boomers exiting the labor force each month through retirement, the rule of thumb that the economy needs to add 140,000 jobs per month to keep up with population growth no longer holds. The new normal is 100,000, which is why 150,000 new jobs a month has brought the unemployment rate from 9.5 percent to 7.9 percent over the last two years.
Getting this right matters. If policy makers believe that the labor market has not improved over the past three years, they will reject the stimulus approach that the president took in 2009 and oppose further efforts to boost aggregate demand -- just as John A. Boehner, the speaker of the House, did last week after the administration called for a $50 billion stimulus package.
Over the coming weeks, big fiscal policy choices will be made, and many will be looking backward for a guide on how to move forward. But just as the generation that once proclaimed ''don't trust anyone over 30'' has had to face the reality of gray hair and grandkids, the new economics of the baby boom dictate that we must deal with the country and economy we have today -- not the one in the history books.

HEADLINE: Planning His Legacy, Cisco Chief Maps an Expansion

BYLINE: By QUENTIN HARDY

 BODY:
SAN JOSE, Calif. - John T. Chambers has readied his last great act as the leader of Cisco Systems, fearing major changes in the technology business that could doom his company.
In an interview at Cisco headquarters this week, Mr. Chambers said that a worldwide revolution in mobile devices and sensors, connected to huge Internet computer systems, was roiling technology giants like Microsoft, I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard, SAP, Oracle and Cisco.
"Two or three of those will not be in that list five years from now," said Mr. Chambers, who at 63 plans to retire in the next two to four years. "Transitions are happening at a faster pace than ever before." 
On Friday, Mr. Chambers will announce plans to take Cisco from simply making the boxes through which most of the Internet's traffic zips, to being a company that designs and sells software and services for a world of pervasive information technology.
Cisco, the chairman and chief executive says, will shift toward customers in government and large businesses, handling projects like designing and managing systems for efficient traffic and clean water across entire cities. Cisco's plan is to create networks of sensors and data analysis systems, working closely with government officials and civil engineering companies. And it will work with companies to set up efficient mining, manufacturing and distribution systems.
"It's a $4 trillion market," he said. "The days of boxes are over."
For many years Cisco was one of the fastest-growing technology companies, and it is still the largest player in the networking business. But its growth has shrunk because of the global economic slowdown and new types of competition.
Mr. Chambers, who says his latest strategy will be a legacy for the next generation of Cisco leadership, has tried to fix this in part by acquiring companies that rely on high-profit-margin software and moving into growth areas like video.
Mr. Chambers has been reorganizing Cisco, consolidating a number of divisions and buying companies to prepare for his new strategy. Parts of the plan, however, seem to have large gaps, in particular how Cisco will move from a focus on technical engineering to producing social and economic results. "We've got some of the horses," he said. "We need a lot more."
The new focus, which will be echoed in a marketing campaign that starts Monday called "Tomorrow starts here," was introduced at a meeting of Cisco's top 200 salesmen last weekend in Hawaii. Mr. Chambers and his top lieutenants worked on some of the organizational rules on his plane home, and broke the news to Cisco employees on Tuesday.
The underlying pressures behind the change, however, have been building for years. The boom in smartphones and tablets has increased the range of devices that a computer network has to manage, along with the amount and diversity of data, from two-way video to sensor data and social network updates. These devices are connected to supercomputing clouds, which collect and process enormous amounts of information at low cost.
The trend threatens large incumbent tech companies that grew up in a more predictable world. Oracle, once mainly a purveyor of databases, has moved into computer servers in response. Microsoft has invested heavily in building out its own cloud. Hewlett-Packard's ill-starred purchase of Autonomy for $11 billion in 2010, which resulted in a $8.8 billion write-down, was an effort to become a big player in data analysis.
I.B.M., which emerged from an earlier near-death experience with the help of a services strategy similar to that of Mr. Chambers, has spent $16 billion on analytics companies in the last five years.
For Cisco, which by some measures is in 80 percent of Internet systems, the threat is from start-ups using a technology called software-defined networking, or S.D.N. This makes it possible to instantly reconfigure millions of computer servers and data storage systems to handle different types of applications, so that a fast currency trading system can instantaneously be turned into a machine that serves thousands of videos.
A move into services could ease some of that pressure, because the start-ups do not have Cisco's corporate connections nor its deep range of products. What the firms do have, in abundance, is former Cisco talent.
Some of the biggest names backing and creating S.D.N. companies like Arista Networks, Big Switch Networks and Nicira are former senior executives at Cisco. In July, Nicira, which had almost no revenue, was acquired for $1.26 billion by VMware, a cloud computing giant that was a close collaborator of Cisco.
Mr. Chambers was dismissive of the shifting alliances. "We don't go into a market without a chance of a 40 percent share, and sustainable differentiation," he said. "We wouldn't get into wiring oil rigs if we didn't believe we could get 40 percent."
Mr. Chambers also said that Cisco's newest Internet switches were much faster than Arista's products, and that an internally financed S.D.N. project would beat back the competition.
Not surprisingly, the competition does not agree. "He's picking a point in time to say he's faster," said Jayshree Ullal, the chief executive of Arista. "We've diversified to be about programmable networks, and he's still thinking about basic speeds."
Mr. Chambers has in the past studied the personal biographies and decision-making habits of his competitors. Without prompting, he provided personal details about the life and choices of Ren Zhengfei, the founder and chief executive of Huawei, another Cisco competitor, and said he could do the same for many other competitors. "I've worked with Jayshree for years," he said, "I can tell you what her next two moves will be."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Participants in Talks on a Budget Deal Shrink to Two: Obama and Boehner

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN and PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- At House Speaker John A. Boehner's request, Senate leaders and Representative Nancy Pelosi have been excluded from talks to avert a fiscal crisis, leaving it to Mr. Boehner and President Obama alone to find a deal, Congressional aides say.
All sides, even the parties excluded, say clearing the negotiating room improves the chance of success. It adds complexity as the two negotiators consult separately with the leaders not in the room. But it also minimizes the number of people who need to say yes to an initial agreement. 
''This is now the speaker and the president working this through,'' said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the Senate's No. 2 Democrat.
White House aides and the speaker's staff, by mutual agreement, have largely shut down public communication about the talks to avert hundreds of billions of dollars in automatic tax increases and spending cuts set to begin in January if no deal can be reached. Both sides said on Thursday that lines of communication remained open.
For public consumption, Democrats and Republicans are engaging in an increasingly elaborate show of political theater. Mr. Obama on Thursday went to the home of a middle-income family in the Virginia suburbs of Washington to press for an extension of expiring tax cuts for the middle class -- and for the expiration of Bush-era tax cuts on incomes over $250,000.
''Just to be clear, I'm not going to sign any package that somehow prevents the top rate from going up for folks at the top 2 percent,'' Mr. Obama said. ''But I do remain optimistic that we can get something done.''
On Capitol Hill, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, moved Thursday to vote on Mr. Obama's proposal, in his broader deficit package, to permanently diminish Congress's control over the federal government's statutory borrowing limit, assuming that Democrats would break ranks and embarrass the president. Instead, Democratic leaders did a count, found they had 51 solid votes, and took Mr. McConnell up on what Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate majority leader, called ''a positive development.''
Mr. McConnell then filibustered his own bill, objecting to a simple-majority vote and saying a change of such magnitude requires the assent of 60 senators.
''I do believe we made history on the Senate floor today,'' Mr. Durbin said.
The government is expected to hit its borrowing limit in late January or early February, and it is an added complication in the deficit talks because some House Republicans say they will demand further spending cuts before they lift the debt ceiling. Mr. Obama has said that any deal on taxes and spending must ensure that there will not be another crisis over the debt ceiling early next year.
But the White House on Thursday gave Republicans assurances the president would not employ a potent weapon to get what he wants. Some Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton, have theorized that the Constitution gives the president the authority to raise the debt ceiling unilaterally, citing a clause in the 14th Amendment guaranteeing that the nation's debts ''shall not be questioned.''
Mr. Obama renounced such an assertion of authority on Thursday through his spokesman. ''I can say that this administration does not believe that the 14th Amendment gives the president the power to ignore the debt ceiling,'' Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, told reporters, reading from language that had been prepared for him.
Administration officials had long discounted the possibility that the president would claim such power, but Thursday's statement seemed more definitive than any in the past.
The exclusion of Senators Reid and McConnell and Ms. Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, is a departure from last year's search for a major deficit deal. Then, Obama-Boehner deficit talks coincided with side talks between Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, which were followed by broader talks by a special bipartisan Congressional committee. All failed.
This time, while Mr. Boehner has made himself the sole focal point, aides say he has made sure a broad leadership team is behind him. He meets every morning while the House is in session with the full slate of Republican leaders, as well as the committee chairmen who would most likely implement a deal: Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, who heads the Budget Committee; Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, who leads the Ways and Means Committee; and Representative Fred Upton of Michigan, who heads the Energy and Commerce Committee.
White House officials have begun daily conference calls with the communications staffs of Mr. Reid and Ms. Pelosi. The White House communications director, Dan Pfeiffer, met with the Senate Democratic Caucus last week, and the director of the National Economic Council, Gene Sperling, spoke with the House Democrats late last month.
The arrangement has led to bipartisan grumbling. Senator Bernard Sanders of Vermont, an independent and perhaps the Senate's most liberal member, said on Thursday that Senate Democrats needed to find a way to make themselves more relevant to the search for a resolution to the fiscal standoff.
Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, has gone to the Senate floor repeatedly to denounce ''secret'' deficit talks.
''Shouldn't the president lay out his plan?'' Mr. Sessions asked. ''He's the president of the United States and the only one who represents everybody. Or will that remain a secret? Will it just be revealed to us on the eve of Christmas or on the eve of the new calendar year and we will be asked to vote for it like lemmings?''

HEADLINE: Alaska Offers Prospects for Democrats

BYLINE: By NATE SILVER

 BODY:
The state where President Obama most improved his performance from 2008 was Alaska. He lost it by ''only'' 14 percentage points this year, considerably less than his 22-point margin of defeat in 2008. 
Part of the reason is that the former governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin, was on the Republican ticket in 2008 but was not this year. That probably does not explain all of the shift, however.
Consider that in 2000 -- also without Ms. Palin on the ballot -- the Democratic nominee, Al Gore, lost Alaska by 31 points.
There are reasons to think that Alaska could continue to become more competitive in the coming years.
One factor is that Alaska's vote is elastic, meaning that it can shift quite a bit from year to year. In 2008, 43 percent of voters in Alaska identified themselves as independents on the exit poll, among the highest percentages in the country. (There was no exit polling in Alaska in 2012.)
Of the remaining voters in the state, far more were Republicans (37 percent) than Democrats (20 percent), meaning that a Republican candidate will ordinarily have a clear advantage if the independent vote is split about evenly. But the right sort of Democrat, who wins the majority of independents, can be competitive there, and indeed some Democrats (like Alaska's Democratic senator, Mark Begich) can win statewide office there under the right conditions.
Alaska's population is also changing; between 2010 and 2011, Alaska had the third-highest population growth rate in the country, trailing only Texas and Utah.
Where are those new Alaskans coming from? Many are from liberal states on the West Coast. Between 2005 and 2009, about 4,300 Californians moved to Alaska per year, making it the top state for domestic emigration to Alaska. So did 4,200 residents a year from Washington and 2,200 from Oregon.
Texas, where about 2,700 people emigrated to Alaska each year, also ranked high on the list, perhaps in part because of each state's ties to the fossil fuels industry (along with Texas' large population). But the new residents of Alaska are most likely considerably more liberal than the rest of the state's population, over all.
On cultural issues, Alaska already resembles other Pacific Coast states in certain respects. Only about half of Alaska's adults say that religion is an important part of their everyday lives, which is among the lowest rates in the country (and similar to those in Washington and Oregon).
On economic affairs, Alaska is considerably more conservative. And Democrats will encounter some friction in the state so long as they are perceived as opposing the interests of the oil and natural gas industries, which are essential to the economy there.
If the Democratic nominee in 2016 is someone like Hillary Rodham Clinton, who embraces a relatively traditional Democratic agenda, she will have better places to compete.
But a Democrat who was perceived as being of the center-left or the libertarian left, especially one from a Western state, like Colorado's governor, John W. Hickenlooper, could conceivably be competitive in Alaska. And if Alaska continues to add population from states like California and Washington, it could be competitive on a more regular basis in 2020 and beyond.

HEADLINE: Dreaming A Dream Of More Awards

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Early in the coming movie adaptation of ''Les Misérables,'' Anne Hathaway and a group of grimy factory workers sing about ''another day dawning.'' Will it be a better one? Or will their toiling bring ''nothing for nothing''?
Working Title Films, which co-produced ''Les Misérables'' with Cameron Mackintosh, is confronting the same questions as it amps up an already aggressive awards campaign for the film. The all-star movie musical could pop at the multiplex, sweep into the Academy Awards and instantly recharge the company, which has had a bumpy few years. Or ''Les Misérables'' could end up like the 2004 adaptation of ''The Phantom of the Opera'' -- lackluster ticket sales, a few Oscar nominations, no wins. 
Working Title, based in London, was once one of Hollywood's most reliable suppliers of classy commercial movies: ''Fargo,'' ''Billy Elliot,'' ''Elizabeth,'' ''Bridget Jones's Diary,'' ''Four Weddings and a Funeral,'' ''Pride & Prejudice.'' But the company, which has 53 Oscar nominations and six wins on its résumé, has lost its way in recent years. It has still delivered the occasional gem -- ''Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy'' was one -- but misses have far outnumbered hits.
Like many specialty-film suppliers, Working Title was knocked off balance by a variety of forces. DVD sales fell off a cliff. Audiences started to reject romantic comedies, which had been one of its most dependable genres. (Adjusting for inflation, the company's ''Love Actually,'' directed by Richard Curtis, took in $300 million worldwide in 2003.) Meanwhile, Universal Pictures, which pays Working Title's script development costs and finances most of its movies, went through management turmoil.
The upshot: Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner, Working Title's chairmen, started to stray from what they did best. ''We made small films with big budgets, and that is never good,'' Mr. Fellner said, speaking of disappointments including the war drama ''Green Zone,'' the newspaper mystery ''State of Play'' and the period comedy ''Pirate Radio.''
''If one's honest about it, we made some decisions that weren't the right ones,'' he added bluntly.
''Les Misérables,'' along with Working Title's much smaller-scale ''Anna Karenina,'' may well be a return to form for Mr. Fellner and Mr. Bevan. It's still early, but ''Les Misérables,'' which cost a relatively cheap $61 million to make (after taking tax credits into consideration), is shaping up as both a blockbuster and a major awards contender. While some Oscar voters have been turned off by its length -- 2 hours and 38 minutes -- buzz from industry screenings has been overwhelmingly ecstatic, especially pertaining to Ms. Hathaway, who plays the dying Fantine.
Although a movie critic for The Hollywood Reporter gave ''Les Misérables'' a scathing review on Thursday, the publication lists the movie as a ''front-runner'' in nine Oscar categories. Deadline.com deemed it ''an instant major contender'' after late November screenings in New York and Los Angeles. A thicket of nominations is assured at the very least for the film, which arrives in theaters on Christmas Day. The last Universal-released movie to win best picture was ''A Beautiful Mind'' in 2001.
The hyper-stylized ''Anna Karenina,'' which cost about $30 million to make, is having a rougher go of it. Mr. Bevan and Mr. Fellner hoped that pairing Keira Knightley with the director Joe Wright for a third time -- they collaborated on ''Pride & Prejudice'' in 2005 and on the critical darling ''Atonement'' in 2007, both for Working Title -- would deliver similarly robust results. Reviews have been mixed, however, and ticket sales for the film's limited release have been solid but not spectacular.
''Anna Karenina'' has taken in about $16.2 million worldwide since opening on Nov. 16. It will almost assuredly receive Oscar attention in categories like costume design (nominations in higher-wattage categories are also a possibility), which could give it a box-office boost. The Academy Awards ceremony will be on Feb. 24.
If Universal is anything but thrilled with the direction Working Title is now headed, you wouldn't know it from talking to Donna Langley, the studio's co-chairwoman. ''They are extraordinarily important to us,'' she said.
Working Title's movies have always played better overseas than in North America. In the late 1990s, with the international success of films like its ''Dead Man Walking,'' the production company became known in Hollywood as the Miramax of Europe. Now, with the movie business growing increasingly global, Working Title's knack for ''speaking to an international audience,'' as Ms. Langley put it, makes Mr. Bevan and Mr. Fellner ''crucial'' partners.
Their deal with Universal expires in 2015.
Mr. Fellner and Mr. Bevan regrouped partly by leaning harder into some of their core creative relationships. They looked to Mr. Wright to make ''Anna Karenina,'' for instance. Mr. Curtis has a comedic drama coming in May called ''About Time,'' starring Rachel McAdams and Bill Nighy. ''Tim and Eric create a very supportive and safe environment,'' Mr. Wright said. ''They're taking creative risks, and that is extraordinarily important for the future of film.''
''Les Misérables,'' directed by Tom Hooper, who won an Oscar last year for his direction of ''The King's Speech,'' may not seem like much of a risk. It's based on a wildly popular musical seen by an estimated 60 million people in 43 countries. Along with Ms. Hathaway, ''Les Misérables'' stars Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe, among others.
But the movie, based on Victor Hugo's monumental novel, is ''not a slam dunk,'' Ms. Langley said. Musicals, much less period ones, can be box-office poison. The story is also quite bleak; although it comes across onstage like a fairy tale, its criminals, revolutionaries (and sewers) are starkly real on screen.
On the other hand, moviegoers may identify more than ever with the tale of haves and have-nots. And Mr. Bevan hopes that a creative decision to have the cast sing live on set (instead of lip-syncing to pretty recorded music) will engage audiences.
''It's almost a live experience and brings a whole different dimension to this film, something that you haven't seen,'' Mr. Bevan said. ''It adds a slight danger -- more visceral, more exciting, more emotional.''

HEADLINE: Are Women Having Fewer Children to Have More Fun?

BYLINE: THE INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE


HIGHLIGHT: As the United States sees record-low birthrates, some lament a new form of social organization that prizes liberation, personal happiness and perhaps even a "hip" urban aesthetic over traditional values like community and self-sacrifice. 

 BODY:
Chrystia Freeland, in her latest column, notes that the United States birthrate has plunged to its lowest ever, following declines in Europe and even China. 
Then she joins the debate over why, pointing out that researchers like Joel Kotkin lament that the falling birthrate is the central feature of " 'post-familialism,' a new form of social organization that prizes liberation, personal happiness and perhaps even a 'hip' urban aesthetic over the more traditional values of community and self-sacrifice," Chrystia says. 
This cultural critique - made, not accidentally, mostly by men - misses the central fact about falling birthrates. They are, above all, driven by decisions by women. And, in the countries where we have seen birthrates drop, they are about decisions driven by women who face three defining facts.
First, women have the historically unprecedented power to control their own fertility.
Second, the old close-knit family and community ties that once supported child-rearing have been severed by industrialization and urbanization, and not much has emerged to take their place.
Third, women's economic circumstances have been transformed. Women in countries where birthrates have fallen tend to be richer than were previous generations with higher birthrates or their sisters in countries where the birthrate is still high.
Chrystia concludes that in middle-income and rich nations, falling birthrates are also a reflection of how deeply societies have failed to find a way to allow women to be both mothers and contributing members of the society outside the home. In essence, she says, with no solution on how to do it all, "now women are voting with their wombs."
 Do you agree? Are falling birth rates more the response of a desire for personal freedom or more a reflection of women deciding, as society has not helped them, that they cannot have it all?

HIGHLIGHT: Delusions about trade, and more. 

 BODY:
Or, as the late James Tobin used to say, it takes a lot of Harberger triangles to fill an Okun gap.
Dean Baker catches David Ignatius suggesting that trade liberalization can provide enough economic boost to offset the effects of austerity. As Dean says, the arithmetic is totally off -- almost two orders of magnitude off. 
The truth is that using any conventional economic model, the costs from current levels of protectionism are very small as a share of GDP. To some extent that reflects the success of decades of trade liberalization: there just isn't that much protection any more. But it's a more general observation that even bad microeconomic policies, which lead to substantial distortions in the use of resources, have a hard time doing remotely as much damage as a severe economic slump, which doesn't misallocate resources -- it simply wastes them. Which is the point of that Tobin quote.
Right now the U.S. economy is operating something like 6 percent below capacity. You would be hard-pressed to find any microeconomic distortion that comes anywhere close to doing that much damage, or even a tenth that much damage. The one place that might qualify is health care, where we surely do waste several points of GDP. But the problem with health care in America isn't that we don't let the free market work, it is that we have a semi-private system in a sector where free markets can't work.
Two more things -- and back to Ignatius.
First, there's an especially strong tendency to mythologize the power of free trade. Not that open world markets are a bad thing; they're definitely a force for good, especially for small, poor countries. But my experience is that the less somebody knows about international trade, the more likely he or she is to imagine that modest moves toward or away from protectionism will have huge effects. Trade economists, who have actually worked with the models, have a much less grandiose view.
Second, even to the extent that trade liberalization would raise the efficiency of the world economy, it is not, repeat not, a route to overall job creation. Yes, everyone would export more; they would also import more. There is no reason at all to assume that the jobs gained from export creation would exceed the jobs lost to import competition.
Globalization is not the answer to the Lesser Depression.

HEADLINE: The Zuckerberg Family's Eggnog Cinnamon Chip Scones, and Other Tech Recipes

BYLINE: CLAIRE CAIN MILLER


HIGHLIGHT: A new cookbook, The Start-Up Chef, collects recipes from people in the tech world, with the proceeds going to charities that fight hunger. 

 BODY:
Not just anyone can build the next Facebook or Foursquare, but you can bake the Zuckerberg family's eggnog cinnamon chip scones, or cook the Foursquare founder's mother's sausage soup.
These are two of 75 recipes, along with personal stories and photos, shared by tech entrepreneurs, engineers and executives in a cookbook, , with proceeds going to hunger charities.
There are recipes for double marinated fillet of beef from Spotify's founder, Daniel Ek, and chocolate chip cookies from Fred and Joanne Wilson, tech investors and bloggers, who claim they are the best cookies around. There are quirky recipes, like the digital media entrepreneur Brit Morin's chocolate iPhone, and others that sound worthy of a dinner party, like Ken Weber of Zynga's halibut with Meyer lemon salsa, roasted new potatoes and creme fraiche. 
The cookbook is available as an e-book or PDF, and a print version might be published later (hopefully with a more inviting cover). The publisher is Leanpub, which enables writers and editors to continuously update the digital version of the book even after it is originally published, so more recipes can be added.
It sells for a suggested $20 and a minimum $10, though shoppers can pay as much as they want. All proceeds after credit card processing fees go to charities fighting hunger, including No Kid Hungry and Rockaway Plate Lunch, which helps people affected by Hurricane Sandy.
"The Start-Up Chef" is the brainchild of Hunter Walk (who shared a recipe for thumbprint cookies), a product executive at YouTube who leads YouTube for Good, which works with nonprofits and schools. He created it with Maya Baratz (raspberry jam), who is in charge of new media products at ABC News.
The recipes provide a peek into the private lives, and kitchens, of tech world celebrities. Engineers, it turns out, really like dessert, and venture capitalists really like cocktails.
"These are really interesting people, well-known for what they do in the office during the day, but this is a peek into what inspires them or their creative process," Ms. Baratz said.
Mr. Walk came up with the idea a couple months ago, he said, after being inspired by the many food photographs that his friends in tech posted on services like Instagram. Cooking, it turns out, is not so different from writing software, in terms of taking raw ingredients and turning them into a finished product, or meal, the cookbook's editors said.
"It's not just the approach to cooking itself being iterative, much like product design and start-ups, but also the community table being somewhere that ideas, experiences and thoughts are shared," Mr. Walk said.
The cookbook is the latest example of young tech founders doing philanthropic work long before they retire. Silicon Valley's young billionaires have sometimes been criticized for a lack of philanthropy relative to their wealth, but that is changing, Mr. Walk said.
"Increasingly, there's interest amongst the tech community, especially a lot of younger founders, to not wait for philanthropy to just be the pot of gold at the end of the I.P.O. rainbow, but how to contribute to the world around you all the time," he said.

HEADLINE: Daily Report: Experts Are Skeptical About a Renaissance of U.S. Manufacturing

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Apple announced its plans to bring some manufacturing jobs back to the United States, but some experts doubt that the move will inspire a broader rebirth in American manufacturing. 

 BODY:
Apple plans to join a small but growing number of companies that are bringing some manufacturing jobs back to the United States, drawn by the growing economic and political advantages of producing in their home market, report Catherine Rampbell and Nick Wingfield in Friday's New York Times. But some experts remain skeptical that the move will inspire a broader renaissance in American manufacturing. 
On Thursday, Apple's chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, who built its efficient Asian manufacturing network, said the company would invest $100 million in producing some of its Mac computers in the United States, beyond the assembly work it already does in the United States. He provided little detail about how the money would be spent or what kinds of workers might benefit.
"I find it hard to see how the supply chains that drive manufacturing are going to move back here," Andre Sharon, a professor at Boston University and director of the Fraunhofer Center for Manufacturing Innovation, told The Times. "So much of the know-how has been lost to Asia, and there's no compelling reason for it to return. It's great when a company says they want to create American jobs - but it only really helps the country if those are jobs that belong here, if it starts a chain reaction or is part of a bigger economic shift."
Over the last few years, companies across various industries, including electronics, automotive and medical devices, have announced that they are "reshoring" jobs after decades of shipping them abroad. Lower energy costs in America, rising wages in developing countries like China and Brazil, quality control issues and the desire to keep the supply chain close to the gigantic American consumer base have all factored into these decisions.
Even so, the impact on the American job market has been modest so far. Much of the work brought back has been high-value-added, automated production that requires few actual workers, which is part of the reason America's higher wages are not scaring off companies.
American manufacturing has been growing in the last two years, but the sector still has two million fewer jobs than it had when the recession began in December 2007. Worldwide manufacturing appears to be growing much faster, even for many of the American-owned companies that are expanding at home. General Electric, for example, has hired American workers to build water heaters, refrigerators, dishwashers and high-efficiency topload washers, but continues to add more jobs overseas as well.
Apple has not announced plans to move the complex, faster-growing portions of its product lines. Macs now represent a relatively small part of Apple's business, accounting for less than 20 percent of its nearly $36 billion in revenue in its most recent quarter. The company's iPad and iPhone products, which amount to nearly 70 percent of its sales, will continue to be made in low-cost centers of manufacturing like China, mostly on contract with outside companies like Foxconn.

HEADLINE: Automotive Diversions of the Non-Driving Kind

BYLINE: NORMAN MAYERSOHN


HIGHLIGHT: A brief review of "Joe's Junk Yard" by Lisa Kereszi. 

 BODY:
This weekend's Automobiles section offers six brief reviewsof recent books that readers may want to consider as holiday gifts or as additions to their own bookshelves. Covering a broad range of interests - pop culture, famous racers and marque histories are among the selections - they are evidence of a healthy ecosystem in the realm of automotive literature. 
Among the books considered for review, one that did not lend itself to a conventional appraisal was "Joe's Junk Yard," a 143-page volume of photographs by Lisa Kereszi (Damiani, $45). There are explanatory pages by the photographer, who is on thefaculty of the Yale School of Art, but it is the images, and their supporting context, that provide the book's main attraction.
Ms. Kereszi is not a disinterested observer here, an artist with a camera simply making well-imagined images of used-up vehicles. The junkyard was her family's livelihood through three generations, founded by her grandfather in Pennsylvania and serving as a gathering place and her creative inspiration. There are pages drawn from family albums and scrapbooks, portraits of relatives and acquaintances, landscapes strewn with ruined sedans and blown-up engines. Some might be characters from a Bruce Davidson essay, and there are scenes that may remind you of Lee Friedlander's work; Ms. Kersezi cites Walker Evans and Robert Frank among her influences.
I can well understand the attraction of the place - many hours of my younger years were spent wandering grimy piles of cast-off vehicles -- but the draw was purely mechanical. I searched for a usable transmission that would work in my '57 Bel Air, not a still-life composition of carburetors, fenders and bald tires.
The clarity with which Ms. Kersezi compiles images, family history and the decline of a way of life make "Joe's Junk Yard" a book that goes well beyond a photo collection. The individual pages are not all important works of creativity, but taken together with the words and the personal documentation, it is a volume worthy of examination.

HEADLINE: Little Clarity on the Jobs Front

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: The two employment surveys seem to disagree again. On balance, the recovery continues, but it could be in jeopardy if Washington acts irresponsibly. 

 BODY:
The jobs report for November has something for every side of the current economic argument. Are you convinced the economy is growing decently? The adding of 146,000 jobs in November sounds good. So does the unemployment rate falling to 7.7 percent. 
Are you convinced the recovery is in peril? The previous two months' job numbers were revised lower, and the unemployment rate went down only because the labor force declined. The number of manufacturing jobs fell for the third time in the last four months -- a string not seen since the depths of the credit crisis in 2009.
At the heart of the confusion is that there are two separated surveys every month, one of households and one of employers. To make things a little more confusing this month, the household survey covered the week of Nov. 4-10, a week earlier than it normally would have, so that the survey would be finished before the Thanksgiving holiday. That meant it covered the week after Hurricane Sandy, which must have had some impact in the affected states. The household survey also tends to be more volatile.
Over time, the two surveys give similar pictures, and that is true now. Over the last 12 months, the household survey says we have added 2.6 million jobs. The establishment survey puts the figure at 2.0 million. (That figure is after adjusting for the coming benchmark revision, which will add 386,000 jobs in the 12 months through March 2012. For purposes of this analysis, I assumed those jobs were spread equally over the period.)
The numbers will not get the fevered debate they did when they came out before the election, for reasons that are obvious. But on balance they indicate an economy that is growing, but that could be threatened if the European recession deepens, reducing the demand for American manufactured exports, or if the Congress and president end up slamming the brakes on fiscal policy with a combination of slashed spending and higher taxes.

HEADLINE: A Look at Taxing Marijuana

BYLINE: JEREMY W. PETERS


HIGHLIGHT: With some states beginning to relax their laws against marijuana, the notion of replacing prohibition with taxation is getting a look. 

 BODY:
Here's a thought for a tax increase that might at least break some of the tension in the room between President Obama and John Boehner: a marijuana tax. 
It's not as ludicrous an idea as it might seem. This week, Washington became the first state in the nation where marijuana is legal for recreational use. Colorado is set to follow its lead soon.
The fact that some states are starting to relax their marijuana laws got analysts at the Tax Policy Center thinking. What if the drug were legalized nationwide and taxed? 
The center looked at two studies, one of which estimated that a marijuana tax could bring in $9 billion a year in state and federal tax revenues and save roughly the same amount on law enforcement. (The study made certain assumptions about price and demand, and applied taxes comparable to those on alcohol and tobacco, as well as income taxes on those making money in the legalized trade.) Another study pointed to an estimate from California officials that marijuana legalization could add $1.4 billion to the state's economy, but doubted whether that much revenue would actually materialize.
Now, of course, $9 billion isn't much. One percent of the country's gross domestic product is about $150 billion. And this year's deficit is about $1 trillion. The tax increases and spending cuts set to begin taking effect on Jan. 1 if Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner aren't able to agree on a plan to head them off add up to about $600 billion.
Is a marijuana tax a bit fanciful in the near-term? Probably. Federal prosecutors aren't planning on making it any easier for these states to tax marijuana. In fact, the White House and the Justice Department have been considering whether to pursue legal action against Colorado and Washington to block their new marijuana laws. 
An earlier version of this post mischaracterized a Rand study on a marijuana tax. The study did not conclude that such a tax could bring $1.4 billion to California, but expressed doubt about whether that much revenue would actually materialize.

HEADLINE: When Cheap Foreign Labor Gets Less Cheap

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Rising wages in some manufacturing bases abroad could be encouraging American companies to move some of their production back home. 

 BODY:
Nick Wingfield and I had an article in Friday's paper about how some American companies are "re-shoring" manufacturing they had previously sent abroad. The scale of these efforts is still more anecdotal than widespread at this point. Still, it's worth examining why the United States might be a more attractive place to locate your plant today than in the past.
Cheap energy costs in the United States (thanks to shale gas extraction), concerns about keeping the supply chain close to the American consumer base, quality control issues and intellectual property concerns have all encouraged American companies to produce at least some of their products at home. But so have rising wages in some manufacturing bases abroad. 
Inflation-adjusted average wages in China, for example, more than tripled over the decade from 2000 to 2010, according to a report released Friday by the International Labor Organization.
This table, taken from the report, shows that in Asia, inflation-adjusted average wages have about doubled since 2000. In Eastern Europe and Central Asia, average wages almost tripled:
Growth rates published as "Provisional estimates" (based on coverage of c. 75%). ** Growth rates published as "Tentative estimates" (based on coverage of c. 40%- c. 74%). *** Growth rates published but likely to change (based on coverage of less than 40%). Source: ILO Global Wage Database.

In the developed world, wages are just barely higher than they were in 2000. In the United States, other studies have shown that median household income is lower today than it was in 2000. 
That does not mean that American wages are anywhere close to those in countries in East Asia or other places where American imports come from. As of 2010 (the latest year available), hourly compensation costs for manufacturing in the United States were about four times those in Taiwan, and 20 times those in the Philippines, according to the Labor Department. 
But the narrowing of that wage gap does mean that the labor cost advantage some of these other countries have enjoyed is eroding a little, particularly if there are other cost-based advantages to producing in the United States (like access to cheap natural gas or being closer to your consumers). 
"I'm going to sound like an economist talking here, but in a way it's good news that U.S. wages are going down, because that's making us more competitive year to year," said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities. 
On the other hand, as wages in many developing countries rise, companies also have a big incentive to automate more of their production. 
The most valuable part of each computer, a motherboard loaded with microprocessors and memory, is already largely made with robots, according to my colleague Quentin Hardy. People do things like fitting in batteries and snapping on screens.
As more robots are built, largely by other robots, "assembly can be done here as well as anywhere else," said Rob Enderle, an analyst based in San Jose, Calif., who has been following the computer electronics industry for a quarter-century. "That will replace most of the workers, though you will need a few people to manage the robots."

HEADLINE: Comparing Recessions and Recoveries

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: The country added jobs in November, the 26th consecutive month of gains: 146,000 nonfarm payroll jobs, to be more precise. But employment still has a long way to go before returning to its prerecession level. 

 BODY:
For the 26th straight month, the country added jobs: 146,000 nonfarm payroll jobs in November, to be more precise.
But employment still has a long way to go before returning to its prerecession level. 
The chart above shows economywide job changes in this last recession and recovery compared with other recent ones; the black line represents the current cycle. Since the downturn began in December 2007, the economy has had a net decline of about 3 percent in its nonfarm payroll jobs. And that does not even account for the fact that the working-age population has continued to grow, meaning that if the economy were healthy we should have more jobs today than we had before the recession.
Getting the economy to 5 percent unemployment within two years - a return to the rate that prevailed when the recession began - would require job growth of closer to 270,000 a month.
There are now 12 million workers looking for work who cannot find it. The tally of those who are "underemployed" - that is, adding in those workers who are part time but want to be employed full time, and workers who want to work but are not looking - is an even larger 22.7 million.
As bad as all these figures are, it's worth remembering that job markets in the decade following a financial crisis are always terrible. In fact, layoffs were far worse and lasted much longer in the aftermath of the financial crises that struck, for example, Finland and Sweden in 1991 and Spain in 1977, not to mention the United States during the Great Depression.

HEADLINE: Taxes Are the New Sex as Campaigns Target Multinationals

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Starbucks has moved to head off a consumer boycott in Britain by offering to pay taxes. But there are signs of a backlash, amid a growing clamor in Europe against multinational tax avoiders. 

 BODY:
LONDON - An attempt by Starbucks to buy its way out of a consumer boycott with a voluntary payoff to the British taxman may have backfired.
The Seattle-based global coffee chain has offered to pay the British government £20 million, or $32 million, over the next two years after it emerged that the company had paid only £8.6 million since 1998 on sales of £3 billion in Britain.
But politicians, newspapers and coffee-drinkers called the offer a public relations stunt that made a joke of the tax system. 
Richard Murphy, a British accountant, posted:
Note to Starbucks: we don't want token gestures. We want the right tax in the right place at the right timeshar.es/6zPYD
- Richard Murphy (@RichardJMurphy) December 6, 2012
And the satirical News Thump joked:
NEWS! Taxpayers queuing up to try Starbucks 'pay what you think it fair' tax model bit.ly/Urjolh
- News Thump (@newsthump) December 7, 2012
A tax pressure group said it planned to go ahead with sit-ins at 40 of the company's stores this weekend.
With Britain and other European states in the grip of an austerity regime stemming from the debt crisis, taxes are replacing sex as the daily staple of the popular press amid a backlash against corporations and individuals accused of not paying their fair share.
Rendezvous reported on Wednesday on international moves to squeeze the owners of bank accounts in Switzerland who are accused of using the country's banking secrecy laws to squirrel away fortunes in unpaid taxes.
Across Europe, governments have launched a crackdown on Internet giants, including Google and Amazon, by moving to close loopholes that allow them to pay minimal tax on their operations in the Continent.
No one is accusing the multinationals of breaking the law. The accusation is that they are taking advantage of clever tax avoidance methods to minimize their contributions to European treasuries.
The Associated Press wrote this week: "Thanks to the way the European Union is run, companies operating in Europe can base themselves in any of the 27 member countries, allowing them to take advantage of a particular country's low tax rates."
Business lobbyists have argued that a populist campaign against alleged multinational tax avoiders is anti-business. Others have argued that the way forward is for politicians to reform tax law at the European level.
Kris Engskov, who heads Starbuck's British unit, acknowledged on Thursday that "tax has become an important subject of debate over the past several weeks and I think it's important to share that the emotion of the issue has taken us a bit by surprise."
He said the company would pay around £10 million annually in tax over the next two years, whether its British operation, which includes 760 retail stores, was profitable or not.
Executives of Starbucks, Google and Amazon last month faced a fierce grilling on taxes by British legislators. After the session of Parliament's Public Accounts Committee, one observer wrote: "By the end, Starbucks management had been plucked, roasted, ground and sprayed with hot steam."
The committee this week accused the companies of "immorally" avoiding paying their fair share of taxes. 
Margaret Hodge, the opposition Labour Party politician who chairs the committee, said, "Global companies with huge operations in the U.K. generating significant amounts of income are getting away with paying little or no corporation tax here."
As the tax issue became the favorite talking point among customers and baristas, Starbucks opted to offer its voluntary payment under threat of a consumer boycott.
Political reaction was cautious at best. Ms. Hodge said it was a "first step in the right direction" and she hoped Google and Amazon would follow suit.
Stephen Williams, Treasury spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, part of the coalition running the government, was quoted saying, "It is extraordinary. People have been joking that some of these multinationals seem to think that paying tax is voluntary. Well, Starbucks have just confirmed the joke really."
Prem Sikka, a professor of accountancy at Essex University, was among those who rejected the concept of a "private sweetheart deal" with the taxman, telling the BBC: "We need to get Starbucks to pay proper tax." 
The company's £20 million, or $32 million, offer put it on a potential collision course with investors, according to The Financial Times, since the payment would come from its parent group. 
"Its plan is yet to be accepted by the U.K. tax authorities, which were not consulted in advance," the business daily reported, "and it sends a troubling signal to other companies under attack over their U.K. taxes, including Amazon and Google."

HEADLINE: Warming Ski Slopes, Shriveled Revenues

BYLINE: JOANNA M. FOSTER


HIGHLIGHT: Projections by climate scientists indicate that winter temperatures could rise by anywhere from 4 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century, and the length of the snow season in the Northeast could be cut in half. 

 BODY:
Snow can be an entrancing sight or an exhausting burden, but for communities dependent on winter sports, it is one thing above all else: revenue. 
In recent years, however, the cold cash that used to fall from the sky, giving an economic lift to 38 states, has become less reliable. Winters are getting warmer, less snow is falling, and snow seasons are starting later and ending earlier. 
A new report from the Natural Resources Defense Council and the climate-themed industry group Protect Our Winters takes a look at the possible impact of climate change on the nation's $12.2 billion snow sports industry and the 211,900 jobs it supports. 
According to the research, which focused on data from 1999 to 2010 and was conducted by researchers at the University of New Hampshire, the downhill ski industry takes in about $1 billion less revenue in a poor snow season than it does in a good one. A bad snow year subtracts anywhere from 13,000 to 27,000 jobs.
Projections by climate scientists indicate that winter temperatures could rise by anywhere from 4 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century, and the length of the snow season in the Northeast could be cut in half.

"Winter as we know it is on borrowed time," said Elizabeth Burakowski, a co-author of the report with Matt Magnusson. Both are doctoral candidates in earth science at the University of New Hampshire. 
Last winter, for example, was the fourth-warmest on record since 1896 and saw the third-lowest snow cover since record-keeping on that kind of data began in 1966. 
Auden Schendler, vice president of sustainability at the Aspen Skiing Company resort area in Colorado, says he has been disappointed by the winter sports industry's response to the climate change threat. 
"The industry hasn't done a good job on educating leaders on the raw science and hasn't made enough of a public statement on climate," he said. "It needs to ramp that up radically in the same way that the insurance industry has recognized climate change as an existential threat." 
Mr. Schendler said that the chief executive of another skiing resort was recently pressed on the issue and replied that while winters had definitely warmed, he did not know whether "this is a natural cycle or not." 
"The C.E.O. of a ski resort is fiscally obligated to know if it is caused by human actions or not," said Mr. Schendler, who accepts the scientific consensus that greenhouse gas emissions related to human activity are a leading cause.
Across the nation, ski resorts are increasingly trying to make up for a dearth of snowfall by manufacturing their own. But Ms. Burakowski pointed out that in the West, there is only so much snow that can be made before water scarcity becomes an issue and that snow-making, on which the average resort spends about $1 million every season, cuts deeply into profits. 
"The bitter irony here," Mr. Schendler said, "is that the response to climate change is to use a lot of energy and water in snow-making, which further cannibalizes the climate. Why is no one trying to address the root of the problem? Why not take a shot at saving the industry while there's still time rather than giving up and saying we'll just adapt while we can."
He suggested that at heart, skiers and snowboarders were optimists.
 "When we're at the top of a big ski slope full of hazards, we think, 'We can do this.' That's the approach we need to have with climate change -- here's an opportunity for us to do what we do best: get in there and tackle the impossible."

HEADLINE: Netflix in Hot Water Over Facebook Post

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: A controversial Facebook post by Netflix's chief executive shows how the Internet age has presented new challenges for defining what is "fair disclosure." | Diamondback Capital Management, which was caught up in the government's insider trading investigation, is shutting down. | Public shareholders don't always get a say in deals. | David Kostman, a former head of Lehman Brothers' global Internet group, recently returned to Wall Street -- serving up lunch at Goldman Sachs. 

 BODY:
NETFLIX IN HOT WATER OVER FACEBOOK POST | The Internet age has presented new challenges for defining what is "fair disclosure." Netflix and its chief executive, Reed Hastings, have been warned by regulators about a 43-word post that Mr. Hastings made on his Facebook page in July, in which he said subscribers had watched one billion hours of video the previous month. The Securities and Exchange Commission, concerned that the post may have violated a rule requiring a company to announce material information to all investors at the same time, warned that it may file civil claims or seek a cease-and-desist order.
Mr. Hastings announced the matter in a Facebook post, which he also filed with regulators. He challenged the agency's position, writing, "We think posting to over 200,000 people is very public, especially because many of my subscribers are reporters and bloggers." The so-called Wells notice issued by the S.E.C. gives the recipient a chance to object, and Mr. Hastings said he was "optimistic this can be cleared up quickly through the S.E.C.'s review process." 
The Regulation Fair Disclosure rule, known as Reg FD, "is intended to prevent the selective release of important information to some investors, depriving others of knowledge that would affect a company's stock," DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced notes. "But the interpretation of that rule may be changing in an age of blogs, Facebook and Twitter."
DIAMONDBACK SHUTTING DOWN | Diamondback Capital Management paid more than $9 million in fines and penalties in January, hoping it had put the government's insider-trading investigation behind it. But that didn't satisfy investors, who asked to withdraw $520 million in capital, or about 26 percent of assets. Now, the hedge fund has announced that it is shutting down.
"Rather than continue to manage investor capital while undertaking to restructure the firm to manage this reduced level of assets, we have decided that the most prudent course is to wind down and terminate the funds and return investor capital," said the letter signed by the Diamondback co-founders Richard Schimel and Larry Sapanski. Two former Diamondback employees, Todd Newman and Jesse Tortora, were charged with participating in an insider trading ring that prosecutors said produced $62 million in illegal profits. Mr. Tortora pleaded guilty and is currently a witness in the trial of Mr. Newman, which is in its third week in Federal District Court in Manhattan.
The insider trading crackdown is causing some hand-wringing in the art world, as the government focuses on Steven A. Cohen, the head of SAC Capital Advisors. Mr. Cohen, who has not been accused of wrongdoing but has been linked to questionable trades, was absent this week from Art Basel Miami Beach, where in the past he has been a prominent collector. Are art luminaries worried about the legal issues surrounding Mr. Cohen? "A quick survey of gallerists, advisers and collectors suggests it depends on whom you ask," The New York Times's David Segal writes.
WHEN SHAREHOLDERS ARE LEFT OUT | Public shareholders don't always get a say in deals, as illustrated by two recently announced transactions, the Starbucks Corporation's $620 million acquisition of Teavana Holdings, and Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold's $9 billion deal for Plains Exploration and Production and the McMoRan Exploration Company. Typically, a target company would be allowed to terminate a deal if shareholders vote it down. Steven M. Davidoff writes in the Deal Professor column: "Starbucks did allow Teavana to accept a higher bid up until the time the deal was approved by shareholders. The twist was that Andrew T. Mack, the chief executive and chairman of the board, and three other shareholders held 74 percent of Teavana. So on the day the acquisition agreement was signed, the four controlling shareholders executed a consent approving the merger."
In the Freeport deal, shareholders loudly protested. But, Mr. Davidoff writes, "Freeport shareholders will not be able to veto the transactions, and the company is stuck with them. The reason is that a buyer incorporated under Delaware law is only required to have a shareholder vote on an acquisition under limited circumstances. If the acquisition is for cash, then no shareholder vote is required."
ON THE AGENDA | 
The jobs report for November is out at 8:30 a.m. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect that 80,000 jobs were added and that the unemployment rate ticked up to 8 percent. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for December is out at 9:55 a.m. Cliff Asness of AQR Capital Management is on Bloomberg TV at 10 a.m. Jan Hatzius, Goldman Sachs's chief economist, is on CNBC at 10:30 a.m.
GRABBING A BITE WITH AN EX-LEHMAN BANKER | David Kostman, a former head of Lehman Brothers' global Internet group, recently returned to Wall Street - serving up lunch at Goldman Sachs. Mr. Kostman, the co-founder of the Mediterranean chain Nanoosh, is among a stable of local restaurant owners periodically invited to set up shop in Goldman's cafeteria. During a week in October, Nanoosh served hundreds of employees in the firm's Lower Manhattan headquarters. "A lot of the really senior people are friends of mine," said Mr. Kostman, 47. "They like to say the managing director from Lehman is serving them hummus." Big financial firms, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse, regularly have local chefs set up pop-up stations in their cafeterias.
APPLE TO BRING SOME PRODUCTION HOME | 
Facing pressure to create more jobs in its home market, Apple plans to produce some of its Mac computers in the United States. The chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said the company would invest $100 million in the effort. "I don't think we have a responsibility to create a certain kind of job," Mr. Cook told Bloomberg Businessweek. "But I think we do have a responsibility to create jobs."

HEADLINE: Mitch McConnell Objects to Himself. So Do We.

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Mitch McConnell takes senate absurdity to a new low. 

 BODY:
Does the United States Senate actually serve any purpose these days beyond providing material for Jon Stewart? Apparently not under Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader. 
You may recall that one day after the election of the nation's first African-American chief executive and commander in chief Mr. McConnell made it clear he planned to try to make Barack Obama a one-term president.
Obviously he failed at that, but he did turn the Senate into a mockery of a legislative body by using parliamentary rules written when Senators wore powdered wigs and brocaded coats. (At least they dressed better than the current ones.) Mr. McConnell and his Republican colleagues filibustered pretty much anything President Obama wanted, especially if it had to do with promoting economic recovery, making taxes fairer and putting the middle class back to work. 
Virtually every matter, no matter how routine, requires 60 votes in the Senate, enough to overcome not just a filibuster or actually these days the mere threat of one.
Yesterday, Mr. McConnell filibustered his own bill.

Here's how it happened: In the morning, Mr. McConnell went to Harry Reid, the Senate Majority Leader, and asked him to take a vote on a bill that would allow the president to raise the debt ceiling. That's the artificial limit imposed by Congress on how much money the government may borrow to make good on past debt. (Please note here: "imposed by Congress" and "past debt.")
Mr. McConnell's clever plan was that the Democrats would not be able to muster a regular majority to pass the bill, thus proving to the world (or at least the 18 people who still have the patience to pay attention to Congress) that the Democrats don't really want to end the pointless fight over the debt ceiling Mr. McConnell cooked up in 2011.
But Mr. Reid consulted with his caucus and found support for the bill, so he went to the floor, offered it and scheduled 20 minutes of debate before an up or down vote.
And that's when Mr. McConnell may have made Senate history. He rose in objection to his own bill. "Matters of this level of controversy always require 60 votes," he said. Using the Senate's phony politesse, he added that he wanted "my friend, the majority leader, to make it 60 votes."
Mr. Reid said no. "The republican leader objects to his own idea," he said. "We have a filibuster of his own bill."
Senator Dick Durbin, the Illinois Democrat who is the Majority Whip, was incredulous. "This may be a moment in Senate history, when a Senator made a proposal and when giving an opportunity for a vote on that proposal, filibustered his own proposal," he said.
In a classic understatement, he added: "It really calls into question whether or not this was the kind of offer that would be considered to be good faith."
Mr. Durbin said he would ask the Senate parliamentarian to look into whether or not a Senator had ever objected to his own bill before. No doubt that fellow has a lot of time on his hands, since there's no real opportunity for him to monitor the Senate when it is actually doing business.

HEADLINE: How to Save Egypt's Dying Chance at Democracy

BYLINE: DAVID ROHDE


HIGHLIGHT: If nothing changes, we are headed for a dark place in Egypt that we already know: an authoritarian leader, an America that merely seeks "stability," and an opposition that, in disgust, abstains from a troubled political process. 

 BODY:
NEW YORK - The return of protests, tanks and death to the streets of Cairo this week is harrowing. So is the power of the rampant conspiracy theories that cause both Muslim Brotherhood members and their secular opponents to sincerely believe that they are the defenders of Egypt's revolution. 
Criticisms of President Mohamed Morsi's power grab and rushed constitutional process are legitimate. So are complaints that the country's secular opposition is poorly organized, lacks majority support and refuses to compromise. 
Barring a surprising change in direction, Egypt's experiment with democracy seems to be headed toward failure. The country's flawed constitution will likely be ratified in a referendum on Dec. 15. A frustrated and distrustful opposition will boycott subsequent Parliamentary elections. Mr. Morsi will lead a "soft authoritarian" government similar to that of former President Hosni Mubarak. Small opposition parties will exist, but the Muslim Brotherhood's dominance of the state, politics and society will never be in doubt.
U.S. officials - ever eager for stability in the Middle East - will turn a blind eye and establish a "working relationship" with Mr. Morsi.
"I think the impulse of most American administrations is to show up in an Arab country and say, 'Take me to your leader,' " Nathan J. Brown, a George Washington University professor and leading expert on Egypt, told me in a bleak interview this week. "I don't think we have many alternatives. The United States is not in the position to back a military coup or the opposition."
Mr. Brown is correct. Yes, the United States has some economic leverage in Cairo, but in general America remains radioactive in post-Mubarak Egypt. After 40 years of the U.S. backing Egyptian strongmen who made peace with Israel, Washington is hugely mistrusted.
A September 2012 Gallup Poll found that 82 percent of Egyptians opposed the country's government accepting any economic aid from the United States. By comparison, 42 percent of Egyptians surveyed - roughly half that number - opposed the country's peace treaty with Israel.
For those who think more "American leadership" is the answer: a U.S.-backed military coup - which it is doubtful the U.S. could engineer - would radicalize Islamists across the region and be an enormous gift to Al Qaeda. Similarly, if Washington openly backs the country's secular opposition, those opponents will be viewed as American stooges and lose popular support.
"A much more effective strategy for the United States is to call for a dialogue between Morsi's government and the opposition behind closed doors," said Dalia Mogahed, the American scholar who conducted the Gallup survey. "The U.S. coming out publicly on the side of the opposition will be used against them."
The only small cause for hope is that Egypt's struggles are not unprecedented. Other countries have undergone agonizing and turbulent transitions as well. Thomas Carothers, an expert on transitions to democracy at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that what is occurring today in Egypt is typical when a long-disenfranchised group gains power. Distrustful and insular after years of struggles, it is often reluctant to share power and still views itself as deeply vulnerable.
Mr. Carothers said Egypt's struggle mirrors the difficult transition still under way in Bolivia. Seven years after Evo Morales was elected that country's first president of indigenous descent, a tense "fundamental rebalancing of political power" is still playing out in Bolivia. The country's traditional elite and the indigenous movement still struggle to trust each other and share power. Bigoted arguments that democracy does not work in the Arab world do not apply in Egypt.
"There is nothing particularly Arab about what is happening," Mr. Carothers said. "It's not an Islamist issue per se."
There is another international comparison that should give the Brotherhood pause, according to Mr. Carothers. South Africa's African National Congress gained a monopoly on power after the country's first post-apartheid elections in 1994. With no viable opposition, the ANC grew increasingly corrupt as opportunistic figures flocked to the only patronage show in town.
"The party just became a self-sustaining machine," Mr. Carothers said. "People start joining your party out of sheer opportunism."
That may not matter to the Brotherhood. Its fear of being forced from power it has finally attained may lead it to become the kind of governing party its members once loathed.
The stark picture painted by Shadi Hamid, the director of research at the Brookings Doha Center, in this excellent piece in Foreign Policy this week, may prove to be true. There may be no common vision in Egypt, as Mr. Hamid argues; there may be no consensus on what the Egyptian nation should be.
If there is a common ground, the surest way to reach it is for there to be more democracy in Egypt, not less. Yes, the flawed draft constitution is likely to be ratified on Dec. 15. But the opposition should not boycott the vote or subsequent legislative elections. 
In a best-case scenario, the no vote could reach as high as 30 percent, according to Mr. Brown, the George Washington University professor. The opposition could then run in subsequent legislative elections. It would not win a majority, but perhaps it would win enough seats to be a viable opposition to the Brotherhood. Two groups that loathe each other would be forced to sit in Parliament together. 
Time and a desire to win elections might make them compromise and save Egypt's fading chances at democracy.

HEADLINE: European Banks Thriving As Investor Fears Ease

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
THE European bank crisis was one of the major worries of 2012. There were forecasts that the euro zone would break up, that various countries would default on their debts and that undercapitalized banks would fail because national governments could not afford to keep them alive. 
The bank crisis is not yet resolved, but it ''appears to have been put on the back burner of investor concerns,'' Jeffrey Yale Rubin and Kevin Pleines of Birinyi Associates said in a research bulletin sent to clients this week.
The accompanying charts show what has happened to the share prices of an index of euro zone bank stocks, and to each of the 28 members in the index, since June 30. In early July, the index kept falling, but by late in the month it turned around. Anyone who bought all the banks at the end of June is up by about 25 percent. Anyone with the good fortune to buy at the exact bottom has a profit of about half the money invested.
The bank stocks have outperformed other European stocks and they have outperformed American bank stocks, although the shares of most American banks also have risen.
The reasons for the relaxation of investor fears are simple enough. There is a growing confidence that euro zone institutions will succeed in their support efforts. Finance ministers are still arguing about the details of a single regulator for banks throughout the zone, but the European Central Bank's promise to lend money to banks that need it is widely accepted, and investors believe that Germany will put up whatever money is needed to keep the euro zone from breaking up.
Troubled governments like Italy and Spain are still paying much more than Germany to borrow, but their rates have fallen. Costs have declined even in Portugal, which is in the weakest position of countries other than Greece. The French banks led the way up in late 2012, but even the price of Banco Espirito, a Portuguese bank, has soared by about half since midyear. There are still major concerns about troubled Spanish banks, and two of those join an Italian institution in being the only stock market losers over the period. But the National Bank of Greece managed a small gain.
None of this means that those banks have served long-term shareholders well. Only one of them, a Finnish institution, has a share price higher than it did at the end of 2007, before the financial crisis.
But, for now at least, investors seem to have growing confidence that the banks will survive. Given the fears of a few months ago, that is reason for celebration.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Is the Banking Crisis Over? For much of this year, the fate of Europe's banks appeared to be a critical issue. But since the European Central Bank took steps to assure the banks could borrow money, and it became clear that Germany was not willing to allow the euro zone to break up, euro zone bank stocks have been among the best investments around.

HEADLINE: Justices To Take Up Generic Drug Case

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court said on Friday that it would decide whether a pharmaceutical company should be allowed to pay a competitor millions of dollars to keep a generic copy of a best-selling drug off the market.
The case could settle a decade-long battle between federal regulators, who say the deals violate antitrust law, and the pharmaceutical industry, which contends that they are really just settlements of disputes over patents that protect the billions of dollars they pour into research and development. 
Three separate federal circuit courts of appeal have ruled over the last decade that the deals were allowable. But in July a federal appeals court in Philadelphia -- which covers the territory where many big drug makers are based -- said the arrangements were anticompetitive.
Both sides in the case supported the petition for the Supreme Court to decide the case, each arguing that the conflicting appeals court decisions would inject uncertainty into their operations.
By keeping lower-priced generic drugs off the market, drug companies are able to charge higher prices than they otherwise could. Last year, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that a Senate bill to outlaw those payments would lower drug costs in the United States by $11 billion and would save the federal government $4.8 billion over 10 years.
Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican who co-sponsored the Senate bill, which never came to the floor for a vote, praised the decision.
The Federal Trade Commission first filed the suit in question in 2009. Jon Leibowitz, chairman of the F.T.C., said, ''These pay-for-delay deals are win-win for the drug companies, but big losers for U.S. consumers and taxpayers.''
Generic drug makers say that the payments preserve a system that has saved American consumers hundreds of billions of dollars.
''This case could determine how an entire industry does business because it would dramatically affect the economics of each decision to introduce a new generic drug,'' Ralph G. Neas, president of the Generic Pharmaceutical Association, said in a statement. ''The current industry paradigm of challenging patents on branded drugs in order to bring new generics to market as soon as possible has produced $1.06 trillion in savings over the past 10 years.''
The case will review a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, based in Atlanta, which in the spring ruled in favor of the drug makers, Watson Pharmaceuticals and Solvay Pharmaceuticals. Watson had applied for federal approval to sell a generic version of AndroGel, a testosterone replacement drug made by Solvay.
While courts have long held that paying a competitor to stay off the market creates unfair competition, the pharmaceuticals case is different because it involves patents, whose essential purpose is to prevent competition.
When a generic manufacturer seeks approval to market a copy of a brand-name drug, it also often files a lawsuit challenging a patent that the drug's originator says prevents competition.
Last year, for the third time since 2003, the 11th Circuit upheld the agreements as long as the allegedly anticompetitive behavior that results -- in this case, keeping the generic drug off the market -- is the same thing that would take place if the brand-name company's patent were upheld.
Two other federal circuit courts, the Second Circuit and the Federal Circuit, have ruled similarly. But in July, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals said that those arrangements were anticompetitive on their face and violated antitrust law.
The agreements are also affected by a peculiar condition in the law that legalized generic competition for prescription drugs. That law, known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, gives a 180-day period of exclusivity to the first generic drug maker to file for approval of a generic copy and to file a lawsuit challenging the brand-name drug's patent.
Brand-name drug companies have taken advantage of that law, finding that they can settle the patent suit by getting the generic company to agree to stay out of the market for a period of time. Because that generic company also has exclusivity rights, no other generic companies can enter the market.
Michael A. Carrier, a professor at Rutgers School of Law-Camden, said that while there were provisions in the law under which a generic company could forfeit that exclusivity, ''they really are toothless in practice.''
One wild card could still prevent the Supreme Court from definitively settling the question. In granting the petition to hear the case, the Supreme Court said that Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. recused himself, taking no part in the consideration or decision.
That opens the possibility that a 4-4 decision could result, upholding the lower court case that went against the F.T.C. and in favor of the drug makers. But it would leave the broader question for another day.
The case is Federal Trade Commission v. Watson Pharmaceuticals et al, No. 12-416.

HEADLINE: Consumer Borrowing Rises to $2.75 Trillion

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer debt rose to a record in October as Americans used their credit cards more often and borrowed more to attend school and buy cars, the Federal Reserve said on Friday. 
The agency said consumers increased their borrowing by $14.2 billion in October from September. Total borrowing rose to a record $2.75 trillion.
Borrowing in the category that covers autos and student loans increased by $10.8 billion. Borrowing on credit cards rose by $3.4 billion, only the second monthly increase in the last five months.
The increase in borrowing came in a month when Americans cut back on consumer spending, reflecting in part disruptions from Hurricane Sandy.
Many consumers may also have scaled back because of fears about the automatic tax increases and spending cuts that will take effect in January if Congress and the Obama administration fail to reach a budget deal by then.
Consumer spending drives about 70 percent of the nation's economic activity.
Economists think that it could bounce back. But the underlying trend remains weak because with unemployment remaining high, households don't have the income to spend.
Consumers are also signaling concern. A survey of consumer sentiment, the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan survey, fell sharply in December, economists noted, partly over worries that taxes could rise next year.
Many consumers have been reluctant to build up credit card debt, which typically carries steeper interest rates than other loans.
Credit card use has fallen sharply since the 2008 credit crisis. Four years ago, Americans had $1.03 trillion in credit card debt. In October, that figure was 17 percent lower.
During the same period, student loan debt rose. The category that includes auto and student loans is 22 percent higher than in July 2008. That reflects in part the decision by many Americans who have lost jobs to return to school to get training for new careers.

HEADLINE: An Art World Gathering, Divided by Money

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN

 BODY:
MIAMI -- Mera Rubell was taking time out from greeting the hundreds of visitors at her family's sprawling contemporary art center here to vent.
''It's the height of arrogance to dismiss -- -- ,'' she began.
Jason, her son, interrupted: ''It's arrogance. It's a completely uninteresting story.''
For the moment her husband, Don, had given up on trying to get a word in.
The Rubells, deans of Miami's bustling art scene, were pushing back against a chorus of complaints that has been growing louder in the weeks leading up to Art Basel Miami Beach, the annual art pilgrimage that began Wednesday and ends Sunday. 
Prominent art writers and critics, including Sarah Thornton, Felix Salmon, Will Gompertz and Dave Hickey, have been attacking the art world, arguing that the staggering sums of money being spent on works are distorting judgments about art and undermining its long-term cultural significance.
''Money talks loudly and easily drowns out other meanings,'' Ms. Thornton wrote in TAR magazine in a recent article, ''Top 10 Reasons NOT to Write About the Art Market.''
In its special edition for the opening day of the fair, The Art Newspaper asked whether ''the art world is facing a crisis of values'' because of the ''pernicious influence of the market on art.''
And in the eyes of many critics, Art Basel Miami Beach -- or what Simon Doonan, writing in Slate last week, labeled a ''promo-party cheese-fest'' -- has become a symbol of everything that's wrong with the art market. The fair's extraordinary success in just over a decade, and its celebration of wretched excess, have triggered a backlash.
But the Rubells, along with a growing number of other prominent collectors, art dealers and curators, are having none of it. The backlash against the backlash has begun.
''The market supports artists,'' Jason Rubell said. Given the limited amount of government support for the arts, he added, ''it's an industry that without commerce doesn't exist. What do people want -- to go back to the recession?''
Ms. Rubell was annoyed that critics seemed to ignore the social, economic and cultural transformation of Miami that the fair and collectors like her have helped bring about. She noted that the Rubells' 45,000-square-foot art center -- where one huge gallery is now filled with works by Oscar Murillo, a 26-year-old Colombian immigrant who lived with and was supported by the Rubells while he created dozens of mural-sized canvases -- used to be a Drug Enforcement Administration storage center.
Outside, in the center's courtyard, visitors like Martha Stewart admired the French artist Bernar Venet's collaboration with Bugatti, the superluxury sports car brand, on a one-of-a-kind Veyron Grand Sport Venet car (a price hasn't been set, a Bugatti spokeswoman said, but will undoubtedly be in ''the higher end of the millions'').
''I'm grateful to Bugatti, Perrier, Bank of America and other companies,'' Ms. Rubell declared. ''Their support helps facilitate quality programs and opens exhibits like this'' -- the Murillo show -- ''to the public.''
In Miami Beach, at the main fair, the consumer-oriented glitter abounds this week: coffee carts with $20-a-glass Ruinart Champagne; Davidoff cigar rollers; BMW's artist-designed cars; and Takashi Murakami's $70,000-and-up commissioned portraits. One could almost imagine that the Barbara Kruger work on display at L&M gallery -- a super-sized sign reading ''Greedy'' on one line and an unprintable expletive on the next -- had an invisible subtitle telling the wealthy V.I.P.'s who had come to shop, ''I'm Talking to You -- Yeah, You!''
Of course, rich patrons have always supported artists, Don Rubell pointed out, from the pharaohs to the Medicis. Today, multimillion-dollar sales represent only a silk-thin layer of a deeply varied and thriving art market. The art world, Mr. Rubell asserted, is ''actually becoming more democratic.''
''There's 20 ancillary fairs'' in addition to the high-end main event of Art Basel, he said. ''Whatever amount of money you have in your pocket, you can enter this magical world of art.''
The notion that the art market contains multitudes is one with which Marc Glimcher, part of the family dynasty that runs the Pace Gallery, said he agreed.
Sure, he said, there are examples of galleries turning into distribution networks for rich collectors who want what their friends -- or rivals -- have. It used to be that an artist or gallery would immediately do the opposite of what people were clamoring for, but now, he said, ''every foyer in New York City'' needs the same painting.
But Mr. Glimcher maintained that there were essentially as many markets as there were individual works of art and that more people than ever before had developed an appreciation for art.
The art market ''isn't like a child we're all bringing up,'' he said, summarizing some of the points he made in a public talk at the fair on Thursday. Rather, he compared it to the African savanna, where lions eat antelopes and every beast is looking for a niche of its own in which to survive.
In another aisle on the fair floor, the New York dealer Fergus McCaffrey said he thought that concerns about the future of art were overwrought. ''Miami is a bling-bling kind of place, and there's a lot of money,'' he said, ''but real art is happening.''
Still, many in the art world worry that even if superpowered collectors play a useful role in the market, they also exert a disproportionate influence on it. Their particular tastes, however idiosyncratic, can cause a middling artist to be elevated and a great one to be neglected, that argument goes.
''Everything is consumption, and the galleries are very hungry for money,'' said Magda Baltoyanni, a dealer from Greece, while resting for a moment in the collectors lounge. ''Galleries run the game now, not the museums.''
But powerful collectors, from Eli Broad to Rosa de la Cruz, resisted this notion. ''I don't consider myself a tastemaker,'' said Mr. Broad, who founded a new museum at Michigan State University and is opening another in downtown Los Angeles in 2014, and whose foundation regularly donates and lends some of its 1,800-work collection to hundreds of museums. Mr. Broad was at No. 10 this year in Art + Auction magazine's list of the art world's most powerful people, which was released on the fair's opening day.
Enno Scholma, chairman of the Museum Ludwig in Cologne, said he rooted for ambitious collectors like Mr. Broad.
''Here, there is an incredibly choosy public that is committed to buying at the top -- we need them for the art market to work,'' he said. He added that he loved the bravado of the collectors who come to Miami Beach.
''They're not sissies,'' he said, and ''that is essential.''

HEADLINE: Under the Skin of Bernini's Angels

BYLINE: By SOUREN MELIKIAN

 BODY:
NEW YORK -- The obvious question was never asked until now. No one among the specialists diligently studying 17th-century Baroque art had thought of researching just how sculptors proceeded when carving their marble statues or creating bronzes.
Three men pooled the resources of art history, connoisseur expertise and science techniques to do just that in the book that comes with the show ''Bernini: Sculpting in Clay'' on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art through Jan. 6. They are C.D. Dickerson III, curator of European art at the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth; Anthony Sigel, conservator of objects and sculpture at the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies at the Harvard Art Museums; and Ian Wardropper, the former chairman of the department of European sculpture and decorative arts at the Met, which he left to become the director of the Frick Museum of Art.
The three specialists studied 52 models that served as preliminary steps to the execution of some of Bernini's most famous works. These range from the life-size marble of Saint Jerome in the Siena Cathedral to the larger than life-size angels that greet visitors crossing the Tiber River on the Ponte Sant'Angelo on their way to the Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome. 
Miraculously, 49 of the 52 fragile models molded in clay were allowed to travel to New York where they make up the core of a sensational art show. Drawings by Bernini borrowed from institutions scattered around Europe and the United States have been brought to bear upon the investigation. Crucially, the models have been subjected to systematic X-radiography and fingerprint analysis, as in some kind of police cold case.
The exhibition inspired by the work of the three scholars and, most importantly, the book that tells their story break entirely new ground.
With self-effacing modesty, Mr. Dickerson underlines the importance of the thousands of incredibly detailed photographs and X-rays taken under Mr. Sigel's direction: ''Through Sigel's analysis, we gain an unprecedentedly intimate view of how Bernini modeled. We can stand with him as he initially massed the clay and roughed out the forms ... Not only his techniques are illuminated but also aspects of his character. The models reveal that he was highly pragmatic, that he prized efficiency, and that he allowed himself the occasional pause to marvel at his own extraordinary gifts as a modeler.''
As Andrea Bacchi sees it in a chapter titled ''The roles of Terracotta Models in Bernini's Workshop,'' there were three types of models. Only one was exclusively made by Bernini. This is the kind of impressionistic study quickly molded in clay or bozzetto that gave a material form to the first vision that flashed through the sculptor's mind. Alone among 17th-century sculptors, Bernini produced such bozzetti in groups. This makes them the three-dimensional equivalent of the multiple sketches that some painters would jot down before drawing the final composition.
The sculptor then went on to the second stage, the preparation of the small-scale elaborate models in terra cotta called, indeed, ''modelli.'' Carving in marble or casting bronze was the third and last stage. And here is what makes the show fascinating to non-specialists. There is an aesthetic abyss between the initial clay sketches or bozzetti, and the finished sculptures, as if they were the work of artists separated in time and distance, sharing nothing in common.
Consider some of the earliest surviving bozzetti. One of these was done in 1630 or 1631 as a first step toward the marble of a female allegory in high relief that is perched above the slab commemorating Pope Urban VIII on the entrance wall to Santa Maria in Aracoeli. The female figure is clad in ancient Roman drapes.
In the terra cotta, the folds are rendered by grooves nervously pressed in clay. The expressive face conveys extreme bitterness, with its thin lips tightly pressed. The face, tilted downward, has no eyes as if the character was blind. The larger -than-life-size marble to be seen on the entrance wall to Santa Maria in Arcoeli is a far cry from this expressionistic terra cotta, which is as bold as the work of avant-garde artists of the late 19th century. The marble woman looks up, not down, with a self-confident, almost imperious expression.
True, the carving of that marble was entrusted by Bernini to an assistant, Andrea Bolgi.
However, there can be no doubt that the finished sculpture met with the famous sculptor's approval. Nothing could be more puzzling than the lack of any artistic common ground between the expressionism of the figure dreamed up in terra cotta by Bernini himself and the bland triumphalism of the sculpture created by Bolgi, presumably according to the master's instructions.
A similar discrepancy is evident between the marble of the ''Angel With the Crown of Thorns'' that stands on the Ponte Sant'Angelo in Rome and the terra cotta loaned by the Louvre, or the marble ''Angel with the Superscription'' on the same bridge and the sculptor's first thought molded in clay.
The bozzetto for the ''Angel with the Crown of Thorns'' conveys sorrow. The furrows are briefly indicated on the brow, the eyes are cast down and the lips are open in lamentation. By contrast, the marble figure, carefully finished and polished, glowers with operatic grandiloquence, bereft of its dramatic punch.
The expressiveness of the terra cotta was not the result of some flight into whimsy. This is the last of the Roman master's monumental endeavors and he thought long and hard about it, making more preliminary studies for it than for any other sculpture.
Other terra-cotta bozzetti lack the expressionistic touch. A sketch molded with a view to carving the ''Angel With Superscription'' on loan from the Museo Nazionale del Palazzo di Venezia has an enigmatic smile that sends back an echo to Leonardo's angel in ''The Annunciation.'' But the features are briskly molded -- you almost feel the thumb leaving its imprint as it quickly runs over the clay. The outcome is one of the boldest masterpieces of 17th-century sculpture.
Other bozzetti for the ''Angel with the Superscription'' do not have the Leonardesque smile. The Kimbell Art Museum versionis done with astonishing freedom in an advanced modernist style. Nothing among the finished marble sculptures carved by Bernini or his assistants comes anywhere near the aesthetic vision that the Kimbell sketch reveals. Clearly, something got lost in the marble translation of Bernini's first flash of inspiration.
Even elaborate preliminary terra-cotta sketches retain an energy that somehow vanishes from the marbles.
The Hermitage terra cotta for the equestrian monument honoring the memory of Constantine the Great who established Christianity as a state religion in 313 A.D. is carried by a forward thrust that is no longer perceptible in the marble monument erected in 1670.
The Hermitage terra cotta was molded earlier, probably around 1662, but this contrast between the formality of the marble and the compelling vigor of the terra cotta recurs everywhere. A blatant case concerning portraiture is that of the ''Four Members of the Cornaro Family'' from the Fogg Museum. The heads molded separately were added to the low-relief torsos. They too are executed with a remarkable economy of means, revealing a spartan strain in Bernini entirely at odds with his official art.
An even greater contrast is to be found between the modernity of Bernini's inspiration when molding terra-cotta figures and the finished bronze statues based on these. A striking example is offered by the Altar of the Blessed Sacrament in Saint Peter's Basilica, completed in 1674. The bronze kneeling angel bears little resemblance to the model. It could be the work of another artist.
As the viewer leaves the show and the reader closes the book, a far bigger question than those concerning the sculptor's methods of creating marble or bronzes springs to mind. How does an artist's thinking move from his initial idea to the final stage of his work?
That one also awaits proper investigation.

HEADLINE: Corporate Money Allowed For Inaugural Donations

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama will accept unlimited donations from corporations -- but no money from lobbyists or political action committees -- to finance his 2013 inaugural festivities, a spokeswoman for his inaugural committee said Friday.
The committee also said the activities surrounding Mr. Obama's inauguration would be smaller in scope than four years ago; the White House is mindful of the state of the economy and does not want a show of opulence.
The panel did not release a schedule. But officials told donors during a conference call on Friday afternoon that there would be just three official inaugural balls -- a candlelight ball for members of Mr. Obama's national finance committee, a military ball and a large presidential ball -- down from 10 official balls in 2009, according to one person who listened to the call. 
The committee later sent donors a formal invitation detailing access to various reception and parties depending on how much they contribute. The most exclusive access will be reserved for individuals who contribute $250,000 or more and institutions that contribute $1 million or more.
The decision to accept corporate money reverses Mr. Obama's policy from 2009, when he refused corporate donations and capped individual donations at $50,000 per person or $100,000 per couple. Mr. Obama also barred corporations from helping finance this year's Democratic National Convention.
But after the most expensive campaign in presidential history -- Mr. Obama, the Democratic National Committee and the party's joint fund-raising efforts took in $1.14 billion -- many of the president's contributors are feeling worn out, and the committee concluded that it would be difficult to raise the tens of millions of dollars it needed for the parade, inaugural balls and other events.
''Our goal is to make sure that we will meet the fund-raising requirements for this civic event after the most expensive presidential campaign in history,'' the spokeswoman, Addie Whisenant, said in a statement, adding that donors' names would be posted on a Web site ''to ensure continued transparency.''
The question of whether the Presidential Inaugural Committee would accept corporate money has been a thorny one for Mr. Obama. Companies that donate money may have business before the White House, raising questions of conflict of interest. Committee officials said its lawyers would vet each donor, and those with conflicts would not be permitted to give.
But government watchdog groups sharply criticized the decision and accused Mr. Obama of abandoning his principles. ''It's very disappointing,'' said Robert Weissman, president of the advocacy group Public Citizen, which wrote to Mr. Obama last month urging him to reject corporate money. ''There's no corporation which has no conflict of interest. It's really a terrible reversal of the decision they made in 2009.''
Committee officials counter that Mr. Obama is using standards adopted by civic institutions that take corporate money, including museums, philanthropic groups and service organizations like the Red Cross.
The committee has laid down some guidelines for the kind of corporate money it will accept, an official said. Corporations that accepted money from the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program, used to rescue the financial system during the economic meltdown of 2008 and 2009, will not be able to donate unless they have paid back the TARP money.
In addition, the committee said it would not enter into any sponsorship arrangements with companies. And in accordance with laws governing contributions to an inaugural committee, the panel will not accept money from foreign individuals or corporations.
Presidents rely on a mix of public and private funds to pay for their inaugurations. Taxpayers pay the bill for security and for events at the Capitol -- the swearing in-ceremony and traditional inaugural luncheon -- but private money pays for everything else. In 2009, Mr. Obama raised $53 million for his first inauguration, which stretched over a four-day weekend.
Donors are typically rewarded with access to exclusive events; on Friday afternoon's conference call, they were told that depending on their level of contribution, donors might be invited to ''benefactor brunches'' at the White House on Jan. 17 and 18.
In 2009, donors who contributed $10,000 or more were rewarded with V.I.P. tickets to the swearing-in ceremony, balls and other events, like a parade-watching party at a restaurant along the route and a concert for children at the Verizon Center. Those who contributed $50,000 or more were invited to events including black-tie dinners the night before the inauguration.
Mr. Obama's 2009 inauguration was a star-studded event that brought 1.8 million people to Washington, more than three times the typical inaugural crowd. Some of the music industry's biggest celebrities -- Bruce Springsteen, Bono and Beyoncé among them -- rocked the National Mall the day before Mr. Obama took his oath.
The 2013 crowd is likely to be much smaller, and the committee has not said whether there will be a concert this time. But Mr. Obama has already announced that he will follow a practice he established four years ago by making Jan. 19, the day before his swearing-in, a national day of service.

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Edges Down To 4-Year Low

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Despite fears of a slowdown caused by gridlock in Washington, the economic recovery moved forward at a steady pace in November, pushing unemployment to its lowest level in four years.
The nation's employers added 146,000 jobs last month, in line with the average of 151,000 a month in 2012. But the pace was a substantial improvement from earlier this year, when job growth slowed sharply and many observers feared a double-dip recession.
The biggest surprise was that Hurricane Sandy created so little drag. Economists had estimated that only 86,000 jobs would be added in November, a decline from October largely because of the storm. 
According to the monthly snapshot from the Labor Department, released on Friday, the nation's unemployment rate dropped to 7.7 percent last month from 7.9 percent in October. Economists cautioned that this bit of seeming good news was the result of a shrinking labor force, rather than the addition of jobs. At the current pace of job creation, the unemployment rate will gradually decline to 7.1 percent by December 2013, said Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays Capital.
''The underlying trend in unemployment is downward, and that's what we continued to see in the November figures,'' Mr. Maki said. ''Over the past year, unemployment has fallen a full percentage point and is now down 2.3 percentage points from its high in 2009.''
Many economists worry that job creation will slow markedly, however, if President Obama and Congressional Republicans cannot agree on a plan to reduce the deficit by the end of the year, leading to more than $600 billion in government spending cuts and automatic tax increases in 2013. The Congressional Budget Office, as well as many private economists, warn that this path will lead to a recession in the first half of 2013 and push unemployment back up.
While it is encouraging that businesses seem to be hiring in spite of the uncertainty in Washington, that could change quickly, said Ethan Harris, co-head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
''If the budget impasse can't be resolved this month, it's likely that jobs growth will weaken early next year,'' he said. ''The fiscal cliff is a very dangerous game.''
Even if both sides in Washington come up with a short-term solution on the budget, as many observers expect, the pace of job growth remains well below what is needed to push wages substantially higher or to significantly reduce the broadest measure of unemployment anytime soon. Factoring in people seeking work, as well as those who want jobs but have stopped looking and those forced to take part-time jobs because full-time employment was not available, the broad unemployment gauge dipped to 14.4 percent in November from 14.6 percent in October.
Average hourly earnings rose 0.2 percent in November, and are up about 1.7 percent from a year earlier -- about half the annual rate of growth seen in 2007 before the recession hit, when unemployment was below 5 percent.
The size of the labor force, according to a household survey separate from the one showing how many jobs were added by businesses and government, shrank by 350,000 in November. Part of that drop can be explained by the number of baby boomers deciding to retire, but a significant number of workers remain discouraged, prompting them to drop out of the job hunt.
As a result, the labor participation rate, which represents the portion of the adult population that is either employed or actively looking for work, remains low by historical standards, said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist for IHS Global Insight.
At 63.6 percent in November, Mr. Gault said, this measure is near the low point in this economic cycle.
''We're not at the point in which the jobs market is strong enough to pull discouraged workers back into the labor market,'' he said. Although job growth in November exceeded expectations, the Labor Department revised downward its figures for the preceding months. For September, the Labor Department said the economy created 132,000 jobs, down from an earlier estimate of 148,000, and the figure for October was lowered to 138,000 from 171,000.
Highlighting just how vulnerable the economy remains, a widely followed measure of how likely consumers were to make purchases showed a marked drop. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer confidence for early December, released on Friday, fell to 74.5, down from 82.7 in November.
That was the lowest since August. Bricklin Dwyer, an economist with BNP Paribas, attributed the decline to the showdown in Washington over the budget.
''The deterioration in consumers' future expectations was probably related to increased concerns relating to the political theater surrounding the 'fiscal cliff' negotiations,'' he wrote in a report Friday.
One notable point of weakness in the latest jobs report was the manufacturing sector, which lost 7,000 jobs in November. Demand for goods from Europe and other overseas markets has softened recently, and some manufacturing companies have held up spending amid the standoff in Washington.
Employment in the construction sector fell by 20,000 last month -- one hint of Hurricane Sandy's impact, economists said. However, construction employment could pick up in December as homeowners rebuild in the Northeast and as the housing sector continues to regain ground nationwide.
Retailers added 53,000 jobs last month, more than triple the typical monthly rate in the last year. Much of that increase was to accommodate holiday shoppers, and Julia Coronado, chief North American economist at BNP Paribas, suggested the early start of sales promotions and an early Thanksgiving may have encouraged stores to hire workers more quickly than usual in November.
''We may see less of a gain in retail in December,'' she said. ''This was a very, very strong number that probably won't persist.''
Among the unemployed, the percentage of people who have been out of a job for more than 27 weeks remains high but came down slightly in November, falling to 40.1 percent from 40.6 percent a month before.
Younger workers, who have had significantly higher rates of unemployment than older workers since the recession, also seem to have done a bit better in November. According to seasonally adjusted figures in the household survey, unemployment among workers aged 20 to 24 fell to 12.7 percent in November from 13.2 percent in October, and among 25- to 34-year-olds it fell to 7.9 percent from 8.3 percent.
While substantially lower, the unemployment rate among workers 55 and older held steady at 5.8 percent.

HEADLINE: Strapped District Plans To Add Online Classes

BYLINE: By JESS BIDGOOD

 BODY:
MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Budget cuts have eliminated about 95 full-time teachers from the school district here over the past year, swelling class sizes and prompting parents to cry foul.
''We had students sitting on the floor with a clipboard,'' said Jim O'Connell, the president of the Parent-Teacher Organization at Hillside Middle School. ''It's one degree separated from a 1700s classroom with chalk and a slate.''
Officials, seeking an overhaul, began to wonder if a 21st-century technology might help allay their struggles: having some students take courses online during the school day, without a teacher physically present. 
But a plan to institute ''blended learning labs,'' which allow students to do just that, is stoking concern among parents and teachers. Some doubt the efficacy of online learning. Others say the proposed solution barely scratches the surface of systemic problems here.
''It's smoke and mirrors; it's a high-tech baby sitter,'' said David Fischer, a community college instructor who has two children set to attend Central High School next year.
The plan, which Superintendent Thomas J. Brennan Jr. presented to the district's school board last month, would expand the district's current use of New Hampshire's online charter school, the Virtual Learning Academy, by putting a virtual learning lab in each of the district's three high schools, allowing students to take courses there during the school day under the supervision of a ''facilitator'' who would be present in the lab. It would also add a remote classroom to each high school, where students in undersubscribed courses could participate in classes taught at one of the other schools via an interactive monitor, and expand the school's collaboration with the University of New Hampshire at Manchester.
In an interview, Dr. Brennan said class-size issues were not the main motivation for the project, which he hopes will expand student opportunity and increase technology literacy among pupils and staff alike. But it could, he said, provide a new alternative for students in oversubscribed classes without the schools' having to hire part-time teachers to pick up extra course sections.
''It deals with the reality of budgets and the limited resources we have, and the need for students and school districts to catch up with technology,'' Dr. Brennan said of the plan. ''I believe the class sizes will diminish, and it will allow more opportunities for teachers to work with students that are struggling.''
With more than 15,000 students, Manchester is the largest school district in the state, serving about 1 in 12 of its public school students, district officials say. Once, the city drew money from the large business tax base of its mill economy, now defunct. Since then, the district's growth has not kept up with its tax revenues, and Manchester now has some of the state's lowest per-pupil spending, at $10,283.77 per student (the state average is $13,159.15). Some frustrated school officials and parents also blame underfinancing on a tax cap, finalized last year, that limits what the city can spend.
The question of underfinancing and overcrowding drove the school board in tiny Candia, N.H., to request a face-to-face meeting with Manchester's school board late last month. Candia has its own public schools through eighth grade, but it contracts with Manchester to send its students to their Central High School.
Assistant Superintendent Michael Tursi presented the new plan, including the learning labs, to Candia's board, but it was unimpressed. ''This is not a solution,'' said Candia's superintendent, Charles P. Littlefield, to applause. Later, he added, ''I'd like to think I'm a 21st-century superintendent, but I'm not sure anything substitutes for high-quality interaction between teachers and students.''
Parents bristled at the idea that online learning could begin to close the gap they see in the schools. ''What you're seeing in Manchester is a postage stamp, a fig leaf, to cover the fact that politicians in our city will not increase taxes to fund our schools,'' said Mr. O'Connell, who is president of an advocacy group called Citizens for Manchester Schools.
Yet the use of online learning in high schools is growing nationwide; a 2008 survey by the Sloan Consortium, an organization that advocates for online learning, estimated that 1.3 million high school students took an online course during that academic year, and the number is likely to have grown since. Some states, like Florida, require students to take an online course to graduate.
Steve Kossakoski, the chief executive of the Virtual Learning Academy, New Hampshire's online charter school, said that the program was often used for accelerated or remedial courses or increased flexibility, but that he did not know of schools using his program to ease overcrowding.
But Crystal Howard, of Florida Virtual School, said school districts like Miami-Dade, one of the nation's biggest, did look to online learning when a 2002 voter referendum that went fully into effect in 2010 limited class sizes statewide. ''When they said that there would be a mandatory class size and they could only have a certain number of students in the classroom, we did become a solution,'' Ms. Howard said.
Officials in Manchester expect to spend about $80,000 on the blended and remote classrooms, which they aim to begin putting in place next semester.
''I don't want people to think we're trying to divert resources so that we don't have to hire teachers,'' Dr. Brennan said. ''The intent is to maximize the learning and to minimize the financial impact on Manchester School District.''

HEADLINE: Scrooge. The Grinch. Congress.

 BODY:
Hurricane Sandy didn't suppress job growth in November by as much as economists had expected. But the jobs report, released on Friday, offers plenty of bad signs, and no reason to believe the picture will improve unless Congress starts dealing with high unemployment and the needs of those already out of work for months. 
The job market is not getting better or, worse, is slowing down. In recent months, it had appeared that the economy was beginning to produce jobs at a pace of more than 170,000 a month. But in November, only 146,000 jobs were created, and tallies for September and October were revised downward, for an average monthly gain in those months of only 139,000 jobs.
The labor force contracted in November, after expanding in September and October. While the unemployment rate fell to 7.7 percent last month, down from 8.7 in November 2011, about half of that improvement is the result of people leaving the work force. Of course, the situation was even worse in 2009 and 2010, when nearly all of the improvement in the jobless rate was from a shrinking labor force. Over all, the job market is still very weak, with an estimated 3.9 million people having either dropped out of or never entered the work force after leaving school, on top of 12 million people who are officially unemployed and 8.2 million who are stuck in part-time jobs.
Rather than address unemployment with job-creation measures, Congress is poised to end what little aid is offered. Federal unemployment benefits, which average $290 a week and typically kick in after 26 weeks of state-based benefits, will expire at the end of 2012. If Congress does not extend them, two million workers will be cut off between Christmas and New Year's, and nearly one million more will have no federal program to turn to when their state benefits run out in the first quarter of 2013.
In total, over five million people who would otherwise qualify for federal benefits in 2013 will find that such benefits no longer exist. That would be unconscionable at a time when 40 percent of all jobless workers have been unemployed for more than six months, many of them older workers. It also would be foolish, because the abrupt withdrawal of benefits would depress consumer demand, leading to the loss of an estimated 400,000 jobs.
Federal jobless benefits could be extended as part of the fiscal cliff negotiations or as a stand-alone measure. Unfortunately, Republicans have consistently balked at extending the program and have grown accustomed to holding an extension hostage to their demands for tax cuts or other measures. Is it too much to ask that they not leave town -- especially for Christmas -- without first providing for unemployed Americans?

HEADLINE: Storm Sirens' Last Wail

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
TILLAMOOK, Ore. -- The tsunami sirens of Tillamook County, posted along the rocky beachfront on this stretch of the earthquake-prone Pacific coast, are a reassuring presence to many residents and visitors. The 30-odd pole-mounted speakers, simple and dated in their 1960s technology of transistors and circuit boards, carry an echo of cold war civil defense, suggesting that people have a kind of handle on responding to the earth's potential violence from a killer wave.
But now a decision by the County Commission to dismantle and forever silence the sirens on Jan. 1 has opened up a fault line of its own, as questions of hard science and geology -- about the big quake that scientists say will surely strike here one day -- mix with emotion and angst about how human beings and emergency managers prepare for, or deny, that eventuality. 
What further complicates the story is money. In a hard-pressed county that is still struggling in the aftermath of the recession and tax-revenue declines, managers said they weighed the effectiveness of the sirens, in light of new tsunami research and coastal flood-zone maps, against the roughly $100,000 needed to replace the devices under new federal communications regulations that take effect next year. The conclusion, they said, was clear: the sirens were not worth it.
''In better days, it wouldn't be unreasonable to spend $100,000 on a less than perfect tool,'' said Michael Soots, the county's director of information services. ''But in these times we don't have the $100,000, and it is much less than perfect.''
Some residents are not buying it. They say they fear that the county's new tools of warning, which include cellphone texts and automated reverse 911 calls, could leave behind older residents who have not embraced the digital age, along with tourists and day-trippers from Portland who come here to unplug from their smartphones. Wearing a belt and suspenders, those critics charge, should be the rule. If you have three tools in your toolbox, why not have them all at the ready, just in case?
''Their systems are good, but so are the sirens, and the sirens are already here,'' said Ocie Johnson, who lives two blocks from the ocean in the town of Rockaway Beach and who started, with her mother, a Facebook page, ''SOS Save our Sirens in Tillamook County.'' ''They trained us, 'Listen for the sirens, listen for the sirens,' '' she said.
Supporters of the county's decision, including some coastal hazard experts, say that the sirens, comforting as they may sound in their monthly tests, are so vague in their wailing message -- declaring only a tsunami in approach, with no indication of size or timing -- that they may be, in a strange way, dangerous to public safety.
The last time the sirens wailed, after the March 2011 earthquake in Japan, for example, which triggered tsunami alerts around much of the Pacific Rim, emergency managers here expected the tsunami hitting this part of Oregon to be small, which it was. The only evacuations they ordered were for residents living within a half mile of the shoreline.
But some people panicked anyway, as word of mouth flashed through the community and images from Japan filled the news, and at least a few residents fled. County managers said they drew a message from the experience that a more finely tuned, information-rich alert system would be an improvement over their current tools, including the sirens.
Worse, hazard experts say, the sirens can create a false sense of security from the real threats that hang over the coast. When the next big local earthquake does strike along the 700-mile-long Cascadia Fault, about 60 miles offshore from here -- the fault has moved, sometimes catastrophically, about every 300 years, most recently in the late 1700s -- residents will have perhaps 15 minutes or so to get to high ground. So by the time the alarm could be sounded on the beach, it would probably be too late anyway. The shaking itself, quake experts say, will be the signal to flee.
''I think there is this sort of fetishism with technology that people have -- that if only we possessed the accurate technology, we are therefore safe from harm,'' said Patrick Corcoran, a hazards specialist at Oregon Sea Grant, a network of researchers and marine experts based at Oregon State University. Mr. Corcoran said that education -- about escape routes, planning and contingencies -- is what would save lives in a big tsunami, not a screaming noise from the beach.
In a minor tsunami threat, he said, ''sirens scare people and suggest a level of danger far greater than reality.'' And in a major event, he added, where people really need to run for their lives, power, and probably the siren poles themselves, would probably go down anyway.
''Do you really need a siren to tell you that you just experienced a 9.0 earthquake?'' he said.
And there is no debate that the sirens, which were bought used from an old nuclear power plant that closed in 1993, are basically museum pieces. ''You can't get parts, you can't get people to fix them, and they don't really serve a purpose anymore,'' said Gordon McCraw, the county's director of emergency management.
What the sirens are, though, without doubt, is familiar.
''There are a lot of older people in this area,'' said Pepi Gabor, a co-owner of the Rising Star Cafe along the coast in Wheeler. Ms. Gabor said that while she thought the beach sirens would be ''pretty ineffectual'' in an actual emergency, they probably prompt memories of security and authority in people who remember the fallout shelters of the 1960s or the air-raid warnings of World War II.
To worry or not -- that is the question. Just around the corner from Ms. Gabor's restaurant, for instance, the Tsunami Bar and Grill was closed on a recent weekday. Had the owners sought a safer locale, free from the threat of earthquake and waves?
Not at all. A sign on the front window said the Tsunami had moved closer to the ocean, to be right on the waterfront.

HEADLINE: Fate Unclear for Ornate Piano Showroom

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
It has long been the place where renowned pianists like Emanuel Ax, Alfred Brendel and Lang Lang would try out the nine-foot concert grands they would play up the block at Carnegie Hall or at Lincoln Center. And also pop stars like Harry Connick Jr., Billy Joel and Diana Krall.
But you did not have to be a world-class musician to walk in and run your hands over the products that carry the most famous name in the piano world. It was a showroom -- a very ornate showroom -- but it was as inviting as any auto dealer's: Salespeople were standing by ready to chat up customers and talk deals.
Now the future of the Steinway & Sons showroom on West 57th Street, one of those spaces that give New York City a particular flavor, might be uncertain. The company has signed a tentative agreement to sell the 16-story, 87-year-old building. 
''That place, it's more than magical,'' said Erica vanderLinde Feidner, who was a saleswoman at Steinway from 1992 through 2005 and now sells pianos on her own. ''I remember when I was 10, auditioning at the Juilliard School of Music, and my father told me that we were going to go to the very famous Steinway Hall after my audition. I remember being captivated by the idea that pianos had a home such as that.''
Michael T. Sweeney, the chief executive of Steinway Musical Instruments, said in a conference call with financial analysts last month that the company was losing about $5 million a year on the building, whose Beaux-Arts facade and ornate rotunda inside were the work of Warren & Wetmore, the architectural firm most often remembered for Grand Central Terminal.
Mr. Sweeney, in the conference call, said he expected the sales contract to be finished by the end of November and the closing to take place by the end of the year. But Julie Theriault, a spokeswoman for Steinway Musical, said Friday that the contract had not yet been signed.
The $195 million deal contains a provision for Steinway to pack up the pianos and move out if the buyer -- who has not been identified -- or Steinway itself gave 12 months' notice. ''There's a chance we'd stay and a chance we won't,'' Ms. Theriault said. ''It's potentially our decision, but it's potentially the buyer's.''
Steinway, which owns the building but not the land beneath it, said its share of the sale would total $56 million. But the company said $20 million would go into escrow for as long as it remained in the building. Mr. Sweeney, the chief executive, did not say how long that might be or how much rent Steinway would have to pay if it stayed on.
At one time or another, the building housed offices of the New York Philharmonic, Columbia Artists Management and Musical America magazine. In the 1990s, the nameplate above the large front window was replaced with one that said ''The Economist'' when the British magazine became a tenant. The Economist moved out in 2010.
For many New Yorkers, it was the showroom that was, and is, captivating. Dr. JoAnn Difede, a psychologist on the faculty of Weill Cornell Medical College, rented an upright piano there several years ago -- a Boston, one of Steinway's two lower-priced brands. Her son Hal Rives showed promise, she said. After six months of renting, they bought it. And last summer Hal, now 14, took a teenage friend who was visiting from Los Angeles to Steinway Hall.
''They went and played the pianos for an hour until someone threw them out,'' she said. ''It's an icon. It may not be up there with the Apple store in touristy, but it gets some people there. And it's a similar concept, the design of a perfect product and the place in which they're selling it.
''That's what Steve Jobs understood better than anybody in modern corporate America, and that Steinway got right. The environment in which it's sold matters.''
But it is an environment on a block that is changing. There was a time when its stretch of West 57th Street ''evoked comparison to the elegant Rue de la Paix in Paris,'' in the words of the Landmarks Preservation Commission. But now a 1,004-foot-high tower is going up a few doors away from the Steinway building.
That new structure, known as One57, will be one of the city's tallest. Its prices are high, too: Two duplexes are said to be under contract for more than $90 million apiece. And it was the scene of high drama during Hurricane Sandy when a construction crane snapped and dangled over the street.
The Steinway building, designated a city landmark in 2001, opened in October 1925 with a performance by 35 players from the New York Philharmonic. In the invitation-only audience, The New York Times reported, were ''more persons of note in society and music, perhaps, than New York's greatest concert halls often shelter in a day.'' Among them were the composer Sergei Rachmaninoff; George Eastman, the founder of Eastman Kodak; the mining mogul and art collector Solomon R. Guggenheim; and John D. Rockefeller Jr.
Over the years, generations of piano teachers scheduled recitals in the rotunda, with its 60-foot-high domed ceiling and elaborate marble columns, and generations of beginners labored through Beethoven's ''Für Elise'' or Chopin's ''Minute'' Waltz. And the basement, a workaday space with factory-style fluorescent lights, became a haunt for famous pianists with a recital or a concert on the calendar. There they could choose from among the instruments in Steinway's concert fleet, a bank of pianos that could be delivered to concert halls or recording studios.
Rachmaninoff was introduced, so the story goes, to Vladimir Horowitz in the basement in the 1920s. After they worked their way through Rachmaninoff's Concerto No. 3, Rachmaninoff is said to have declared, ''That's the way it should be played.''
Steinway occupied four floors and the basement when the building was new. But in the 1950s, the company moved most of its administrative operations to its factory in Astoria, Queens. In 1958, it became a tenant in its own building, which it sold to the Manhattan Life Insurance Company. Steinway bought back the building in 1999 for $62 million.
Virginia Gambale, a technology strategist from Greenwich, Conn., said she remembered when she first saw the Steinway building. It was in 1970. She was a 10-year-old pianist who arrived to play in a competition there.
She also remembered the first time her 8-year-old daughter, Olivia, saw the Steinway building. It was last spring, for a piano recital. ''She knew the story of Mommy,'' Ms. Gambale said. ''I was so excited, and so was she. You couldn't put this same experience in a different building. You stand there and you look at the columns. You look at the architecture. In a regular modern building, it would not have the same experience.''

HEADLINE: (Risk vs. Reward)

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
In March 1991, Michael R. Milken, once the richest and most powerful financier of his generation, entered prison, signaling the end of an era of junk bond-financed hostile takeovers and high-visibility prosecutions that law enforcement officials hoped would deter insider trading for generations.
But now, less than one generation later, federal prosecutors and enforcement lawyers at the Securities and Exchange Commission have exposed a vast network of insider trading that in its sophistication, breadth and profits dwarfs that of the earlier era. And with the emergence of Steven A. Cohen, the founder of the hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors, as a subject of interest, the government has identified a financier whose power and wealth surpasses even that of Mr. Milken in his heyday.
Why has insider trading proved so persistent, even in the face of prosecutions and popular Hollywood films like ''Wall Street''?
The risk-versus-reward equation that has always been a factor in financial markets has changed drastically in the last 20 years. Ivan F. Boesky, the once-celebrated arbitrageur who admitted to insider trading after preaching to graduates of the University of California, Berkeley in 1986 that ''Greed is all right, by the way,'' had to pay fines and restitution then considered a milestone: $100 million. 
When the government revealed that Mr. Milken earned $550 million in a single year in the 1980s, the sum astonished Wall Street and even his fellow traders at his now-defunct firm, Drexel Burnham Lambert. The Wall Street Journal calculated that $550 million was more than it cost to launch the space shuttle, build a B-1 bomber or, adjusted for inflation, pay for the Louisiana Purchase. (Mr. Milken's take would be $1.07 billion in 2011 dollars.)
By contrast, the average hedge fund manager in the top 25 performers today makes that in a good year, and a few have earned more than $4 billion in a single year. Mr. Cohen reportedly earned $1.4 billion in 2009, and Forbes estimated his net worth in 2012 at $8.8 billion. (Mr. Milken's fortune, by comparison, is estimated by Forbes at $2 billion, which puts him in the middle of the magazine's list of the richest 400 Americans.)
At the same time, the tactics and technologies available to inside traders today are more sophisticated and more difficult both to detect and to prove.
A large majority of hedge funds have not been tainted by any wrongdoing, just as most junk bond traders were never accused of any crime. Mr. Cohen hasn't been accused of any wrongdoing nor has his firm, although the S.E.C. has said it may face civil charges.
This week, I stopped by St. Andrews Plaza in Lower Manhattan to see Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, and his deputy, Richard Zabel, the former head of the criminal division. Both said they couldn't discuss any pending cases. But many people who work in financial markets ''are highly skilled at cost-benefit analysis,'' Mr. Bharara told me. ''They're highly intelligent. They've been to the best schools. They weigh the risk of getting caught against the potential reward, and they decide it's worth the risk. We're trying to tilt that equation.''
There's no doubt that the potential for gain ''has soared,'' Robert S. Khuzami, head of enforcement at the S.E.C., told me, and not because there are more takeovers and other market-moving events to trade on. ''That's a big change from the 1980s and '90s. Hedge funds can take massive positions, use short-selling and derivatives, and employ trading techniques that aren't transparent, and make huge amounts of money on small fluctuations on price. They don't need to hit a home run on a $20 pop on a takeover announcement. These bets may be bunts and singles, but they get to the same place.''
Even at lower rungs of the hedge fund world, the potential gains have shot up. Mathew Martoma, a former SAC trader who was accused last month of using secret information to help SAC gain profits, was paid a $9.4 million bonus in 2008, when he was just 34. At the same time, the cost of failure can be catastrophic. When he failed to replicate that kind of information, he was fired a little more than a year later. (Mr. Martoma pleaded not guilty to the charge, and, through his lawyer, has denied any wrongdoing.)
The pressure to get an ''edge,'' as hedge fund traders often put it, has never been greater. ''There's a cruciblelike intensity of competition now that didn't exist at the time of Boesky,'' Mr. Zabel told me. ''With hedge funds, there's a lot of capital, and they're competing ruthlessly. You have to be better every quarter or you're not going to exist. Add the tremendous incentive of great wealth, and it's not surprising that some people lack the moral fiber to resist that kind of pressure.''
Even as the potential rewards have soared, the nature of today's trading -- the bunts and singles, as Mr. Khuzami put it -- has made enforcement more difficult, leading to what seems to have been a perception of less risk of getting caught. In the wake of the Milken-Boesky era, the government has become sophisticated at monitoring major market-moving events like takeover announcements, to the point that insider trading on major corporate news has become relatively rare (though just this week the S.E.C. charged an old-fashioned insider trading ring based on leaks about proposed mergers and acquisitions).
Modern technology has also rendered obsolete the use of suitcases of cash, secret passwords and other subterfuges I described in ''Den of Thieves,'' my 1991 book about Mr. Milken, Mr. Boesky and insider trading in the 1980s. ''In the 1980s, you had to meet someone, or have lunch or exchange information in ways that were slower and more visible,'' Mr. Zabel said. ''Now, you can have only the glow of your computer screen on your face and you can scoop up all sorts of valuable information from all over the country or even the world. If you get even little bits, you can trade on a daily or hourly basis on micromovements.''
But technology has cut both ways. Although some critics say the S.E.C.'s expertise has lagged advances in areas like high-frequency trading, the enforcement division has made progress in monitoring suspicious trading. ''We've created databases to see who is trading in tandem, even if you know nothing about an event,'' Mr. Khuzami said. ''It's a trader-based approach, not an issuer-based approach. These trading patterns are the first clue to what might be insider trading rings. You then have to do the real detective work, pulling phone records and e-mails and using other techniques to uncover the links. ''
There's no doubt that the new techniques have been yielding results. Since Mr. Bharara became a United States attorney in 2009, his office has charged 75 people with insider trading, including such now-household names as Raj Rajaratnam, the founder of the Galleon Group hedge fund, and Rajat K. Gupta, a former McKinsey chief and Goldman Sachs director. His office has secured 69 convictions or guilty pleas without losing a case (six are pending and more are said to be in the pipeline). Many of those cases were developed in conjunction with the S.E.C., which has brought over 200 enforcement actions since 2009. ''These have been cases of hard-core insider trading, and they've done a marvelous job,'' said Harvey Pitt, the former S.E.C. chairman who previously represented Mr. Boesky (and has lectured SAC employees on compliance with securities law).
It's still too soon to measure the deterrent effect of the latest wave of cases, but it's surely substantial. For the most part, inside traders aren't hardened criminals but rational decision-makers. When confronted by an F.B.I. agent in his front yard, Mr. Martoma fainted. ''What we're trying to accomplish is deterrence,'' Mr. Bharara said. He mentioned that the jurors in the Gupta case openly wept as they rendered their guilty verdict, which they must have known meant the ruin of a once-illustrious career and reputation. ''I want smart people to see that and say, 'I never want that to happen to me.' ''
One thing that apparently hasn't changed is motive, and a question hovering over insider trading prosecutions then and now is why people who are already so rich and successful would resort to criminal activity. ''Sometimes, it's about the money or a bigger house in the Hamptons or wanting to climb the social ladder,'' Mr. Khuzami said. ''But for the already-rich, it's mostly about ego and being a player. A winning tip impresses others and makes them part of the club.''
Mr. Pitt added: ''My bottom line is that not a lot has really changed. Cheating is still cheating. Insider trading is cheating. It's an effort to get an edge and give yourself an advantage you know you're not supposed to have.''
''Far too many people are questioning whether the markets give you a fair shake or whether inside traders are taking advantage of them,'' Mr. Pitt said. ''That's bad for capitalism, bad for capital formation and very bad for the country.''

HEADLINE: On the Occasion of 'Madoff Day,' Think About How to Avoid Fraud

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
THIS is the time of year when most people think of gifts and holiday gatherings. I couldn't help thinking of frauds past.
Four years ago this week, Marc S. Dreier, a high-flying lawyer, was arrested and later charged with defrauding his clients of $700 million. A few days later, Bernard L. Madoff's fraud was uncovered. Totaling an estimated $65 billion, Mr. Madoff's fraud was in a class by itself. And then, a short time afterward, some of the brokers who had been selling fraudulent certificates of deposit for R. Allen Stanford began to turn on him; he was arrested in February 2009 and later convicted of a $7 billion fraud.
These schemes collapsed with the economy in 2008. But on their anniversaries, it may be a good time to ask whether you have done all you can to lower your risk of being caught up in a similar fraud. Call it Madoff Day (celebrated on Dec. 11, the day of his arrest).
Protecting yourself against fraud, or simply bad advice, is easier said than done. The most common advice is to make sure your money is held by an independent custodian or firm whose job is to keep your money safe. That wasn't the case with either the Madoff or Stanford fraud. But that is only one small step. 
So what else can investors do to protect themselves, not only from unscrupulous advisers but also from rushing into an investment that is clearly too good to be true?
Marc H. Simon, a lawyer who lost two years of bonuses, his job and months of unreimbursed expenses when Mr. Dreier's law firm collapsed, said he has thought a lot about what he could have done differently.
Mr. Simon said that six or seven years before the fraud was uncovered, he knew of inconsistencies in the firm's 401(k) plans. But the big red flag should have been that Mr. Dreier had sole control over every major decision at the law firm. Still, that had been Mr. Dreier's pitch: work for him and don't worry about the irksome details partners typically face.
''People like Drier and Madoff were highly intelligent individuals, they were very charismatic and they were giving people what they wanted,'' Mr. Simon said. ''It is harder to bring into question those who are providing you something you want.''
Randall A. Pulman, a lawyer in San Antonio who represents many victims of Mr. Stanford's fraud, agreed that the will to believe was what ensnared people.
''For you and me, it's too good to be true,'' he said. ''For the guy who has been working in the oil fields, how is he supposed to know?''
Of course, fraud and just plain bad advice are not limited to the poor or unsophisticated. Robert P. Rittereiser, the former chief financial officer of Merrill Lynch and former chief executive of E. F. Hutton, is working as the receiver for two funds suing J. Ezra Merkin, a former money manager who steered money to Mr. Madoff. Mr. Rittereiser did not think investors in Mr. Merkin's funds knew that their money was simply being passed on to Mr. Madoff. But even if they did, they may not have seen anything to be concerned about.
''They were investing money and getting appropriate returns for the kind of fund it was,'' Mr. Rittereiser said. ''Most of them had a relationship of some kind and confidence with Merkin and the people he was dealing with.''
So how do you protect yourself? The first step would seem to be picking an honest adviser. The good news is that only about 7 percent of advisers have disciplinary records, said Nicholas W. Stuller, president and chief executive of AdviceIQ, a company that evaluates advisers. The bad news is that those violations appear only after someone has filed a complaint.
Mr. Stuller's company, which has now approved some 2,400 advisers, rejects anyone with any type of infraction -- from a securities fine to a misdemeanor for getting into a fight. He said this policy might keep some good advisers off the site, but his goal is to search the records of federal and state regulators to find advisers he knows are clean.
''There are advisers who have significant negative disciplinary history with one regulator but appear to be pristine with another regulator,'' Mr. Stuller said. ''There was a guy in Minnesota who was stealing insurance premiums. In his enforcement record, it says, 'We're going to alert Finra,' but his Finra record is clean,'' he said, referring to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. ''That's where the regulators don't talk to each other.''
AdviceIQ's main competitor, BrightScope, takes a different approach. It notes disciplinary actions taken against advisers but leaves it up to the consumer to go to regulators to determine what the violations were.
''We want the consumer to go to the source data, because there is a lot of liability in publishing that,'' said Mike Alfred, co-founder and chief executive of BrightScope. ''Many of these folks are good advisers, and they'll take care of you. But what if they had one crazy client who put all his money in Internet stocks in 2000 and then sued?''
Both services have obvious downsides. With AdviceIQ, a crooked adviser could be rejected from the site and no one would know about it, while BrightScope's listing could hurt an otherwise honest adviser who had a frivolous suit brought against him.
Mr. Stuller said his site's main goal was to match advisers with clients of similar needs, like a doctor with someone whose clients are mostly doctors. Mr. Alfred said his site left it to the individual to do more due diligence, though he pointed to an adviser with 55 violations and said she would have trouble explaining those away. (Both sites charge featured advisers an annual fee.)
Ross Gerber, president and chief executive of Gerber Kawasaki, a wealth manager, said clients with sizable wealth should not trust it to any single adviser, no matter how good the adviser seems to be.
He said one of his clients, with about $25 million, has $5 million with him, $10 million with a private bank, and $10 million with a trust company. Each month, Mr. Gerber sends her statement to the private banker, who acts as the point person to make sure the various portfolios aren't all invested in Apple.
''I'm not threatened by other investment managers who work with my client,'' he said. ''My clients with a lot of money have a lot of private banking relationships, or lending relationships, or things we don't provide.''
Mr. Gerber added that he would steer clear of advisers who didn't want to share with other advisers what they had done for clients. ''If Starbucks goes from $50 to $80, it's easy to show them why it did well,'' he said. ''When you're investing in these scams, they're funds. You don't see what's in them. People don't necessarily ask a lot of questions or they don't care.''
In some cases, investors do not even know the questions to ask. Marc Odo, director of applied research at Zephyr Associates, a financial software firm, said he had been asked by a client whether a return could be so high or consistent for so long that it might signal a fraud.
Not knowing the answer, he applied sophisticated financial models to compare Mr. Madoff's record, using a fund that fed money to Mr. Madoff, Fairfield Sentry, against the returns of Hedge Fund Research's Equity Hedge index from 1990 to 2008.
He plotted the returns on a graph that measured the frequency of losses and the amount of time returns were positive. All but five equity hedge funds were grouped together at the left side of the graph, and four of those outliers were still close to the pack. The Madoff returns floated in the top right corner, like a distant planet.
''This is a more mathematical way to quantify the 'too good to be true,' '' Mr. Odo said. ''This helps pick apart the numbers. It helps you understand the risks out there.''
He said this analysis was particularly important with investments in hedge funds or other vehicles that do not disclose their holdings: testing how believable the returns are over a long period of time may be the only way to know if they are achieved legitimately.
Still, Daylian Cain, an assistant professor of organizational behavior at the Yale School of Management whose research has looked into how advisers who disclose their conflicts can give people a false sense of comfort, said anyone, no matter how smart, could be duped if the situation were appealing enough.
He said the best advice would be for investors to ask themselves at the moment they are about to invest: What would happen if the investment is not what I think it is?
''Asking, 'Could I be wrong?' is psychologically completely different to the brain than, 'Could I be right?' '' he said. ''It's not 'Could this be true,' but 'How could this investment be a bad idea?' ''
The very act of asking that question, he said, might prompt a potentially positive response: procrastination. ''If the opportunity is gone tomorrow,'' he said, ''it may mean that your money and your adviser is gone tomorrow, too.''

HEADLINE: Looking For Solutions: Obama Trusted on Economy

BYLINE: By DALIA SUSSMAN

 BODY:
When it comes to dealing with the country's economic problems, Americans give President Obama the upper hand, according to a national poll released Friday. Nearly half, 48 percent, said they trust Mr. Obama more to develop solutions to the nation's economic problems, compared with the 32 percent who trust Congressional Republicans more. 
As for what would be effective in reducing the nation's deficit, about three in four Americans said raising taxes on family incomes over $250,000 would be. Nearly as many said reducing taxes and regulations to spur economic growth would be effective. Fewer, but still a majority of respondents, said increasing taxes on all Americans, reducing military spending and reducing programs that benefit the poor, like welfare and Medicaid, would be effective in getting the country's finances under control.
Just a third of Americans, however, say reducing spending on Social Security and Medicare would be effective.
The survey, the Heartland Monitor Poll, was conducted for Allstate and The National Journal.
Asked what they thought would most help the country improve over the next couple of years, 43 percent said "growing the economy and creating jobs through investments in education, training, infrastructure, and research, even if it means continued deficits and tax increases."
Fewer, 29 percent, said "growing the economy and creating jobs through tax cuts for businesses and individuals, even if it means continued deficits and cuts to public services." Fewer still, 22 percent, said "reducing the federal deficit, even if it means both tax increases and cuts to public services."
The national poll was conducted Nov. 25 to Dec. 1 by landline phones and cellphones among 1,000 adults and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.

HEADLINE: Jobs Report Becomes Fodder in Fiscal Debate

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Democrats and Republicans seized on November's job numbers on Friday to press for a compromise on a deficit deal, as Speaker John A. Boehner opened the door slightly to tax rate increases as part of a broad fiscal package.
Mr. Boehner, meeting with reporters, declined to rule out a rise in the top income tax rate below the level President Obama wants, only to reiterate later that his opposition to tax rate increases remained unchanged. That suggested a possibility that although he opposes higher tax rates, they could still end up in a final package, given enough compromise by the White House on spending. 
''There are a lot of things that are possible to put the revenue that the president seeks on the table,'' Mr. Boehner said when asked about an increase in the top tax rate short of the 39.6 percent level of the Clinton era. ''But none of it's going to be possible if the president insists on his position, insists on 'my way or the highway.' ''
Mr. Boehner later released a statement saying: ''As I've said many, many, many times: I oppose tax rate increases because tax rate increases cost American jobs. That has not changed, and will not change.''
Publicly neither side indicated progress toward a deal ahead of the end-of-the-month deadline for averting a series of automatic tax increases and spending cuts. But talks continued. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, met with Mr. Obama at the White House for private consultations.
Mr. Boehner put the onus on the president to make the next move. ''This isn't a progress report, because there's no progress to report,'' he told reporters outside his suite of offices in the Capitol. ''The White House has wasted another week.''
The jobs report gave both sides a new talking point to press for compromise. The Labor Department on Friday said the economy added 146,000 jobs last month, and the unemployment rate fell to 7.7 percent from 7.9 percent in October. Those numbers were unexpectedly bright, given the impact of Hurricane Sandy and business fears about the potential fiscal crisis next month.
Mr. Boehner continued to say that his opposition to allowing the top two rates to rise from 33 percent and 35 percent to 36 percent and 39.6 percent stems from fears of the impact on small businesses that pay ordinary income tax rates, not the corporate tax rate. About 97 percent of small businesses do not turn enough profit to be affected, but Republicans note that more than half of small-business income -- from the most profitable businesses, partnerships and limited liability corporations -- would be hit by the increases.
''The risk the president wants us to take with increases of tax rates will hit many small businesses that create 50 to 70 percent of the jobs in our country,'' Mr. Boehner said. ''That's the whole issue.''
Ms. Pelosi countered that after 33 straight months of gains in private-sector jobs, employment was now threatened by Republican refusal to pass Senate legislation extending Bush-era tax cuts for 98 percent of American households -- but not the top 2 percent.
''The only obstacle standing in the way of middle-income tax relief are Republicans' unwillingness to ask the top 2 percent to pay their fair share,'' she said.
Senior House Republican aides say they will not move an inch more toward Mr. Obama unless he spells out immediate spending cuts for 2013. Even if Republicans agreed to the president's request on higher tax rates for the rich, a deal would still be about $42 billion short of the $110 billion ''down payment'' Republican leaders need to pass legislation canceling next year's across-the-board spending cuts.
''It would be an embarrassment to move further when the president is moving the opposite way,'' a senior Republican leadership aide said.
Meanwhile, cracks emerged in the pressure campaign the White House is trying to assemble. A coalition of philanthropies refused publicly on Friday to join White House-organized efforts to raise the heat on Republicans in a show of moxie that portends poorly for any effort next year to tackle one of the largest tax benefits for the rich, the charitable deduction.
The coalition, the Alliance for Charitable Reform, said in a statement that it ''refuses to go along with the White House's request for charities to insert themselves into the debate over tax rates.''
''Our priority is to preserve and protect the charitable deduction,'' it said. ''Throughout his first term, President Obama has proposed reducing itemized deductions, including the charitable deduction, in multiple budgets and other spending proposals, and never voiced concern over the impact of his plan on the charitable sector.''
Alison Hawkins, a spokeswoman for the alliance, said White House officials had asked nonprofits to publicly oppose a Republican proposal to cap tax deductions at $25,000 instead of raising rates, and instead to press for higher upper-income tax rates to save government programs that partner with charities. Administration officials wanted charitable organizations to write letters to the editor and opinion articles and mount social media campaigns to amplify Mr. Obama's message.
Such a public unmasking of a White House request is highly unusual, but charities have been at odds with the president on taxes ever since his first year in office, when he proposed capping tax deductions at 28 percent. Taxpayers in the 35-percent tax bracket are currently allowed to deduct 35 percent of charitable giving from their taxes, a policy the White House maintains is unfair to middle-class taxpayers in a lower bracket.
The 28-percent bracket was part of the president's deficit-reduction offer last month.

HEADLINE: Shares Are Mixed After Jobs Report

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks were mostly higher on Friday, lifted by a positive report from the Labor Department on job creation and the unemployment rate.
Trading was light, continuing the week's trend of slight moves and anemic volume. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 0.1 percent for the week after several volatile sessions.
Stocks opened higher after the nonfarm payrolls report, which showed 146,000 jobs added in November, far more than had been expected, while the unemployment rate fell to 7.7 percent. A poor reading on consumer sentiment caused an erosion of those gains, though markets rebounded later. 
The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for early December fell to its lowest level since August. Sentiment declined on growing concerns over the fiscal debates in Washington, which have been a major factor preventing broader moves as well.
''We're not as concerned as we were a few months ago because of improvement like you can see in the employment number, but there's such a wild card over'' the fiscal talks, Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland, said. ''There are such concerns about what could happen that markets will be overhung until a resolution is more certain.''
One of the biggest drags on the Nasdaq was Apple, which fell 2.6 percent to $533.25, extending its losses for the week to 8.9 percent. This was the worst week for the stock since May 2010.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 81.09 points, or 0.62 percent, to close at 13,155.13. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.13 points, or 0.29 percent, to 1,418.07. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 11.23 points, or 0.38 percent, to close at 2,978.04. For the week, the Nasdaq was down 1.1 percent, hurt largely by the decline in Apple. The Dow, which does not count Apple as a component, rose 1 percent for its third consecutive week of gains. The S.& P. 500 was also up for three consecutive weeks, rising 4.3 percent over that period.
The equity market has regained most of the ground it lost after President Obama's re-election as markets turned their focus to the tax increases and spending cuts that are coming if Congress and the president fail to reach a budget agreement. Market response to macroeconomic data remained muted as negotiations continued to command investors' attention.
The House speaker, John Boehner, said talks this week with Mr. Obama had produced no progress. He renewed his demand that the president make a new offer to avert the series of tax increases and spending cuts that are likely to hurt economic demand in 2013.
Material shares were the strongest performers of the day. Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold gained 2.9 percent, to close at $31.70 Dow Chemical added 2.2 percent, to $30.30.
Amarin, a biopharmaceutical company, fell 18.9 percent, to $9.69, in New York. It raised $100 million in financing to help it introduce its heart drug, Vascepa, but it disappointed investors, who had hoped for a sale or partnership.
CombiMatrix, a medical research company, gained 336.6 percent, to $8.60, after the company said two studies published in a medical journal favored technology it uses for prenatal diagnosis of genetic abnormalities over traditional technologies.
Groupon, the online coupon provider, was one of the day's leading gainers, rising 88 cents, or 23 percent, to $4.68, but it was still well below the $24.58 it reached in February.
Interest rates were higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year bond fell 3/32, to 100 1/32, and the yield rose to 1.62 percent from 1.59 percent late on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Rise of the Robots

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Capital versus labor rears its head again. 

 BODY:
Catherine Rampell and Nick Wingfield write about the growing evidence for "reshoring" of manufacturing to the United States. They cite several reasons: rising wages in Asia; lower energy costs here; higher transportation costs. In a followup piece, however, Rampell cites another factor: robots. 
The most valuable part of each computer, a motherboard loaded with microprocessors and memory, is already largely made with robots, according to my colleague Quentin Hardy. People do things like fitting in batteries and snapping on screens.
As more robots are built, largely by other robots, "assembly can be done here as well as anywhere else," said Rob Enderle, an analyst based in San Jose, Calif., who has been following the computer electronics industry for a quarter-century. "That will replace most of the workers, though you will need a few people to manage the robots."
Robots mean that labor costs don't matter much, so you might as well locate in advanced countries with large markets and good infrastructure (which may soon not include us, but that's another issue). On the other hand, it's not good news for workers!
This is an old concern in economics; it's "capital-biased technological change", which tends to shift the distribution of income away from workers to the owners of capital.
Twenty years ago, when I was writing about globalization and inequality, capital bias didn't look like a big issue; the major changes in income distribution had been among workers (when you include hedge fund managers and CEOs among the workers), rather than between labor and capital. So the academic literature focused almost exclusively on "skill bias", supposedly explaining the rising college premium.
But the college premium hasn't risen for a while. What has happened, on the other hand, is a notable shift in income away from labor:
If this is the wave of the future, it makes nonsense of just about all the conventional wisdom on reducing inequality. Better education won't do much to reduce inequality if the big rewards simply go to those with the most assets. Creating an "opportunity society", or whatever it is the likes of Paul Ryan etc. are selling this week, won't do much if the most important asset you can have in life is, well, lots of assets inherited from your parents. And so on.
I think our eyes have been averted from the capital/labor dimension of inequality, for several reasons. It didn't seem crucial back in the 1990s, and not enough people (me included!) have looked up to notice that things have changed. It has echoes of old-fashioned Marxism -- which shouldn't be a reason to ignore facts, but too often is. And it has really uncomfortable implications.
But I think we'd better start paying attention to those implications.

HEADLINE: Heritage, Chicago, and the Fiscal Cliff

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: It's not just a problem at the think tanks. 

 BODY:
Menzie Chinn has some fun pointing out that if the doctrine Heritage was pushing to oppose fiscal stimulus were true -- namely, that government borrowing always crowds out an equal amount of private spending -- then the fiscal cliff could not be a problem. Hey, the government is going to borrow less, which will automatically and necessarily lead to an equal rise in private borrowing, so total demand can't be affected, right? 
It is, of course, an absurd proposition; when Heritage propounded this doctrine, it was also retrogressing intellectually by at least 80 years.
But what Menzie doesn't mention is that the very same doctrine was propounded by distinguished economists at the University of Chicago -- John Cochrane and Gene Fama made exactly the same argument that Brian Riedl was making at Heritage, while Robert Lucas fell into a somewhat different but equally misleading fallacy.
So if you think the fiscal cliff matters, you also, whether you know it or not, believe that a whole school of macroeconomics responded to the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression with ludicrous conceptual errors, of a kind nobody has had a right to make since 1936 at the latest.
And I see no sign at all of a rethink, of an admission that perhaps the macroeconomic situation has developed not necessarily to the Chicago School's advantage.

The latest job numbers became a new talking pointfor both Democrats and Republicans on Friday, as the two parties continued to press for a compromise on the deficit deal, Jonathan Weisman reports.

        
President Obama's 2013 inaugural festivities will be low-key compared with 2009, but this time corporations will be allowed to donate without caps or limits, Sheryl Gay Stolberg writes.
 Weekly Address 

        
Mr. Obama used this week's address to nudge Congressional leaders toward a solution for the "fiscal cliff," saying both sides agree on the need to reduce the deficit, but both sides should be willing to compromise. "I stand ready to work with Republicans on a plan that spurs economic growth, creates jobs and reduces our deficit - a plan that gives both sides some of what they want," he said.

HEADLINE: Using The South American Playbook

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

 BODY:
Miami
OUTSIDE the United States, many real estate developers have less of an appetite for risk than their counterparts here.
In South America, for instance, developers typically ask buyers to pony up a big chunk of the total price of an apartment in a new development long before it's finished.
So South Americans pay huge installments -- often 50 percent or more of the cost of the unit by the time the building is completed. It's a system that most Americans, accustomed to financing at least 80 percent of a property with a bank loan, would consider unworkable.
I remember being shocked to learn from the owner of the apartment I rented in São Paulo, Brazil, where I lived as a foreign correspondent, about the schedule of huge payments -- totaling 57 percent -- he had had to deliver to the developer as the condo building went up. It was all nonrefundable, he told me. 
But what if something went wrong, I asked him, like the developer going bankrupt? Or if the economy suddenly exploded into crisis, which is certainly not unheard of in South America?
He just shrugged. That's simply how things are done down south, where interest rates are much higher, and where historically high inflation made financing riskier and more expensive than in the United States. The practice is especially common in Brazil and Argentina, but also in smaller countries like Uruguay, where Donald Trump has a licensing agreement for a new residential tower in the beach resort of Punta del Este that will require down payments of 40 percent from buyers before construction begins.
That perspective offers a different lens on the risks that developers are taking in Miami's recent condo boomlet.
The Miami of today is not the Miami of 2004, when property prices were still rising in large part on a wave of speculation, with buyers putting down, at most, 20 percent and then flipping properties before construction was done.
This is post-bubble Miami, where banks are still skittish about backing new condo projects.
So Miami developers have taken a page from the South American playbook -- a handy strategy, given how many willing buyers are flocking to Miami from that continent. Developers of several condos downtown and at the beach are requiring initial deposits of 40 percent or more, and more as they get closer to completion. By the time the building is finished, buyers are forking over as much as 80 percent of the total price of their apartments.
''Essentially, the buyers are helping developers build their buildings,'' said Ann Nortmann, senior project director for Palau at Sunset Harbor, a 50-unit development planned for South Beach that requires a total deposit of only 40 percent because the developer, SMG Management, expects more American buyers.
Jorge M. Pérez, chairman of the Related Group of Florida and a chief architect of the new strategy, defends it as necessary to get developments off the ground, and to prevent speculators from flocking back to Miami, hoping to flip apartments as they did in the old days.
''Financing died during the recession,'' Mr. Pérez said. ''We all were awakened by the things that happened. We said, 'If we don't have the buyers that will pay for the majority of the price in the building upfront, then we don't want to take the chance of building these buildings.' ''
Related has employed the financing strategy in three buildings now under construction in South Florida (Apogee Beach, MyBrickell and Millecento) and in three others where sales, but not construction, have started (Beachwalk, Icon Bay and One Ocean). A 3,200-square-foot penthouse at One Ocean is listed for $8.5 million.
For all six towers, Related is requiring buyers to pay 40 percent by the time construction begins, and even more during construction. By the time they move in, buyers will have paid 50 percent to 80 percent of the total apartment price.
The strategy isn't exactly keeping buyers away. MyBrickell and Millecento, both in downtown Miami, have all their units under contract, while Apogee Beach has only two apartments out of 49 still available, according to a Related spokeswoman.
''People said there is no way people would pay that, and people have,'' Mr. Pérez said. That's in large part because South Americans are South Florida's biggest condo buyers right now. Argentines are ''by far'' the top buyers, he said, followed by Brazilians, Colombians, Venezuelans, Mexicans and Peruvians. Argentines concerned about high inflation in their country have seen Miami real estate as a stable place to park their money.
Wealthy Europeans, including some from economically distressed countries like Greece and Italy, are also flocking to Miami real estate, as are Americans from the Northeast and Chicago. Many of those buyers are willing to pay all cash for the condos.
Related is sitting on another 20 or so pieces of land from Palm Beach to Miami where it is considering beginning sales for developments ''when we think the market is ready,'' Mr. Pérez said.
South Florida's real estate industry has been buzzing about more than 80 planned residential developments. But Mr. Pérez said he saw that as mostly hype.
''There is not that much development going on right now,'' he said. ''There are a lot of projects that have been announced. But I don't know where they are going to get financing from.''
For now, with buyers assuming more risk, they don't have to worry as much. Still, ''South Americans are not stupid. They are not going to give money to someone they don't think is going to deliver the building.''
The new financing strategy is great for developers, who can reduce their risk, but it carries some downsides. For one, it has motivated developers to build more towers for the rich -- mostly with foreigners in mind, though they rarely want to admit that -- and not for middle-class Americans who simply cannot afford the big down payments, real estate lawyers said.
That could keep lenders from returning to more traditional lending practices, which some appraisers believe is necessary for Miami's bifurcated real estate market to become truly healthy again. As it is, luxury residences are breaking price records even as tens of thousands of foreclosure cases clog the courts.
Inspections are also an issue. Normally banks require regular inspections during construction to ensure that the buildings are meeting standards. With banks out of the process, developers won't face the same level of scrutiny, real estate lawyers said.
''Will a developer cut corners?'' said Avi Tryson, a lawyer with Beloff Parker Jacobs PLC in Miami Beach. ''I am sure they might.'' It will fall to government authorities, which require some inspections of their own, to police developers, he said.
And buyers, of course, will have more nonrefundable skin in the game. If they cannot close for whatever reason, developers don't have to refund the big down payments. ''But we will work to help you sell your unit,'' Mr. Pérez said.
For now, Related will stick to the high down-payment strategy in its new planned developments. At some point, Mr. Pérez predicted, developers will loosen rules to require 30 percent down.
''The world is going to change,'' he said. ''I just hope we don't go back to the past, when we had very highly leveraged buildings'' that attracted speculators.
Mr. Tryson, the lawyer, sees the big-money spigot -- still flowing so strongly from South America especially -- eventually shutting off.
''I don't know how long it can continue,'' he said. ''There is only so much foreign money. There is only so much domestic money. At some point there has to be a breaking point where they implement a more mixed model or go back to 20 percent.''

HEADLINE: College Boosters

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a college teacher, I was saddened to read ''The Old College Try? No Way'' (Sunday Styles, Dec. 2). While I understand that a diploma is not a prerequisite for a satisfying career or financial success, I believe that people who forgo college miss a crucial learning experience.
The cost has risen astronomically in recent years, and we need to address this. But there is no substitute for four years learning how to read critically, argue effectively and conduct research. The individuals described in this article will have the rest of their lives to travel the world, invent new apps, and ''make all the money they will ever need.'' 
ANYA BERNSTEIN BASSETT
Newton, Mass.
The writer is a senior lecturer on social studies at Harvard.
To the Editor:
Saying no to college is a perfectly reasonable option for the most brilliant minds, just as the wealthy can say no to loans -- they don't need community support to succeed. For the rest of us, college provides students with a wide range of support to hone their skills, quench their intellectual curiosity, learn from failures and mature as critical thinkers.
Upon graduation, they will have more employment options, including jobs at innovative companies like Apple or Facebook, even if their C.E.O.'s never needed a degree.
JEFFREY H. TONEY, Ph.D.
The writer is vice president for academic affairs at Kean University.
To the Editor:
As the number of children and families living in poverty increases, particularly in communities of color, it is ever more crucial that strong supports are enacted to gear young people toward high school graduation, college readiness and eventual employment success. Countless studies suggest a strong positive correlation between education and income.
Anecdotal stories of success without college make interesting reading, but they send the wrong message to young people struggling to overcome multigenerational lifelong poverty.
GARY PARKER, MSW
The writer is deputy director of the McSilver Institute for Poverty Policy and Research at the N.Y.U. Silver School of Social Work.
To the Editor:
It seems that the great problem here is that many people seem to have no idea what a college education is. For those of us who are not from the socioeconomic elite and who have good though not remarkable talents, college is a doorway to the future. It is expensive, but those costs can be mitigated in any number of ways.
I was admitted to a small liberal arts college in the '70s, and it saved me from a life of ignorance and servitude. A cadre of caring professors, supportive classmates, opportunities to participate in the life of the community, and breathing room in which to grow as a person were wonderful gifts from my college.
Those who are graduating high school at this time are going to live long lives; those lives will be more meaningful and help create a better society if the young are encouraged and allowed to pursue college educations in fields that they probably do not even yet know exist. One more thing: Steve Jobs and Bill Gates are unique and they made a lot of money and created wonderful things, but they are not role models for the rest of us.
JUDE RYAN
San Antonio, Fla.
To the Editor:
It is striking that about half the people mentioned in your article about the merits of skipping college were in fact admitted to an elite college like Harvard or Stanford. The experience of a small, ultra-talented and ultra-lucky cohort, in terms of the marketplace for jobs and opportunities for 20-year-olds, can hardly be relevant to the broader discussion about the costs and benefits of higher education.
But it is an interesting and unique economic problem for elite schools: will a meaningful number of students be able to harness the value of ''getting into'' a great school, without actually paying for it (i.e. attending for four years)?
EUGENE SIKLOS
Toronto
To the Editor:
I certainly hope the individuals profiled in this article go on to lead wonderful lives, but how many are we talking about? I fear these individuals are similar to the college athletes who leave college for the pros before graduating because, quite frankly, they do have better (or at least more lucrative) things to do with their time than go to college.
But few of us will be successful professional athletes, and I believe the evidence still shows that most of us will be more successful in the labor market and business world with more education. PATRICK FLAHERTY
Coventry, Conn.
To the Editor:
Clip this article to review this scene in five years. While many things about secondary education need reform, the notion that you should ditch formal education and expect to make a living making apps is sheer folly.
There is only room for a very, very few millionaires in this game, and even those wealth dropouts have precarious wealth -- look at Facebook stock and how poorly it has done.
CATHERINE FITZPATRICK
New York
To the Editor:
Steve Jobs's Stanford address is quoted again and again as a justification for dropping out and still ''making it.'' But he did not ''drop out.'' He stopped paying; he still attended classes for another 18 months So, really, he is saying that you should not stop going to school, but stop paying for it. If everyone did that, there eventually would be no school for anyone. KEITH WARTER

HEADLINE: Frosting on the Cross-Country Cake

BYLINE: By WARREN CORNWALL

 BODY:
THEY came by the dozens, drawn to a white oasis in a land of green and brown. A high school teacher and eight students drove halfway across Vermont. A lawyer made the trip from his home, an hour away. Three vans pulled into the dirt parking lot at noon and disgorged 22 Bates College students, bleary-eyed after the four-hour drive from Maine.
''Just get out and have fun, and get on snow,'' urged Becky Woods, head coach of the Bates cross-country ski team.
The irresistible prospect of snow had lured these cross-county skiing enthusiasts to the Craftsbury Outdoor Center in northern Vermont on a chilly mid-November day. Beneath a blue sky, there wasn't a trace of white in the trees or the parking lot. But nearby a mountain of snow stood 15 feet tall, and a ribbon of white crossed a green field, spilled down a short hill, circled back on itself and headed up the hill again. 
It was opening day at the center, whether winter was ready or not.
About a year ago, Craftsbury joined the growing ranks of northern New England cross-country ski areas using artificial snow, long a staple of their wealthier downhill brethren. Spooked by fears of climate change, tired of on-again, off-again winters, and eager to lure visitors with promises of guaranteed snow, Craftsbury and other Northeast cross-country destinations are hoping to compensate for nature's shortcomings and to offer skiers a longer season.
Most American cross-country, or Nordic, areas are still all-natural, particularly smaller ones with tight budgets and areas in colder places like the Rockies. Some New England areas farther south have used artificial snow for more than a decade. Now, it's the trail systems in northern New England -- the heartland of Northeast cross-country skiing -- that are following their lead.
''With global warming and everything else, we can't rely on Mother Nature to give us everything we need,'' said Matt Skehan, director of the Parks and Recreation department in Waterville, Me., where the town is about to turn the switch on a $385,000 snow-making system.
Scientists have observed a striking decline in Northeast winters. The number of days with snow on the ground in a typical year shrank by more than a month between 1965 and 2005, according to a study by University of New Hampshire researchers that appeared in the Journal of Geophysical Research in 2008. And many scientists are warning that it's likely to get worse. For Northeast cross-country ski centers, snow-making is creating two camps: those with the technology, and those who wish they could afford it. The meager snow last winter offered a stark lesson in the split between ski centers with the technology and those without. Craftsbury, already one of the Northeast's premier Nordic ski areas, became a refuge for skiers, while 40 miles to the southwest, in the foothills of the Green Mountains, the small, family-owned Sleepy Hollow Inn, Ski and Bike Center lay dormant most of the winter. Now, the owners are installing the first part of a snow-making system that could eventually churn out enough snow to cover 1.5 kilometers.
"We'd been thinking about it off and on, but the real clincher was last winter,'' said Eli Enman, the center's co-owner.
Thirty miles away, the Rikert Nordic Center, home to Middlebury College's cross-country racing team, plans to open a five-kilometer loop this winter, a project fed by artificial snow. In Stowe, the Trapp Family Lodge, the region's most upscale resort dedicated to cross-country skiing, began making snow in 2007, and Pineland Farms, near Portland, Me., started last winter.
Snow-making, however, doesn't appeal to all skiers. The results, particularly at the start and end of the season, entice only true die-hards, like the ones who showed up at Craftsbury in mid-November. Unlike the extensive snow-making operations at downhill resorts that can blanket much of a mountain, the loop at Craftsbury was just slightly longer than a standard 400-meter running track. The crowded line of skiers marching up the hill resembled a freeway at rush hour. A week later the loop had grown to a little over one kilometer.
These kinds of limitations help explain the reluctance to embrace snow-making at the Jackson Ski Touring Center in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Many skiers come for a trip through a winter wonderland, not just for a workout, said Thom Perkins, executive director of the Jackson Ski Touring Foundation. Still, the center is warily considering snow-making.
''The decision would have a huge economic impact on the organization, and not necessarily on the positive side,'' Mr. Perkins said, referring to the cost of installing and running a snow-making system.
Then there's the environmental cost. Some skiers see artificial snow as a blemish on cross-country's image as a wholesome, green alternative to the glitz and machinery of downhill skiing. As the industry frets about climate change, it faces the discomfort of turning to an energy-sucking technology.
Last year at Craftsbury, for instance, it took 2,600 gallons of diesel fuel to power the enormous snow fans that are used to create snow. Lucas Schulz, Craftsbury's Jack Frost, recently demonstrated how he creates winter -- a process that involves three fans over eight feet tall; a 200-kilowatt diesel generator and up to 150,000 gallons of water in a single night. When the temperature drops to the mid-20s, water sprayed into the fans shoots 40 feet into the air, transforming into an arc of fine-grained snow. The snow accumulates in huge piles, which are then pushed and prodded into 18-inch-deep trails using fuel-guzzling snow-grooming machines that look like sleek bulldozers. Later in the year, an excavator will carve chunks from the snow pile and load them into a dump truck, to be hauled to various parts of the trail system.
''In a sport that prides itself in being green, it is difficult to countenance,'' Fred Griffin said, referring to Craftsbury's snow-making. He is a high school English teacher from Fairfax, Vt., and a founder of the New England Nordic Ski Association, a nonprofit that oversees the region's amateur racing circuit. Still, Mr. Griffin trekked to Craftsbury for opening day, along with a pack of students from his school's cross-country skiing club, eager to feel their skis gliding on snow, even if artificial.
Despite its increasing reliance on snow-making, Craftsbury is trying to build its image as an eco-friendly institution, an effort that is reflected in the name of its elite cross-country program: the Green Racing Project. Skiers swoosh past eight enormous solar panels that produce enough electricity to offset one-third of the power that the center uses. Mr. Schulz points to steps the center is taking to blunt the environmental toll of its snow-making. Heat from the diesel generator will soon warm water to heat several buildings and tap water. Eventually, they hope to switch to pure biodiesel for the generator and 20 percent biodiesel for the grooming machines.
''It's kind of too bad that it's becoming a necessity,'' Mr. Schulz said of the snow-making.
Such thoughts, however, didn't seem to intrude on the giddiness of the Bates students as they chased one another around the little loop, hurtled down the hill and otherwise enjoyed the only cross-country skiing in New England on that clear November day. Maybe they would be sick of the circuit after a few days, said 18-year-old Margaret Pope, a first-year student from McCall, Idaho.
''But I can't really complain,'' she said. ''Snow is snow.''

HEADLINE: An American In Paris, Again

BYLINE: By ERIC WILSON; Cathy Horyn contributed reporting.

 BODY:
ALEXANDER WANG may be the savviest designer of his generation.
At 28, he is the rising star who built a global multimillion-dollar business in less than a decade, opened his own stores in New York and Beijing and, last week, landed a plum job at a prestigious label in Paris, when he was named the creative director of Balenciaga. Some see Mr. Wang's appointment as symbolic of the triumph of youth; others see the demise of fashion.
''It was a coup for Alex, and a coup for American fashion,'' said Diane von Furstenberg. But, she added, ''he's going to need some mentoring in Paris.''
In a way, it is fitting that Mr. Wang should become the first American designer to take on a big, historic European design house since Marc Jacobs, Michael Kors and Narciso Rodriguez went to Paris in the late 1990s. (Only Mr. Jacobs, with his role at Louis Vuitton, remains there.) While other young designers have occasionally been proposed for such lofty jobs, it is Mr. Wang who most perfectly represents his generation's more accessible and business-minded approach to fashion. He also reflects the growing prominence of designers of Asian descent who are making their mark on the global stage. 
He is young, energetic, engaged, streetwise and generally adorable. And like all great (meaning successful) designers, he recognized a crucial shift in the market well before its impact had been fully realized, in this case how the democratization of fashion would also lead to a gradual devaluation of the concept of luxury. He created a business with estimated sales of more than $60 million by making contemporary T-shirts, sweatshirts and shorts that look remarkably like high fashion. (His company does not release numbers.) Early in his career, when critics said he was too commercial, Mr. Wang said: ''I don't see that as a negative thing. It is something I actually enjoy.''
But it is for the same reasons that his appointment at Balenciaga -- nearly a century-old fashion house that was thoroughly modernized over the last 15 years under the considered eye of Nicolas Ghesquière -- bothers so many people, or at least the fashion purists. Some established designers, grumbling privately because they did not want to be seen as meanies, see the change as symbolic of a broader watering-down of creativity in fashion.
''They're not fashion designers,'' one New York designer said. ''They're fashion curators. They're sitting at a computer copying other peoples' ideas.'' Even on Balenciaga's Facebook page, alongside the many positive comments about Mr. Wang, one fan sniped, with Ghesquière gone, ''who will Wang rip-off now?''
Their fear is that PPR, the luxury group that owns Balenciaga, as well as Gucci, Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta, plans to take the label in a more commercial direction, or that the choice of Mr. Wang, as an Asian-American, was somehow an opportunistic play for the emerging luxury market in China.
Mr. Wang's command of the Chinese market and his fluency in Mandarin were not overlooked by executives at Balenciaga, but François-Henri Pinault, the chief executive of PPR, said that they were not considered criteria for his recruitment. He nevertheless described Mr. Wang's heritage as ''an extra value,'' noting that he will bring more exposure to the brand worldwide.
Responding to the question of handing the keys to one of the most famous names in fashion to a designer so young, Mr. Pinault argued that, when Mr. Ghesquière began designing Balenciaga in the mid-1990s, ''he was designing uniforms for Air France, and who would have said that Nicolas would become such a great talent?''
Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue, who championed Mr. Wang for the job, also scoffed at concerns about his age.
''Oh, please, come on,'' she said. ''How great is it to be young? That is when designers are at their most fearless. That is when you do your most creative work.''
When Mr. Ghesquière was named chief designer there, in 1997, he was just 25.
ON Nov. 5, in a major surprise, Balenciaga announced that Mr. Ghesquière was leaving. His vision for the house, combining a reverence for the archives of Cristóbal Balenciaga with high-tech fabric treatments and elements inspired by science fiction, was so transformative that Style.com/Print recently described it as ''the standard by which other big house revivals are judged.'' The business grew to include 62 stores and, Mr. Pinault said, sales have expanded substantially since it was acquired by Gucci Group (as PPR was formerly known) in 2001. But Balenciaga is an expensive business to operate.
There were demands for more commercial styles and reissues of his earlier designs, leading to what retailers described as a confusing assortment in the stores, and, according to several colleagues of Mr. Ghesquière, the designer's frustration.
Isabelle Guichot, the chief executive of Balenciaga since 2007, said in a telephone interview on Thursday that the role of a designer in today's industry demands a quality that she called ''creative realism.''
Last month, when the company began a search for its next designer, there was a short list of candidates. Christopher Kane, the young English designer who recently consulted on Versace's Versus collection, was reportedly one of them. Mr. Wang, Ms. Guichot said, was the ''top choice.'' Mr. Pinault, who makes the final decision on the hiring of designers, approved.
''We're not asking him to be an entrepreneur,'' Ms. Guichot said. ''But luxury fashion is a business with some rules, and he understood that very early in his career, without ever compromising the creativity.''
Among the observations made on the hiring of Mr. Wang, who has a strong accessories business, having astutely positioned his handbags at the lowest end of the luxury category, is that PPR was looking for its own version of what Mr. Jacobs brought to Louis Vuitton.
''There were some feelings after what happened with John Galliano at Dior that the brands were promoting the individual designers too much,'' the veteran consultant Robert Burke said. ''Now they're thinking, what is it going to take to keep a brand relevant and alive?''
Linda Fargo, the fashion director for Bergdorf Goodman, said there are real ''design chops'' in Mr. Wang's collections. Asked about the complaints that he copies, she said: ''I hands-down do not agree with that. I think he's incredibly original.''
MR. WANG grew up in California. His parents, who had emigrated from China, had a successful plastics manufacturing business that they later moved to Shanghai. Among his classmates at Drew in San Francisco was Victoria Traina, who now works in fashion in New York and was a big influence on Mr. Wang's look, often described as ''off-duty model'' for its slouchy ease and street-wear feeling. Beginning in 2002, he attended Parsons the New School for Design for two years, while working as an intern at Vogue and for the designer Derek Lam.
Then, like many now-famous designers have done, he dropped out to start his own fashion label. With his sister-in-law, Aimie Wang, he started a line of sweaters: six pieces that were sold on consignment. The reaction was so strong that Mr. Wang had a full ready-to-wear collection by 2007, when he became one of the hottest names on the New York fashion calendar. His family remains involved in the privately controlled business, which now has about 140 employees. He will continue to design his own label.
And there was never really any question that it would be that way. Ms. Wintour recalled Mr. Wang's appeal for the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund award (a prize he won in 2008). ''He was so articulate,'' she said. ''He said he wants to dress the girls of his age and his generation. That's what you see in everything he does. He lives and breathes the Alex brand.''
Ms. von Furstenberg, who was assigned to mentor Mr. Wang after the competition, recalled walking into his showroom for the first time. ''There wasn't very much there, but it was all very clear,'' she said. ''His clarity is part of his talent. He knows who he is.''
Part of Mr. Wang's appeal is his connection to the street. He associates with the cool photographers and provocative musicians, and despite showing at the beginning of each season, has his radar attuned to the models of the moment. These qualities were also attractive to Balenciaga. Mr. Ghesquière is one of the best designers at adapting the reality of the everyday life with a strong vision for modernity, and Mr. Pinault said he expects Mr. Wang to build upon that legacy.
Making it profitable will also be important. Tapping into emerging markets like China, India and Brazil will be crucial. In New York last week, while not going so far as to say Mr. Wang was hired because of his heritage, Mr. Pinault gave the impression that it was an advantage.
Increasing profits in countries where luxury is a mature business is very tough, Mr. Pinault said. But in China, where the potential is so strong that economic growth of 5 to 7 percent is seen as a bad year, the possibilities are endless. Making a profit there, he said, ''is an easy job.''

HEADLINE: 4 Cylinders in a Big Car: Sometimes Less Is More

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER JENSEN

 BODY:
Bethlehem, N.H.
IN an engineering move that pursues the delicious -- if elusive -- goal of having one's cake and eating it, too, Ford is offering the 2013 Taurus family sedan with a fuel-efficient turbocharged 4-cylinder engine.In doing so, Ford is going unconventional with its most conventional vehicle, a large sedan with a curb weight of almost two tons.
Not radically unconventional, mind you: small engines are arriving in big cars from many makers, and Ford even offered a 4-cylinder in the original Taurus of 1986, when gas seemed cheap at a pump price of less than $1 a gallon.
The goal in 2013, of course, is to provide full-size accommodations with something closer to pint-size fuel economy. It is a tactic that makes the Taurus, with a combined city-highway rating of 26 m.p.g., the country's most fuel-efficient large traditional sedan, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. In second place is the 2013 Toyota Avalon, with a combined rating of 24 m.p.g.; that car has a 3.5-liter V-6. 
In recent years the once-popular Taurus -- it was America's best-selling car five years running and peaked at more than 400,000 in sales twice in the 1990s -- has had a troubled on-again, off-again existence. When its popularity dimmed to near invisibility, it was replaced by the 2005 Five Hundred. But the Five Hundred was so disappointing that Ford -- in what some saw as desperation -- renamed it Taurus for the 2008 model year.
The base engine in the new Taurus is a 3.5-liter V-6 built in Lima, Ohio, and rated at 288 horsepower. In a reversal of the norm, the extra-cost option is a smaller engine, the 240-horsepower 2-liter EcoBoost 4-cylinder built in Spain. It costs $995.
The EcoBoost 4 is a relatively advanced engine, using not just a turbocharger but also direct injection of gasoline into the combustion chamber, a design intended to provide more power and better fuel economy. Its torque output of 270 pound-feet tops the V-6 engine's 254, and it reaches that peak 1,000 r.p.m. sooner. Both the 2.0 EcoBoost and the V-6 engines are paired with attentive and effective 6-speed automatic transmissions.
The EcoBoost label, incidentally, simply means it is part of a family of Ford engines in various sizes, all sharing turbocharging, direct injection and a higher price.
To Ford's credit, the 2.0 EcoBoost is a stand-alone option on the Taurus and is available on even the least expensive version, the SE. That model has a starting price of $27,395 with the V-6, and adding the EcoBoost engine option inflates the window sticker to $28,390.
With the 2.0 EcoBoost, the Taurus is rated at 22 miles per gallon in town and 32 miles per gallon on the highway. That is 3 m.p.g. better than the standard V-6 in both types of driving.
According to the E.P.A.'s Web site (www.fueleconomy.gov), the EcoBoost would save about $250 a year compared with the V-6. That calculation is based on 15,000 miles a year (55 percent city driving) and 87-octane gas priced at $3.39 a gallon.
Stated another way, to reap any savings from the 2.0 EcoBoost option, an owner would have to keep the car almost four years -- though it could pay off sooner if gas prices zoomed or if the car were driven an extraordinary number of miles.
The Taurus can be ordered with all-wheel drive, though the 2.0 EcoBoost is available only on front-drive models, including the Limited version that I tested.
The test car had a starting price of $33,795, including a $795 destination charge. Ford then added $6,880 in options, including the EcoBoost ($995); navigation system ($795) and adaptive cruise control and collision warning ($1,195).
There was also a $3,500 package with a long list of features including a heated steering wheel, heated and cooled front seats, heated rear seats, an automatic parallel-parking system, a Sony audio system and blind-spot monitors. The total sticker price was $40,675.
Particularly with all the creature comforts, the Taurus is a pleasant and accommodating large sedan. The front seats are comfortable, a good compromise of soft and supportive, making a five-hour stretch on the road possible.
But rear legroom is only adequate for a 6-foot adult. Its 38.1 inches is 0.2 inch less than in the 2013 Ford Fusion, a midsize car.
The 20-cubic foot trunk is huge, however.
Ford's notorious and ill-conceived MyFord Touch system continues as the bad boy of ergonomics despite the automaker's attempts at rehabilitation. It is supposed to make controlling everything from the audio system to the climate control easier, but it doesn't. It just makes things that should be simple, like changing the temperature, more complicated.
A voice-control system offers an alternative. But it can be a chore, requiring several steps to do something that one should be able to handle with one twist of an old-fashioned knob.
On my test car, the touch screen sometimes had to be touched several times before the system responded. During one daylong drive, the lower part of the navigation screen went blank for about eight hours, and then returned. Ford said its dealer was not able to duplicate the problem.
Whether on the Interstate or on a country two-lane, the Taurus offers a comfortable ride with the kind of dutiful but unenthusiastic handling that one expects from a large family car. For drivers who want a greater level of engagement, Ford offers the Taurus SHO with more power and a sport suspension.
Even with three adults and a trunk filled with luggage, the 4-cylinder Taurus easily ambled along at 70 m.p.h. on the Interstate, and it has adequate power for merging onto freeways among New York City's less-than-forgiving drivers.
The issue is not the car's accelerative potency, but its refinement. Under even moderate acceleration there is a level of 4-cylinder noise and vibration that would be marginally acceptable in a modestly priced sedan, but seems out of place in an upscale car like the Taurus Limited.
Over 350 highway miles -- at typical speeds of 65 to 75 m.p.h. -- I got 27 m.p.g. That's a huge 5 m.p.g. less than the E.P.A. estimate, but I was driving in hilly terrain with a heavy load.
Ford is hoping the improvements to the Taurus, as well as the 2.0 EcoBoost engine, will help win sales, which haven't been great.
Through the first 11 months of the year, Ford sold 67,471 vehicles, including some police cars and fleet sales, according to LMC Automotive, a market research firm.
That compares with 159,710 Chevrolet Impalas, 63,572 Chrysler 300s, 74,725 Dodge Chargers and 55,212 Nissan Maximas, LMC said.
The auto industry can be a rude and disappointing arena, and Toyota will try to spoil things with its redesigned Avalon, which goes on sale this month.
The E.P.A. ratings for the Avalon with a 268-horsepower V-6 will be only 1 m.p.g. lower for both city and highway use than the 4-cylinder Taurus.
There will also be a hybrid version of the Avalon with a 4-cylinder engine, which Toyota says will be rated at 40 m.p.g. in town and 39 on the highway. However, the least expensive V-6 Avalon will be $31,785, which includes leather upholstery and heated front seats. Direct comparisons can be tricky because of variations in standard equipment.
The least expensive Avalon Hybrid will be $36,350.
In each of the last three years, Toyota never sold more than 29,000 Avalons, which is not much more than a curious footnote in the large-sedan segment.
So, yes, the 2013 Taurus with the 2.0 EcoBoost is a pleasing combination. But the package is hardly compelling because its strongest draw -- the lure of better fuel economy -- is undermined by the extra $1,000 that it costs.
INSIDE TRACK: Ho-hum.

HEADLINE: Subverting The Standard Survey

BYLINE: By MARTHA SCHWENDENER

 BODY:
An impressive selection of 79 artworks dating from the 1700s to the present makes up ''Artists in America: Highlights of the Collection From the New Britain Museum of American Art'' at the Nassau County Museum of Art in Roslyn Harbor. But while the museum's Web site says the exhibition ''surveys 300 years of great American painting,'' the show isn't arranged as a historical survey at all. Instead, it reflects recent curatorial trends, which lean toward mash-up or collage aesthetics, with paintings hung in pairs or groupings that consciously disrupt the flow of linear history.
A wall text near the beginning of the exhibition explains (or perhaps warns) that the installation, culled from the holdings of the New Britain Museum of American Art in Connecticut, encourages viewers ''to compare and contrast works of art across historical periods'' rather than illustrating ''familiar trajectories and broad stylistic changes.'' 
So how does ''Artists in America'' fare at subverting the standard, chronological installation? There are many moments when the current arrangement tells us more, or different things, about art and history than the traditional ''hang.'' For instance, Ralph Earl's ''Gentleman With Attendant,'' from around 1785 to 1788, an oil-on-canvas painting, depicts an unidentified Caucasian ''gentleman'' with a much younger African-American ''attendant.'' An accompanying wall text tells us that the boy, possibly a slave, is painted with his mouth open and showing his teeth in a manner deemed inappropriate for members of 18th-century American society. This information suggests how the painting both reproduces and underscores racism and social and economic distinctions in early America during the slavery era.
Earl's painting is hung, however, next to ''Early Morning'' (1964) by Romare Bearden, one of the great collage artists of the past century. Not only has Bearden used vastly different materials, but he has also placed an unidentified young African-American man at the center of the work and, using Cubist-inspired techniques, superimposed the eyes of the young man, cut from different photographic sources, onto an African mask. And Bearden himself was African-American, suggesting a different relationship among artist, subject and race in America. In a hallway nearby are Thomas Hart Benton's black-and-white studies for ''Arts of the South,'' a section from the mural ''The Arts of Life in America,'' executed for the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1932, which sets up a third scenario: a white artist sympathetically documenting the mistreatment of African-Americans over the course of United States history.
Another gallery features a lineup of paintings that highlight a different strain of history and culture: the emphasis on nature and landscape in American art. Here you find a Thomas Cole painting, ''The Clove, Catskills,'' from around 1826 -- an early representative of the Hudson River School, arguably the United States' first internationally recognized lineage of painters -- hung next to a Stuart Davis painting curiously titled ''Analogical Emblem Landscape'' (1933).
Where Cole's painting shows an early-19th-century artist adopting nature as a signature American theme, complete with golden lighting and allegorical, political and spiritual overtones, Davis's nearly abstract canvas with a bisected tree at its center suggests that this emphasis on nature endured well into the modern era. (This is cheating somewhat, since Davis's best-known works deployed advertising and commercial packaging motifs and were painted in what Karen Wilkin describes, in a wall text excerpted from the New Britain Museum's collection catalog, as a ''homemade version of Cubism.'')
Hung in the same gallery are paintings by Albert Bierstadt, John Frederick Kensett, James McNeill Whistler and John Henry Twachtman that further the American-landscape thesis -- but also a startling Precisionist cityscape of New York by Georgia O'Keeffe, made in the late 1920s before she forged a new version of modernism in the American West.
Similar idiosyncratic groupings appear throughout the museum. There is a wall of people -- mostly portraits, but also some paintings of unidentified individuals -- that ranges from the society portraiture of John Singer Sargent (the 10-year-old ''Miss Cara Burch'' from 1888 is very naturalistic, but was not a critical success) to Robert Henri's consciously rustic ''Spanish Girl of Segovia'' (1912). The latter employs, as does John Sloan's ''Main Street, Gloucester'' (1917), the color system of Hardesty Maratta, an artist and theoretician, which used the notes in a musical scale as its basis.
Upstairs you find a quirky trio: an untitled, slightly macabre Cindy Sherman photograph of herself from 2000, flanked on one side by William Michael Harnett's ''Still Life With Violin'' (1886) and Severin Roesen's allegorical picture of abundance, ''Fruit and Wine Glass,'' from around 1860 to 1865, which together suggest different attitudes toward objects, culture and consumption.
Also in this room are works by artists from one of America's first families of painting, the Peales: a sedate ''Bowl of Peaches'' (1816) by Raphaelle Peale, the country's first professional still-life painter, and ''Mrs. Charles Ridgely Carroll,'' circa 1822, by his cousin Sarah Miriam Peale, one of the first women to be a professional painter in the United States. Downstairs is a portrait of an unidentified ''New England Merchant'' (1765) by her famous uncle -- Raphaelle's father -- Charles Willson Peale. While it is somewhat unusual to see the Peales distributed throughout a historical show in this fashion -- rather than highlighted as monuments of American art history -- it makes for a pleasingly democratic and unorthodox viewing experience.
To get to these smaller pairings and groupings, however, you have to approach ''Artists in America'' through its larger framework, and here is where the show falters somewhat. For rather than devoting specific rooms to landscape, still life or portraiture -- which is basically what has happened anyway -- or even wilder categories like American adaptations of Cubism or themes of geographical and spiritual displacement, the curators have divided the show into a series of ''question words,'' which are posted on the walls in individual galleries: Who? What? When? Where? Why? How?
Central to journalism and to police investigations, they feel simplistic and trivializing in this context. After all, as the artworks themselves demonstrate, ideas, meanings and histories are put into play when you juxtapose even two artworks on a wall. Three hundred years of American art cannot be summed up and surveyed by factually answering these questions.
''Artists in America: Highlights of the Collection From the New Britain Museum of American Art'' is at the Nassau County Museum of Art, 1 Museum Drive, Roslyn Harbor, through Feb. 24. Information: (516) 484-9337 or nassaumuseum.org.

HEADLINE: Clinton's Countless Choices Hinge on One: 2016

BYLINE: By JODI KANTOR; Michael Barbaro and Amy Chozick contributed reporting.

 BODY:
You're one of the most famous women on earth, and you're jobless for the first time in decades. You'd like to make money, but you don't want to rule out running for president. So what do you do all day?
Right now, aides and friends say, Hillary Rodham Clinton's plan looks like this: exit the State Department shortly after Inauguration Day and then seclude herself to rest and reflect on what she wants to do for the next few years. Those who have invited her for 2013 engagements have been told not to even ask again until April or May.
She and her husband would like to buy a house in the Hamptons or upstate New York, several friends said, and Mrs. Clinton will finally have more time for everyday activities like exercise (last summer, between world crises, she was squeezing in 6 a.m. sessions at a pool with a trainer).
She is likely to use her husband's foundation as at least a temporary perch, several former aides said, and she has been considering a new book -- not a painful examination of her failed 2008 presidential bid, as she once proposed, but a more upbeat look at her time as secretary of state. 
For the moment, Mrs. Clinton may appear to be a figure of nearly limitless possibility, and her name has come up for prestigious jobs: president of Yale University, head of George Soros's foundation. But being Hillary Clinton is never a simple matter, and her next few years are less a blank check than an equation with multiple variables. Her status is singular but complicated: half an ex-presidential partnership, a woman at the peak of her influence who will soon find herself without portfolio, and an instant presidential front-runner (a title that did not work out well last time).
Mrs. Clinton may find that her freedom comes with one huge constraint. The more serious she is about 2016, the less she can do -- no frank, seen-it-all memoir; no clients, commissions or controversial positions that could prove problematic. She will be under heavy scrutiny even by Clinton standards, discovering what it means to be a supposedly private citizen in the age of Twitter. With the election four years away -- a political eon -- she will have to tend and protect her popularity, and she may find herself in a cushy kind of limbo, unable to make many decisions about her life until she makes the big one about another White House try.
''If you're thinking about running for president, does that affect everything else?'' asked former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, who once agonized over the same choice and whose son Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo may find his own prospects shaped by what Mrs. Clinton decides. ''Yes. Once you make your decision, everything clears up.''
Still, Mrs. Clinton faces some immediate choices, which nearly two dozen current and former aides, friends and donors described:
¶ Should she team up with her husband again?
Last summer, Bill Clinton expressed doubt about whether his wife would join forces with him at the foundation that bears his name. ''She has to decide what's best for her,'' he said in an interview. ''It might be better for her and she might have a bigger impact if she has a separate operation.''
The question is a fraught one. The climactic moment of Mrs. Clinton's career came in 2000, when after years of supporting her husband's campaigns and jobs, she struck out as a solo artist. Would rejoining his team be a step backward? Many aides said no. ''She's revered and admired as her own person,'' said Lissa Muscatine, her longtime adviser.
Still, some former aides said it was difficult to imagine Mrs. Clinton comfortable at the foundation in its current form. It is organized entirely around the former president, the endowment is small, and even supporters acknowledge that it lacks the organization of, say, the Gates Foundation. The group has made strides lately, with a new director of fund-raising and more involvement from Chelsea Clinton.
Mrs. Clinton could do a trial run there, ''testing the structure,'' as one former aide put it. That way, she would have a home for the longtime advisers who are expected to stay with her. And by joining her husband's operation, she could save the considerable time, money and effort it would take to start her own -- which might be disbanded anyway if she runs in 2016.
¶ Should she do what she wants or what makes the most political sense?
Of all the issues Mrs. Clinton has worked on over the years, the one nearest her heart is improving the status of women and children around the world. As the first lady of Arkansas, she brought Dr. Muhammad Yunus, later a Nobel Peace Prize winner, to set up a microlending program there. She turned her tenure as secretary of state into a sustained argument that women's welfare is central to security and economic stability, championing projects like milk cooperatives in Malawi and support networks for self-employed women in India. Now her desire is to be ''a professional advocate,'' as her daughter put it to a reporter.
Ann Lewis, a longtime adviser, echoed that. ''In the last four years, she has seen firsthand the difference she can make for women and girls,'' she said.
But even if Mrs. Clinton returns full time to her activist feminist roots, it is not yet clear exactly where she would begin: the topic is diffuse by its very nature. Nor is a campaign for, say, safer cookstoves in China the obvious way to win over voters in Iowa -- and her work could touch on issues, including reproductive health, that could prove sensitive.
But former aides say that Mrs. Clinton drew a lesson from her 2008 run: she believes that the country approves of her, and of female candidates in general, when they appear to be serving others rather than seeking power out of personal ambition. By that logic, Mrs. Clinton's interest in helping poor women around the world would not hurt her politically in 2016 and might add to her current politician-above-politics luster.
Her former aides also agree that she was too cautious in the early months of her last campaign and hurt herself by hiding her real passions. Regardless of whether she runs, telling Mrs. Clinton not to focus on women would be like ''telling Al Gore not to talk about the environment,'' said Paul Begala, a longtime adviser to Mr. Clinton. (Mr. Gore did not always emphasize his knowledge on the subject in 2000, which later looked unwise.)
¶ What is the most dignified way for her to make money?
Being a Clinton is expensive, and when the former secretary leaves office, she'll want a staff and the ability to travel on private planes, friends say. The Clintons -- who already own costly homes in Washington and Chappaqua, N.Y. -- love renting in the Hamptons in the summer, according to friends, and buying their own home there could easily run well into the seven figures. Though friends say Mrs. Clinton could easily make a lot of money at a law firm, advising foreign countries on geopolitical risk, or at an investment bank or a private equity firm, none of those pursuits would be likely to wear well in a presidential campaign.
Instead, Mrs. Clinton is expected to take on lucrative speaking engagements -- maybe even joint speeches with her husband, which could command record prices -- and write one or more books. After she lost in 2008, she was on the cusp of signing with her old publishing house, Simon & Schuster, for a book about her failed bid, for slightly less than the $8 million advance she earned for her 2003 memoir, ''Living History,'' according to someone involved in the negotiations. In meetings to discuss the book, that person recalled, she was quite critical of Mr. Obama. But then he drafted her for his Cabinet -- and it is unclear if she will ever share her true feelings about that race.
¶ How should she navigate the nonstop speculation about 2016?
For her last presidential run, Mrs. Clinton declared her candidacy nearly two years before Election Day -- but the timing did not feel right to her, because it made the race endless, say former aides who hint she would wait much longer if she made a bid again.
The enormously disciplined Mrs. Clinton has stuck to the same story in public and private: She's not running. That is what she told Elie Wiesel, the Nobel laureate and an old friend, when she and her family dined with him recently, according to Mr. Wiesel. Others close to her emphasize that no one knows otherwise, not even Mrs. Clinton herself. ''Be very wary of those pretending to bear actual knowledge,'' said Philippe Reines, her State Department spokesman.
Bill Clinton, however, sometimes cannot keep himself from verbally gaming out another campaign for her, said a friend who recently spent time with him. ''Every indication is that he would really want her to run,'' the friend said.
The speculation is not without its advantages. If Mrs. Clinton is not running, she is a widely respected figure whose chief accomplishments are mostly behind her; if she may be running, she glows with White House and historic potential. ''Nobody interacts with Hillary Clinton like she's fading off into the sunset,'' Mr. Reines said.

HEADLINE: New Taxes to Take Effect to Fund Health Care Law

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- For more than a year, politicians have been fighting over whether to raise taxes on high-income people. They rarely mention that affluent Americans will soon be hit with new taxes adopted as part of the 2010 health care law.
The new levies, which take effect in January, include an increase in the payroll tax on wages and a tax on investment income, including interest, dividends and capital gains. The Obama administration proposed rules to enforce both last week. 
Affluent people are much more likely than low-income people to have health insurance, and now they will, in effect, help pay for coverage for many lower-income families. Among the most affluent fifth of households, those affected will see tax increases averaging $6,000 next year, economists estimate.
To help finance Medicare, employees and employers each now pay a hospital insurance tax equal to 1.45 percent on all wages. Starting in January, the health care law will require workers to pay an additional tax equal to 0.9 percent of any wages over $200,000 for single taxpayers and $250,000 for married couples filing jointly.
The new taxes on wages and investment income are expected to raise $318 billion over 10 years, or about half of all the new revenue collected under the health care law.
Ruth M. Wimer, a tax lawyer at McDermott Will & Emery, said the taxes came with ''a shockingly inequitable marriage penalty.'' If a single man and a single woman each earn $200,000, she said, neither would owe any additional Medicare payroll tax. But, she said, if they are married, they would owe $1,350. The extra tax is 0.9 percent of their earnings over the $250,000 threshold.
Since the creation of Social Security in the 1930s, payroll taxes have been levied on the wages of each worker as an individual. The new Medicare payroll is different. It will be imposed on the combined earnings of a married couple.
Employers are required to withhold Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes from wages paid to employees. But employers do not necessarily know how much a worker's spouse earns and may not withhold enough to cover a couple's Medicare tax liability. Indeed, the new rules say employers may disregard a spouse's earnings in calculating how much to withhold.
Workers may thus owe more than the amounts withheld by their employers and may have to make up the difference when they file tax returns in April 2014. If they expect to owe additional tax, the government says, they should make estimated tax payments, starting in April 2013, or ask their employers to increase the amount withheld from each paycheck.
In the Affordable Care Act, the new tax on investment income is called an ''unearned income Medicare contribution.'' However, the law does not provide for the money to be deposited in a specific trust fund. It is added to the government's general tax revenues and can be used for education, law enforcement, farm subsidies or other purposes.
Donald B. Marron Jr., the director of the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, said the burden of this tax would be borne by the most affluent taxpayers, with about 85 percent of the revenue coming from 1 percent of taxpayers. By contrast, the biggest potential beneficiaries of the law include people with modest incomes who will receive Medicaid coverage or federal subsidies to buy private insurance.
Wealthy people and their tax advisers are already looking for ways to minimize the impact of the investment tax -- for example, by selling stocks and bonds this year to avoid the higher tax rates in 2013.
The new 3.8 percent tax applies to the net investment income of certain high-income taxpayers, those with modified adjusted gross incomes above $200,000 for single taxpayers and $250,000 for couples filing jointly.
David J. Kautter, the director of the Kogod Tax Center at American University, offered this example. In 2013, John earns $160,000, and his wife, Jane, earns $200,000. They have some investments, earn $5,000 in dividends and sell some long-held stock for a gain of $40,000, so their investment income is $45,000. They owe 3.8 percent of that amount, or $1,710, in the new investment tax. And they owe $990 in additional payroll tax.
The new tax on unearned income would come on top of other tax increases that might occur automatically next year if President Obama and Congress cannot reach an agreement in talks on the federal deficit and debt. If Congress does nothing, the tax rate on long-term capital gains, now 15 percent, will rise to 20 percent in January. Dividends will be treated as ordinary income and taxed at a maximum rate of 39.6 percent, up from the current 15 percent rate for most dividends.
Under another provision of the health care law, consumers may find it more difficult to obtain a tax break for medical expenses.
Taxpayers now can take an itemized deduction for unreimbursed medical expenses, to the extent that they exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income. The health care law will increase the threshold for most taxpayers to 10 percent next year. The increase is delayed to 2017 for people 65 and older.
In addition, workers face a new $2,500 limit on the amount they can contribute to flexible spending accounts used to pay medical expenses. Such accounts can benefit workers by allowing them to pay out-of-pocket expenses with pretax money.
Taken together, this provision and the change in the medical expense deduction are expected to raise more than $40 billion of revenue over 10 years.

HEADLINE: Tebow Divided Hometown Without Even Taking a Snap

BYLINE: By BEN SHPIGEL

 BODY:
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- This was the first night of the 2010 N.F.L. draft, the draft that contained the player who could deliver excitement and relevancy, if not necessarily victories, to Raef Godwin's beloved Jacksonville Jaguars.
Could they pick Tim Tebow? Would they?
The Jaguars' pick, the 10th over all, scrolled across the bottom of the television screen: Tyson Alualu, defensive tackle, California.
''Instant deflation,'' Godwin said.
Godwin harbored no illusions that Tebow, taken at No. 25 by Denver, would be a panacea, that his presence alone would herald a teal-and-gold revival for a team with many ills, that he even merited a first-round selection. It was merely that these were extenuating circumstances, and he wanted the Jaguars to recognize what he did: rarely can a team with sagging ticket sales, without a national profile or star power, solve all three problems at once by drafting a native son. 
''Worst case, he's a P.R. bonanza, a merchandise machine and a ticket-sales driver,'' said Godwin, the director of advertising operations for the PGA Tour. ''Best case, he does all of that, and the Jags are competitive. Then you've got Larry Bird in Indiana.''
Or, rather, the next Archie Manning -- another legend of Southern football, a revered player for a terrible hometown team with an image that no 12-loss season can tarnish. With such struggles, the Jaguars are familiar. They are 2-10, assured of missing the playoffs for the 11th time in 13 seasons, heading into Sunday's game against the Jets (5-7) and Tebow.
What might have been is a subject that, nearly three years later, remains as polarizing here as the player.
The debate ensnared the Jaguars' new owner, Shahid Khan, who told a local radio station in January that ''100 percent'' he would have drafted Tebow, and it continues to divide the city as much as the St. Johns River.
Thousands of additional tickets sold. Tebow jerseys moved by the truckload, expanding the Jaguars' brand nationwide and overseas. More prime-time games and, thus, more exposure for a city starving for attention. Already a strong presence in the community, Tebow could have lived here year-round and increased his involvement.
This much the factions seem to agree on. But they diverge on two critical points, at the intersection of his marketing value and his football potential.
''How good a player would he have been, and would his impact have been sustainable?'' said Frank Frangie, a sports radio talk-show host. ''Get me 100 people, and you'll get 100 different opinions, all passionate. Either that, or you'll get two opinions 50 times.''
In Jacksonville's sporting history, Frangie said, only two days ''blew the roof off this place'': when it was awarded an N.F.L. franchise, and when it was awarded Super Bowl XXXIX. If Tebow had landed in Jacksonville through the draft or a trade, a possibility last March before Denver traded him to the Jets, Frangie said, ''the hysteria would have been comparable.''
In this college hotbed, practically a football suburb of Gainesville, where Tebow won two national titles with the Florida Gators, sectionalism runs rampant. The same people who recall Tebow's dominance at Nease High School in nearby Ponte Vedra Beach -- where he won a state title, where he unwittingly played with a broken fibula against Pedro Menendez High of St. Augustine, where he once ran over a safety from Palatka, carrying four defenders to gain an extra 15 yards -- might have opposed his arrival just because of their loyalty to Florida State or Georgia.
''But it wouldn't stop anyone from watching,'' said Mannie Wellington, a former teammate of Tebow's at Nease. ''People want to see if he's going to fail or if he's going to succeed, and that's the reality of it.''
So much so, Frangie said, that he could have envisioned a surge in season tickets, a sold-out EverBank Field populated by fans in half-Jaguar, half-Gator jerseys.
''No one knows the exact number, but it's Tyson Alualu plus X,'' said Godwin, who called Tebow a potential ''cash machine'' for the franchise. ''Not one person bought a ticket saying, I think this Alualu guy's going to be the real deal. The hard-core Gator fans, they would have doubled down to get seats.''
Attendance, though, is not as much of a problem, at least not anymore. Despite gaps of empty seats, a team once synonymous with television blackouts has had every home game televised locally since 2010. But it was far different three years ago, when the Jaguars ranked 31st in the league, filling their stadium to 73.9 percent of capacity. There was fear the team would move, possibly to Los Angeles. Charlie Crist, the governor at the time, lobbied ownership to choose Tebow.
''Back in those days, I was trying to sell tickets, and people kept asking me how much easier would it be if they drafted Tebow,'' said Carl Cannon, a former publisher of The Florida Times-Union, who assisted in that 2010 push to stimulate interest. ''I said, Man, it would be so, so, so much easier.''
Crist's public acknowledgment gave rise to the theory that the Jaguars' business side would drive a football decision, an awkward and unwieldy situation that their general manager, Gene Smith, debunked again and again. Tony Boselli, a former offensive tackle who is perhaps the best player in franchise history, said he was a fan of Tebow's, but added that winning was what improved marketing and stabilized a franchise.
Smith declined an interview request through a team spokesman, saying he does not discuss the dynamics of the team's drafts.
The modest returns of those drafts have contributed to the franchise's decay, with only one playoff victory since 1999. Andrew Chapman was 15 then, and the Jaguars' three losses that season -- all to Tennessee -- crushed him. Now 28, he represents a growing demographic of fans, those of an age, and an income level, that find investing in season tickets appealing as well as feasible. The Tebow factor complicates things.
''I'm of the opinion that it was in his best interest to not be drafted by the Jaguars,'' Chapman said, ''but I don't know that it was in the Jaguars' best interest not to draft him.''
There are fans like Josh Ashby, a season-ticket holder for eight years, who said he ''would rather lose more games without him than win more games with him'' because, they contend, Tebow would stunt the short-term progress and long-term development of the franchise. Ashby also questioned how long fans would adore him if the team failed to show improvement.
''He might solve some of the off-the-field problems,'' Ashby said. ''But if you're truly interested in winning football games, he's not your answer.''
And then there are those like John Pramuka, who has missed two games since 1995. His admiration of Tebow trumps his allegiance to the Jaguars. Rattling off their many draft missteps -- R. Jay Soward, Reggie Williams, Matt Jones, Derrick Harvey, Quentin Groves -- Pramuka asked whether Tebow would have failed, too. The question is rhetorical. ''I want to be entertained week in and week out, and because we don't have the level of talent that other teams do, the Jags have failed to do that,'' said Pramuka, a Connecticut native who moved here in 1990. ''If I had the choice today of Tim Tebow being here or the Jaguars winning the Super Bowl next year, I'd probably pick Tebow.''
Pramuka showed a visitor to his home, in Jacksonville Beach, a collection of No. 15 Tebow jerseys -- from Florida, from the Broncos, from the Jets and from the Jaguars, wishful thinking in size XL.
When Tebow was a junior, Pramuka printed a few thousand ''Draft Tebow'' bumper stickers. He sold some, gave away far more -- including one to Tebow's mother, Pam, who replied with a thank-you note -- and later enlarged one that he hung on a fence near the stadium two days before the draft, to no avail.
Had the Jaguars somehow maneuvered to draft him, Frangie said, Tebow would have ranked among the franchise's five most popular players, just by signing a contract. And if Tebow had led the Jaguars to glory?
''What would Archie Manning have been if the Saints had won the Super Bowl?'' Godwin said. ''New Orleans would have had a statue 40 feet high of him. Here, with Tebow, it would have been 80.''

HEADLINE: Party's Over For Snooki And the Gang

BYLINE: By DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
EAST HANOVER, N.J.
RELAXING in a pedicure chair one October morning here at a favorite nail salon, Nicole Polizzi, the diminutive troublemaker and reality-TV star known as Snooki on ''Jersey Shore,'' was explaining that she would wait until her infant son, Lorenzo, was 15 or 16 before sharing with him her goofy, boozy escapades from that MTV series.
''That's when kids start to go out and have their first drink, go to parties and things,'' said Ms. Polizzi, 25, who had recently returned from a tanning-products convention in Nashville. ''I'm going to say: 'You know what? Mommy was just 21 years old, doing what everybody else does. She just had a camera following her.' ''
Ms. Polizzi seemed to know exactly what she'd be doing in some far-off future, when she is laying down the rules rather than flouting them. But when it came to the nearer term -- basically, any time after Dec. 20, when MTV will broadcast the final episode of ''Jersey Shore'' -- she expressed an uncertainty shared by her soon-to-be ex-housemates. 
''Because 'Jersey Shore' made us,'' she said, ''so it's like, what now?''
Incredibly it was only three years ago that MTV ran its first episode of ''Jersey Shore,'' its documentary-style account of four muscle-bound guys and four impossibly orange women partying down and hooking up in Seaside Heights, N.J.
Over six rapid-fire seasons, including excursions to Miami and Florence, Italy, ''Jersey Shore'' became one of MTV's biggest hits ever, drawing nearly nine million viewers an episode at its peak and introducing terms like ''smooshing'' and the gym-tanning-laundry shortcut ''G.T.L.'' (among less savory acronyms) to the American lexicon.
The series has also elevated its distinctively monikered cast members like Michael Sorrentino (a k a the Situation), Jenni Farley (JWoww) and Paul DelVecchio (Pauly D), making them the envy of unemployed milliennials, the scorn of Italian-American advocacy groups and unlikely ambassadors of their hurricane-devastated coastal escape.
But now these improbable celebrities are bracing themselves for a different kind of reality, when the parties and press tours -- and the cornerstone TV show that supported them -- go away, leaving viewers to take stock of why they tuned in, and its subjects to wonder if their fame could fade as rapidly as it arrived.
''We were regular people a couple years ago,'' said Vinny Guadagnino, a ''Jersey Shore'' star. ''I don't want it to stop.''
At an Italian lunch in the West Village with the other men of ''Jersey Shore,'' Mr. Guadagnino said MTV had been vowing to cancel the show almost from its first season, possibly to see how the housemates would react. ''We always think they're bluffing,'' he said.
Chris Linn, MTV's executive vice president for programming, said by telephone that the decision to end ''Jersey Shore'' -- for real -- came down to its cast ''moving on to the next stages of adulthood.''
With milestones like the birth of Ms. Polizzi's son and Ms. Farley's engagement, Mr. Linn said, the series ''was moving away from the original conceit, and rather than drive it into the ground or milk it to the very, very end, we wanted to give it a dignified send-off.'' (In a current season more about personal reflection than gratification, the show has also seen its numbers ebb to under four million viewers an episode, though it remains strong among the younger audience MTV covets.)
When that final day of taping ''Jersey Shore'' occurred in the summer, and its housemates were allowed for the first time to interact directly with crew members and onlookers, ''I had a nervous breakdown in the middle of the street, crying,'' Ms. Farley said. ''It was so bittersweet. That's the house that changed my life.''
As Ms. Farley and her co-stars Samantha Giancola and Deena Nicole Cortese sipped ginger ales and Diet Cokes at a Times Square hotel bar, the women, attired in animal-print outfits, said they had come onto ''Jersey Shore'' with minimal expectations. Yet they were well prepared by the wide range of reality shows they had watched, from great-grandparents of the genre like ''The Real World'' to more recent offerings like ''Real Housewives'' and ''Bad Girls Club.'' They knew that there would be no privacy from the cameras rolling 24/7, and that the editing would not always portray them in flattering light.
''I say everything on that show is completely real,'' said Ms. Giancola, whose on-and-off romance with her co-star Ronnie Ortiz-Magro was a long-running ''Jersey Shore'' soap opera. ''What I said is real, how I acted is real. But it is a TV show, and you're only seeing 45 minutes. You're not seeing the full picture of everything.''
Mr. Sorrentino, who is gentler and more humble since a stint he did in a substance-abuse rehab program this year, agreed, in his own way, that ''Jersey Shore'' had not always allowed its ensemble members to display their full range of emotions and abilities. ''We're all very dense human beings with lots of different facets,'' he said. ''And I think you only get to see that one side -- the party side.''
Perhaps more than their constant falling down, their drunken fistfights and shouting matches, it was the cast members' rare aptitude for expressing themselves, candidly and without varnish, that won them acknowledgment from President Obama and fans like Leonardo DiCaprio.
Maybe it was the way they reaffirmed viewers' understanding of a certain middle-class vacation culture, or introduced it to audiences who found it completely alien. Or maybe, as the ''Jersey Shore'' executive producer SallyAnn Salsano argues, the series took the place of coming-of-age dramas like ''Beverly Hills 90210'' or the John Hughes movies from her youth.
''For all of their faults they're actually really good kids,'' said Ms. Salsano, who is 38 and spent many summers in Jersey Shore share houses. ''I did the same thing. I lived in my parents' house in my mid-20s, making more money than my dad, but they were making my lunch and putting gas in my car.''
For several of its stars ''Jersey Shore'' represented the first time they'd lived on their own, cooked their own meals or checked themselves onto airplanes without a parent's assistance.
To the men it was an introduction to life with women who did not conform to traditional stereotypes. ''You get these girls, and they're drinking out of bowls, their underwear's falling down,'' Mr. Ortiz-Magro said. ''I'm not used to that.''
To the women the show was a crash course in coping with the criticism they have come to expect at appearances and on their widely followed Twitter accounts.
When Ms. Cortese joined ''Jersey Shore'' in Season 3 and was told by some viewers that she looked heavy, she said, ''People would be like, 'Don't listen to them.' But it always got me. I was like, 'I'm seeing myself gain weight.' ''
Among the men and women there was disagreement over just how famous ''Jersey Shore'' had made them and to what that renown entitled them.
''I don't consider myself a celebrity,'' Ms. Farley said. ''It's hard to think of yourself as a celebrity when you're just yourself.''
Mr. Guadagnino, however, said the ''Jersey Shore'' housemates had become ''A-list celebrities overnight,'' then backed off slightly, adding that the show had put them ''in the A-list crowd.'' (''I won't give myself too much credit,'' he said.)
Mr. Ortiz-Magro said he was confident that ''if we want this to become something more after 'Jersey Shore,' it's going to become something more.''
Mr. Guadagnino said his dream was ''to be on a scripted TV show, a series, maybe get a pilot -- not as the main character, just a role in the show.'' (''What a humble guy, huh?'' Mr. DelVecchio teased him.)
Make no mistake: Every member of the ''Jersey Shore'' troupe is now his or her own start-up business, whether it is Mr. DelVecchio's thriving career as a D.J. or the array of licensed products they each endorse -- energy drinks, fragrances, sunglasses and slippers.
As they perceive it these side careers are independent from -- and as important as -- their status as reality-TV idols. As Ms. Polizzi put it: ''I don't care if I'm famous or not. I just want to have my brand.''
But Ms. Salsano cautioned that this visibility, in whatever form it takes, would not endure for all of them. ''I'll say: 'Don't get used to it. Enjoy it, but it's not staying. And listen, God bless you if it does,' '' she said.
Reality stars who have built lasting careers were the exception rather than the rule. ''But I've done a bazillion of these reality shows,'' said Ms. Salsano, who also produces shows like ''Tattoo Nightmares'' and ''Nail Files,'' ''and I've never seen a cast go from zero to 100 like this.''
MTV is certain too that its own youth-culture brand will survive the loss of its most popular series. ''We were in a similar situation post-'Laguna Beach,' post-'Hills,' post-'Beavis and Butt-Head,' post-'The Osbournes,' '' Mr. Linn said. ''We've always found a way to reinvent and to stay connected with our audience.''
For MTV that crop of potential successors includes shows that star ''Jersey Shore'' alumni, like the spinoff ''Snooki & JWoww'' (which, after a moderately successful first season, resumes in January) and a talk show hosted by Mr. Guadagnino and set at his family home in Staten Island. No one is predicting that the reality-television genre has run its course, but Ms. Salsano said there was no harm in MTV giving the ''Jersey Shore'' franchise a rest.
''It's O.K. for people to miss things,'' she said. ''But that's the American culture. You love something so much, you have it till you don't want it anymore. And then you're like, 'Uch, I can't eat pizza again.' ''
Some cast members have at least begun to contemplate the possibility of a life without cameras and constant attention. If her own talk-show hosting aspirations do not pan out, Ms. Polizzi said, she would be satisfied to become a veterinary technician. Ms. Cortese said she could open a salon.
Other dreams, simpler and yet fleetingly elusive, would also seem to be within their grasp. When a follower on Twitter wrote to Ms. Cortese that ''normal is how u perceive normal not what someone else tells you,'' she replied, ''yes and I can't wait to be my normal again.''
For good measure she threw in an ''lol'' at the end.

HEADLINE: Profiting From a Child's Illiteracy

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
JACKSON, Ky.
THIS is what poverty sometimes looks like in America: parents here in Appalachian hill country pulling their children out of literacy classes. Moms and dads fear that if kids learn to read, they are less likely to qualify for a monthly check for having an intellectual disability.
Many people in hillside mobile homes here are poor and desperate, and a $698 monthly check per child from the Supplemental Security Income program goes a long way -- and those checks continue until the child turns 18.
''The kids get taken out of the program because the parents are going to lose the check,'' said Billie Oaks, who runs a literacy program here in Breathitt County, a poor part of Kentucky. ''It's heartbreaking.'' 
This is painful for a liberal to admit, but conservatives have a point when they suggest that America's safety net can sometimes entangle people in a soul-crushing dependency. Our poverty programs do rescue many people, but other times they backfire.
Some young people here don't join the military (a traditional escape route for poor, rural Americans) because it's easier to rely on food stamps and disability payments.
Antipoverty programs also discourage marriage: In a means-tested program like S.S.I., a woman raising a child may receive a bigger check if she refrains from marrying that hard-working guy she likes. Yet marriage is one of the best forces to blunt poverty. In married couple households only one child in 10 grows up in poverty, while almost half do in single-mother households.
Most wrenching of all are the parents who think it's best if a child stays illiterate, because then the family may be able to claim a disability check each month.
''One of the ways you get on this program is having problems in school,'' notes Richard V. Burkhauser, a Cornell University economist who co-wrote a book last year about these disability programs. ''If you do better in school, you threaten the income of the parents. It's a terrible incentive.''
About four decades ago, most of the children S.S.I. covered had severe physical handicaps or mental retardation that made it difficult for parents to hold jobs -- about 1 percent of all poor children. But now 55 percent of the disabilities it covers are fuzzier intellectual disabilities short of mental retardation, where the diagnosis is less clear-cut. More than 1.2 million children across America -- a full 8 percent of all low-income children -- are now enrolled in S.S.I. as disabled, at an annual cost of more than $9 billion.
That is a burden on taxpayers, of course, but it can be even worse for children whose families have a huge stake in their failing in school. Those kids may never recover: a 2009 study found that nearly two-thirds of these children make the transition at age 18 into S.S.I. for the adult disabled. They may never hold a job in their entire lives and are condemned to a life of poverty on the dole -- and that's the outcome of a program intended to fight poverty.
THERE'S no doubt that some families with seriously disabled children receive a lifeline from S.S.I. But the bottom line is that we shouldn't try to fight poverty with a program that sometimes perpetuates it.
A local school district official, Melanie Stevens, puts it this way: ''The greatest challenge we face as educators is how to break that dependency on government. In second grade, they have a dream. In seventh grade, they have a plan.''
There's a danger in drawing too firm conclusions about an issue -- fighting poverty -- that is as complex as human beings themselves. I'm no expert on domestic poverty. But for me, a tentative lesson from the field is that while we need safety nets, the focus should be instead on creating opportunity -- and, still more difficult, on creating an environment that leads people to seize opportunities.
To see what that might mean, I tagged along with Save the Children, the aid group we tend to think of as active in Sudan or Somalia. It's also in the opportunity business right here in the United States, in places like the mobile home of Britny Hurley -- and it provides a model of what does work.
Ms. Hurley, 19, is amiable and speaks quickly with a strong hill accent, so that at times I had trouble understanding her. Ms. Hurley says that she was raped by a family member when she was 12, and that another family member then introduced her to narcotics. She became an addict, she says, mostly to prescription painkillers that are widely trafficked here.
Equipped with a crackling intelligence, Ms. Hurley once aspired to be a doctor. But her addictions and a rebellious nature got her kicked out of high school, and at 16 she became engaged to a boyfriend and soon had his baby.
Yet there are ways of breaking this cycle. That's what Save the Children is doing here, working with children while they're still malleable, and it's an approach that should be a centerpiece of America's antipoverty program. Almost anytime the question is poverty, the answer is children.
Save the Children trains community members to make home visits to at-risk moms like Ms. Hurley, and help nurture the skills they need in the world's toughest job: parenting. These visits begin in pregnancy and continue until the child is 3 years old.
I followed Courtney Trent, 22, one of these early childhood coordinators, as she visited a series of houses. She encourages the mothers (and the fathers, if they're around) to read to the children, tell stories, talk to them, hug them. If the parents can't read, then Ms. Trent encourages them to flip the pages on picture books and talk about what they see.
Ms. Trent brings a few books on each visit, and takes back the ones she had left the previous time. Many of the homes she visits don't own a single children's book.
She sat on the floor in Ms. Hurley's living room, pulled a book out of her bag, and encouraged her to read to her 20-month-old son, Landon. Ms. Hurley said that she was never read to as a child, but she was determined to change the pattern.
''I just want him to go to school,'' she said of Landon. ''I want him to go to college and get out of this place.'' Ms. Hurley said she was clean of drugs, working full time at a Wendy's, and hoping to go back to school to become a nurse. I'd bet on her -- and on Landon.
''When kids come to us through this program and come here, we can see a big difference,'' Ron Combs, the principal at Lyndon B. Johnson Elementary School here, told me. ''They're really ready to go. Otherwise, we have kids so far behind that they struggle to catch up.
''By second or third grade, you have a pretty good feeling about who's going to drop out,'' he added.
A group of teachers were in the room, and they all nodded. Wayne Sizemore, director of special education in Breathitt County, puts it this way: ''The earlier we can get them, the better. It's like building a foundation for a house.''
I don't want to suggest that America's antipoverty programs are a total failure. On the contrary, they are making a significant difference. Nearly all homes here in the Appalachian hill country now have electricity and running water, and people aren't starving.
Our political system has created a particularly robust safety net for the elderly, focused on Social Security and Medicare -- because the elderly vote. This safety net has brought down the poverty rate among the elderly from about 35 percent in 1959 to under 9 percent today.
BECAUSE kids don't have a political voice, they have been neglected -- and have replaced the elderly as the most impoverished age group in our country. Today, 22 percent of children live below the poverty line.
Of American families living in poverty today, 8 out of 10 have air-conditioning, and a majority have a washing machine and dryer. Nearly all have microwave ovens. What they don't have is hope. You see it here in the town of Jackson, in the teenage girls hanging out by the bridge over the north fork of the Kentucky River, seeking to trade their bodies for prescription painkillers or methamphetamines.
A growing body of careful research suggests that the most effective strategy is to work early on children and education, and to try to encourage and sustain marriage. Bravo to Mayor Julián Castro of San Antonio for backing a landmark initiative to add one-eighth of 1 percent to the local sales tax to finance a prekindergarten program. Early interventions are not a silver bullet, and even programs that succeed as experiments often fall short when scaled up. But we end up paying for poverty one way or another, and early childhood education is far cheaper than adult incarceration. I hope that the budget negotiations in Washington may offer us a chance to take money from S.S.I. and invest in early childhood initiatives instead.
One reason antipoverty initiatives don't get traction in America is that the issue is simply invisible.
''People don't want to talk about poverty in America,'' Mark Shriver, who runs the domestic programs of Save the Children, noted as we drove through Kentucky. ''We talk more about poverty in Africa than we do about poverty in America.''
Indeed, in the 2012 election campaign, poverty was barely mentioned. A study by Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting, a liberal watchdog organization, found substantive discussion of poverty in just 0.2 percent of campaign news reports.
Look, there are no magic wands, and helping people is hard. One woman I met, Anastasia McCormick, told me that her $500 car had just broken down and she had to walk two miles each way to her job at a pizza restaurant. That's going to get harder because she's pregnant with twins, due in April.
At some point, Ms. McCormick won't be able to hold that job anymore, and then she'll have trouble paying the bills. She has rented a washer and dryer, but she's behind in payments, and they may soon be hauled back. ''I got a 'discontinue' notice on the electric,'' she added, ''but you get a month to pay up.'' Life is like that for her, a roller coaster partly of her own making.
I don't want to write anybody off, but I admit that efforts to help Ms. McCormick may end with a mixed record. But those twin boys she's carrying? There's time to transform their lives, and they -- and millions like them -- should be a national priority. They're too small to fail.

HEADLINE: Upshot of the Foreclosure Backlog

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
FORECLOSURES are taking significantly longer in states where lenders must go through the courts, and the delay may or may not be good for borrowers, depending on their circumstances. But some researchers say that dragging the process out hurts society at large.
About half of the 50 states have judicial foreclosure systems. The housing market crash so bogged down the systems in New York and New Jersey that foreclosures there have routinely dragged on for two or three years; their timelines are among the longest in the country. The national average, which factors in nonjudicial states, is about one year, according to RealtyTrac, which monitors foreclosures nationwide. 
The sluggish process has caused a backlog of loans in foreclosure and is slowing the housing market recovery in judicial states, says Michael Fratantoni, the vice president for research and economics at the Mortgage Bankers Association. As of the end of the third quarter, according to the association, 6.6 percent of all loans were in foreclosure in judicial states, compared with 2.4 percent in nonjudicial states.
A study released last summer by researchers at the Federal Reserve Banks in Boston and Atlanta found that the longer properties languish in delinquency or under a bank's ownership, the greater the negative effect on the value of surrounding properties.
''The best outcome is to prevent the foreclosure,'' said Paul S. Willen, an economist and policy adviser at the Boston Fed. ''But if it's clear that can't be done, it's in society's interest to get the foreclosure done as soon as possible.''
In a separate study last year, Mr. Willen and his colleagues question the basis for giving borrowers more time to try to fix mortgage problems. The study found that avoiding foreclosure was no more likely for borrowers subject to either judicial foreclosure, or laws forcing lenders to wait 90 days before beginning foreclosure proceedings, than it was for other borrowers.
Consumer advocates agree that foreclosures are taking too long in some states. High concentrations of vacant properties have taken a heavy toll on certain neighborhoods, said Michael D. Calhoun, the president of the Center for Responsible Lending in Washington. ''We agree that borrowers should be considered quickly for loan modifications,'' he said. ''They're more successful if they're done early on.''
But in his estimation, the delays aren't a result of the protections provided to consumers under the judicial process, because the court process has worked fine in ''normal times.'' The problem now, he said, lies with the mortgage servicers. ''We had a servicing system that was totally overwhelmed by the housing boom and even more so by the housing crash,'' Mr. Calhoun said. ''The backlog is due to servicer errors and lack of capacity.''
Communication gaps are also a factor, says Mark S. Cherry, a lawyer who represents borrowers in the state-sponsored foreclosure mediation program in New Jersey. His clients must sometimes return to mediation sessions five or six times before finally getting a loan modification. ''Persistence breaks resistance,'' he said.
Courts, too, have been overwhelmed. In New Jersey, a typical year brings about 24,000 residential foreclosure filings; in 2009 and 2010, annual filings surpassed 60,000.
The courts have since had time to adjust, especially because lenders have halted the processing of thousands of old cases while they work with federal regulators on improving their practices, said Kevin M. Wolfe, the assistant director of the Civil Practice Division of New Jersey's Administrative Office of the Courts.
New foreclosure cases are moving much more quickly, and there is no backlog, Mr. Wolfe said. The average time for foreclosures filed this year is 6.4 months.
By the time lenders begin processing those old cases, the court should be far better prepared, he said, adding, ''We're not going to be caught up short this time.''

HEADLINE: 'History's Greatest Automotive Mysteries, Myths and Rumors Revealed'

BYLINE: By PRESTON LERNER and MATT STONE

 BODY:
The more automobile design has changed, the more it has remained the same. A century after the Model T Ford debuted, the vast majority of the cars on the road still feature steel bodies, chassis suspended on four wheels and four-stroke internal combustion engines. Not that would-be revolutionaries haven't tried to ''improve'' the automobile with a host of innovations: Bodies made of carbon-fiber. Bodies fitted with wings. Bodies that float on water. Three-wheelers. Six-wheelers. Steam engines. Jet turbines. For a while, there was even talk of nuclear power.
Back in 1974, when the country was still reeling from the fuel embargo and painful memories of long lines at gas stations were fresh in everyone's minds, the vehicle anointed as ''the car of the future'' had one rear wheel, two cylinders and a Space Age composite body that appeared to have been inspired by ''The Jetsons.'' The relevant specs were 70 miles per gallon, a top speed of 85 miles per hour and a bargain-basement price of $1,995. Before long, the car was featured not only in daily newspapers and national magazines but also on talk shows and as a prize on ''The Price is Right.'' 
The Dale, as the car was dubbed, was promoted relentlessly by a larger-than-life character named Liz Carmichael. Built and sounding more like a linebacker than the widowed mother of five she claimed to be, she told the world that she was going to crush the hidebound manufacturers in Detroit and ''rule the auto industry as a queen.'' It didn't happen exactly the way she planned it. But Carmichael ended up playing a starring role on a stage far from the car business, first in Los Angeles County Superior Court and later as a convicted felon on the lam featured on ''Unsolved Mysteries.''
''I was 15 when the Dale came out, and I saw it at the L.A. Auto Show,'' recalls Leslie Kendall, curator of the Petersen Automotive Museum, which owns a mock-up of the car. ''I remember thinking, Man, that is something! I also remember seeing a picture of Liz and thinking, Holy moly, that is not a woman!' It was the perfect scam for L.A. First, you had someone bilking people out of money. And that somebody was doing it with an imaginary car And that someone was a transsexual. It was a movie of the week waiting to happen.''
Geraldine Elizabeth Carmichael was a huge woman, anywhere from 6 feet tall and 175 pounds to 6 foot 2 and 225 pounds, depending on the account, and she had a voice to match. At various times, she claimed to be an Indiana farm girl who'd wrenched on tractors, a one-time stock car racer, an entrepreneur with an MBA from the University of Miami, a mechanical engineer with a degree from Ohio State University, the mother of five children, the widow of a NASA structural engineer, the former owner of a company that modified cars, the builder of custom and experimental vehicles and the patent holder on a ''self-skinning foam.'' She romanced [car designer Dale] Clifft by telling him that she planned to put his three-wheel design into mass production, then sealed the deal by offering him a royalty payout that could total as much as $3 million.
In August 1974, the Twentieth Century Motor Car Company was incorporated in Nevada. Liz Carmichael set up shop in a posh office suite on Ventura Boulevard in Encino while production commenced in an industrial building on Deering Avenue in Canoga Park. She amassed a sales team and began aggressively marketing the Dale. ''We'll either be fabulously wealthy,'' she told company associates, ''or we'll go to jail.''
Twentieth Century produced a slick, six-page, full-color brochure showcasing a futuristic-looking car in banana-yellow livery. ''The new 70 mpg Dale,'' read the copy on the cover. ''Dollar for dollar, the best car ever built!'' Inside the brochure, the claims were even more extravagant: ''The most exciting new car of this century.'' ''The first Space Age automobile.'' ''Designed and built like it's ready to be driven to the moon.'' ''The most exciting idea that ever happened to personal transportation.'' Nor did the hype stop there. ''The eyes of the world are on the amazing new Dale,'' a creative but anonymous copywriter began. ''A masterpiece in automotive design and engineering. A whole new standard of performance, economy and safety available in no other car in the world today.''
The unibody two-seater featured a body of a ''rocket structural resin'' that ''will absorb over four times the impact of a Cadillac without serious damage.'' The windows were made of a material called Rigidex, which ''has 70 times the impact resistance of safety glass. Only the force of a bullet could penetrate it.'' There were no pesky wiring looms to malfunction. ''The car is operated electronically through a printed-circuit dashboard. All accessories (radio, heater, air conditioner) are simply plugged in.'' Carmichael said she chose the three-wheel layout because it saved 300 pounds and knocked $350 off the price, bringing the curb weight down to 1,000 pounds and the sticker price below $2,000. Powered by a 40-horsepower 850cc horizontally opposed twin from a BMW motorcycle, the Dale supposedly maxxed out at 85 miles per hour. The car even came with a 15-month/15,000-mile warranty. For an additional $100, buyers could extend it to 30 months and 30,000 miles.
Before long, a mock-up was placed on display -- behind stanchions so nobody could get too close -- in the Twentieth Century office. (It featured front wheels nailed to a 4x4 that served as the front axle. There was also a barely functional prototype, but it ran so poorly that Carmichael used film footage of Clifft scampering around the dry lake at El Mirage in his original three-wheeler. And the Dale sports car was supposed to be just the beginning. Next, Carmichael said, would come a sedan called the Revelle, and then a station wagon called the Vanagen. Already, she claimed, she had 100 employees working in a 150,000-square-foot factory in Burbank. Her projections called for 88,000 cars to be sold during the first year of production -- and 250,000 during the second -- through 100 dealerships and 210 distributors. The initial investment, she claimed, was $33 million. ''We're going to revolutionize personal transportation,'' she told Dan Jedlicka, the respected car writer for the Chicago Sun-Times. ''Sure, Detroit will try to hurt me. That's why I'm talking about my autos so far in advance. If we're hurt by the big automakers, I want it out in the open. I want the world to know.''
Jedlicka's story was slyly skeptical, but most of the coverage in newspapers and magazines and on TV and radio accepted Carmichael's grandiose claims at face value. (The prestigious Columbia Journalism Review later published an article castigating the media for its credulous reporting.) Throughout 1974, millions of dollars flowed into Twentieth Century's coffers as investors, would-be dealers and prospective customers put down deposits for a piece of the pie. The first intimation that all wasn't what it seemed came in September, when the California Corporation Commission issued a cease and desist order prohibiting the company from continuing to sell stock in the corporation. But Carmichael was unrepentant. ''I don't want to sound like an egomaniac, but I am a genius,'' she told the Associated Press. ''I believe 100 percent that this car would revolutionize the industry.''

HEADLINE: A Switch At Midlife, To Make A Difference

BYLINE: By MARCI ALBOHER. 
Marci Alboher is the author of the coming ''Encore Career Handbook: How to Make a Living and a Difference in the Second Half of Life.''

 BODY:
I CAN pinpoint the time in my career when I started to question what I was doing with my life.
It happened 12 years ago on Ipanema beach in Rio de Janeiro. I was enjoying my first vacation in nearly two years when a call came through on my cellphone. There was a crisis at work. My boss asked if I'd cut my trip short to take care of it. I said no, and that was it. I realized that my work as a corporate lawyer just didn't matter to me anymore. After I hung up, I vowed to figure out a way to leave that job and do something more meaningful.
My reinvention wasn't easy. After about two years, I weaned myself from the law and re-emerged as a journalist. It took a lot of work -- classes, conferences, networking with writers and editors, learning from mentors 10 years my junior. In time I was getting regular assignments and writing for publications that included The New York Times. Even today, more than 10 years into my new career, I earn only two-thirds of what I was making in my last law job. But the trade-offs are worth it. 
The subject of career reinvention was so fascinating to me that it's become front and center in my current work. These days I'm working for Encore.org, a nonprofit that focuses on so-called encore careers. As people hit their 50th and 60th birthdays and realize they are far from done with work, millions are moving into new careers that combine making a living and a difference.
I've talked to hundreds of people who are part of this growing trend. People like Fred Weinberg, a retired New York State parole officer who now helps low-income patients navigate the health care system. And Nancy Burkhart, who started Earth Safe Finishes, a company that makes nontoxic paint, after her years of working in the arts and crafts industry convinced her that conventionally manufactured paints and varnishes were harming the environment.
The urge to shake up things at midlife even happens to those who have dedicated their lives to making a difference and may be experiencing burnout after 20 or 30 years on the job. I've met nonprofit leaders who told me they're done with board meetings and budgets and are ready to work one-on-one to help people. And I've talked to teachers who are ready to leave the classroom and focus on education policy.
Transitions are harder when you feel old enough to be a parent to everyone else at the office. Age discrimination is real, but those who reinvent over 50 don't let it get in the way. If they interview with organizations that don't value experience, they move on. When they network, they recognize the importance of intergenerational relationships; they even tap their children's LinkedIn contacts.
Many people over 50 need retraining or education to do the work they want to do. Some retool through classes at the local Y. Others enroll in certificate programs at community colleges to retrain for high-demand roles in nursing, caregiving or other health-related fields. Still others are like Priscilla Santiago, a laid-off forklift operator, who returned to college at 59 and ultimately found work at the WorkPlace, an agency in Bridgeport, Conn., helping others battered by the current economic slump.
New pathways are sprouting up for those seeking encore careers. ReServe, which placed Mr. Weinberg in his position with the Hospital for Special Surgery, matches people who are over 55 with part-time paid positions at nonprofits. Encore Fellowships, a program created by Encore.org, offers a transition to the nonprofit sector for professionals from the private sector interested in moving into mission-focused work. Even programs like Teach for America, known for recruiting recent graduates, are looking for those in midlife committed to fixing our country's schools.
MOVING into new work often requires taking a financial hit, so good planning is crucial. According to research from the MetLife Foundation and Encore.org, the average midlife transition to socially motivated work takes about 18 months, during which most people don't earn an income. Some spend more going back to school. In addition, it's common to take a pay cut if you're moving to a job more focused on mission than money.
As I inch closer to 50 myself, it's impossible not to notice that some things aren't what they used to be -- my vision, the shine of my hair, my ability to remember names. Still, I'm convinced the one thing that doesn't dim with age is the chance to change people's lives for the better, even our own.

HEADLINE: A King of Art With the Midas Touch

BYLINE: By CHARLES McGRATH

 BODY:
NEW HAVEN
JOCK REYNOLDS, the director of the Yale University Art Gallery, likes to say that when he took over in 1998, the collection -- the oldest and one of the most important university art collections in the country -- had grown so large that its landmark Louis Kahn building resembled an ''old sock drawer.'' The museum could show only a small fraction of its holdings, and some works had been in storage so long that even the curators had never seen them. Beyond campus few people knew that there was a world-class encyclopedic art museum in New Haven, of all places, just an hour and a half from New York.
The 1953 Kahn building was in dire need of rehab, and two adjacent buildings on Chapel Street that had previously housed the collection -- the so-called Old Yale Art Gallery, a 1928 neo-Florentine Gothic building, and, next door, Street Hall, a Ruskinian Gothic structure from 1866 -- were in even worse shape. Among the three buildings there were 280 years of deferred maintenance, Mr. Reynolds said. 
Almost as soon as he arrived here Mr. Reynolds set out to transform his stretch of Chapel Street at the urging of Yale's president, Richard C. Levin. He planned a renovation of all three buildings that would restore the older ones, which had long since been put to other uses, to their original purpose as gallery space.
The Kahn makeover, by Duncan Hazard and Richard Olcott of Ennead Architects in New York, was finished in 2006. Work began on the two others in 2009, and the entire refurbished complex -- a block-and-a-half-long stretch that is itself a museum of changing architectural styles -- is scheduled to open officially on Wednesday, a few months after visitors began being admitted to the galleries as they were completed.
While all the work was going on Mr. Reynolds and his staff were also busy acquiring yet more art, much of it reflecting a broader range of cultures than the core Yale collection, to fill additional space made possible by the renovations. There is a brand-new collection of Indo-Pacific art, for example, and a new curator, Ruth Barnes, hired away from the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, to look after it.
The collections of African art and the art of the ancient Americas have also been expanded. Newly on display as well are lots of works from the old collection, like paintings by Corot, Degas and Rothko, that there was never room to show before. The American decorative arts collection now includes a restored parlor from an 18th-century house in Gilead, Conn., that used to be just numbered boards in a Yale storage barn.
And there are a number of old-master works -- including paintings by Titian, Fra Angelico, van Dyck and Uccello -- that had been wrongly attributed and consigned to the junk pile. Laurence Kanter, the museum's keen-eyed chief curator (lured from the Metropolitan Museum of Art by Mr. Reynolds) discovered them while cleaning out the basement before renovation.
The price tag for the renovation was $135 million, an immense sum in this economy, but Mr. Reynolds seems to have raised it effortlessly, along with additional funds for the art acquisitions. Mr. Reynolds is, or used to be, a sculptor and a designer of installations for institutions like M.I.T. and the University of Washington in Seattle, but lately he has mastered a rare and difficult form of performance art: raising money. He has caused hundreds of millions of dollars -- sums that would be the envy even of the Met or the Getty -- to pour into Yale's coffers. He makes money rain on the place.
Part of his secret may be that at a time when museum directors are increasingly bottom-line-focused types, or even former art dealers, who have less in common with artists or curators than with the high-rolling crowd that buys art as an investment, he doesn't look or act the part of the museum professional. He's a big, friendly, sandy-haired man who favors the official uniform of the aging preppy: khakis, navy blazer, striped oxford-cloth shirt.
One morning not long ago he opened the art gallery's Chapel Street door at exactly 10 o'clock and, beaming, waved inside a waiting class of New Haven schoolchildren, along with a group of grown-up art students from the suburbs. (The Yale Art Gallery charges no admission, and Mr. Reynolds means to keep it that way.) You could have mistaken him for one of those old alums with too much time on their hands who hang around campus looking for something to do.
But he is by all accounts an excellent administrator, and his curatorial staff, all with scholarly credentials that far outstrip his own, say they greatly respect his eye. That same morning his duties included conferring with Mr. Kanter and Suzanne Boorsch, the curator of prints, drawings and photographs, about a 16th-century van Leyden woodcut that the museum was thinking of buying.
Mr. Reynolds had noticed before anyone else that in the upper right corner the woodcut showed three birds that were missing in the version reproduced in a reference book. Since bits of wood sometimes got knocked off during printing, this might indicate that the print under consideration represented the work in an earlier state.
Mr. Reynolds, who turned 64 last spring, got into the museum business more or less by accident and made his reputation not by climbing the curatorial rungs at well-financed institutions but by working in the world of alternative art spaces. In the mid-'70s, while teaching art at San Francisco State University, he helped turn a former coffin factory into what became New Langton Arts, one of that city's earliest alternative arts spaces. He did much of the plumbing and drywall-hanging himself.
Kathy Halbreich, a former director of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and now an associate director at the Museum of Modern Art, has known Mr. Reynolds for decades. She said recently that in the museum world ''it's liberating to have someone who thinks like an artist,'' and added, ''Jock speaks several languages. He's as apt to convince an artist to make a contribution as a rich alum.''
''He's like a pied piper,'' Ms. Halbreich continued. ''His ability to communicate so well involves his understanding of what it means to make a work of art. It comes from his own pleasures and struggles as an artist. People instinctively want to follow him.''
The historian David McCullough, who is an art lover, a Yale alumnus and in recent years a friend of Mr. Reynolds's, said recently: ''Jock has squeezed more out of me than I would ever have thought possible. His attitude is: Come on in, the water's fine. Don't stand on the sidelines.''
In 1983 Mr. Reynolds, without entirely giving up his own art practice, became executive director of the Washington Project for the Arts, an alternative art space in Washington. (It was a scary step: He was married with two children, and the new job meant giving up tenure.) When he got there he found that the center's finances were in much worse shape than advertised. But he raised the necessary money and also the profile of the organization. In 1989, when the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington at the last minute backed out of showing ''The Perfect Moment,'' Robert Mapplethorpe's controversial exhibition of photographs, many of them homoerotic or violent, Mr. Reynolds stepped in and arranged space for the show.
Mr. Reynolds's first real institutional job was at Andover, the Massachusetts prep school he attended and whose old-school manners and wardrobe he has never entirely abandoned. In 1989 he became director of the school's Addison Gallery, a small museum of American art. When he arrived the place was a bit of a backwater, attracting fewer than 10,000 visitors a year. When he left, nine years later, attendance was 65,000 annually, and he had also increased the endowment by millions.
If Mr. Reynolds's secret were an obvious one more institutions would copy it. It helps that, unlike some people in the business, he actually enjoys fund-raising and long ago got over any embarrassment at asking for large sums.
''You need to remember that the number you're asking for -- whether it's a million or a million-five or 20 million -- has nothing to do with you,'' he said, smiling. ''You're giving them an opportunity. You need to think: What would give them pleasure? What would make them think they'd done something significant?''
But Mr. Reynolds's greatest secret may be that he has first dosed himself with his own Kool-Aid and sold himself on his own message. Walking around Yale galleries he sometimes shakes his head in wonder at all their riches and takes evident pleasure in sharing them. He hung the collection of modern and contemporary art himself.
''He's believable because he's a believer,'' Ms. Halbreich said. ''The joy he gets from art is palpable.''
John Walsh, director emeritus of the J. Paul Getty Museum, said: ''These are not techniques, you know that right away. He's not faking it. He's really well prepared. It's very hard to say no to Jock because you feel he deserves it. You want to make him happy.'' He laughed and added, ''He's used this on me many times.''

HEADLINE: Russia Announces Barriers on Imports of U.S. Meat

BYLINE: By ELLEN BARRY

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Russian health regulators announced formidable new barriers to the import of meat from the United States late on Friday, in a move some analysts saw as retaliation for American legislation punishing Russian officials linked to human rights violations. 
The new Russian regulation requires imported meat to undergo testing for and be certified free of ractopamine, which is added to animal feed in the United States to make meat more lean.
The United States Department of Agriculture considers ractopamine safe and does not test for it. The United States exports about $500 million worth of beef and pork to Russia.
A notice published on the regulator's Web site on Friday said the regulation would go into force immediately, and that during an unspecified ''transition period'' Russia will conduct its own testing. After the transition period ends, foreign countries will be required to certify their meat exports as ractopamine-free.
The announcement came hours after the Senate passed the so-called Magnitsky Act, which will deny visas and freeze assets of Russian officials who have been linked to the death of Sergei L. Magnitsky. Mr. Magnitsky was detained after accusing Russian officials of embezzlement and died in a Moscow detention center in November 2009.
Gennady Onishchenko, Russia's chief health inspector, responded indignantly to the notion that the ractopamine ban was politically motivated or linked to the Magnitsky Act.
Mr. Onishchenko said there were serious questions about the effects of ractopamine.
''For instance, use of ractopamine is accompanied by a reduction in body mass, suppression of reproductive function, increase of mastitis in dairy herds, which leads to a steep decline in the quality and safety of milk,'' he told Interfax on Saturday.
The United States Department of Agriculture on Friday asked Russia to suspend the requirement, saying it could effectively halt beef and pork exports to Russia.
American trade and economic officials are expected to travel to Moscow this week to urge the government to postpone the new requirement.

HEADLINE: The Cracks in the Nation's Foundation

 BODY:
Across the coasts of New York and New Jersey, hundreds of millions of gallons of raw and partially treated sewage are spilling into waterways and the ocean. The immediate cause is equipment damage from Hurricane Sandy, but as Michael Schwirtz recently reported in The Times, aging plants like one in Nassau County on Long Island were leaking long before the storm, flooding neighborhood streets with sewage during downpours.
There are thousands of faltering sewage plants like these across the country, staffed by operators who dread rainy days. Civil engineers in every state are monitoring ominous cracks in roads and bridges that carry freight and school buses. And millions of transit commuters are awaiting new equipment and long-deferred maintenance on systems that are reliable only when the sun is shining. 
The need for investment in public works, never more urgent, has become a casualty of Washington's ideological wars. Republicans were once reliable partners in this kind of necessary spending. But since President Obama spent about 12 percent of the 2009 stimulus on transportation, energy and other infrastructure programs, Republicans have made it a policy to demonize these kinds of investments.
When the president asked recently for a modest $50 billion for transportation improvements in the ''fiscal cliff'' talks, Republicans literally laughed out loud. There will be no stimulus in any deal, said Representative Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, the incoming chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.
Obviously the economy needs another boost, in part because the austerity being demanded by Republicans is likely to slow down growth. Big government construction projects put people to work, and those new jobs have enormous ripple effects -- $1.44 in benefits for every government dollar spent on public works. An infrastructure bank for energy and water projects, started with $10 billion in government seed money, could leverage hundreds of billions in private investments.
But the biggest reason to spend money on these projects is that they are desperately needed in every city and state. Around the country, there are 70,000 structurally deficient bridges; one of them, in southern New Jersey, collapsed under a train last week, sending tank cars full of flammable gas into a creek. There are 4,000 dams in need of repair, and the electrical grid in this supposedly advanced country ranks 32nd in the world in reliability, behind Slovenia's. Those Republicans who deride this investment as worthless stimulus might want to explain to freezing homeowners why it is too expensive to bury fragile power lines.
The president's $50 billion proposal for highways, rail, mass transit and aviation, hard as it will be to achieve, is only a slim down payment on the real job. (He proposed the same package last year as part of the American Jobs Act, which Republicans ignored.) Most estimates put the cost of basic repairs at more than $2 trillion, and that does not even include long-range upgrades to the electrical grid, storm protection and mass transit.
Around the country, ridership on transit has grown significantly since the 1990s, but federal investments have fallen far short. The Transportation Department says that if $18 billion were spent every year -- 40 percent more than is being spent now -- transit systems might get to a state of good repair by 2028. But that does not include spending to improve service or keep up with growth, or to protect systems like New York's from storm damage. (The city's subway system needs $4.8 billion just to recover from Hurricane Sandy.)
The NextGen satellite program desperately needed to replace the nation's clogged air traffic control system will cost at least $30 billion, but much of that money is likely to be cut by the automatic sequester of spending put in place by Republicans last year. This investment will ultimately save the airline industry vast amounts now lost to delays and excess fuel consumption, but like so many other important projects, it is being eroded in the blind ideological rush to cut everything. As bridges fall, subway riders are stranded and flight delays pile up, the cost of this shortsightedness will continue to mount.

HEADLINE: Giving an Old Brewery A New Life, and Cuisine

BYLINE: By STIRLING KELSO. 
skelso@texasmonthly.com

 BODY:
Nearly 12 years ago, the Pearl Brewing Company in downtown San Antonio emptied its tanks and moved the production of its beer to Fort Worth. It left behind a historic but derelict 22-acre complex, anchored by a towering brew house. It looked like the property was destined to be razed.
Enter Silver Ventures, a private equity firm led by Christopher Goldsbury, a native of San Antonio. Mr. Goldsbury, the firm's chief executive, considered the brewery a symbol of his city's entrepreneurial spirit and rich industrial past. When he told his advisers he wanted to turn the area into a mixed-use development, ''I told him: 'Don't walk away. Run away,' '' said Bill Shown, now Pearl's managing director of real estate. ''Buildings had structural problems and soils were contaminated. Luckily, my advice wasn't taken.'' 
Silver Ventures bought the property in 2002 and began executing Mr. Goldsbury's vision of a food-focused neighborhood where restaurants could attract and groom local chefs (like Andrew Weissman and Johnny Hernandez) and elevate them to an international stage. (Mr. Goldsbury has a food background: he was married to Linda Pace, whose parents founded Pace Foods, and he was its president before selling it to Campbell Soup for $1.1 billion.)
The Culinary Institute of America, known as the C.I.A., chose the property for its third campus -- the others are in Hyde Park, N.Y., and in St. Helena, in the Napa Valley -- based in part on its proximity to Latin American cooking influences. (Mr. Goldsbury also donated $35 million to the institute).
Silver Ventures renovated the historic structures, added some stylish lofts and worked with the city to clean up the adjacent river. Now, a haute designer hotel is in the works.
True to Mr. Goldsbury's vision (and to a greater extent, San Antonio's), the Pearl is becoming a destination for gourmands and travelers alike. Here are some of Pearl's top stops:
Eat
It's hard to say what's more impressive: The Granary 'Cue & Brew (602 Avenue A; 210-228-0124; thegranarysa.com) venue -- a historic family home fronted with Corinthian columns -- or its 4,000-pound wood-fired smoker, tended by the chef Tim Rattray. A back bar in a wood-paneled space faces the restaurant's own microbrewery, where the brewer (and brother) Alex Rattray pours four types of craft ales. (The restaurant also makes its own root beer.) Pair a flight with dishes from the meat-focused menu: house-made Texas toast served with butter marbled with barbecue drippings, and pork belly with a Latin twist courtesy of a cumin and coriander rub.
In an era when restaurants seem to be getting smaller, it is gratifying to walk into a large, recession-defying space. The Boiler House (312 Pearl Parkway, Building 3; 210-354-4644; boilerhousesa.com), named after the 1896 building it occupies, divides 400 seats between two stories. Downstairs, where old coal-powered boilers form the kitchen's walls, a post-work crowd sips wine paired with the executive chef James Moore's small plates like quail poppers wrapped in jalapeños and bacon. The quieter upstairs might appeal to executives making deals over 32-ounce rib-eyes.
At Nao (312 Pearl Parkway; 210-554-6484; naorestaurant.com), the C.I.A.'s Latin American restaurant, cocktails and tapas -- all priced at $9 -- compete for attention. Order both.
For those looking for the next hot spot, mark your calendar for January, when Arcade Midtown Kitchen (303 Pearl Parkway; 210-233-1212; arcadesatx.com) opens. The modern American menu of Jesse Perez, the chef, will include comfort foods like shrimp and grits and meatloaf made with wild mushrooms and green peppercorn gravy.
Shop
The Pearl Brewery complex upgrade enticed some small-business owners to move to the modern, light-filled shops at the base of loft-style apartments. LeeLee Shoes (303 Pearl Parkway, Suite 105; 210-832-0066;
leeleeshoes.com) opened at Pearl, with its inventory of Ash sneaker wedges and Brazilian Melissa shoes. And Caroline Matthews, the owner of Dos Carolinas (303 Pearl Parkway, Suite 102; 210-224-7000; doscarolinas.com) takes orders for her popular custom guayaberas ranging from classic white wedding shirts to ranch-ready camos.
Appoint your kitchen at
Melissa Guerra (303 Pearl Parkway, Suite 104; 210-293-3983; melissaguerra.com) with cooking utensils including stone molcajetes, and serving dishes like Chilean earthenware and etched Mexican glasses.
Want the chic mercado vibe, but hoping to avoid the city's touristy Market Square? Head to Adelante Boutique (303 Pearl Parkway, Suite 107; 210-826-6770; adelanteboutique.com), which features San Antonio designers like Elizabeth Carrington, who makes chairs with graffiti fabrics, and Stevie Thompson, who has a Sway Clothing line.
Stay
Aside from the C.I.A., perhaps the biggest coup for the Pearl project was the Roman and Williams-designed hotel (the team behind the Ace Hotels), scheduled to open in mid-2014. The property will occupy the main brew house, keeping architectural features like the building's turn-of-the-century brew tanks and huge round pillars.
''We've drawn out Pearl's sense of industry and craftsmanship by preserving the building's muscular concrete rooms, and are adding our own Americana ornaments such as massive chandeliers you might envision in a 19th-century train station,'' said Robin Standefer, the New York-based design principal. ''It's an immensely exciting project to work on, and I've become obsessed with Texas.''

HEADLINE: Anarchy in the U.S.A.

Elsa Dixler is an editor at the Book Review.

 BODY:
SASHA AND EMMAThe Anarchist Odyssey of Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman
By Paul Avrich and Karen AvrichIllustrated. 490 pp. The Belknap Press/Harvard University Press. $35.
The ''first terrorist act in America,'' as its perpetrator described it, occurred on July 23, 1892. Alexander Berkman, known as Sasha, a 20-year-old Russian immigrant outraged at the brutal suppression of the strike at Carnegie Steel's Homestead plant, burst into the office of Henry Clay Frick, the plant's manager, shot him twice, then tried to stab him. The attempted assassination, or attentat, was meant to inspire workers at Homestead and elsewhere to move beyond their fight for better wages into full revolt against the capitalist system: it was ''an act of liberation,'' Berkman said. 
But Frick lived. And in jail, Berkman encountered a furious member of the Homestead strike committee who told him that the workers did not believe in violence and that their struggle was none of Berkman's business. Another union leader complained that ''the bullet from Berkman's pistol . . . went straight through the heart of the Homestead strike.'' Public sympathy, which had tended to oppose the treatment of the steelworkers, shifted in Frick's favor. Even the anarchist community in which the young radical had found an American home was torn. Berkman's most constant supporter was his lover, Emma Goldman, who was just beginning to realize her enormous talent as a speaker and agitator. Goldman organized a relief fund and attempted to justify Berkman's act in numerous articles and interviews. When he was sentenced to 22 years in prison, she corresponded with him frequently and visited as often as she was allowed to. Except for a brief period after Berkman's release 14 years later, their sexual relationship ended, but they remained friends and comrades and maintained their -- one can only call it love -- for the rest of their lives.
Their ''intense connection and intertwined lives,'' in Karen Avrich's words, are the subject of ''Sasha and Emma: The Anarchist Odyssey of Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman.'' Before his death in 2006, Paul Avrich, a distinguished historian of anarchism, asked his daughter Karen, a writer and editor, to complete this book. The result is an account, at once densely detailed and lively, that traces the pair from their births in what is now Lithuania to their deaths in exile in the shadow of World War II. With generous contemporary accounts and Paul Avrich's interviews with anarchists and their children, as well as Berkman's and Goldman's extensive writings, the book draws readers into the lives of its characters.
Always the better known of the two friends, Emma Goldman was energetic, life-loving, multitalented (a capable seamstress, nurse and cook as well as a brilliant speaker), ''the blazing sun to Sasha's morose moon,'' as Avrich says. Berkman, ascetic, melancholy and militant, was a less engaging figure. During the 1970s, Goldman became a hero of the resurgent women's movement as an advocate of self-expression and unconventional choices; her autobiography, ''Living My Life,'' enjoyed wide popularity. ''Everyone . . . was naming things after Emma Goldman -- health collectives, dogs, even babies,'' Candace Falk, the director of the Emma Goldman Papers project, recalled. T-shirts emblazoned with her face and the slogan ''If I can't dance I don't want to be in your revolution'' were ubiquitous. In the 1980s, excellent biographies of Goldman by Falk and by Alice Wexler were published; Goldman appeared as a character in E. L. Doctorow's novel ''Ragtime'' (1975) and in the movie ''Reds'' (1981).
Berkman's revolution was much less fun, and in consequence, he has received far less attention. ''Sasha and Emma'' highlights Berkman's significant relationship with Goldman and, equally important, it trains the spotlight on Berkman's life. Born in 1870, the son of a wealthy merchant in Russia, he was inspired by the political ferment that resulted in the assassination of Czar Alexander II in 1881. He left for New York on his own, speaking no English, at the age of 17. There he fell in with a circle of anarchists, most of them foreign-born, who congregated in the cafes of the Lower East Side. There, too, he met Goldman. They felt an immediate ''powerful connection'' and set up housekeeping before the year was out, eventually forming a ménage à trois with a cousin of his. Berkman was a difficult man, kind to those close to him but constitutionally incapable of accepting authority, and lost job after job.
''Sasha and Emma'' follows Berkman through the attentat into prison, where he improved his English and became an accomplished writer. His ''Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist,'' undertaken at Goldman's urging and published in 1912, is a powerful indictment of the cruelty and corruption of the American prison system, full of compassion for those caught up in it. (''Vivid, candid, honest,'' a New York Times reviewer said.) For the rest of his life, Berkman lectured on prison reform -- ''a prison,'' he observed Foucaultishly, ''is the model on the lines of which civilized society is built'' -- and advocated for anarchist prisoners around the world. He also edited Mother Earth, the magazine founded by Goldman in 1906, and in 1916, he started his own journal, called The Blast, naturally. He became active in the progressive Modern School movement and helped to found the Ferrer Center in New York. He was a leader in the campaign to save Tom Mooney and Warren Billings, who were unjustly convicted of placing a bomb that killed 10 people in San Francisco in 1916. As the United States moved toward entry into World War I, Berkman and Goldman campaigned against militarism. The Wilson administration closed down dissent, and with the passage of the Espionage Act in 1917 it imprisoned left-wing opponents of the war.
In 1919, after serving their sentences, Goldman and Berkman, neither of whom was an American citizen, were deported to Russia. Critical of the authoritarian Bolsheviks, they left the Soviet Union in 1921 and began years of exile in Europe, mostly in France. Berkman died in Nice in 1936, killing himself in response to continued ill health. Goldman, who had the opportunity to work with anarchist forces during the Spanish Civil War, died in Toronto in 1940.
For a modern reader, ''Sasha and Emma'' contains many surprises. One is that early-20th-century anarchist rhetoric sounds remarkably contemporary. Goldman's question to a crowd in Union Square in 1893 -- ''Do you not realize that the state is the worst enemy you have?'' -- would not be out of place at a Tea Party rally, although Goldman deplored the state as a pillar of capitalism. It is also interesting to remember how frequent depressions were in the 1890s and early 20th century, and how often they engendered huge marches and demonstrations of the unemployed. And bombings -- a long string of them, large and small, culminating in 1919 with the attack on the home of Mitchell Palmer, the attorney general, which became a justification for the Red Scare.
Berkman and Goldman corresponded steadily and affectionately, assuring each other of their devotion. ''My dear, beloved friend and comrade,'' Berkman wrote with typical tenderness in 1917, ''you have been my mate and my comrade in arms -- my life's mate in the biggest sense, and your wonderful spirit and devotion have always been an inspiration to me.'' But in ''Emma Goldman in Exile,'' the second volume of a biography, the historian Alice Wexler warns that ''we should not romanticize this friendship for there were limits to it, disappointments and deep failures of communication.'' Separation was the ''price of their intimacy,'' Wexler says, ''which was often most intensely expressed in letters.'' Both had many sexual partners, often decades younger than themselves, and neither Goldman nor Berkman thought much of the other's romantic choices.
Wexler, like Candace Falk, author of ''Love, Anarchy and Emma Goldman,'' views these lives with a psychological sensitivity absent from ''Sasha and Emma,'' and she also provides a sophisticated discussion of Goldman's complicated relationship with feminism. More clearly than the Avriches, she teases out some of the philosophical conflicts within the anarchist movement, and especially the tension between collectivism and individualism. Following the disastrous attentat of 1892, Berkman developed closer ties with the American labor movement. Goldman, who scorned unions and never joined one, devoted herself to lecturing -- on anarchism, to be sure, but also on topics like sexual freedom, birth control and modern drama. As time went on, she seemed to emphasize the freedom of speech and self-expression above all -- an anarchism of attitude without a path to revolution. Her circle expanded to include many socialist and liberal artists and intellectuals. When she petitioned to be allowed to enter the United States in 1934, her request was supported by Sherwood Anderson, John Dewey, Sinclair Lewis, Margaret Sanger, Eugene O'Neill and Dorothy Canfield Fisher. ''Everyone is an anarchist who loves liberty and hates oppression,'' Goldman declared during that visit. That would be pretty much everyone.
Nevertheless, ''Sasha and Emma'' is an enormously rich book, offering an absorbing portrait of the world of anarchists in turn-of-the-century America and of the loving yet competitive partnership at its center. In completing this work, Karen Avrich has done her father proud.

HEADLINE: Yesterday's Tomorrows

BYLINE: By STEVEN HELLER

 BODY:
During the Great Depression, American production was primed to run on all cylinders, but sales had slowed to a standstill. Good design was hailed as a solution to consumer inertia: ''The appeal of efficiency alone is nearly ended,'' the adman Earnest Elmo Calkins wrote in a 1927 essay, ''Beauty the New Business Tool.'' ''Beauty is the natural and logical next step.'' He advocated a practice called ''styling the goods'' or style ''engineering,'' making familiar products look new, and desirable. A generation of designers working in architecture, advertising, packaging, interior design, graphic and scenic design came to believe that commonplace goods and appliances, from automobiles to pencil sharpeners, could benefit from contemporary veneers -- and some serious retooling. This philosophy underscored the advent of a new field of industrial designers, the white knights of American industry. 
Norman Bel Geddes was a founding member of the profession, according to Donald Albrecht, the editor of NORMAN BEL GEDDES DESIGNS AMERICA (Abrams, $65), an exceptionally rich history and profusely illustrated career monograph that serves as the catalog for an exhibition, ''I Have Seen the Future,'' at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin and the Museum of the City of New York. Geddes was at the forefront of industrial design visionaries, including Raymond Loewy, Henry Dreyfuss, Walter Dorwin Teague and Russel Wright. Their individual and collective redesigns of products, Albrecht writes, ''still define contemporary American life today, from telephones to transportation vehicles and elegant yet casual dinnerware.'' They envisioned how the masses would experience the future, relying on, in large part, a design approach based on aerodynamics known as streamlining, which was both an engineering feat and a metaphoric principle. Speed was the mantra of the future, and Geddes was singled out as ''the man who streamlined the world.''
A self-trained polymath and expert in almost every art and craft, from cartooning to architecture, theater to furniture design, he fervently believed that stylish consumable design and ingenious city planning could improve the American way of life. He was a futurist with a pragmatist's mind, the pundit and engine of change. Nowhere was this more profoundly expressed than in his design for the massive, swooping General Motors pavilion and its ''Futurama'' display-cum-ride, one of the most popular attractions at the 1939-40 New York World's Fair. A colossal monument to the automobile's centrality in American life, ''Futurama'' presented a diorama portrait of the United States in a visionary 1960, when dysfunctional urban areas would be entirely rebuilt with sustainable skyscrapers, surrounded by lush greenbelt areas that would eliminate pollution, and radio-controlled cars would ensure safe travel on the miles and miles of new highway systems, which he believed were key to economic growth.
Geddes has been acknowledged for his innovations at the World's Fair. But this study, with its rare sketches and forgotten artifacts, is the first significant monograph to cover all aspects of his work and should help him attain greater recognition. For those who have never heard of Geddes, this book will be a revelation, an introduction to a brilliant craftsman and draftsman, a master of style, the 20th century's Leonardo da Vinci, who was able to realize everything he could imagine.
Geddes's paean to the highway, ''Magic Motorways,'' does not, however, appear in THE BOOK OF BOOKS: 500 Years of Graphic Innovation (Thames & Hudson, $65), edited by Mathieu Lommen, but that can be excused given the scope of this impressive survey. It starts in 1471 with Nicolas Jenson's design of ''Elegantiae Linguae Latinae,'' a stunning example of Jenson's typographic version of Latin epigraphy, and ends in 2010 with Irma Boom's design of ''James, Jennifer, Georgina Are the Butlers,'' a voluminous (more than three inches thick) piece of book sculpture.
This is not a list of the great Western books; rather it's a sampler of extraordinarily printed and well-designed volumes, with emphasis on their respective typographic assets. ''This book showcases book design in all its forms,'' Lommen writes in the introduction, ''reference works and works of art, 'machines for reading' and picture books, prestigious collector's items and throwaway paperbacks.'' Lommen has made his selections from the special collections of the University of Amsterdam, which he curates. The coverage emphasizes printers' manuals, type specimen books and ''writing masters' copybooks,'' the cornerstones of modern graphic design.
Lommen presents each book at a generous size, either single- or double-page views, large enough for viewers to feel they are looking at the originals. The typography of Cornelis de Bruijn's ''Voyage au Levant'' (1700) is so crisp, it looks as if it were just printed. The precisionist hand-colored engravings of flowers and bugs in Maria Sibylla Merian's ''Over de Voortteeling en Wonderbaerlyke Veranderingen der Surinaemsche Insecten'' (1719) is exemplary. Vincent Figgins's ''Specimen of Printing Types'' (1828) has a vintage patina but is so skillfully printed it feels modern. And Eadweard Muybridge's landmark of pre-cinema photography, ''Animal Locomotion'' (1887), though stippled with age, is unsurpassed as a record of his experiments.
Lommen's inclusion of books from the '60s helps define the modern canon. Included are Willy Fleckhaus's ''Rainbow series'' (1963), a ''daringly minimalist concept'' for 48 books that when displayed in order on a bookshelf form a chromatic range from violet, red, orange all the way to indigo. The other principal volume of the period is Quentin Fiore's collaboration with Marshall McLuhan on ''The Medium Is the Massage'' (1967), the first of the kinetic, picture-text paperbacks of the decade.
The selection of pre- and early-20th-century books is logical and generally predictable, but the choice of the ''postmodern'' books is more unexpected. Lommen cites some acknowledged benchmarks, including Rem Koolhaas and Bruce Mau's ''Small, Medium, Large, Extra-Large: Office for Metropolitan Architecture'' (1995), one of the first in the fashion for ''bulky'' books, a brick of a volume that exhibits the synergy of image and text (à la Quentin Fiore), and Stefan Sagmeister's ''Sagmeister. Made You Look: Another Self-Indulgent Design Monograph'' (2001), designed as both a scrapbook and a formal art book. But my favorite postmodern selection, if only for its appropriate restraint, is Derek Birdsall's ''Common Worship: Services and Prayers for the Church of England'' (2000), patterned after a standard book of psalms.
For those who fear the demise of the printed word, ''The Book of Books'' is a testament to its endurance. For those who see books as lasting forever, here is a generous helping of past and present models for the future.
One of the most visibly invisible components of books are page numbers, meant to be seen but not dwelled upon. Yet numbers play as large a role in typographic communication as letters -- if not larger. These ''10 digits have a universal appeal among designers,'' Roger Fawcett-Tang writes in NUMBERS IN GRAPHIC DESIGN (Laurence King, $40). ''They are multilingual, universally understood, varied in form, highly adaptable and yet still instantly recognizable since each of the 10 characters has its own strong and unique identity.'' Fawcett-Tang, a British book and calendar designer, has collected an assortment of contemporary examples of designed numbers in everything from train and bus schedules to clocks and diaries.
The recent trend of making numbers into architectural and interior design statements is the most compelling part of the book. A building's floor numbers are no longer small signs near a door; in many instances they've been super-sized. Take Studio Myerscough's wayfinding system for the London College of Communication. The monumental numbers are rendered in a black stencil-style typeface, and ''the supergraphics are made even more striking by seeming to cast their shadows across the floors, creating a three-dimensional effect,'' Fawcett-Tang notes.
A majority of the book, however, involves smaller printed numerals and the ways designers abstract and exaggerate them to either efficiently present information or artfully exploit their forms. As a catalog of current possibilities, ''Numbers in Graphic Design'' provides numerous inventive options. But when it comes to offering detailed explanations of how we perceive numerals and the consequences of certain aesthetic approaches, the number is nil.
Numbers are essential in THE LONELY PLANET BOOK OF EVERYTHING: A Visual Guide to Travel and the World (Lonely Planet, $19.99), by Nigel Holmes, an informative and comprehensive data visualization guide featuring ''everything'' from ''How to use chopsticks'' in six steps to ''How to avoid being hit by lightning.'' Holmes, one of the leading proponents of information graphics, introduced a witty, pictorial approach to Time magazine in the 1980s. His sense of humor combined with a talent for explaining difficult concepts through step-by-step visualizations gives this book its charm.
The range of engaging and eclectic facts is extraordinary, and the various methods of illustrating them are even more impressive. One entry, ''How to defend yourself'' after an argument in Istanbul or an insult in Berlin, includes fighting instructions by the numbers. Then there is the more esoteric ''Want a thrill? Eat fugu. Carefully!,'' about how to enjoy the dangerous and potentially toxic blowfish, which has long been a delicacy in Japan. Holmes notes that there are about 3,800 fugu restaurants in the country and its preparation is ''strictly controlled by law.'' He adds, ''If you want to order it yourself, make sure you see the chef's certificate before you commit!'' These are words and pictures to live by, literally.
Holmes's user-friendly diagrams could, in some cases, save lives, but they are not intended to alter history. On the other hand, Scott Christianson's 100 DIAGRAMS THAT CHANGED THE WORLD: From the Earliest Cave Paintings to the Innovation of the iPod (Plume, $25) is not so modest. This handsomely designed volume makes a case for the diagrams, sketches, drawings and engravings spanning 32,000 years that ''are the essence of abstract thought,'' he writes, ''representing fundamentally what it means to be human.''
While there are many obvious inclusions and a few surprises in the selections, the critical mass of images and analysis provokes many ''aha moments.'' Of course the 1568 illuminated illustration of the Ptolemaic system altered perception. Leonardo's ''Vitruvian Man'' (circa 1487) is assuredly the ''Canon of Proportion.'' And who can argue with the inclusion of Samuel Morse's ''Telegraph Signs'' patent application of 1840? Curiously, Robert Louis Stevenson's exquisite Treasure Island map is also included because, Christianson writes, ''While there is no evidence of real pirates ever leaving a 'treasure map' showing where they had buried their stolen goods, with 'X' marking the spot, the notion has continued to excite generations of children to this day.'' Not to mention the elevation of the letter X to mythic status.
In Stevenson's day, silhouette portraits were one of the more popular personal keepsakes. Just in time for the holidays, the art form has been revived in Olly Moss's SILHOUETTES FROM POPULAR CULTURE (Titan Books, $16.95). Moss, a British graphic designer and artist, has transformed familiar pop personalities -- Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi as the Blues Brothers, the Muppet curmudgeons Statler and Waldorf, and Harrison Ford as Han Solo and Indiana Jones -- into shadows.
He's done an admirable job, but in the absence of captions, the book tests your pop culture I.Q. by forcing you to guess who's who. My score was about 50 percent, which may have more to do with the drawings than with my lack of cultural literacy. Then again, pop culture has come a long way since the old silhouette days.

HEADLINE: Big Money Bets on a Housing Rebound

BYLINE: By JANET MORRISSEY

 BODY:
DAVID N. MILLER, a master of bailouts, steps to the dais and coolly explains how the financial world went crazy.
It is February 2010. The anger behind Occupy Wall Street is building. Flicking through slides, Mr. Miller, a Treasury official working with the department's $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, lays out what caused the housing bubble: easy credit, shoddy banking, feeble regulation, and on and on.
''History has demonstrated that the financial system over all -- not every piece of it, but over all -- is a force for good, even if it goes off track from time to time,'' Mr. Miller tells a symposium at Columbia University in remarks posted on YouTube. ''As we've experienced, sometimes this system breaks down.''
But, it turns out, sometimes when the system breaks down, there is money to be made. 
Mr. Miller, who arrived at the Treasury after working at Goldman Sachs, described himself as a ''recovering banker'' in the video.
Today, he has slipped back through the revolving door between Washington and Wall Street. This time, he has gone the other way, in a new company, Silver Bay Realty, which is about to go public. He is back in the investment game and out to make money with a play that was at the center of the financial crisis: American housing.
As the foreclosure crisis grinds on, knowledgeable, cash-rich investors are doing something that still gives many ordinary Americans pause: they are leaping headlong into the housing market. And not just into tricky mortgage investments, collateralized this or securitized that, but actual houses.
A flurry of private-equity giants and hedge funds have spent billions of dollars to buy thousands of foreclosed single-family homes. They are purchasing them on the cheap through bank auctions, multiple listing services, short sales and bulk purchases from local investors in need of cash, with plans to fix up the properties, rent them out and watch their values soar as the industry rebounds. They have raised as much as $8 billion to invest, according to Jade Rahmani, an analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods.
The Blackstone Group, the New York private-equity firm run by Stephen A. Schwarzman, has spent more than $1 billion to buy 6,500 single-family homes so far this year. The Colony Capital Group, headed by the Los Angeles billionaire Thomas J. Barrack Jr., has bought 4,000.
Perhaps no investment company is staking more on this strategy, and asking stock-market investors to do the same, than the one Mr. Miller is involved with, Silver Bay Realty Trust of Minnetonka, Minn. Silver Bay is the brainchild of Two Harbors Investment, a publicly traded mortgage real estate investment trust that invests in securities backed by home mortgages.
In January, Two Harbors branched out into buying actual homes and placed them in a unit called Silver Bay. It offered few details at the time, leaving analysts guessing about where it was headed.
''They were not very forthcoming,'' says Merrill Ross, an analyst at Wunderlich Securities. As of Dec. 4, Two Harbors had acquired 2,200 houses. Ms. Ross says she couldn't find out how much Two Harbors paid or the rents it was charging. Two Harbors shares, which recently traded at $11.66, are up about 25 percent in 2012.
Two Harbors now plans to spin off Silver Bay into a separately traded public REIT. The new company will combine Silver Bay's portfolio with Provident Real Estate Advisors' 880-property portfolio. Silver Bay will focus on homes in Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Nevada, states where prices fell hard when the bottom dropped out.
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, Silver Bay said it planned to offer 13.25 million shares at an initial price of $18 to $20 a share. But it's no slam dunk. While home prices nationwide have begun to recover -- they were up 6.3 percent in October, according to a report last week from CoreLogic, a data analysis firm -- prices could fall again if the economy falters anew. Millions of Americans are still struggling to hold onto their homes and avoid foreclosure.
''Recent turbulence in U.S. housing and mortgage markets has created a unique opportunity,'' Silver Bay said in an S.E.C. filing. The company, which will be the first publicly traded REIT to invest solely in single-family rental homes, says its investment plan will help clear foreclosed homes from the market, spruce up neighborhoods and renovate vacant homes, presumably while enriching its new shareholders. Its portfolio will be managed by Pine River Capital Management, a hedge fund in Minnetonka that has reportedly been buying bonds backed by risky subprime mortgages. Mr. Miller is a managing director at Pine River and chief executive of Silver Bay.
Mr. Miller, through a spokesman, declined to comment for this article, citing the pending stock offering.
Some real estate experts question Silver Bay's long-term prospects. And they wonder if the moment to plow into the housing market has already passed. The hedge fund manager Och-Ziff Capital, for example, is already starting to sell the single-family homes it bought since the recession began.
''This will be a workable business as a REIT for at least three to five years,'' says Jay Leupp, a managing director at Lazard Asset Management. If the economy perks up and renters start buying, he said, ''it may make more sense to liquidate the portfolio and transition into another business or simply return the cash to shareholders.''
MR. BARRACK just bought a modest house in Inglewood, Calif. And another in Santa Clarita. And another in Sacramento. These are among thousands of foreclosed properties that his private investment company, Colony, has snapped up nationwide -- not for a quick flip, but to rent.
One property, a four-bedroom home bought in Sacramento for $167,500, was worth $436,000 before the recession. Such deals aren't Mr. Barrack's usual style. Colony's financial appetite normally runs a bit more toward, say, Michael Jackson's Neverland Valley Ranch, whose estimated value was about $47 million when Mr. Barrack bought it in 2008 at a discount as it was headed for foreclosure.
Investors like Mr. Barrack's Colony are a rising force in the housing market. Even if their purchases slow, they are now sitting on thousands of homes and have positioned themselves as the new landlords of thousands of Americans.
Now Mr. Miller, 36, has arrived on the scene. At the Treasury, Mr. Miller helped oversee the federal bailouts of banks whose risky mortgage businesses helped send the economy and housing market into a tailspin. Now, as Silver Bay's chief executive, he is trying to pick up family homes on the cheap.
James H. Lambright, who preceded Mr. Miller as the chief investment officer of TARP and who is the former chairman of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, says Mr. Miller did a great job at the Treasury.
He says he was impressed by Mr. Miller's financial knowledge and his commitment to public service. Among other things, Mr. Miller helped place values on mortgage securities.
''This provided him an opportunity to develop a deep understanding of the housing finance markets,'' says Mr. Lambright, 41, now the chief financial officer of Sapphire Energy, a renewable-energy company in San Diego that produces oil from algae.
Mr. Lambright recalls how Mr. Miller, shuttling between Washington and his home in the New York area, navigated complex questions, like how the government would guarantee many millions of dollars in assets held by Citigroup.
''I would find him on conference calls at 3 in the morning, dealing with lawyers, trying to untangle really complicated details,'' Mr. Lambright recalls. No one on the TARP team had time for a social life. ''Socializing in late 2008 and early 2009 meant grabbing a cup of coffee in the Treasury cafeteria,'' he says.
The crisis passed, but since September 2008, an estimated 3.9 million families have lost their homes to foreclosure. Nationwide, home prices have plunged by about a third from their peak in 2006. Some markets, like Las Vegas, are down more than 60 percent, according to Green Street Advisors, a real estate research firm in Newport Beach, Calif.
All of this is good news for someone with money looking to buy homes.
Demand for single-family home rentals has always been there: it represents 33 percent of home rentals, according to Green Street. Until now, though, most rentals were handled by small-time landlord-entrepreneurs who owned five or 10 houses, says Bob Curran, a managing director at Fitch Ratings.
INDUSTRY experts say the potential profits are enormous. They compare the current home market to the commercial real estate market after the savings and loan bust of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Back then, early investors realized double-digit -- and in some cases triple-digit -- returns. Still, some question how long -- and how far -- these big investors can ride the market this time.
Nevertheless, Colony, the private-equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and others have expressed interest in following Silver Bay's lead in taking home investment entities public. The pros are offering mom and pop a slice of the action -- a development that has often been a sign that the big money has already been made.
Silver Bay's financial future will ultimately depend on how much it pays for homes, repairs and maintenance, as well as its ability to lease those homes and for how much. Dealing with hundreds or thousands of individual homes across various states is different from dealing with, say, apartment buildings in one area. Valuations are tricky.
Colony, for example, recently sent 50 people to bid on foreclosed properties at auctions in eight counties in the Atlanta area to ensure that the homes were carefully assessed, recalls Justin Chang, acting chief executive of Colony American Homes, a division of Colony Capital. ''You can't sit in your office underwriting on your computer -- you can't dial it in,'' he says. ''You need local men and women who really know those markets.''
Investors who don't do their homework may see the values of their investments plummet, much the way people lost big on mortgage investments in 2008. Maintenance expenses are one wild card. Another is whether people who rent single-family homes -- some of whom lost houses to foreclosure -- will be able to keep up the rent.
Most of all, the American dream of homeownership burns.
''People want to own, and when the opportunity comes back for people to be able to buy their own homes, they will,'' says Richard Anderson, managing director at BMO Capital Markets. ''Let's not forget -- the American dream is not to rent a home. It's to own a home. And that's not changing anytime soon.''

REDWOOD CITY, Calif.
''YOU are walking around naked on the Internet and you need some clothes,'' says Michael Fertik. ''I am going to sell you some.''
Naked? Not exactly, but close.
Mr. Fertik, 34, is the chief executive of Reputation.com, a company that helps people manage their online reputations. From his perch here in Silicon Valley, he views the digital screens in our lives, the smartphones and the tablets, the desktops and the laptops, as windows of a house. People go about their lives on the inside, he says, while dozens of marketing and analytics companies watch through the windows, sizing them up like peeping Toms. 
By now many Americans are learning that they are living in a surveillance economy. ''Information resellers,'' also known as ''data brokers,'' have collected hundreds to thousands of details -- what we buy, our race or ethnicity, our finances and health concerns, our Web activities and social networks -- on almost every American adult. Other companies that specialize in ranking consumers use computer algorithms to covertly score Internet users, identifying some as ''high-value'' consumers worthy of receiving pitches for premium credit cards and other offers, while dismissing others as a waste of time and marketing money. Yet another type of company, called an ad-trading platform, profiles Internet users and auctions off online access to them to marketers in a practice called ''real-time bidding.''
As these practices have come to light, several members of Congress, and federal agencies, have opened investigations.
At least for now, however, these companies typically do not permit consumers to see the records or marketing scores that have been compiled about them. And that is perfectly legal.
Now, Mr. Fertik, the loquacious, lion-maned founder of Reputation.com, says he has the free-market solution. He calls it a ''data vault,'' or ''a bank for other people's data.''
Here at Reputation.com's headquarters, a vast open-plan office decorated with industrial-looking metal struts and reclaimed wood -- a discreet homage to the lab where Thomas Edison invented the light bulb -- his company has amassed a database on millions of consumers. Mr. Fertik plans to use it to sell people on the idea of taking control of their own marketing profiles. To succeed, he will have to persuade people that they must take charge of their digital personas.
Pointing out the potential hazards posed by data brokers and the like is part of Mr. Fertik's M.O. Covert online profiling and scoring, he says, may unfairly exclude certain Internet users from marketing offers that could affect their financial, educational or health opportunities -- a practice Mr. Fertik calls ''Weblining.'' He plans to market Reputation.com's data vault, scheduled to open for business early next year, as an antidote.
''A data privacy vault,'' he says, ''is a way to control yourself as a person.''
Reputation.com is at the forefront of a nascent industry called ''personal identity management.'' The company's business model for its vault service involves collecting data about consumers' marketing preferences and giving them the option to share the information on a limited basis with certain companies in exchange for coupons, say, or status upgrades. In turn, participating companies will get access both to potential customers who welcome their pitches and to details about the exact products and services those people are seeking. In theory, the data vault would earn money as a kind of authorization supervisor, managing the permissions that marketers would need to access information about Reputation.com's clients.
To some, the idea seems a bit quixotic.
Reputation.com, with $67 million in venture capital, is not making a profit. Although the company's ''privacy'' products, like removing clients' personal information from list broker and marketing databases, are popular, its reputation management techniques can be controversial. For instance, it offers services meant to make negative commentary about individual or corporate clients less visible on the Web.
And there are other hurdles, like competition. A few companies, like Personal, have already introduced vault services. Also, a number of other enterprises have tried -- and quickly failed -- to sell consumers on data lockers.
Even so, Mr. Fertik contends Reputation.com has the answer. The company already has several hundred thousand paying customers, he says, and patents on software that can identify consumers' information online and score their reputations. He intends to show clients their scores and advise them on how to improve them.
''You can't just build a vault and wish that vendors cared enough about your data to pay for it,'' Mr. Fertik says. ''You have to build a business that gives you the lift to accumulate a data set and attract consumers, the science to create insights that are valuable to vendors, and the power to impose restrictions on the companies who consume your data.''
THE consumer data trade is large and largely unregulated.
Companies and organizations in the United States spend more than $2 billion a year on third-party data about individuals, according to a report last year on personal identity management from Forrester Research, a market research firm. They spend billions more on credit data, market research and customer data analytics, the report said.
Unlike consumer reporting agencies, which compile credit reports, however, business-to-business companies that calculate consumer valuation scores, or collect and sell consumer marketing data, are not required by federal law to show people the records the companies have about them or allow them to correct errors in their own files.
Marketing industry groups argue that regulation is unnecessary. They say Web sites have privacy policies to explain what data they and their business partners collect. They add that third-party data collectors do not know Internet users' real names and compile consumers' online marketing records under customer code numbers. Besides, they say, Internet users who are uncomfortable with seeing ads based on data-mining about themselves may use an industry group's program, Your Ad Choices, to opt out of receiving customized pitches.
As the popular conversation shifts from practices like privacy policies and opt-outs to ideas like consumer empowerment and data rights, however, marketing industry efforts have not kept pace with changing public attitudes, analysts say.
''Consumers are leaving an exponentially growing digital footprint across channels and media, and they are awakening to the fact that marketers use this data for financial gain,'' Fatemeh Khatibloo, an analyst at Forrester, wrote in the report. ''This, combined with growing concerns about data security, means that individuals increasingly want to know when data about them is being collected, what is being stored and by whom, and how that data is being used.''
A variety of industries could respond by providing services that offer consumers greater control, she wrote. These might include online companies like Yahoo, Microsoft and Google that already house certain categories of data for consumers; social networks like Facebook and LinkedIn; data vaults like Personal, which allow consumers to store and manage certain kinds of data; and companies like Reputation.com whose business model already relies on customers willing to pay for data privacy.
In a phone interview last month, Ms. Khatibloo described how such an ecosystem might work.
Consumers could choose a variety of companies or institutions to house and manage different categories of their information. They might select a financial institution as the gatekeeper for their financial data, a medical center to manage their health data, and a consumer data locker as their retail manager. Then, when a person is ready to buy a car, she could authorize her personal vault to share relevant financial and insurance information with a car dealer. Or a person might allow his home insurer to survey his retail data vault for purchases every month and automatically increase his insurance coverage if he buys expensive items like a home entertainment system, she said.
''What is necessary to make that happen,'' Ms. Khatibloo said, is ''an inflection point of consumers adopting technology that makes it more valuable for marketers to come to them directly for their data.''
Marketers and information resellers will also have to acknowledge that consumers have some rights to information collected about them, she said. If the industry does not update its data capture practices, legislators and regulators are likely to mandate public data access, she said.
With increasing complaints by consumer advocacy groups and investigations by the news media, the surveillance economy is attracting greater government scrutiny. Two separate efforts in Congress are now examining practices by third-party consumer data collectors. Regulators at the Federal Trade Commission and researchers at the Government Accountability Office are also investigating. In a report this year, the F.T.C. recommended that Congress pass a law giving consumers the right to have some access to the records data brokers compile about them.
''We have a right, I think, to all of the data we have a hand in generating,'' Ms. Khatibloo said. ''I have the right to know who is tracking me online, who is looking at my behavior as I move from site to site, what data they are collecting, all of these.''
MR. FERTIK, blue marker in hand, sketches his vision of a data vault on a white board in a conference room at Reputation.com's headquarters. ''The problem is you don't own your data,'' he says. ''Now, imagine owning your data.''
He sketches a silo and labeles it ''data privacy vault.'' To the left of the silo, he draws an arrow saying ''IN: data about people.'' To the right of the vault, he draws another arrow which says ''OUT: data to vendors.''
It is a system he has previously described at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland; at Harvard Law School; at the Aspen Institute. He points to the diagram.
''This is the future. Let me demystify it. This is not difficult technology,'' he says. ''It's a database where you put your data, or we put it for you, and there are some rules as to how it is externalized or shared.''
Mr. Fertik's thinking on consumer privacy developed in part from what he called his Upper West Side, civil rights, ''Jewish, lefty, pinko'' upbringing and his Dalton, Horace Mann, Harvard College, Harvard Law School education. The result, Reputation.com, founded in 2006, is a part social justice, part profit motive.
''I thought something was wrong,'' Mr. Fertik says. ''You know when you go into a bank or an insurer that you may get offered different rates than the next person, but you have no idea when you go on the Internet that your options, the offers you get or whether you get a coupon, have been defined 20 steps before you get to a site.''
For $99 per year, clients can have the company remove their personal details from databases maintained by various information resellers. They can also install company software that blocks Web tracking by 200 data brokers, advertising networks and ad trading platforms. For $5,000 a year, Reputation.com also offers a ''white glove'' service for executives who want their personal details removed from list brokers with more cumbersome opt-out processes.
Reputation's forthcoming data vault service is just a more elaborate attempt to monetize consumer privacy.
Mr. Fertik says he doesn't think it will be difficult to persuade people to store their data in the vault and share some of it with selected companies in exchange for benefits like cash, coupons or status upgrades. The companies that get permission to gain access to his clients' records, he adds, will have to sign contracts agreeing not to sell or share them with third parties.
Still, some people may not be comfortable with the fact that Reputation.com has already amassed files on millions of Americans mainly by scraping the Web. Other people may wonder whether a consumer data vault is truly secure. Mr. Fertik says Reputation.com will never share or sell clients' information without their permission.
Convincing marketers that Reputation.com's vault has more valuable information and consumer insights than an ordinary data broker is another challenge. ''In order to make our information attractive to Best Buy, Amazon or Disney World, we'd have to tell them we have 5 percent more information about you and better insights than other sources,'' Mr. Fertik says.
EXECUTIVES in technology, retail, marketing and other industries like to say that data is ''the new oil'' or, at least, the fuel that powers the Internet economy. It is a metaphor that casts consumers as natural resources with no say over the valuable commodities that companies extract from them.
Data vaults could give consumers more control over who sees certain kinds of information about them and how that information is used.
It is already a common practice in health care. Patients of the Kaiser Permanente system, for example, can use an online health manager to handle information about their health care, prescriptions and insurance. Elderly parents might also choose to give access to their health vault to offspring who help manage their care.
Still, consumers may not care enough about data-mining by marketers and information resellers to patronize data vaults. And legislators may eventually require information resellers to periodically provide consumers with free data reports, Ms. Khatibloo, of Forrester, said. That would put a dent in the fee-for-service data vault business.
In fact, some politicians and regulators already argue that services that charge people to control their personal data are not an appropriate solution to comprehensive online data collection.
''Having to pay a fee in order to engage in a retrospective effort to claw back personal information doesn't seem to us the right way to go about this,'' David Vladeck, the director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection at the Federal Trade Commission, said at a Congressional hearing in 2010.
Regulators are moving to give consumers more control over data without having to pay for it. In February, for example, the White House assigned the Commerce Department to supervise the development of a ''Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights,'' a code of conduct to be worked out between industry and consumer advocacy groups.
While governmental efforts inch along, companies like Reputation.com are forging ahead with new services that promise consumers more insight into the data collected about them. This month, for example, the direct-to-consumer division of Equifax, the credit information services company, plans to begin offering its customers a separate personal data report from Reputation.com in addition to their credit report. Some Equifax customers will also be offered the option to have Reputation.com delete personal details, like home addresses and phone numbers, from certain information broker databases.
''We see broadening consumers' understanding of what's out there about them online as a very natural extension of what we do today,'' said Trey Loughran, the president of Equifax Personal Information Solutions.
Next spring, TransUnion Interactive, the consumer division of the TransUnion credit information company, plans to offer its customers similar services from Reputation.com.
These deals in no way signify that data vaults are a sure thing or, if they are, that Reputation.com is the company to take them to the masses. But the sudden interest from corporations like Equifax and TransUnion gives credence to the idea that consumers increasingly want to see data collected about themselves and that there is some commercial benefit in showing it to them.
After all, Mr. Fertik says, ''it's your data.''

HEADLINE: A Fringe Politician Moves to Japan's National Stage

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Shintaro Ishihara has been a rare, flamboyant presence in Japan's otherwise drab political world for four decades. A novelist turned right-wing firebrand, he has long held celebrity status on the political margins, where he was known for dramatic flourish. He once signed a pact in blood to oppose diplomatic ties with China because of its communist government, and he published a book at the height of Japan's economic power that lectured his countrymen on the need to end what he considered its postwar servility to the United States.
Now, at 80, Mr. Ishihara is leading a newly formed populist party and has emerged as a contender for prime minster, vowing to turn Japan into a more independent, possibly nuclear-armed nation. While political analysts deem him a long shot, they say the fact that he has gotten this far after decades of pushing what was seen as a fringe agenda is a worrying sign of how desperate this nation is for strong leadership after years of cascading troubles. 
With his promises to restore Japan's battered national pride, Mr. Ishihara has staked out an even more stridently nationalistic position than the current front-runner, Shinzo Abe, the leader of the conservative Liberal Democratic Party, who has called for revising Japan's pacifist constitution. Analysts worry that if Mr. Ishihara succeeds in his bid to become prime minister, he could weaken relations with the United States, yank Japan to the right and damage ties with China, which is already angered by his almost single-handedly rekindling a territorial dispute over an island chain.
But even if in the likely event that Mr. Ishihara loses, they say, his campaign could still have a lasting effect, bringing patriotic populism into the political mainstream of a nation that has shunned such open jingoism since its devastating defeat in World War II.
''This election will be a test of whether Japan is really losing its dovishness,'' said Takeshi Sasaki, a politics professor at Gakushuin University in Tokyo. ''There is so much irritation at how everything seems to be going wrong, and Japan is losing its pride. Politicians on the right like Ishihara and Abe are trying to fan these flames.''
The rise of the two hard-liners has already contributed to hand-wringing among liberals who are anxious that the foreboding sense that Japan is fast becoming an international has-been has left the Japanese vulnerable to long-suppressed nationalism. Even those who call those fears overblown acknowledge that anti-China feelings, which could be easily exploited, are rising as that country eclipses Japan, builds a formidable military and makes its territorial ambitions clear.
From Mr. Ishihara's vantage point, those geopolitical realities make now the perfect time for Japan to put him in charge.
''Here I am, the old man who has run amok!'' he bellowed to a wave of applause at a recent campaign appearance in front of Shinjuku train station in Tokyo. ''I am 80 years old, and I am standing here because I want to break through the indecisive and barren politics that is stifling Japan!''
A tall, bespectacled figure, Mr. Ishihara spent most of his short speech emphasizing what has become the central campaign message of his Japan Restoration Party: offering forceful leadership to end Japan's long political drift by breaking the grip of bureaucrats and vested interests.
Much of the party's message, however, has become vintage Ishihara. He goes further than Mr. Abe, calling for an outright scrapping of Japan's antiwar constitution, written by its postwar American occupiers. He still speaks about ending what he sees as political and cultural subservience to the United States and pledges to resist Chinese territorial appetites, promising to build permanent structures on the disputed islands in a move likely to further antagonize China.
''I cannot allow myself to die until my Japan, which has been made a fool of by China, and seduced as a mistress by the United States, is able to stand up again as a stronger, more beautiful nation,'' Mr. Ishihara said last month to reporters, explaining why he resigned after 13 years as Tokyo's governor to return to national politics. He did so after being asked to lead the fledgling Restoration Party's slate in this month's parliamentary election by its founder, the popular mayor of Osaka who did not yet want to run for national office.
So far, polls show that Mr. Ishihara has only limited appeal. His party's approval ratings are in the low teens, about the same as the unpopular incumbent Democratic Party, but below Mr. Abe's Liberal Democrats, who poll only slightly better, at around 20 percent. Polls also show that more than half of voters disapprove of Mr. Ishihara and of scrapping the antiwar clause of Japan's constitution.
Still, there is a slight chance the Liberal Democrats will not garner enough support to win a majority in the lower house. If that happens, Mr. Ishihara stands a chance of becoming a kingmaker who can name his price for joining a coalition government: the prime ministership.
Mr. Ishihara seems to be betting that his undeniable star power will give him an edge in an election crowded by unknown new parties and established parties that many people view as too indecisive or inept to move Japan past its financial paralysis.
Part of that celebrity was inherited from his younger brother, Yujiro, a movie star whose bad-boy persona won him comparisons to James Dean until he died in 1987. The elder Mr. Ishihara also developed his own name recognition, first as an author and screenwriter (for some of his brother's movies) and later as a lawmaker. His fame gave him a special status in Japanese politics as a radical who was tolerated by the mainstream, though not taken seriously -- until now.
As governor of Tokyo since 1999, he proved popular by projecting an image of a decisive, hands-on leader, making the point by wearing the gray jumpsuit of a city employee to the office. Although vested interests often get their way in Japan, he brushed aside objections by businesses to make Tokyo one of the first places in the world to adopt a cap-and-trade system for limiting diesel truck emissions.
But he also offended non-Japanese residents by blaming violent crime on foreigners, adding to fears that his nationalism is grounded in the same type of xenophobia that some suspect underlies his continual references to China by the name that imperial Japan used during its brutal occupation of that country in the 1930s.
And while Mr. Ishihara's message seems to appeal to male voters anxious about their country's future and angry over China's claims to the disputed islands, he can also seem out of touch. Last year, he was forced to issue a rare public apology after calling the deadly tsunami in northeast Japan ''punishment from heaven'' for what he perceived as Japan's moral decline.
Reservations about Mr. Ishihara's strong views were shared even by some who attended his recent Tokyo rally and were considering supporting him.
''Ishihara is running as fast he can to the right,'' said Jiro Ogata, a 22-year-old university student, ''but I don't think the country is going to follow him.''
During the current campaign, Mr. Ishihara has appeared to temper some of his past stands, notably on his country's relationship with the United States. He has not repeated his calls to close American bases in Japan, and has said that he would maintain Japan's security alliance. But he can still appear resentful of a country he feels has belittled his own nation and himself. In one of his dozens of books, he recounted how some American soldiers who occupied Japan after its wartime defeat hit him in the face with an ice cream stick when he refused to step out of their way.
He was a junior high school student at the time, but politicians who know him say the years since have not diminished his sense that Japan needs to reclaim its honor.
''Ishihara sees this as his last chance to win a place in the history books,'' said Masakuni Murakami, a former Liberal Democratic Party heavyweight who has known Mr. Ishihara for more than three decades. ''He wants to go down as the man who gave Japan its pride and self-confidence back.''

HEADLINE: Tax Arithmetic Shows Top Rate Is Just a Starter

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Despite hints in recent days that President Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner might compromise on the tax rate to be paid by top earners, a host of other knotty tax questions could still derail a deal to avert a fiscal crisis in January.
The math shows why. Even if Republicans were to agree to Mr. Obama's core demand -- that the top marginal income rates return to the Clinton-era levels of 36 percent and 39.6 percent after Dec. 31, rather than stay at the Bush-era rates of 33 percent and 35 percent -- the additional revenue would be only about a quarter of the $1.6 trillion that Mr. Obama wants to collect over 10 years. That would be about half of the $800 billion that Republicans have said they would be willing to raise.
That calculation alone suggests the scope of the other major tax issues to be negotiated beyond tax rates. And that is why many people in both parties remain unsure that a deal will come together before Jan. 1. Without agreement, more than $500 billion in automatic tax increases on all Americans and cuts in domestic and military programs will take hold, which could cause a recession if left in place for months, economists say. 
''The question is making sure that we hit a revenue target that's required for a truly balanced deficit-reduction plan,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee. ''And when the president and all of us say this is a question of math, we mean it. It's very hard to make the numbers work without the top rates going back to the full Clinton-era levels.''
The top tax rates are taking center stage right now because Mr. Obama believes he won a mandate after campaigning relentlessly on the idea of extending Mr. Bush's tax cuts only for households with annual income below $250,000. But the two parties also have ideological differences on taxes affecting savings, investment and inheritance, which have flared in battles going back to the Reagan years. To get a deal in the coming weeks, those differences must be addressed at least in broad terms, even if the details are left to a battle over revamping the tax code next year.
The argument over rates is far from settled. Although the two sides seem close enough on the percentages for easy compromise, principle and politics loom large: Republicans oppose raising rates as a matter of ideology, saying that it kills jobs, and the president insists that he will not keep the Bush-era rates on income above roughly $250,000 after two campaigns in which he vowed to return them to the levels of the Clinton years.
''Just to be clear, I'm not going to sign any package that somehow prevents the top rate from going up for folks at the top 2 percent,'' he said Thursday.
In recent days, comments from some Republicans, including Mr. Boehner, their chief negotiator, have hinted that the party -- recognizing its weak hand -- might be moving toward a concession on tax rates. Seldom mentioned is that Mr. Obama's revenue total also reflects four other changes from Bush-era tax cuts: higher tax rates on investment income from capital gains and dividends, and the restoration of two other Clinton-era provisions limiting deductions and tax exemptions for affluent individuals.
Together those changes would raise $407.4 billion over a decade -- nearly as much as the president's proposal on higher rates, which would raise $441.6 billion by 2023, for a total of $849 billion. Another $119 billion would come from higher estate taxes, opposed by Republicans and some Democrats.
And both the president and Republicans are committed to raising hundreds of billions of dollars by overhauling the tax code to further limit or end the tax breaks that high-income taxpayers can claim, though they differ in how to do that.
Republicans want to raise all $800 billion from overhauling the tax code, erasing tax breaks for high-income households and using the new revenues both to reduce deficits and to lower everyone's tax rates. But they have not proposed how to do that, and the president insists it cannot be done without hitting middle-income taxpayers.
Mr. Obama has proposed to keep existing tax breaks but to limit the rate of those breaks for people in higher tax brackets to 28 percent, which would raise $584 billion in a decade. He has proposed variations of that proposal for four years, only to be ignored by both parties because of opposition from charitable groups, the housing industry, insurers and others to curbing deductions for charitable giving, mortgage insurance and other purposes.
Yet both parties seem poised to confront that opposition because they want a budget deal to commit Congress and the White House to overhaul the tax code next year. That is another reason Mr. Obama wants to have the top rates as high as possible: The lower the rates now, the harder it would be to raise revenues next year in overhauling the code.
Some Republicans inside and outside of Congress agree. ''Actually, I would rather see the rates go up than do it the other way because it gives us greater chance to reform the tax code and broaden the base in the future,'' Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, said last week.
Roughly splitting the difference on the top rates -- settling at 35 percent and 37 percent -- would collect nearly $200 billion over 10 years, under half the amount that would be raised if the rates reverted to Clinton-era levels, according to data from Citizens for Tax Justice and the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, research groups that advocate for a progressive tax code.
In the years of debate over the Bush tax cuts, which predates Mr. Obama's first election, $800 billion has been the rough estimate for how much revenue could be raised in the first decade by ending them for the highest-income 2 percent of taxpayers. But most attention focused on the top rates, which account for half of the revenue equation.
The remainder would come from the other four tax changes for Americans with the highest income, two raising taxes on investment income from capital gains and dividends and two restoring restrictions on the itemized deductions and exemptions claimed by high earners.
Under Mr. Obama's plan, the tax rates for long-term capital gains and dividends, now 15 percent, would revert to 20 percent for capital gains and to 39.6 percent for dividends, the same as for ordinary income. Republicans oppose the increases, and Senate Democrats oppose the proposed tax on dividends; their bill would tax both dividends and capital gains at 20 percent.
People in both parties say that the four tax issues can be readily worked out. Mr. Obama is widely expected to give ground on the main sticking point, the dividends tax. Yet that would mean roughly $100 billion less in additional revenue over 10 years than his current proposal for the higher dividend tax.
Another dispute is over estate and gift taxes. Here again Democrats are divided within as well as against Republicans, and big money is at stake -- $118.8 billion through 2022 under Mr. Obama's plan, or $143.3 billion counting assorted other adjustments.
Currently, a two-year-old bipartisan compromise holds that inheritances are taxed at 35 percent, with an exemption of $5 million for each spouse. On Jan. 1 that will revert to a 55 percent tax beyond the first $1 million of inheritance. Mr. Obama is seeking a middle-ground 45 percent rate beyond $3.5 million, but some Democrats from states with large farms and ranches favor lower estate taxes.
All of these tax issues await some agreement on the core issue of marginal rates. And a final accord on taxes rests on separate questions of spending being settled -- Republicans will not give further on raising revenues until they know what Democrats will agree to by way of long-term reductions in spending for Medicare and other fast-growing entitlement benefit programs.

HEADLINE: How a Fiscal Impasse, In 1990, Was Broken

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Back when leaders led, followers followed and the news media made less noise, the commanding figures of American government retreated to Andrews Air Force Base to forge a bipartisan budget compromise.
That 11-day summit meeting failed - despite the threat of deep automatic spending cuts, and despite the top Republican's acknowledgment that taxes had to go up.
A smaller group of negotiators later struck a deal inside the Capitol. That failed, too - defeated on the House floor by a coalition of liberal and conservative rebels. 
History now recalls those events in the fall of 1990, and the agreement Congress eventually enacted, as the opening chapter of Washington's long, successful climb out of the deficit hole of the 1980s. And they offer a perspective on the current stalemate between a White House and a Congress struggling to repeat that achievement.
"There is a flow to these things," said William Hoagland, who was a top Senate Republican aide during the earlier negotiations. The bigger the deal, the greater the turbulence.
"There always seems to be little cooperation for a long time," said Robert Reischauer, a Democrat who led the Congressional Budget Office then. "And then things come together relatively rapidly."
That does not mean President Obama, Speaker John A. Boehner and other main players will succeed in achieving a consensus to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff. Neither Mr. Hoagland nor Mr. Reischauer voice much optimism.
But the 1990 experience provides a reminder that high-stakes budget negotiations can sometimes include high-velocity shifts from despair to deliverance. The prospect of an across-the-board increase in tax rates and automatic spending cuts, which could tip the economy back into recession, and a potential showdown over the debt limit next year provide powerful incentives for a breakthrough.
Similar forces helped propel the deal in 1990. The talks began in spring as annual budget deficits, which had topped $200 billion before declining during the latter part of Ronald Reagan's presidency, rose over that mark again under President George Bush.
A group of foreign central bankers visiting Washington warned Mr. Bush that he needed to strike a deal with the Democrats who controlled both houses of Congress. Without one, an earlier budget-reduction law was about to trigger automatic cuts even deeper than the so-called sequester looming now.
But the Republican president, long before Grover Norquist became famous, was hamstrung by his own unequivocal no-new-taxes pledge. Once Mr. Bush abandoned it - embracing higher revenues, though not higher rates, just as Mr. Boehner has - negotiations quickened.
Yet at the time the pace felt glacial. After talks in a Senate office building failed, participants moved to Andrews to escape the media spotlight.
Eventually, a smaller group of just eight negotiators, meeting in Speaker Thomas S. Foley's office, produced a $500 billion deficit reduction package that included $134 billion in taxes and substantial cuts in Medicare. Then Republican conservatives, led by Representative Newt Gingrich, joined liberal Democrats in blowing it up.
After a six-month slog, the White House, offering fewer spending cuts and more tax increases, won over enough Democrats to enact it. "The final agreement was reached largely out of exhaustion and convenience," former Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, said at a recent panel discussion.
By some measures, this White House and Congress ought to be able to move faster. Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner began their postelection discussions having gone through all the labor of their near-miss "grand bargain" talks last year.
The president's chief of staff, Jacob J. Lew, has experience in fiscal negotiations, including the 1983 deal between Speaker Tip O'Neill and President Reagan on Social Security and the 1997 budget-balancing agreement between President Bill Clinton and Republicans.
But those eras were different. The two major parties were more ideologically disparate and less polarized. That extended from legislative leaders through the ranks of their staffs, which could quietly explore potential solutions with higher levels of trust and discretion.
"It allowed you to test things without risk" that premature publicity would quash them, said Sheila Burke, then the chief of staff for the Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole.
As unwelcome as news coverage could be, it was a whisper compared with the nonstop 21st-century din on television and online. The talks took place as Mr. Bush prepared for war with Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait, substantially diverting public attention, whereas today the fiscal talks dominate the news.
The result: talks today combine louder public posturing with less-productive staff work behind the scenes.
"We're facing a much tougher and more difficult challenge than we had in 1990," Mr. Foley said at the panel discussion.
The Republican Party's anti-tax wing is stronger now. No one has forgotten that President Bush lost his 1992 re-election bid after breaking his no-tax pledge.
Even two values that all parties should be able to agree on - transparency and accountability - represent new obstacles.
Staff members and interest groups alike have ready access to sophisticated analyses of tax and spending changes, which they can use to instantly mobilize opposition.
And memories of this fall's campaign are still fresh. Though independent observers say a deal requires both Medicare cuts and higher taxes, Mr. Obama and Democrats ran as Medicare's protectors, Republicans as unflinching foes of tax increases.
"The more details you have, the harder it is to reach agreement," Mr. Reischauer said. And "we've just been through an election in which the members promised not to do what they have to do."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In Talks, G.O.P. May Have To Just Say Yes

BYLINE: By ROBERT H. FRANK. 
Robert H. Frank is an economics professor at the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University.

 BODY:
IN their book, ''Getting to Yes,'' Roger Fisher and William Ury introduce what may be the most important concept in the theory of negotiations: the best alternative to a negotiated agreement, or Batna. Knowing your true Batna -- and your adversary's -- is critical in bargaining. A vivid example from the entertainment world illustrates the concept and offers some useful hints about how the current fiscal negotiations in Washington are likely to unfold.
The Warner Brothers 1999 hit comedy ''Analyze This'' portrays a mob boss (Robert De Niro) and his psychiatrist (Billy Crystal), who share a passion for the recordings of Tony Bennett. With the film almost completed -- and with Mr. Bennett already an integral part of the plot -- the studio finally got around to approaching the crooner with an offer of $15,000 to sing ''I've Got the World on a String'' in the movie's closing scene. But as Danny Bennett, the singer's son and business manager, later explained, the executives made a fatal mistake by not scheduling this conversation sooner: ''Hey, they shot the whole film around Tony being the end gag and they're offering me $15,000?'' 
Had studio officials made their offer at the outset, they would have had much more leverage. If the Bennetts demanded an unreasonable sum, the filmmakers could have rewritten the script and used some other singer. At the 11th hour, however, Warner Brothers' best alternative to a negotiated agreement was to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars reshooting the film. In the end, the studio paid Tony Bennett $200,000 for a brief cameo appearance.
A similar logic is shaping the current negotiations between President Obama and Congressional Republicans. The Republicans want to keep everyone's tax rates the same while raising revenue by closing tax loopholes yet unspecified. The president, for his part, wants to restore the 39.6 percent top tax rate for families earning more than $250,000, while maintaining current rates for everyone else. But with the Bush tax cuts scheduled to expire at year's end, the Republicans face a hurdle similar to the one that confronted Warner Brothers.
In the earlier instance, both sides knew that failure to reach agreement would be far more costly to Warner Brothers than to Tony Bennett. Here as well, both sides know that failure to reach agreement before January will be much more costly to the Republican negotiators than to the president. That's because expiration of the Bush tax cuts lets Mr. Obama confront the Republicans with an extremely unpalatable choice.
If the year ends without a deal, tax rates for everyone automatically revert to those in effect when President Bill Clinton left office. Neither side wants that to happen, but if it does, the president has a strong hand to play. On Day 1 of the new Congressional session, he could propose legislation that would restore the Bush tax cuts for families with incomes under $250,000. Republicans could then vote in favor, in which case the president gets exactly what he had hoped for; or they could vote against, in which case they will have blocked a reduction in almost every voter's tax rates. They may wish that these weren't the alternatives they face, but both sides know that many Republicans would find the second option politically untenable.
That realization appears to have led some Republicans to resurrect their time-honored claim that because many top earners own small businesses, higher top tax rates would severely compromise job creation. But that argument flies in the face of the basic cost-benefit test that governs rational hiring decisions. As every economics textbook on the subject makes clear, a business will hire additional workers whenever, and only whenever, their contribution to the bottom line promises to exceed their pay. If that criterion is satisfied, hiring makes economic sense, no matter how poor the business owner might be. And if it isn't, no hiring will occur, even if the owner is a billionaire.
An awareness of the weakness of their negotiating position may also explain recent Republican attempts to portray the impasse in Washington as a fiscal cliff that poses an unthinkable disaster for the nation. But as Jonathan Chait of New York magazine has argued, the fiscal cliff is a bad metaphor for the situation we are facing. Because middle-class tax rates would be unlikely to remain higher for long, they would have little impact on overall spending. And as the president would tell voters, even that limited impact can be avoided by making the middle-class tax cuts retroactive to Jan. 1.
THE same goes for so-called sequestration -- the across-the-board spending cuts to defense and other non-entitlement spending that automatically start to occur after Jan. 1 in the absence of a budget deal. As both sides recognize, blanket cuts are a terrible way to reduce government spending. But here, too, getting to year's end without an agreement would strengthen the president's hand.
Government programs exist because at least some constituents want them, which makes even wasteful ones extremely difficult to cut. Both parties could curry favor by embracing proposals to restore money for the programs that voters value most, and the president could delay cuts while Congress was debating those proposals.
In short, the nation faces not a fiscal cliff, but rather a gentle fiscal slope.
Getting to January without a deal would cause anxiety that everyone wants to avoid -- especially Republicans, since opinion polls suggest that most voters will blame them if negotiations break down. But the president and Republicans would prefer to reach agreement now on whatever they would be willing to agree to after new year.
Let's hope they move rapidly. Any such agreement, however, will be heavily shaped by knowledge of what would otherwise happen after Jan. 1. As Mr. Fisher and Mr. Ury wrote, Batna is the only standard that can protect negotiators from accepting terms that are too unfavorable and from rejecting terms it would be in their interest to accept.
Some have likened today's negotiations to a game of chicken, in which the loser is whichever of two cars on a head-on collision course swerves first. But that metaphor isn't instructive without some additional texture: if Republicans are driving a Chevy Spark, the president is driving a Mack truck.

HEADLINE: Post-Polemic

BYLINE: By ANDREW GOLDMAN

 BODY:
Your documentary, ''2016,'' suggested that if Obama were re-elected, America would never again be the country we know and love. Specifically, how do you predict America will change? ''2016'' is based on an experiment: what if you let Obama do it himself? That experiment is necessarily limited because I'm not factoring in a Republican House, a Supreme Court or the tug of public opinion.
Did you make those qualifications in the film? I don't remember that part. I implied it. 
But it felt like ''2012,'' the movie where the world explodes. What's the scariest thing that's going to happen? The scary thing is a dramatic erosion of American position in the world -- its economic, military position, as well as America's influence. Obama is not the man at the wheel desperately trying to conserve American power, influence and wealth. For ideological reasons, he wants the slipping to continue. He's actually the architect of it.
In your film, you traveled to Nairobi to interview Obama's half brother, to get him to express frustration that the president hasn't helped him financially. It had to be disappointing when he wasn't upset at all. Initially. Then I realized that this gives the story a more interesting twist. I expected George to be this helpless slum kid who had an outstretched hand. In fact, I find George to be a cunning, self-reliant guy -- in a certain respect, a kind of conservative. He's not looking for a handout. I admired George for that.
You suggest that President Obama may have decided not to support George because of his politics. That's right. It may be that Obama doesn't want to help George because he sees George as an ideological enemy.
One of your film's central arguments is that Barack Obama has absorbed the philosophy of a father whom he met once at 10 years old. Is it a bit absurd to think after a short visit, he's the walking embodiment of everything his father believed? Young men are obsessed with their dads, and they remain obsessed if the dad is not around. Remember that there was a lot of discussion about how George W. Bush might have invaded Iraq to atone for the failures of his dad.
Considering how poorly Mitt Romney did among nonwhites, what do you make of the renewed interest in candidates like Bobby Jindal, Marco Rubio and Susana Martinez? To start producing a Republican field that ''looks like America'' is one way to respond. The group I know best, Asian-Americans, are natural fodder for the party. Most are not only economic conservatives but subscribe to a social ideology that is to the right of Pat Robertson. Yet this is a group that actually is voting for Democrats. There's something wrong here.
How did Romney turn off Asian-Americans? Whenever a Gujarati or Sikh businessman comes to a Republican event, it begins with an appeal to Jesus Christ. While the Democrats are really good at making the outsider feel at home, the Republicans make little or no effort.
You recently resigned as president of the Christian-affiliated King's College after it was reported that you brought a woman to a Christian convention and introduced her as your fiancée when neither of you had actually divorced your spouses. Did you do anything wrong? I exercised imprudent judgment. In Christianity there is no intermediate status of being separated. I asked an attorney if there is anything problematic with being engaged while separated, and I was informed absolutely not.
You wrote, ''I had no idea that it is considered wrong in Christian circles.'' I am not a Christian, but I'd guess that it would be high on the list of wrong things. What I meant was I didn't know what rule of Christian morality it violates. I recognize that there would be people who might say Dinesh has only met this woman a few months ago, Dinesh is rushing into things. But that is completely different from saying Dinesh is violating one of the Ten Commandments. Imprudent is not the same thing as wrong.

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
Ordinarily, the unemployment of a film critic would be the very definition of a dog-bites-man story, but the circumstances that separated Michael Calleri from his job at The Niagara Falls Reporter, a small weekly newspaper in upstate New York, were sufficiently peculiar -- and also sufficiently resonant -- to go a bit viral, stirring up a minor storm on the Internet and attracting the attention of a network morning-news show. This was a man-bites-man story that also turned out to be a man-freaks-out-about-women story. In a long narrative uploaded in November by Roger Ebert on The Chicago Sun-Times's Web site, Calleri quoted an e-mail from his boss, Frank Parlato (curiously unnamed in the article), who had recently taken over as editor and publisher of The Reporter. Parlato was not, to put it mildly, a fan of Calleri's movie reviews, but his real problem was with the movies themselves. ''I don't want to publish reviews of films where women are alpha and men are beta,'' he wrote. ''Where women are heroes and villains and men are just lesser versions or shadows of females.'' 
The specific movie that set the editor off was ''Snow White and the Huntsman,'' a retelling of the Grimm fairy tale starring Kristen Stewart and Charlize Theron as the disinherited princess and her vengeful stepmother. The picture's apparent reversal of gender norms -- this Snow White wears armor, wields a sword and leads an army into battle -- struck Parlato (who does not seem to have seen it) as emblematic of ''a Hollywood agenda of glorifying degenerate power women and promoting as natural the weakling, hyena-like men, cum eunuchs.''
A Hollywood agenda of glorifying powerful women -- now that is news! Granting that Parlato's rant seemed to emanate from the same zone of the culture-war id that undid a few Republican Senate candidacies this year, you might still be inclined to wonder if, in sensing a shift in the portrayal of women, he was onto something -- or for that matter to hope that he might have been. After all, the contrary complaint -- that Hollywood is a swamp of testosterone, turning out entertainment that marginalizes or condescends to women when it does not ignore them entirely -- has been around much longer, and has, to say the least, a much stronger grounding in reality. Have things really changed that much?
There is a smattering of evidence to support the impression that they have, because 2012 was, all in all, a pretty good year for movies and also a pretty good year for female heroism. In addition to ''Snow White and the Huntsman,'' there was ''Brave,'' whose flame-haired heroine, Merida, combined Disney-princess pluck with Pixar's visual ingenuity; ''The Hunger Games,'' which drew on young-adult literature to find, in the resourceful person of Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence), a new archetype of survivalist girl power; and perhaps best of all, ''Beasts of the Southern Wild,'' in which a scrappy child of the Louisiana bayou named Hushpuppy (the amazing Quvenzhané Wallis) faced down hurricanes, monsters and the power of the state. And we should not forget the culmination of the ''Twilight'' saga, speaking of Kristen Stewart, whose Bella Swan, grown from a sulky, indecisive teenager into a fiercely protective vampire mother, fought alongside her in-laws against the supernatural forces of evil. Forget about Team Jacob and Team Edward: it was Team Renesmee that triumphed in the end.
Of course it would be silly to proclaim, on the basis of a handful of movies, that some kind of grand role reversal has taken place, that cultural power has shifted toward women, or even that 2012 is yet another ''year of the woman,'' a wishful phrase that surfaces periodically in movies as it does in politics. When the box-office records are tallied, ''The Avengers,'' a superhero frat party with Scarlett Johansson upholding the ''yeah, but it's not all guys'' clause, will most likely be at the top, flanked by Spider-Man, the Dark Knight, James Bond, Liam Neeson and other familiar franchise dudes. At the Oscars, the academy can be expected to continue its tradition of equating gravitas with masculinity. We are likely to see a lot of ''Flight,'' ''Lincoln,'' ''Argo'' and perhaps ''The Master'' (all fine movies, by the way), though such manly titles might be balanced, or even upstaged, by Kathryn Bigelow and ''Zero Dark Thirty,'' starring Jessica Chastain as a C.I.A. officer involved in the hunt for Osama bin Laden.
In hindsight, the first decade of the 21st century can be viewed as a singularly male-dominated era in American cinema. In nearly every sector -- summer blockbusters, indie dramas, awards-trolling prestige pictures, naughty comedies -- stories of men and boys hogged the screens, even as a handful of women found their way into the Hollywood boys' club of studio executives, A-list producers and big-name directors. Hermione Granger was a wonderful smart-girl role model (and nerd-boy crush object), but it was Harry Potter whose name was on the eight-movie billion-dollar fantasy juggernaut and whose epic coming of age ruled the multiplexes from 2001 to 2011. Keeping him company in the kingdom of the tent poles were Spider-Man, Iron Man, Batman, the X-Men and a lot of other men.
Hollywood used to take pride in its ''woman's pictures,'' a category that embraced many of the immortal romances and melodramas of the studio era and that made actresses like Bette Davis, Joan Crawford and Ingrid Bergman into powerful industry players as well as adored stars. The modern analog is the ''chick flick,'' a demeaning name applied mostly to cynical and threadbare rom-coms trotted out with dreary regularity every spring. Movie comedy, once a lively, if tilted, battlefield of the sexes, regressed into an aggressive puerility that was the flip side of macho superhero self-pity. The big joke, repeated endlessly (and sometimes wittily) in Adam Sandler vehicles, school-of-Apatow farces and up-from-mumblecore slackfests is that guys can reject all the traditional trappings of maturity -- jobs, manners, hygiene -- and that girls will sleep with them anyway. And the girls in these movies are not called on to do much else, except be mommies, nice or mean, symbolic or actual. They can serve as the object of or the audience for the guys' jokes but rarely the agents of humor in their own right.
The prevalence of this kind of comedy contributed to the rise of the canard -- ''meme'' is too dignified a word -- that women are not as funny as men. This notion became, in effect, a self-fulfilling prophecy. It consigned brilliant, frequently sexy screen comediennes of the past (like Katharine Hepburn, Claudette Colbert, Judy Holliday, Doris Day, Marilyn Monroe, to name just a few) to the footnotes of film history and made ''Bridesmaids'' feel like a groundbreaking event in the annals of pop culture.
Which, in a way, it was. Partly because it introduced many of us to the unhinged, protean comic gifts of Rebel Wilson, and partly because it made you wonder what had taken so long, given that Maya Rudolph and Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy did not all of a sudden become funny in 2011. And you may also have found yourself wondering why it took the wizards of Pixar 17 years and more than a dozen features to arrive at its first female protagonist, or wishing that Katniss Everdeen had been around when you (or your sisters, or your daughters) were young.
The rush to celebrate movies about women has a way of feeling both belated and disproportionate. Pieces of entertainment become public causes and punditical talking points, burdened with absurdly heavy expectations and outsize significance. It should not, after all, be a big deal that movies like ''Bridesmaids'' or ''The Hunger Games'' exist, perhaps because it should have been a bigger deal when such movies didn't. In 1985, the comic-strip artist and memoirist Alison Bechdel first formulated what has since become known as the Bechdel test, which assesses movies according to a three-step formula. To pass the test, a film ''1. has to have at least two [named] women in it 2. Who talk to each other 3. About something besides a man.'' It is a stunningly simple criterion, and stunning how few movies manage to fulfill it. (Though a visit to bechdeltest.com suggests that things have been improving recently.)
Well, yeah, but wait, hang on. . . . The stated desire for more, better or different kinds of movie representation, like other forms of feminist advocacy, is often met with defensiveness, or heard as special pleading. Girls like action movies, too, so what's the problem? Women talk about men all the time, don't they? Lighten up! I promise I will, but not before noting a deep and ancient bias that underlies the way we talk about movies, and what we see in them -- namely the assumption that stories about men are large, important and universal, while stories about women are particular, local and trivial.
This is not a prejudice limited to movies, of course. Nor, however, is it a primal fact of human nature, encoded by genes and ratified by custom. The Great Tradition of the 19th-century English novel -- so designated by the mighty critic F. R. Leavis, hardly an apologist for feminism -- moved through Jane Austen and George Eliot on the way to Henry James and Joseph Conrad and has at its center the implicit assumption that women's lives and fates are not only interesting but also emblematic, vessels of meaning and mirrors of history. The Dead White Male canon bustles with lively ladies -- Emma Bovary, Hester Prynne and, of course, Anna Karenina, who reappeared on-screen this year in the lithe and energetic person of Keira Knightley.
Part of what makes these women and their fictional sisters so fascinating is that they live their lives and exercise their wills in highly constrained circumstances. In a novel by James or Austen, the question of who a woman will be is always bound up with the questions of whom she will marry and whether, in the cases of the great adulterous heroines listed above, she will be faithful to him. These questions are hardly obsolete, but they seem increasingly narrow when measured against the social realities of the time. In Joe Wright's version of ''Anna Karenina,'' the heroine is a wild bird in a gilded, highly stylized cage, a modern spirit imprisoned by archaic custom. Her entire world conspires to flunk the Bechdel test. She vacillates between the cold, righteous Alexis Karenin and the shallow Count Vronsky, and neither man seems adequate to the force of her passion, which is finally less erotic than existential.
Love remains part of the great drama (and also the comedy) of existence, and it is not as if the great romantic and melodramatic woman's-picture themes -- maternal devotion, sexual longing, enduring commitment -- will ever fade away. Naomi Watts in ''The Impossible'' is surely the mother of the year, a lioness fighting to restore her family in the wake of catastrophe. All of those themes are breathtakingly present in what might be the single finest film of the year, Michael Haneke's ''Amour,'' which won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in May. Emmanuelle Riva plays Anne, who is a wife, a mother, a musician and a teacher and whose decline and death, in the company of her faithful husband, Georges, constitute as intensely particular and as grandly universal a story as you could want. Anne is completely (and painfully) human. She is more than the sum of her domestic, artistic and professional roles, even though she bears the traces, in her extraordinary face, of the various roles she has performed.
It is a fact beyond dispute that the roles available to women in what movie-lovers nervously call the real world have expanded significantly in the last half-century, a fact at once celebrated and lamented in backward-looking pop-cultural phenomena like ''Mad Men.'' But the things that women do -- the people they insist on being -- remain endlessly controversial. It takes very little for individual tastes and decisions to become urgent matters of public debate. It takes, basically, a magazine cover article. Women are breast-feeding their babies, pushing their children to practice violin, reading ''50 Shades of Grey'' on the subway, juggling career and child care, marrying late or not at all, falling behind or taking over the world. Stop the presses!
The problem is not that these issues are not important but rather that they are presented with a sensationalism that tends to undermine their ongoing and complicated significance. The behavior of a woman who appears on the public stage can be counted on to provoke a contentious referendum on the state of women in general. Is this good for women? Is she doing it wrong? This happened, in the last 12 months, to Sandra Fluke and Paula Broadwell, to Rihanna and Ann Romney, and, closer to the matter at hand, to Lena Dunham.
You did not really think I would get through a whole essay on gender and popular culture without mentioning her, did you? But the reception of ''Girls,'' even more than the show itself -- which is, to keep things in perspective, a clever half-hour sitcom about a bunch of recent college graduates -- is an interesting sign of our confused times. Dunham was mocked for her body, sneered at for her supposed nepotism, scolded for her inadequate commitment to diversity and lectured about the inappropriate things her alter ego, Hannah Horvath, does in bed. That much of the criticism came from Dunham's peers is both evidence of a robust feminist discourse in the cultural blogosphere and a legacy of the under- and misrepresentation I have been talking about. Dunham was not quite allowed just to explore her own ideas and experiences. She was expected to get it right, to represent, to set an example and blaze a path.
All of which she did, but not quite in the ways that immediately grabbed attention. ''Girls'' is not primarily about kinky sex, dull boyfriends and creepy older guys who suddenly turn into marriage material (or not). Its real subject is the fraught, funny relationship, in Hannah's life, between ambition and friendship.
That is also, by the way, the subject of ''Bridesmaids'' and, even more so, of ''Pitch Perfect,'' one of the unheralded hits of this year and yet another platform for the fearless and hilarious Rebel Wilson. There are boys in the movie, but the romantic prospects of the heroine, Becca (Anna Kendrick), are even less relevant to the story than those of Katniss Everdeen. The real arc of ''Pitch Perfect'' is Becca's growth as a singer and a functional member of a fractious all-girl a cappella group. The movie is, literally and symbolically, about a young woman finding her voice.
As is Sally Potter's ''Ginger and Rosa,'' an uncommonly sensitive early-'60s coming-of-age story anchored by Elle Fanning's subtle and heartbreaking performance. Her character, Ginger, is the child of Bohemian British parents who longs, above all, to be taken seriously, to grow from a precocious schoolgirl into a grown-up poet.
My point is not to hold any of these characters and films up as positive images. Nor is the purpose of this year's photography portfolio to advance an agenda, score an ideological point or address a historic imbalance. It is, instead, to acknowledge the range and depth of 13 remarkable and very different actresses, and also to convey, through the suggestive medium of pictures and words, an array of intriguing, troubling, inspiring and contradictory possibilities. A partial list of the roles the women in these pages have played this year would include a slave, a sex therapist, a trainer of killer whales, a randy Texas dowager, a 19th-century factory worker driven to prostitution and the two most compelling and morally complicated characters in the semicompelling, morally simplistic ''Dark Knight Rising.'' And also, of course, Katniss and Hushpuppy, authentic superheroes with the power to turn the world upside down.

HEADLINE: Obama and Boehner Talk Deficits at the White House

BYLINE: BRIAN KNOWLTON and JACKIE CALMES


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama and Speaker John Boehner met privately at the White House as a top Republican senator suggested that his party should perhaps accede to Mr. Obama's demand to raise the top tax rates so that the attention can shift to making serious cuts in benefit programs like Medicare and Medicaid. 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - With just three weeks left for lawmakers to avert a fiscal crisis, President Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner met privately at the White House on Sunday as a top Republican senator suggested that his party should perhaps accede to Mr. Obama's demand to raise the top tax rates so that the attention can shift to making serious cuts in benefit programs like Medicare and Medicaid.
Administration officials would not offer details of the discussion between Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner. But the disclosure of the meeting indicated that private discussions continue in the face of Republican leaders' public statements deploring the lack of progress and the president's refusal so far to specify the sort of deep, long-term reductions in spending for social programs that they insist upon as a condition of their support for raising taxes on high earners. 
The White House and Mr. Boehner's office issued identical statements afterward that said "the lines of communication remain open."
The meeting was the first face-to-face negotiation between the president and the speaker since a session three weeks ago, when they were joined by the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi of California; the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada; and the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. They were the first one-on-one deficit talks between Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner since the summer of 2011, when the search for a "grand bargain" on taxes and spending ultimately failed.
The latest meeting gave rise to renewed optimism that a deal could be reached before the end of the month.
"My guess is still that we will reach a deal, but I do not think that anything is either certain or imminent," Representative Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican and Boehner lieutenant, said Sunday night. "If they reach a deal, I suspect the majority of our conference will support the speaker. I hope the president can command equal support on his side of the aisle."
Any optimism is a step forward from Friday, when Mr. Boehner told reporters that he did not have a progress report because there was "no progress to report."
But the ups and downs of the search for a deal to avert a fiscal crisis have been in large measure for public consumption. Between public statements and news conferences, the staffs of the president and the speaker have been in close contact.
Just hours before the White House meeting, Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, said on "Fox News Sunday" that a small but growing group of Republicans had begun considering acquiescing on tax rates so that the negotiations could shift to entitlement programs.
Mr. Corker, a member of the Banking Committee who had presented a deficit-reduction plan of his own, said that if Republicans gave in to the president's chief demand, then "all of a sudden the shift goes back to entitlements, and maybe it puts us in a place where we actually can do something that really saves the nation."
Republicans have been insisting that the Obama administration agree to substantial savings in entitlement programs as the two sides negotiate how to narrow the country's huge deficits. But Mr. Corker is part of a group of Republicans who say the party will ultimately have to yield to the Obama demand of higher tax rates for top earners, potentially back to the levels that prevailed under President Bill Clinton.
That group of Republicans, Mr. Corker said on Fox, was beginning to realize "that we don't have a lot of cards as it relates to the tax issue before year end" - but that a tax-rate concession could be converted, jujitsu style, into a tactical advantage.
Mr. Corker's comments came as central figures on network news programs mixed cautious words of optimism over the negotiations between the White House and Congressional Republicans with dire warnings about what a failure to act might bring.
Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned that such a failure was the gravest threat now facing the still-fragile United States economy - greater than the European debt crisis or any uncertainty in China.
"It would result in the stock market really taking a hit," Ms. Lagarde said on the CNN program "State of the Union." The overall result could be zero growth next year, not the 2.1 percent growth rate projected by the I.M.F.
She called for a "balanced" agreement of both revenue increases and spending cuts. That is a word Mr. Obama has often used to describe his preferred outcome. Ms. Lagarde offered a tentative prediction that what she called American "pragmatism" would prevail and avert the worst outcome.

HEADLINE: A.I.G. to Sell Most of Leasing Unit to Chinese Investors

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: A.I.G. will sell up to 90 percent of its stake in the International Lease Finance Corporation to a group that includes the New China Trust Company, the China Aviation Industrial Fund and P3 Investments, in a deal that values the business at $5.28 billion. 

 BODY:
The American International Group agreed on Sunday to sell up to 90 percent of its extensive airplane leasing unit to a group of Chinese investors in a deal that valued the business at about $5.28 billion. It is part of the insurance giant's effort to sell assets that it considers nonessential to its core operations as the company continues to recover from the financial crisis.
Under the terms of the deal, A.I.G. will sell an 80 percent stake to a group that includes the New China Trust Company, the China Aviation Industrial Fund and P3 Investments. The consortium has the option of buying an additional 9.9 percent stake. If exercised, the move would bring in two additional investors: New China Life Insurance and an arm of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. 
A.I.G. will hold onto at least 10 percent of the business, and the insurer's chief executive, Robert H. Benmosche, will keep a seat on the company's revamped board.
 The deal is one of the biggest acquisitions of an American company by Chinese investors, and is expected to undergo scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the government body that reviews the national security implications of deals involving foreign buyers. The deal is also subject to other American and Chinese regulatory reviews.
The transaction is yet another asset sale by A.I.G. as it continues to sell off nonessential businesses, largely to help pay back its taxpayer-financed rescue. Since its government bailout in the fall of 2008, it has disposed of major units like AIA, a big Asian life insurance operation, and the American Life Insurance Company, another large international operation.
A.I.G. said it expected to eventually record a loss of about $4.4 billion on the sale, including an accounting charge of about $1.8 billion tied to the use of tax assets in the deal. The International Lease Finance Corporation, or I.L.F.C. as the division is commonly known, is one of the biggest in the world and has long been regarded as one of A.I.G.'s crown jewels. The nearly 40-year-old company claims as customers over 200 airlines in 80 countries. It owned about 918 planes in its fleet as of Nov. 15, according to a securities filing, and has commitments to buy 229 new fuel-efficient aircraft.
I.L.F.C. came under pressure during the financial crisis, burdened by an enormous debt load, though it has since rebounded. For the first nine months of the year, it earned $339.7 million, in contrast to a $736.4 million loss in the period a year earlier.
The insurer had long identified the business as one it was willing to part with, in part because the aircraft leasing business requires an intensive amount of capital to support. Last fall, A.I.G. filed to take the unit public. But a sale of the company proved more attractive, providing a quicker and more certain path to disposing of the business.
"This transaction creates a solid and strategic partnership for I.L.F.C.," Mr. Benmosche said in a statement. "While I.L.F.C. is an extremely strong business platform and A.I.G. will retain a minority stake as a passive investor, the aircraft leasing business is not core to our insurance operations."
The investor consortium will take advantage of the leasing operation's booming business in China, which the company said it expected to account for much of its future growth. About 176 of its owned planes are operated by Chinese airlines like Air China, China Southern and Shanghai Airlines, and I.L.F.C. opened offices in Singapore and Beijing this year to help keep up with demand.
"Our group shares a commitment to I.L.F.C.'s experienced management team, its operating philosophy, and its presence in the United States," Weng Xianding, the chairman of New China Trust, said in a statement. "This transaction allows I.L.F.C. to continue to serve its worldwide partners in the aviation industry with world-class service while accelerating its growth in important markets, including Asia."
A.I.G. was advised by Citigroup and the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton, while the buyers were represented by Credit Suisse and the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett.

HEADLINE: Tom Wolfe Would Hardly Recognize The Bronx Today

BYLINE: SAM ROBERTS


HIGHLIGHT: Twenty-five years after the publication of Tom Wolfe's "The Bonfire of the Vanities'' the South Bronx depicted in the book has changed. 

 BODY:
 Two white people, one of them a young woman decked out in a royal-blue Avenue Foch jacket with shoulders out to here . . . enough matched luggage in the back seat for a trip to China . . . a $48,000 Mercedes roadster . . . in the middle of the South Bronx . . .Miraculous!
Twenty-five years later, a comparable Mercedes roadster would set Sherman McCoy back about $108,000. But the latest model comes equipped with a voice-activated navigation system that would have warned him away from the South Bronx where a hit-and-run accident involving a black honor student triggered a chain of events that dethroned McCoy as a Master of the Universe in Tom Wolfe's racially-charged novel "The Bonfire of the Vanities." 
Today, if McCoy were still flush with a Wall Street bonus, he might even be armed with the mobile app patented by Microsoft a year ago to warn people away from "an unsafe neighborhood." 
Now, some parts of the South Bronx have become desirable residential neighborhoods "so it's possible that McCoy would be up there looking at a luxury condo development in which he's an investor," said Sarah Chinn, a professor of English at Hunter College of the City University of New York. "But of course, that GPS would in many ways make the set-up of 'Bonfire' obsolete - he wouldn't have got lost in the first place."
The South Bronx is still poor and the majority is nonwhite. Bruckner Boulevard, on which the Manhattan-bound McCoy wound up after making a fateful wrong turn on what used to be called the Triborough Bridge, remains uninviting in the shadow of the elevated expressway during the day and is still more desolate at night.
But the South Bronx is no longer the vast wasteland - "entire blocks of the city without a building left standing"- depicted in the novel. The population has grown, more apartments have been built or renovated, median household income has inched up and reported crime has declined.
The book was widely praised by critics and was a popular success. It also became a movie with Tom Hanks starring in the McCoy role that was poorly received by critics and the public.
Mr. Wolfe said he has not returned to the South Bronx in the 25 years since his novel was published to witness any changes for himself.
"I'm afraid I haven't," he said, adding, though: "I shall investigate." (He is writing his own 25-year retrospective, though he will not say where it will appear.)
Regardless of demographic differences, he said, New Yorkers are not yet living in a post-racial climate.
"Legally," he said, "Sherman McCoy would be in worse shape today than he was in 1987, because prosecutors' zeal to convict The Great White Defendant is now even more fervid in the wake of the scandals of the subprime crash of 2008 - although, of course, he may very well have been laid off, even at age 64, like so many of his brethren, making it a moot point, moot but a very sad one for him."
But Edward W. Hayes, the model for the defense lawyer in the novel ("Bonfire" was dedicated to Mr. Hayes and to Burton B. Roberts, a former judge who died in 2010), suggested that the city has, indeed, changed since 1987, mostly for the better.
"There is much less crime, racial appeals are not quite as strong and it's a much richer city," Mr. Hayes said, "but McCoy could still get lost because it's always hard to find one's way in a strange neighborhood."
Another inspiration for a character in the book, the Rev. Al Sharpton, described New York as "not as polarized as it was, but it's still a tale of two cities. I don't think we're in a post-racial period, but we're in a better racial period," he said.
"Life for blacks and Latinos is better than it was, but it is qualitatively different than for whites," he added. "You don't want to settle for better; you want to settle for equal. It is wrong to say it's not better and some of the people that fought and marched and who he demonized are people who made it better."
In the two police precincts that cover much of the South Bronx, there were 22 murders and 576 robberies last year, compared with 72 and 3,257, respectively, in 1990.
In a Mott Haven census tract near where McCoy's fictional hit-and-run occurred, the Census Bureau in 1990 recorded an unemployment rate of 18 percent, a median household income of $17,633, and 51 percent of families living in poverty.
By 2010, the unemployment rate stood at 13 percent, median household income at $20,253 and 40 percent of families were living in poverty.
Even more visible changes occurred in McCoy's Manhattan enclave, too. The historically impenetrable East 96th Street barrier that separated rich and poor was breached as developers planted luxury high-rise apartments deep into East Harlem.
"What's changed? Everything," said Fernando Ferrer, who had just become the borough president when "Bonfire" was published. Would Sherman McCoy and his mistress be as fearful today ("Human existence had but one purpose: to get out of the Bronx," the mistress thought)?
"Sherman McCoy would have been fearful anywhere that wasn't in his universe," Mr. Ferrer said. "Conceivably you could make a wrong turn in Paris."
Changes aside, some critics complained all along that the South Bronx of "Bonfire" was a caricature that made a bad situation worse. In fact, the book did provoke protests from Bronx boosters.
"To be honest, I never bought the premise of 'Bonfire,' " Professor Chinn said. "Rather, it was a symbol of terrifying otherness, not unlike the image of the 'inner city' that still gets invoked by apps that help us steer clear of 'bad' neighborhoods. The Bronx of 'Bonfire' is the Bronx of the white imagination, not the Bronx of, say, DJ Kool Herc or, not to press the point, Sonia Sotomayor."
To which Mr. Ferrer added: "That's why they call it fiction."

HEADLINE: Chinese Group Agrees To Buy a Unit of A.I.G.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
The American International Group agreed on Sunday to sell up to 90 percent of its extensive airplane leasing unit to a group of Chinese investors in a deal that valued the business at about $5.28 billion. It is part of the insurance giant's effort to sell assets that it considers nonessential to its core operations as the company continues to recover from the financial crisis.
Under the terms of the deal, A.I.G. will sell an 80 percent stake to a group that includes the New China Trust Company, the China Aviation Industrial Fund and P3 Investments. The consortium has the option of buying an additional 9.9 percent stake. If exercised, the move would bring in two additional investors: New China Life Insurance and an arm of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. 
A.I.G. will hold onto at least 10 percent of the business, and the insurer's chief executive, Robert H. Benmosche, will keep a seat on the company's revamped board.
The deal is one of the biggest acquisitions of an American company by Chinese investors, and is expected to undergo scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the government body that reviews the national security implications of deals involving foreign buyers. The deal is also subject to other American and Chinese regulatory reviews.
The transaction is yet another asset sale by A.I.G. as it continues to sell off nonessential businesses, largely to help pay back its taxpayer-financed rescue. Since its government bailout in the fall of 2008, it has disposed of major units like AIA, a big Asian life insurance operation, and the American Life Insurance Company, another large international operation.
A.I.G. said it expected to eventually record a loss of about $4.4 billion on the sale, including an accounting charge of about $1.8 billion tied to the use of tax assets in the deal. The International Lease Finance Corporation, or I.L.F.C. as the division is commonly known, is one of the biggest in the world and has long been regarded as one of A.I.G.'s crown jewels. The nearly 40-year-old company claims as customers over 200 airlines in 80 countries. It owned about 918 planes in its fleet as of Nov. 15, according to a securities filing, and has commitments to buy 229 new fuel-efficient aircraft.
I.L.F.C. came under pressure during the financial crisis, burdened by an enormous debt load, though it has since rebounded. For the first nine months of the year, it earned $339.7 million, in contrast to a $736.4 million loss in the period a year earlier.
The insurer had long identified the business as one it was willing to part with, in part because the aircraft leasing business requires an intensive amount of capital to support. Last fall, A.I.G. filed to take the unit public. But a sale of the company proved more attractive, providing a quicker and more certain path to disposing of the business.
"This transaction creates a solid and strategic partnership for I.L.F.C.," Mr. Benmosche said in a statement. "While I.L.F.C. is an extremely strong business platform and A.I.G. will retain a minority stake as a passive investor, the aircraft leasing business is not core to our insurance operations."
The investor consortium will take advantage of the leasing operation's booming business in China, which the company said it expected to account for much of its future growth. About 176 of its owned planes are operated by Chinese airlines like Air China, China Southern and Shanghai Airlines, and I.L.F.C. opened offices in Singapore and Beijing this year to help keep up with demand.
"Our group shares a commitment to I.L.F.C.'s experienced management team, its operating philosophy, and its presence in the United States," Weng Xianding, the chairman of New China Trust, said in a statement. "This transaction allows I.L.F.C. to continue to serve its worldwide partners in the aviation industry with world-class service while accelerating its growth in important markets, including Asia."
A.I.G. was advised by Citigroup and the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton, while the buyers were represented by Credit Suisse and the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett.

HEADLINE: Who Will Hold Colleges Accountable?

BYLINE: By KEVIN CAREY. 
Kevin Carey directs the education policy program at the New America Foundation.

 BODY:
Washington
LAST month The Chronicle of Higher Education published a damning investigation of college athletes across the nation who were maintaining their eligibility by taking cheap, easy online courses from an obscure junior college.
In just 10 days, academically deficient players could earn three credits and an easy ''A'' from Western Oklahoma State College for courses like ''Microcomputer Applications'' (opening folders in Windows) or ''Nutrition'' (stating whether or not the students used vitamins). The Chronicle quoted one Big Ten academic adviser as saying, ''You jump online, finish in a week and half, get your grade posted, and you're bowl-eligible.''
On the face of it, this is another sad but familiar story of the big-money intercollegiate-athletics complex corrupting the ivory tower. But it also reveals a larger, more pervasive problem: there are no meaningful standards of academic quality in higher education. And the more colleges and universities move their courses online, the more severe the problem gets. 
Much attention has been paid to for-profit colleges that offer degrees online while exploiting federal student-loan programs and saddling ill-prepared students with debt. But nearly all of the institutions caught up in the 10-day credit dodge exposed by The Chronicle were public, nonprofit institutions. And both the credit-givers, like Western Oklahoma, and the sports machines at the other end of the transaction, like Florida State University, were doing nothing illegal.
A main reason the scandal persists is that our system is built around the strange idea of the ''credit hour,'' a unit of academic time that does little to measure student learning. The credit hour originated around the turn of the 20th century, when the industrialist-turned-philanthropist Andrew Carnegie moved to create a pension system for college professors. (It's now known as TIAA-CREF.) Pensions were reserved for professors who worked full time, which ended up being defined as a minimum of 12 hours of classroom teaching per week in a standard 15-week semester.
After World War II, higher education began a huge expansion, driven by the G.I. Bill, a changing economy and a booming middle class. It needed a way to count and manage millions of new students. Credit hours were easy to record, and already in place. That's why today, credit hours determine eligibility for financial aid and graduation (you generally need 120 for a bachelor's degree).
But colleges were left to judge the quality of credit hours by affixing grades to courses, and the quality of colleges themselves would be judged by -- well, there was the rub. Colleges didn't want to be judged by anyone other than themselves, and remarkably, the government went along with it. Yes, colleges are held accountable by nonprofit accrediting organizations -- but those are, in turn, run by other colleges. When asked, Western Oklahoma's accreditor said it had never heard of the school's three-credits-in-10-days scheme and would look into it. But the next scheduled accreditation review isn't until 2017.
The lack of meaningful academic standards in higher education drags down the entire system. Grade inflation, even (or especially) at the most elite institutions, is rampant. A landmark book published last year, ''Academically Adrift,'' found that many students at traditional colleges showed no improvement in critical thinking, complex reasoning and writing, and spent their time socializing, working or wasting time instead of studying. (And that's not even considering the problem of low graduation rates.)
The rapid migration of higher education online exacerbates these problems. The notion of recording academic progress by counting the number of hours students spend sitting in a classroom is nonsensical when there is no actual classroom. Perhaps students themselves will decide what constitutes quality, as they choose among the so-called ''massive online open courses'' being offered free by brand-name universities including Harvard, M.I.T. and Stanford. I suspect those courses that will be most valued will be those where students actually learn.
But the most promising solution would be to replace the anachronistic credit hour with common standards for what college students actually need to know and to be able to do. There are many routes to doing this. In the arts and sciences, scholarly associations could define and update what it means to be proficient in a field. So could professional organizations and employers in vocational and technical fields.
Ending the antiquated credit hour would not only avert abuses involving college sports, but also prevent students of all kinds from taking the path of least resistance toward degrees that may be ultimately worthless.

HEADLINE: Fed Is Likely To Sustain Its Stimulus Program

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce on Wednesday that it will continue buying Treasury securities to stimulate growth in the new year.
The Fed's public declaration in September that it would buy bonds until the outlook for the labor market ''improved substantially'' has cleared away much of the uncertainty and controversy that usually precedes such announcements.
The economic recovery remains lackluster and millions are looking for work. But while some analysts question the central bank's ability to improve the situation, few doubt that the Fed, under its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, is determined to keep trying. 
Indeed, while Fed officials continue to warn that a failure to avert scheduled tax increases and spending cuts next year would overwhelm their efforts and plunge the economy back into recession, they have also said that even if Congress and the White House negotiate a compromise, the Fed's efforts would continue.
''I am not prepared to say we are remotely close to substantial improvement on the employment front,'' Dennis P. Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said in a recent speech. ''I expect that continued aggressive use of balance sheet monetary tools will be appropriate and justified by economic conditions for some time, even if fiscal cliff issues are properly addressed.''
The remarks were particularly significant because Mr. Lockhart is among the moderate members of the Federal Open Market Committee whose support Mr. Bernanke invested months in winning before starting the new policy.
With the direction of policy clearly set, debate has turned to the details. The Fed, whose policy-making committee is meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, still must determine what to buy and how much to spend, and officials continue to debate the best way to describe when the agency is likely to stop buying.
In making those decisions, the Fed must balance its conviction that buying bonds reduces borrowing costs for businesses and consumers against concerns the purchases might disrupt financial markets or inhibit its control of inflation.
Analysts say the immediate answer is likely to be more of the same. The Fed currently buys $40 billion of mortgage-backed securities and $45 billion of Treasury securities a month. Officials highlighted that $85 billion figure in September, and have indicated since that it remained their rough target.
''It would be odd for them to disappoint the expectations that they have created themselves,'' Kris Dawsey of Goldman Sachs wrote in a note to clients predicting that the Fed would maintain both the dollar amount and the division. Other analysts have suggested the Fed might slightly decrease the total amount of purchases, to $80 billion, or increase the share of mortgage securities.
The Fed is unlikely to announce a new timetable this week, analysts said. The committee has said that it does not plan to raise interest rates before the middle of 2015, and that it will stop buying bonds before it starts raising rates.
Many officials on the 12-member committee -- perhaps even the majority -- would prefer to substitute economic objectives for guidance set by the calendar. The Fed's ability to reduce borrowing costs derives in part from persuading investors that interest rates will remain low. Telling investors how the economic situation must change in order to warrant a change in policy could be more convincing, and therefore more potent, than simply publishing an estimated endpoint, these officials say.
But an account of the committee's previous meeting, in late October, showed that officials remained divided about which economic objectives to use.
The most vocal proponent of focusing on economic goals, Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said last month that the Fed should declare its intent to keep short-term interest rates near zero until the unemployment rate fell below 6.5 percent, provided that the rate of inflation did not exceed 2.5 percent.
''I believe we have the ability to go even further in reassuring financial markets and the general public that policy will stay appropriately accommodative,'' Mr. Evans said in advocating the change during a speech in Toronto.
Other officials have misgivings about placing such emphasis on any single economic indicator, or on the unemployment rate in particular.
The discussions are moving slowly, in part because it is not clear the changes being contemplated would have significant benefits. The targets the Fed is considering closely resemble its own past practice, meaning the new thresholds would tend to reinforce rather than shift expectations.
Lou Crandall, chief economist at the research firm Wrightson ICAP, noted in a recent analysis that the unemployment rate exceeded 7 percent in the mid-1980s and again in the early 1990s, and in both cases the Fed waited until the rate fell well into the 6 percent range before it began to raise interest rates.
The relative complacency of Fed officials also reflects their judgment that the mortgage-bond purchases announced in September are working. Average interest rates on 30-year mortgages are at the lowest levels on record, averaging 3.35 percent in November, according to Freddie Mac's regular survey.
''This is solid evidence that our policy has been and continues to be effective -- though it is certainly not all-powerful in current circumstances,'' William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said last week.
To continue the companion purchases of Treasury securities, the Fed will need to change its approach. It is now buying long-term securities with proceeds from the sale of short-term securities, but it is running out of inventory to sell.
The most likely alternative is to create money by crediting the accounts of banks that sell bonds to the Fed, the same method now being used to buy mortgage bonds and also to finance earlier rounds of the Fed's so-called quantitative easing.
The Fed has repeatedly overestimated the health of the economy and the impact of its efforts. This time, officials have promised to maintain their efforts even as the economy shows signs of improvement. But they are once again sounding notes of cautious optimism about the coming year -- if Washington does not interfere.
A budget deal reducing deficits in the long term, Mr. Bernanke said in November, ''could help make the new year a very good one for the American economy.''

HEADLINE: Obama and Boehner Meet, Raising Hopes

BYLINE: By BRIAN KNOWLTON and JACKIE CALMES; Jonathan Weisman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - With just three weeks left for lawmakers to avert a fiscal crisis, President Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner met privately at the White House on Sunday as a top Republican senator suggested that his party should perhaps accede to Mr. Obama's demand to raise the top tax rates so that the attention can shift to making serious cuts in benefit programs like Medicare and Medicaid.
Administration officials would not offer details of the discussion between Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner. But the disclosure of the meeting indicated that private discussions continue in the face of Republican leaders' public statements deploring the lack of progress and the president's refusal so far to specify the sort of deep, long-term reductions in spending for social programs that they insist upon as a condition of their support for raising taxes on high earners. 
The White House and Mr. Boehner's office issued identical statements afterward that said "the lines of communication remain open."
The meeting was the first face-to-face negotiation between the president and the speaker since a session three weeks ago, when they were joined by the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi of California; the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada; and the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. They were the first one-on-one deficit talks between Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner since the summer of 2011, when the search for a "grand bargain" on taxes and spending ultimately failed.
The latest meeting gave rise to renewed optimism that a deal could be reached before the end of the month.
"My guess is still that we will reach a deal, but I do not think that anything is either certain or imminent," Representative Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican and Boehner lieutenant, said Sunday night. "If they reach a deal, I suspect the majority of our conference will support the speaker. I hope the president can command equal support on his side of the aisle."
Any optimism is a step forward from Friday, when Mr. Boehner told reporters that he did not have a progress report because there was "no progress to report."
But the ups and downs of the search for a deal to avert a fiscal crisis have been in large measure for public consumption. Between public statements and news conferences, the staffs of the president and the speaker have been in close contact.
Just hours before the White House meeting, Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, said on "Fox News Sunday" that a small but growing group of Republicans had begun considering acquiescing on tax rates so that the negotiations could shift to entitlement programs.
Mr. Corker, a member of the Banking Committee who had presented a deficit-reduction plan of his own, said that if Republicans gave in to the president's chief demand, then "all of a sudden the shift goes back to entitlements, and maybe it puts us in a place where we actually can do something that really saves the nation."
Republicans have been insisting that the Obama administration agree to substantial savings in entitlement programs as the two sides negotiate how to narrow the country's huge deficits. But Mr. Corker is part of a group of Republicans who say the party will ultimately have to yield to the Obama demand of higher tax rates for top earners, potentially back to the levels that prevailed under President Bill Clinton.
That group of Republicans, Mr. Corker said on Fox, was beginning to realize "that we don't have a lot of cards as it relates to the tax issue before year end" - but that a tax-rate concession could be converted, jujitsu style, into a tactical advantage.
Mr. Corker's comments came as central figures on network news programs mixed cautious words of optimism over the negotiations between the White House and Congressional Republicans with dire warnings about what a failure to act might bring.
Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned that such a failure was the gravest threat now facing the still-fragile United States economy - greater than the European debt crisis or any uncertainty in China.
"It would result in the stock market really taking a hit," Ms. Lagarde said on the CNN program "State of the Union." The overall result could be zero growth next year, not the 2.1 percent growth rate projected by the I.M.F.
She called for a "balanced" agreement of both revenue increases and spending cuts. That is a word Mr. Obama has often used to describe his preferred outcome. Ms. Lagarde offered a tentative prediction that what she called American "pragmatism" would prevail and avert the worst outcome.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Homeless Rates Held Level Amid Recession, Study Says, but Big Gains Are Elusive

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The federal government has made big strides in reducing the ranks of the chronically homeless and of veterans who are homeless, but it probably will not reach its goal of ending homelessness among those two populations by 2015, according to a government report to be released on Monday.
In an annual report to Congress, the Department of Housing and Urban Development said that the overall level of homelessness remained essentially the same from 2011 to 2012, with the number of homeless individuals falling slightly and the number of homeless families increasing slightly. 
''As encouraged as I am that overall homelessness is holding steady during this economic period, we can't be satisfied,'' Shaun Donovan, the housing and urban development secretary, wrote in an e-mail. ''Every number in this estimate is a person, a family or a veteran living in our shelters or even on our streets. It's exactly why we have to redouble our efforts to find real and lasting solutions for those facing homelessness.''
The number of chronically homeless people -- a particularly at-risk population often in need of mental and physical health services and other safety-net support -- fell about 7 percent in 2011 and more than 19 percent since 2007. Homelessness among veterans declined more than 7 percent in 2011 and 17 percent since 2009.
''We are on the right track in the fight to end homelessness among veterans,'' Eric K. Shinseki, the secretary of veterans affairs, said in a written statement. ''While this is encouraging news, we have more work to do and will not be satisfied until no veteran has to sleep on the street.''
In 2010, the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness announced a plan to end homelessness, starting with the most vulnerable populations. The goals included ending chronic and veteran homelessness by 2015, and ending homelessness among families, the young and children by 2020.
''They have set ambitious goals for themselves, but I don't think those are goals that aren't doable,'' said Nan Roman, the president of the National Alliance to End Homelessness. ''But not at the rate that we're going.''
Though chronic and veteran homelessness have declined markedly, it seems unlikely that the housing agency and its partners will be able to eliminate homelessness among those two populations by the 2015 deadline. According to the HUD estimates, there were 99,894 chronically homeless people when a survey was conducted in January 2012, and 62,619 homeless veterans.
Still, the government has played a major role in keeping homelessness from rising during the recession. Indeed, the number of people counted as homeless has fallen for four out of the past five years. It is now about 6 percent lower than it was five years ago. Many poverty experts anticipated that homelessness would increase during the recession, and many were surprised that it did not.
At the same time, other measures of economic distress have increased. According to the Census Bureau, the poverty rate has climbed for four out of the past five years. It is now 22 percent higher than it was five years ago.
The report's data comes from a large survey conducted on a single night in late January, in which local teams counted the number of sheltered and unsheltered homeless people to provide a comprehensive ''point in time'' estimate of homelessness. The housing agency also keeps separate estimates of the number of people who become homeless for periods over the course of a year.
Housing officials said the declining population of homeless people could be credited in part to a $1.5 billion infusion of federal stimulus money. As part of the stimulus-financed Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program, local governments identified vulnerable people and intervened to stop them from becoming homeless by helping them find and pay for new places to live, for instance. That program prevented or ended homelessness for more than one million people, the housing agency estimates.
HUD and its partners also increased the number of available beds in emergency shelters by about 15 percent over five years, and the number of beds in longer term housing by nearly 50 percent.
But with emergency stimulus financing at its end, experts worry that homelessness might increase for some vulnerable groups in the coming year. Ms. Roman, for instance, predicted that the end of the rapid rehousing program might result in more family homelessness in 2013.
Housing officials said they had invested in research and data analysis to learn how to use their resources more efficiently. ''There's always a start-up period where we're trying to learn what works, and trying to understand the best and most effective uses of our resources,'' said Ann Oliva, the acting deputy assistant housing secretary for special needs. ''We know what we need to do now and between 2015 to get to zero.''
Some analysts say the large federal expansion of Medicaid coming in 2014 might help reduce homelessness. States that join the Medicaid expansion -- with the federal government chipping in $9 for every $1 the state spends -- will be required to provide coverage to all adults whose income is up to 33 percent higher than the poverty line. Many states do not provide Medicaid to childless adults now, no matter how poor.
Mark Johnston, the acting assistant housing secretary for community planning and development, estimated that homelessness could be effectively eradicated in the United States at an annual cost of about $20 billion. The housing department's budget for addressing homelessness is currently about $1.9 billion.

HEADLINE: Report Addresses Mismatch Between Jobs and Graduates

BYLINE: By JOYCE LAU

 BODY:
Report shows mismatch between jobs and graduates
The McKinsey Center for Government is scheduled to release its latest report on education and employment in alive Web feed on Monday.
The online discussion, which will begin at 9 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, will include panelists from Bogotá, Dubai, Geneva, New Delhi and Washington. They will address a predicament that involves recent graduates as well as recruiters: 75 million young people are unemployed, and yet many employers say they cannot find skilled workers. 
According to the report, about half of young graduates are ''not sure that their post-secondary education has improved their chances of finding a job.'' On the other hand, 39 percent of employers blamed a shortage of skilled workers for their difficulty in filling entry-level positions.
Academic institutions, which are traditionally the link between students and employers, appear to be the most out-of-touch with workplace realities and are overconfident about the skills they provide. According to the report, 72 percent of educational institutions felt that their graduates were ready for the job market, but only 42 percent of employers agreed.
QS names M.B.A. programs most valued by employers
QS, widely known as one of leading publishers of university rankings, has named the 200 M.B.A. programs that are most valued by employers.
Of the 39 ''Elite Global'' institutions selected for the report, which was released last week, 22 were from North America, 14 from Europe and 3 from the Asia-Pacific region. Harvard was the top U.S. choice. Insead, a business school that has campuses in France and Singapore, was top-ranked in both Europe and Asia. London Business School was also among the top three M.B.A. programs chosen by recruiters.
Among graduates of those ''elite'' schools, those in Europe earned an average of $109,300 a year, compared with $101,100 in North America. But recruiters felt that U.S. business schools were better at teaching specialized subjects.
The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania led in teaching finance; the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Illinois in teaching marketing; and the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management in teaching information management.
According to the report, the most academically qualified students are from India. The Indian Institute of Management Bangalore and Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad reported the highest GMAT scores.
Greek universities consider merging some departments
A petition has been circulating at the University of Patras to protest a plan to merge its humanities departments with those of the University of the Peloponnese, part of cost-cutting measures in Greece, according to a copy of the petition obtained by the International Herald Tribune. The Ministry of Education is expected to announce a decision on the matter Saturday.
Higher education in Asia is topic of online discussion
The Asian Development Bank will hold a live online discussion called ''Higher Education in Asia: Is It Still a Public Good?'' Jouko Sarvi, who coordinates the bank's education-related policy and strategy, will speak to the online public on Friday starting at 2 p.m. in Manila, or 6 a.m. U.T.C.

HEADLINE: British Students Find Advantages at U.S. Schools

BYLINE: By D. D. GUTTENPLAN

 BODY:
LONDON -- For Elliot Miller, the conventional path to academic success in Britain just was not a good fit.
Although an excellent student, Mr. Miller, a senior at Coventry Blue Coat School in the West Midlands, resisted the imperative of choosing a single subject to study, as is customary at British universities. ''I want to do economics,'' he said. ''But I also really want to study French and Chinese.''
Coming from a state school, he also knew that the admissions process at Oxford or Cambridge -- which take nearly half their new students from private schools, in a country where 93 percent of students attend state schools -- was not skewed in his favor.
Instead, Mr. Miller decided to apply to Middlebury College, a liberal arts school in Vermont renowned for its language programs, and to a handful of other U.S. schools. ''I don't really have any intention of going to a British university,'' he said. 
Stephanie Addenbroke, a senior at Upton Hall, a Catholic girls' school near Liverpool, originally had her sights set on Oxbridge. Instead, she has decided to apply for early decision to Yale University.
Eleanor Cheyne, who wants to study aeronautical engineering, is in her last year at Newstead Wood, a state-funded girls' school specializing in engineering and languages. She, like many British students, had long assumed that colleges in the United States were out of reach both financially and academically; but she has now applied to the Georgia Institute of Technology and plans to apply to other U.S. universities.
What made these students change their minds? Last summer, all three of them attended a new program run by a British charity and the Fulbright Commission. They traveled to London for two days of orientation and then to Yale in New Haven, Connecticut, for a week of classes and an introduction to American campus life. While in the United States, they visited other elite universities, like Wesleyan in Connecticut, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Columbia University in New York and Harvard in Massachusetts. Harvard also hosted a college fair for them.
Peter Lampl, a British businessman and the founder of the Sutton Trust, a charity dedicated to increasing educational opportunities for students from less privileged backgrounds, conceived of the program.
The trust has long run summer schools introducing students from disadvantaged backgrounds to elite British universities.
''There are actually quite a few British kids already going to American universities,'' he said. ''But nearly all of them come from a handful of private schools.''
''I've always been a great admirer of the American liberal arts colleges,'' said Mr. Lampl, who is married to an American and spent much of his career in business working in the United States. ''The world is becoming more international, and even the kids who decide not to apply have had a life-changing experience.''
Mr. Lampl was expected to announce Monday that the Sutton Trust-Fulbright summer school program in the United States was inviting applications for an expanded version of the project, which will take 150 British students from state schools to the United States for a week to visit either Yale or M.I.T.
Like the 64 students in the pilot program last year, all of the students will be chosen from families with annual incomes below £40,000, or about $60,000, making them eligible for full tuition scholarships at many U.S. universities. Last year, about half the students were eligible for free school meals, indicating a family income of £16,000; such students will also be given preference this year.
Mr. Lampl's goal is to give academically gifted but financially disadvantaged students from Britain access to the same kind of educational opportunities available to their counterparts in the United States.
''We want to act as a beacon to inspire other talented state school students,'' the trust said in a statement.
After the students return to Britain, the Sutton Trust will pay for a week of counseling service and assistance with college applications, as well as help in preparing for the ACT standardized admissions test.
The program coincides with a sharp spike in interest in U.S. universities among British students, prompted in part by a rise in British university tuition fees, which are now capped at £9,000 a year. In September, students lined up around the block to attend a U.S. college fair held in London by the Fulbright Commission. The fair was extended for an extra day.
''We've doubled in size over the last two years,'' said Lauren Welch, director of student advising at the commission, which is funded by the U.S. and British governments. ''It removes all of the obstacles or barriers that might prevent these students from coming to the U.S.,'' she said. ''Even for those who don't apply now, many have said they'd apply to British schools with a year in the U.S., or apply to graduate school in the U.S.''
According to the Institute of International Education's ''Open Doors'' survey, nearly 9,200 British students attended schools in the United States last year, making the United Kingdom the second-largest country in Europe, after Germany, to send students there. (Both countries' contributions were dwarfed by the number of students from Asia.) Germany's numbers had declined from the previous year, while the British share had grown. Also, more German students came for graduate degrees than undergraduate degrees.
For students from less affluent backgrounds, the economic arguments can be as compelling as the academic ones. Six American colleges and universities -- Amherst in Massachusetts, Dartmouth in New Hampshire, Harvard, M.I.T, Princeton and Yale -- assess international students on a need-blind basis, meaning that applicants are considered irrespective of their ability to pay tuition, with financial aid awarded purely on need, Ms. Welch said. All of the students in the Sutton Trust program would qualify for full tuition and living expenses, with some schools also paying for a flight home every summer.
''What we discovered is that there is actually a huge amount of money available for foreign students -- about half a billion dollars spread out over 250 colleges,'' Mr. Lampl said. ''And the colleges don't know how to find these kids.''
Whereas British universities offer students government loans to pay the new higher tuition fees, ''our kids will come out with zero debt,'' he said. ''The Ivy League schools tell me they don't want students to feel forced into high-paying jobs instead of teaching or public service. They don't want to put them off going to graduate school,'' he said.
For Eleanor Cheyne, the senior who wants to study aeronautical engineering, the trip to the United States was a series of surprises. ''I didn't expect to love it as much as I did,'' she said. But the finances made her decision a lot easier. ''If I stay here and study engineering, that's four years -- so I'd be looking at £50,000 of debt. This showed me that places I wouldn't have dreamed of before were actually in my reach -- and that they made financial sense.''

HEADLINE: For Iran, Unrest in Syria Is Noise, Not Brutal War

BYLINE: By THOMAS ERDBRINK; Ramtin Rastin contributed reporting.

 BODY:
TEHRAN -- When Syria's agricultural minister, Subhi Ahmad al-Abdullah, arrived in the Iranian capital for a visit last week, everybody involved stuck to a well-worn script.
There were welcoming ceremonies, handshakes in front of cameras and tête-à-têtes on rococo chairs. Stern-faced Iranian and Syrian officials discussed ''expanding economic and agricultural ties'' and signed a contract for the joint production of a vaccine for foot-and-mouth disease.
The unrest in Syria did not go unmentioned in the meetings, which were widely reported by Iranian state media. Iran's vice president, Mohammad-Reza Rahimi, said Iran was confident of victory for the Syrian government forces, who, he said, were engaged in ''sporadic fights with terrorists sent by regional countries.'' 
The upbeat ceremonies surrounding Mr. Abdullah's visit illustrate how Iranian leaders perceive the bloody conflict that has engulfed their main ally in the Arabic world. While former Iranian diplomats, academics and analysts increasingly warn that President Bashar al-Assad's government is on the brink of collapse, the country's highest leaders insist the conflict is manageable and ultimately will be resolved to Iran's advantage.
''We say that Bashar al-Assad, or at least his government, is the safest bet for stability and security in Syria,'' said Amir Mohebbian, a political analyst whose views are sometimes published on the Web site of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. ''If the foreign mercenaries take over, there will be a blood bath in Syria.''
Endless news broadcasts by Iran's state television offer an ideological narrative in which Saudi Arabia and Qatar are doing the bidding of the United States and Israel, helping to arm foreign ''terrorists'' and sending them into Syria to punish it for having opposed Israel. War crimes committed by Syrian forces go unreported.
''Clearly, there is no real alternative for al-Assad and his government in Syria,'' Mr. Mohebbian said. ''They have agreed to reforms; there will be a multiparty system in Syria. So foreign countries should stop arming terrorists and let the Syrian people decide their own future.''
Some former diplomats, analysts and academics disagree with the blind support of Syria's government. But they have little, if any, influence on Iran's policy makers, who are mostly rigid ideologues.
''The Syrian Army is on the brink of complete collapse, and the downfall of al-Assad is inevitable,'' Ebrahim Yazdi, a former foreign minister who is a member of the opposition, wrote Saturday in the newspaper Etemaad, which is critical of Iran's government. ''Syria's leaders respond to reforms with bloody crackdowns. Their future is very bleak.''
Mashallah Shamsolvaezin, a Middle East analyst who has been imprisoned for his involvement in Iran's opposition movement, echoed that view. ''In reality, Syria will be in turmoil for years to come,'' he said. ''There will be nothing left of our anti-Israel front.''
Iran has organized two conferences for what it calls the ''genuine'' Syrian opposition, pushing for modest political changes, followed by nationwide presidential elections in 2014, as the only solution to stop the fighting.
Off the record, Iranian officials sometimes hint that Mr. Assad, as a symbol, could be sacrificed in Iran's future vision for the country. But they insist that his political and security apparatus should remain in power, continuing to lead Syria as a regional spear against Iran's archnemesis, Israel.
''We are seeking a peaceful solution in which the Syrian government implements reforms,'' said Hamidreza Taraghi, a politician who is close to Iran's leaders. ''But whatever the cost, we want to keep Syria in the group of resistance against Israel.''
Mr. Taraghi, who recently led an Iranian delegation to North Korea and met with the country's leader, Kim Jong-un, said that Iran was willing to do ''whatever it takes'' to keep Syria as an ally. He said the Syrian government had not yet asked Iran for military help, but if that happened Iran would be compelled by its treaty with Syria to step in.
The United States has accused Iran of providing weapons and money to Syria. Iran has always denied any military presence and military assistance, saying Mr. Assad does not need help in quelling the unrest.
There are signs, however, of some Iranian military involvement in the country. On Saturday, Iran's Tabnak Web site claimed that military advisers, together with Russians in Syria, had suggested that the Syrian Army should pre-emptively attack opposition forces, who, the Web site claimed, were planning to attack Damascus from four sides.
In August, 48 Iranians were taken captive by Syrian resistance fighters who accused the men of being members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. One of the kidnapped Iranians, identified by Iranian news media as Majid Adeli, a cultural adviser at the Iranian Embassy in Damascus, was released on Saturday. Iran insists the other captives are Shiite pilgrims.
On Saturday, Iran's deputy minister of science, Mohammad Mehdinejad, told the Iranian Student News Agency that the country had sent drones to Syria but did not elaborate on how many.
''This is a fight between common people defending their homeland and foreign terrorists,'' Mr. Taraghi said. He was sure that Iran's main ally would soon be ready to face Israel again. ''Syria's army and security forces are still intact,'' he said, ''and they can be rebuilt in order for Syria to regain its former strength.''
During a conference on Syria organized by former diplomats in Tehran last week, Sadegh Zibakalam, a professor of international relations at Tehran University, shocked his audience by publicly criticizing Iran's support for the Syrian government.
''What sort of foreign policy do we have that we support a regime that will be gone in one or two months?'' he said. Mr. Zibakalam criticized those in power, saying that foreign policy must be based on national interests and not on ideology.
But even opposition figures say the government has no choice but to stick with the current Syrian leadership to the bitter end. ''That way,'' Mr. Shamsolvaezin said, ''we can at least influence the unrest that will inevitably follow his downfall.''

HEADLINE: Robots And Robber Barons

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
The American economy is still, by most measures, deeply depressed. But corporate profits are at a record high. How is that possible? It's simple: profits have surged as a share of national income, while wages and other labor compensation are down. The pie isn't growing the way it should -- but capital is doing fine by grabbing an ever-larger slice, at labor's expense.
Wait -- are we really back to talking about capital versus labor? Isn't that an old-fashioned, almost Marxist sort of discussion, out of date in our modern information economy? Well, that's what many people thought; for the past generation discussions of inequality have focused overwhelmingly not on capital versus labor but on distributional issues between workers, either on the gap between more- and less-educated workers or on the soaring incomes of a handful of superstars in finance and other fields. But that may be yesterday's story. 
More specifically, while it's true that the finance guys are still making out like bandits -- in part because, as we now know, some of them actually are bandits -- the wage gap between workers with a college education and those without, which grew a lot in the 1980s and early 1990s, hasn't changed much since then. Indeed, recent college graduates had stagnant incomes even before the financial crisis struck. Increasingly, profits have been rising at the expense of workers in general, including workers with the skills that were supposed to lead to success in today's economy.
Why is this happening? As best as I can tell, there are two plausible explanations, both of which could be true to some extent. One is that technology has taken a turn that places labor at a disadvantage; the other is that we're looking at the effects of a sharp increase in monopoly power. Think of these two stories as emphasizing robots on one side, robber barons on the other.
About the robots: there's no question that in some high-profile industries, technology is displacing workers of all, or almost all, kinds. For example, one of the reasons some high-technology manufacturing has lately been moving back to the United States is that these days the most valuable piece of a computer, the motherboard, is basically made by robots, so cheap Asian labor is no longer a reason to produce them abroad.
In a recent book, ''Race Against the Machine,'' M.I.T.'s Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee argue that similar stories are playing out in many fields, including services like translation and legal research. What's striking about their examples is that many of the jobs being displaced are high-skill and high-wage; the downside of technology isn't limited to menial workers.
Still, can innovation and progress really hurt large numbers of workers, maybe even workers in general? I often encounter assertions that this can't happen. But the truth is that it can, and serious economists have been aware of this possibility for almost two centuries. The early-19th-century economist David Ricardo is best known for the theory of comparative advantage, which makes the case for free trade; but the same 1817 book in which he presented that theory also included a chapter on how the new, capital-intensive technologies of the Industrial Revolution could actually make workers worse off, at least for a while -- which modern scholarship suggests may indeed have happened for several decades.
What about robber barons? We don't talk much about monopoly power these days; antitrust enforcement largely collapsed during the Reagan years and has never really recovered. Yet Barry Lynn and Phillip Longman of the New America Foundation argue, persuasively in my view, that increasing business concentration could be an important factor in stagnating demand for labor, as corporations use their growing monopoly power to raise prices without passing the gains on to their employees.
I don't know how much of the devaluation of labor either technology or monopoly explains, in part because there has been so little discussion of what's going on. I think it's fair to say that the shift of income from labor to capital has not yet made it into our national discourse.
Yet that shift is happening -- and it has major implications. For example, there is a big, lavishly financed push to reduce corporate tax rates; is this really what we want to be doing at a time when profits are surging at workers' expense? Or what about the push to reduce or eliminate inheritance taxes; if we're moving back to a world in which financial capital, not skill or education, determines income, do we really want to make it even easier to inherit wealth?
As I said, this is a discussion that has barely begun -- but it's time to get started, before the robots and the robber barons turn our society into something unrecognizable.

HEADLINE: In Girl's Last Hope, Altered Cells Beat Leukemia

BYLINE: By DENISE GRADY

 BODY:
PHILIPSBURG, Pa. -- Emma Whitehead has been bounding around the house lately, practicing somersaults and rugby-style tumbles that make her parents wince.
It is hard to believe, but last spring Emma, then 6, was near death from leukemia. She had relapsed twice after chemotherapy, and doctors had run out of options.
Desperate to save her, her parents sought an experimental treatment at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, one that had never before been tried in a child, or in anyone with the type of leukemia Emma had. The experiment, in April, used a disabled form of the virus that causes AIDS to reprogram Emma's immune system genetically to kill cancer cells.
The treatment very nearly killed her. But she emerged from it cancer-free, and about seven months later is still in complete remission. She is the first child and one of the first humans ever in whom new techniques have achieved a long-sought goal -- giving a patient's own immune system the lasting ability to fight cancer. 
Emma had been ill with acute lymphoblastic leukemia since 2010, when she was 5, said her parents, Kari and Tom. She is their only child.
She is among just a dozen patients with advanced leukemia to have received the experimental treatment, which was developed at the University of Pennsylvania. Similar approaches are also being tried at other centers, including the National Cancer Institute and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.
''Our goal is to have a cure, but we can't say that word,'' said Dr. Carl June, who leads the research team at the University of Pennsylvania. He hopes the new treatment will eventually replace bone-marrow transplantation, an even more arduous, risky and expensive procedure that is now the last hope when other treatments fail in leukemia and related diseases.
Three adults with chronic leukemia treated at the University of Pennsylvania have also had complete remissions, with no signs of disease; two of them have been well for more than two years, said Dr. David Porter. Four adults improved but did not have full remissions, and one was treated too recently to evaluate. A child improved and then relapsed. In two adults, the treatment did not work at all. The Pennsylvania researchers were presenting their results on Sunday and Monday in Atlanta at a meeting of the American Society of Hematology.
Despite the mixed results, cancer experts not involved with the research say it has tremendous promise, because even in this early phase of testing it has worked in seemingly hopeless cases. ''I think this is a major breakthrough,'' said Dr. Ivan Borrello, a cancer expert and associate professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.
Dr. John Wagner, the director of pediatric blood and marrow transplantation at the University of Minnesota, called the Pennsylvania results ''phenomenal'' and said they were ''what we've all been working and hoping for but not seeing to this extent.''
A major drug company, Novartis, is betting on the Pennsylvania team and has committed $20 million to building a research center on the university's campus to bring the treatment to market.
Hervé Hoppenot, the president of Novartis Oncology, called the research ''fantastic'' and said it had the potential -- if the early results held up -- to revolutionize the treatment of leukemia and related blood cancers. Researchers say the same approach, reprogramming the patient's immune system, may also eventually be used against tumors like breast and prostate cancer.
To perform the treatment, doctors remove millions of the patient's T-cells -- a type of white blood cell -- and insert new genes that enable the T-cells to kill cancer cells. The technique employs a disabled form of H.I.V. because it is very good at carrying genetic material into T-cells. The new genes program the T-cells to attack B-cells, a normal part of the immune system that turn malignant in leukemia.
The altered T-cells -- called chimeric antigen receptor cells -- are then dripped back into the patient's veins, and if all goes well they multiply and start destroying the cancer.
The T-cells home in on a protein called CD-19 that is found on the surface of most B-cells, whether they are healthy or malignant.
A sign that the treatment is working is that the patient becomes terribly ill, with raging fevers and chills -- a reaction that oncologists call ''shake and bake,'' Dr. June said. Its medical name is cytokine-release syndrome, or cytokine storm, referring to the natural chemicals that pour out of cells in the immune system as they are being activated, causing fevers and other symptoms. The storm can also flood the lungs and cause perilous drops in blood pressure -- effects that nearly killed Emma.
Steroids sometimes ease the reaction, but they did not help Emma. Her temperature hit 105. She wound up on a ventilator, unconscious and swollen almost beyond recognition, surrounded by friends and family who had come to say goodbye.
But at the 11th hour, a battery of blood tests gave the researchers a clue as to what might help save Emma: her level of one of the cytokines, interleukin-6 or IL-6, had shot up a thousandfold. Doctors had never seen such a spike before and thought it might be what was making her so sick.
Dr. June knew that a drug could lower IL-6 -- his daughter takes it for rheumatoid arthritis. It had never been used for a crisis like Emma's, but there was little to lose. Her oncologist, Dr. Stephan A. Grupp, ordered the drug. The response, he said, was ''amazing.''
Within hours, Emma began to stabilize. She woke up a week later, on May 2, the day she turned 7; the intensive-care staff sang ''Happy Birthday.''
Since then, the research team has used the same drug, tocilizumab, in several other patients.
In patients with lasting remissions after the treatment, the altered T-cells persist in the bloodstream, though in smaller numbers than when they were fighting the disease. Some patients have had the cells for years.
Dr. Michel Sadelain, who conducts similar studies at the Sloan-Kettering Institute, said: ''These T-cells are living drugs. With a pill, you take it, it's eliminated from your body and you have to take it again.'' But T-cells, he said, ''could potentially be given only once, maybe only once or twice or three times.''
The Pennsylvania researchers said they were surprised to find any big drug company interested in their work, because a new batch of T-cells must be created for each patient -- a far cry from the familiar commercial strategy of developing products like Viagra or cholesterol medicines, in which millions of people take the same drug.
But Mr. Hoppenot said Novartis was taking a different path with cancer drugs, looking for treatments that would have a big, unmistakable impact on a small number of patients. Such home-run drugs can be approved more quickly and efficiently, he said, with smaller studies than are needed for drugs with less obvious benefits.
''The economic model is totally acceptable,'' Mr. Hoppenot said.
But such drugs tend to be extremely expensive. A prime example is the Novartis drug Gleevec, which won rapid approval in 2001 for use against certain types of leukemia and gastrointestinal tumors. It can cost more than $5,000 a month, depending on the dosage.
Dr. June said that producing engineered T-cells costs about $20,000 per patient -- far less than the cost of a bone-marrow transplant. Scaling up the procedure should make it even less expensive, he said, but he added, ''Our costs do not include any profit margin, facility depreciation costs or other clinical care costs, and other research costs.''
The research is still in its early stages, and many questions remain. The researchers are not entirely sure why the treatment works, or why it sometimes fails. One patient had a remission after being treated only twice, and even then the reaction was so delayed that it took the researchers by surprise. For the patients who had no response whatsoever, the team suspects a flawed batch of T-cells. The child who had a temporary remission apparently relapsed because not all of her leukemic cells had the marker that was targeted by the altered T-cells.
It is not clear whether a patient's body needs the altered T-cells forever. The cells do have a drawback: they destroy healthy B-cells as well as cancerous ones, leaving patients vulnerable to certain types of infections, so Emma and the other patients need regular treatments with immune globulins to prevent illness.
So far, her parents say, Emma seems to have taken it all in stride. She went back to school this year with her second-grade classmates, and though her grades are high and she reads about 50 books a month, she insists impishly that her favorite subjects are lunch and recess.
''It's time for her to be a kid again and get her childhood back,'' Mr. Whitehead said.

HEADLINE: Residents and Businesses Still Grapple With Recovery

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
In the streets that surround the New York Stock Exchange, the air is filled with the odor of generator fuel and frustration over the slogging recovery from Hurricane Sandy.
Along the water-damaged blocks below Wall Street and around the South Street Seaport, small businesses are closed or are limping along without phone service, their regular customers, and, in some cases, their employees, who were laid off just before the holidays.
There is no official tally, but local leaders estimated that a few thousand small businesses had been shuttered or were operating at less than full strength since the storm and that as many as 10,000 jobs had been lost, at least temporarily. About 3,000 apartments in Lower Manhattan remain uninhabitable, according to Daniel L. Squadron, a Democratic state senator who represents the area.
''We're really in disaster recovery mode down here, there's no question about that,'' said Ro Sheffe, who will lead a disaster-relief task force for small businesses in Community Board 1. 
Mr. Sheffe, who has lived near the World Trade Center for 19 years, said he feared the financial district would fall into a slump, as it did after the terrorist attacks 11 years ago.
''The nightmare I'm fighting day and night is this vision of the downtown area filled with empty shops and 'for rent' signs,'' Mr. Sheffe said. ''That's something that we saw after September 11 and I never want to see it again.''
Among the obstacles to recovery is the slow restoration of phone and Internet service, business owners and city officials said. Many merchants have been able to accept only cash payments for more than a month, an inconvenience they are loath to impose on the customers trickling in.
At Pizza Pizza N.Y.C. on Pearl Street, Eddie, the only person behind the counter one recent afternoon, has been giving his personal cellphone number to customers who want to call in for slices or pies. The restaurant is surrounded by generators and trailers providing heat and water to neighboring buildings and could not take orders on its Web site.
Many of the displaced workers had been in the business of feeding the hordes of people who work on and around Wall Street. Marcia Gordon was one.
Ms. Gordon, 55, had worked in the cafeteria at 4 New York Plaza for 26 years until Hurricane Sandy sloshed ashore. She and 40 others who worked for the Aramark food-service company in that building or the cafeteria at 55 Water Street are now collecting unemployment benefits and waiting to hear when they will be able to work again.
''What I'm getting from unemployment can't even make my rent,'' said Ms. Gordon, who said she paid $1,550 a month for her home in the Canarsie section of Brooklyn.
Guests at the New York Marriott Downtown near the 9/11 Memorial could not order room service more than a month after the storm. The restaurant and bar in the lobby had been so wrecked by flooding from the storm that the Marriott shut them and laid off all 38 of their employees.
Amanda Byron Zink has been trying to keep her dog-grooming business going even though her shop, the Salty Paw in South Street Seaport, could be washed out for months, and possibly for good. Ms. Zink and some of the groomers who worked in her shop have been operating temporarily from the basement of an animal hospital near the Seaport, but she said they ''can only do little guys'' because they only have a small sink to bathe the dogs in.
The Salty Paw was in the Historic Front Street development, which took on so much water that it will be closed for months. The complex of shops and apartments was powered by a set of geothermal wells drilled deep into the bedrock of Manhattan. The flood water, which Ms. Zink said rose to 11 feet in her ground-level salon, swamped the heating and electrical systems in the basement, she said.
Ms. Zink said she had received no payments from her insurance company even though she was covered for business interruption. Like most of the small businesses around hers, she had no flood insurance.
She said she had applied for a grant from the Downtown Alliance but learnedthat she would receive it only if she reopened in the same location within a few months, which seems impossible. The only other sources of financial assistance are loans, but she said she was reluctant to borrow more for a business whose future was so uncertain.
A 17-year resident of the neighborhood, Ms. Zink has been living with her husband and two young sons out of hotel rooms paid for by the Federal Emergency Management Agency since the storm drove them from their apartment on South Street. Hurricane Sandy arrived on her older son's fourth birthday. She had hoped in vain to get back into their apartment before her younger son's birthday over the weekend.
''Now, my goal is to get home before Christmas,'' she said.
Even some businesses that were able to get back into their buildings quickly after the storm are suffering. In Fidelifacts at 42 Broadway, only 2 of 16 phone lines were working last week, preventing the firm's employees from performing background checks on clients' prospective hires. Thomas Norton, the president, said he had to let a few workers go because ''business is down, there's no question about it.''
Verizon said the saltwater that poured into Lower Manhattan had ruined most of the old copper wiring that ran under the streets. The company's executives had been telling elected officials that it could take three or four more months to fully restore those connections. But Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said last week that he told Verizon's chief executive that the answer was unacceptable.
Mr. Squadron, the state senator, said some of his constituents had expressed concern that Verizon was taking so long because it wanted to switch them over to FIOS, its network of fiber-optic cables that deliver phone, television and Internet service. Mr. Squadron said he had been assured that laying the fiber would take no longer than replacing the copper wires, but he said he did not know if that was true.
''We're making sure that Verizon is doing this absolutely as quickly as possible so that people can be wired again,'' Mr. Squadron said.
Residents of some of the luxury buildings downtown are also struggling to get their lives back to normal.
Some tenants at 1 West Street, who pay as much as $3,500 a month for one-bedroom apartments, said they would use the landlord's response to the storm as grounds to break their leases. Those who wanted to return were allowed back into their homes 10 days ago. They immediately lodged complaints, saying elevators were operating erratically, they lacked heat and there was a persistent odor of oil on the upper floors.
A spokesman for the building's owner, the Moinian Group, acknowledged that ''some tenants were stuck'' in an elevator last week and that ''a smell lingers in some locations,'' but said the landlord would try to ''get the smell out of the walls and hallways'' and clean the carpets this week.
''They still expect us to pay what we signed our lease for, but let's be very clear, this building is not the same building post-Sandy,'' said Laura Takasaki, who lives on the 30th floor.
Margaret S. Chin, a city councilwoman who represents the area, has expressed concern about diesel generators fouling the air. In a letter she sent on Friday to Joseph Martens, the state commissioner of environmental conservation, Ms. Chin invoked post-Sept. 11 air quality hazards and said, ''We cannot leave it to private entities involved with cleanup to assure residents that the air is safe to breathe.''

HEADLINE: Letters Show Miller's Push To Be Taken Seriously

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
For Marvin Miller to revolutionize labor history, he first had to sell himself to the baseball players union. He was still an economist for the United Steelworkers union in December 1965, when he was interviewed by Robin Roberts, Harvey Kuenn and Jim Bunning to be the executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association.
Days later, seeking to convince them further of his credentials, Miller wrote a long, single-spaced letter to Roberts. While some players might be ''hesitant about employing an economist with union experience,'' he wrote, a full review of his work, ''along with the nature of the tasks ahead of you, should dispel such reservations.'' 
He cited the ''virtually perfect fit between your needs and my skills.''
Miller detailed his accomplishments and described what was needed to run the union: someone with a foundation in economics, pensions and benefits as well as a quality that, given his future success in the job, sounded prescient: ''maturity and economic training necessary to grasp and understand the problems of the institution of baseball and of the clubs as thoroughly as, or more thoroughly than, the owners themselves.''
The letter -- contained in his papers at the Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives at New York University -- and other documents offer private glimpses at a serious, purposeful trade unionist who led the union into the era of free agency and who demanded that he, and the players, be taken seriously by baseball's leaders. Miller, who died last month at 95, donated boxes full of papers in 2003 from him and his wife, Terry.
''They made the inquiry in 2001, and we embraced it,'' said Carol A. Mandel, the dean of the division of libraries at N.Y.U. ''This one never got shopped around. We have many terrific union leader archives, so we were the obvious choice.''
In September 1969, several months after Bowie Kuhn's election as the commissioner, Miller amicably but firmly reminded him that Kuhn's role was to represent the owners, not the players, and that he could not be impartial about player-owner relationships.
''The day is past when a management attempt to control, dominate or dictate to the players' organization would be tolerated,'' Miller wrote. ''It should not be necessary to note the foregoing. However, there are some who read your statement, alleging that you represent the players, as a deliberate and provocative challenge to the integrity and independence of the players and their duly elected representatives.''
One line in the letter, perhaps typed without rancor, rings now as contemptuous given the hostility that built between the men. ''That you are viewed as the top management official in baseball,'' Miller wrote, ''is not something to be ashamed of.''
Two years later, Miller dismissed Kuhn's assessment of a disciplinary case and an arbitrator's decision involving Alex Johnson, the 1970 American League batting champion. Miller wrote that Kuhn had shown that ''your preferred mode of behavior is to issue edicts first, without full knowledge of the facts, and then to defend your position by incantations about serving the best interests of the game.''
After a strike in 1972 that began during spring training, Miller wrote to Buzzie Bavasi, the San Diego Padres' president, scorning him for telling players that Miller had been paid during the strike and for failing to honor a $100 bet on the claim with catcher Bob Barton. ''Although I know that you have spent a tremendous amount of your time and that of other people to try to improperly save trifling amounts such as 75 cents a day in spring training rooming allowances,'' Miller wrote, ''still I cannot believe you would deliberately tell untruths to the players in order to avoid paying a $100 bet which you lost.''
The archive is incomplete, insofar as the provocations for his responses are not always in the files. Still, the collection has files from his steelworker days to entries from years after he retired from the players union.
It contains pages of expenses Miller filed during his first trips to spring training camps in 1966 ($231.75 for 15 days of lodging and $108.10 in telephone costs); arbitrators' decisions; newspaper and magazine clippings; handwritten notes, in his barely legible script, on player benefits; and solicitations to write his autobiography.
Johnny Mize, a Hall of Fame slugger, sent a note in 1980 to thank Miller for raising the players' pension. ''Every little bit helps,'' he wrote, ''and this increase is great.'' Another, from Ken Keltner, the third baseman who helped end Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak, thanked Miller for ''everything you have done for us Old Timers.''
Ted Turner, the Atlanta Braves owner and cable television magnate, wrote on March 5, 1980, that he enjoyed a recent Sports Illustrated story about Miller and the impending labor strife that year.
''I would appreciate your autographing your picture (attached) so I can place it in a safe place for keeping!'' Turner wrote. ''Because of what you have done, I would rather be a player than an owner, but, alas, I don't have the talent!''
There is a notable entry regarding Richard M. Nixon: a two-page memo that outlined the legal advice that Nixon's firm could provide the union. The document -- its writer is anonymous -- supports Miller's account of visiting Nixon's Manhattan apartment in 1966 to talk to the former vice president about becoming the union's general counsel.
In his memoir, Miller recalled that Nixon never mentioned the general counsel position but told him: ''Let me know if I can do anything for you. I am on very good terms with the owners.'' To himself, Miller said, ''Yes, I bet you are.''
Miller chose Richard Moss as his general counsel. Nixon pursued other things.
Nearly 30 years later, with the 1994-95 players' strike over but a collective bargaining agreement still elusive, Miller received a note from Donald Fehr, who was Miller's general counsel before becoming the executive director.
''You asked, 'How goes the unilateral request for a contract?' '' Fehr wrote on Aug. 8, 1995. ''Reread Cervantes. Except, when you do, superimpose the notion that Don Quixote knows he is on a useless endeavor. So it goes. Any ideas?''

HEADLINE: Fire Safety in Garment Factories

 BODY:
The deaths of about 400 workers in two recent fires at Asian garment factories that made clothes for American and European brands should outrage consumers and become a rallying cry for higher safety standards. Just as the 1911 fire at the Triangle shirtwaist factory in New York ushered in a sweeping overhaul of industrial regulations in this country, these tragedies should lead to comprehensive changes in developing countries that have become the biggest suppliers of clothes to the Western world.
Accounts of the fires, in Bangladesh and Pakistan, clearly show that there would have been few, if any, deaths had the factories met basic safety standards. Owners of both factories had barred windows to prevent theft, and neither building had usable or safe fire exits, making it impossible for the workers to escape the flames and smoke. At the Bangladesh factory, Tazreen Fashions, managers initially stopped workers from leaving by dismissing a fire warning as a false alarm. 
These fires were the latest in a series of garment factory calamities. The Clean Clothes Campaign, an anti-sweatshop group, estimates that more than 500 workers have died in factory fires in Bangladesh since 2006, not counting the most recent disaster. That country has more than three million workers employed in the clothing industry and is now the world's second-largest exporter of garments, after China.
The loss of life is all the more horrifying because most safety violations are obvious -- as is the need to correct them. Global brands and retailers like Gap and Walmart could pay for improvements to factories in countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh. While the governments of these countries must do more to enforce higher safety standards, real change will come only if buyers of clothing put their economic muscle behind the effort.
News reports about an April 2011 meeting on factory safety in Bangladesh appear to indicate that Walmart and other retailers have been unwilling to pay the higher prices for clothes that would be needed to make factories safer. Labor groups say a roughly 3 percent annual increase in prices paid to the factories would be sufficient to make the needed improvements. That is a small expense to safeguard the lives of millions.
Most clothing brands and retailers also seem unwilling to commit to changes that could improve safety for workers who earn as little as $37 a month in places like Bangladesh. Companies continue to advocate the use of voluntary auditing and inspection regimes that are not up to the challenge.
In the case of Tazreen Fashions, Walmart says it stopped ordering clothes from the factory after its auditors found safety violations. Nevertheless, orders from Walmart channeled through subcontractors found their way to the factory. If companies insist on using such daisy-chain outsourcing, they must make sure every link in the chain is governed by the same rules, and they cannot be willfully ignorant of how their contractors operate.
Gap announced in October that it would start a fire-safety campaign for its suppliers in Bangladesh and help them get loans totaling $20 million to make factory improvements and provide $2 million in grants to pay workers while their workshops closed for renovations. Other companies, like H&M, also have fire-safety programs. But these initiatives are not subject to outside scrutiny and verification.
What's needed is an independent and robust inspection system that is legally enforceable and run by safety professionals. A group of international and Bangladeshi labor organizations have been working on such an effort, but they have been able to get only two companies -- the PVH Corporation, which owns the Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brands, and the German retailer Tchibo -- to agree to it. The proposal would provide for an independent chief inspector who would oversee detailed and periodic inspections, based on internationally recognized fire-safety standards, of factories that make a majority of the clothes bought by the companies that sign the agreement.
The companies would bear the costs of improvements through higher prices for clothes and grants to workers who miss workdays because of renovations. The cost of the inspection program to each company would vary by the firm's size, but it would be capped at $500,000 a year. Most important, the contract would be legally binding and could be enforced through arbitration and the courts in the companies' home countries.
The labor groups and the two companies have agreed that their system will go into effect only when two more major clothing businesses sign on so that more factories could be covered. More brands should step up and embrace this effort.
While this approach advanced by the labor groups is not perfect -- for example, it applies only to Bangladesh and ends after two years -- it provides a solid foundation for meaningful improvements. If successful, it could become a template for international businesses operating in other developing countries, like Pakistan, India, Vietnam and Cambodia. This could be one step toward ensuring that goods headed for American markets are not made in conditions that could well cost workers their lives.

HEADLINE: Let's Gang Up on Killer Bugs

BYLINE: By CARL F. NATHAN. 
Carl F. Nathan is chairman of the department of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College.

 BODY:
I hope you never have this experience: a loved one is hospitalized. Her doctors tell you her infection is resistant to antibiotics. She dies. More than 60,000 American families go through that experience each year -- and the number is almost certain to rise.
Multidrug-resistant organisms are showing up in top-flight hospitals -- like the klebsiella found in the National Institutes of Health's Clinical Center this year, which may have led to the deaths of seven patients. Even infections that used to be a breeze to treat, like gonorrhea, are becoming incurable. 
In much of the world, of course, bacterial disease is a routine cause of tragedy. Tuberculosis alone kills 1.4 million people a year. One reason for this staggeringly high figure is that most people in the world are too poor to pay for most medicines. But another reason is that some strains of tuberculosis bacteria have become resistant to most of the drugs we have. Even after two years of toxic treatment, drug-resistant tuberculosis has a fatality rate of about 50 percent.
What makes the rapid loss of antibiotics to drug resistance particularly alarming is that we are failing to make new ones. We are emptying our medicine chest of the most important class of medicines we ever had. And the cause can be traced, for the most part, to two profound problems.
The first is economic. Historically, the drug industry thrived on antibiotics. But if an antibiotic is useful against only one type of bacterium, relatively few people need it during its patent life. And if an antibiotic is ''broad spectrum,'' meaning it works on many different types of bacteria, wider use shortens its commercial life because it quickens the pace at which bacteria develop resistance. Moreover, antibiotics are designed to cure an acute disease -- not to palliate a chronic one -- so people need them only for a limited time. Compared with drugs that are used for years to treat widespread conditions like high cholesterol or asthma, antibiotics pale as a corporate investment.
The second challenge stems from the nature of bacteria. Though brainless, they are brainy, enjoying a highly effective collective intelligence. Large numbers of independently mutating bacteria test adaptations to group problems, like how to survive antibiotics. What works -- like modifying the bacterial proteins to which antibiotics would otherwise bind -- wins. As bacteria become more adept at evading antibiotics, it has become much harder to find drugs that can beat them back.
Merge these two problems -- scientific and economic -- and the result is a drug-development disaster: the prospects are so discouraging that few companies bother to try anymore.
How can we confront the critical shortage of new antibiotics when both the scientific approach and the economic model are letting us down? We can change both paradigms.
Drug makers survive by selling what people or governments buy in amounts and at prices that maximize profit. Monopoly protects the ability to set price for profit. Patents allow monopoly. Secrecy protects intellectual property until it is patented.
But what if we take a page out of the pathogen playbook? Many pathogens exchange DNA, sharing what they learn. Drug makers can operate in the same way: they can do science ''open lab''-style, working in teams with academic and government scientists and other drug companies to share what they learn and to bring fresh scientific ideas and technological tools to bear. Relaxing the traditional insistence on secrecy allows collaboration, and with it, innovation.
Did I hear you say, ''It'll never happen''? It already has. GlaxoSmithKline opened its campus at Tres Cantos, Spain, to outside academic, government and biotech scientists in order to collaborate on finding antibiotics for neglected infectious diseases. The independent Tres Cantos Open Lab Foundation selects the projects and helps cover visiting researchers' expenses.
In another version of the open lab concept, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation organized a TB Drug Accelerator program that brings together research teams from seven major companies (Abbott Laboratories, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck and Sanofi) with scientists from four academic and government institutions. The companies have exchanged more than a thousand compounds and provided the academic and government scientists with access to millions.
These experiments show that even competing research teams can share knowledge, risk and reward in anti-infective drug development, test diverse approaches and avoid redundant efforts. (I'm involved in both of these projects.)
Philanthropic efforts have financed these open labs, but they can't substitute for market forces. Nor can the current economic model give antibiotic development a permanent, prominent place in drug company portfolios.
There are, however, other ways for drug makers to profit beyond using monopoly to protect prices. As Thomas Pogge of Yale and Aidan Hollis of the University of Calgary have pointed out, an intergovernmental fund for drug discovery could reward drug makers for products in proportion to their impact in reducing the loss of healthy years of life. The lower the cost of a lifesaving drug, the greater the number of people who could use it; the more lives protected, then, the greater the monetary reward. An investment of $20 billion a year could encourage more open-lab collaborations to find new medicines in challenging settings like antibiotic discovery and make them accessible to all who need them.
If we don't make new antibiotics, we will lose the ability to practice modern medicine. A new collaborative model for drug discovery can help make sure this doesn't happen.

HEADLINE: Romanians Vote in Parliamentary Elections

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY; George Calin contributed reporting from Bucharest, Romania.

 BODY:
PARIS -- Romanians went to the polls on Sunday in parliamentary elections that have threatened to push the country further into political upheaval and acrimony.
A center-left coalition led by Prime Minister Victor Ponta is expected to win a comfortable parliamentary majority, according to the latest polls, ostensibly making him the front-runner for the prime minister post.
But his political nemesis, the center-right President Traian Basescu, has the power to appoint a prime minister after the elections. He has indicated that he would not select Mr. Ponta, in part because Mr. Ponta tried to have him impeached over the summer. 
During the campaign, Mr. Basescu called Mr. Ponta a ''compulsive liar'' and an ''ogre'' and said that appointing the man who tried to oust him would be like swallowing a pig. Mr. Ponta's coalition, in turn, has threatened a new impeachment effort if it wins a majority and Mr. Ponta is not named prime minister.
The result, analysts said, was likely to be a protracted political fight that could destabilize the country, undermine its struggling economy and delay a loan deal from the International Monetary Fund that Romania is hoping to negotiate when its current arrangement expires early next year.
In Bucharest, the Romanian capital, political commentators called the election ''Basescu's revenge.''
''The most we can hope for is that it is not a long war, and the parties find a compromise,'' said Cosmin Stan, a leading Romanian broadcaster with Realitatea Television.
Romania, a poor Balkan country that has struggled to shed the legacy of decades of dictatorship under Nicolae Ceausescu, has undergone some of its worst political turbulence in recent memory. The country has weathered a series of unstable governments and come under criticism from the European Union and the United States. In October, the European Commission, the union's executive body, said that concerns about corruption and fraud had prompted it to block development aid potentially worth billions of euros. All the while, the public remains deeply disillusioned amid a simmering dissatisfaction with austerity -- including a 25 percent cut in public sector wages -- which many voters blame on Mr. Basescu.
Mr. Ponta, at 40, the youngest prime minister in the European Union, has been locked in a bitter power struggle with Mr. Basescu, a 61-year-old former sea captain. The acrimony was made worse by the July impeachment vote which Mr. Basescu called a ''coup d'état'' and which drew sharp criticism from the European Union and the United States. Mr. Ponta had accused Mr. Basescu of overreaching his mandate by, among other things, refusing to appoint ministers chosen by the prime minister.
Many Romanians say they are tired of the dueling leaders, and in a sign of that discontent, the populist People's Party of Dan Diaconescu, a flamboyant television station owner who campaigned in a white Rolls-Royce and is being investigated for fraud, is expected to win up to 15 percent of the vote, according to recent polls. As part of his campaign, Mr. Diaconescu has promised 20,000 euros to every Romanian who starts a business.
Yet it is the feud between Mr. Ponta and Mr. Basescu that has dominated the election.
Under the Constitution, the president must name a prime minister from the party that receives a majority, in consultation with the party. Mr. Ponta is the coalition's choice. The candidate for prime minister then needs to be approved by the Parliament, where the center-left coalition is expected to have a strong majority. While the constitution gives the president the prerogative to name the prime minister, he cannot ignore the popular vote.
Mr. Basescu might try and bypass Mr. Ponta by appointing another candidate from the center-left coalition, if it wins a majority. Constitutional specialists said Mr. Basescu's room for maneuver would be determined by size of the center-left coalition's victory. If it wins by a large threshold -- and some polls show them getting as much as 57 percent of the vote -- the experts say it will be hard to ignore the coalition's candidate.
Some experts said that Mr. Basescu was banking on the fact that the Constitution says the president must appoint the prime minister from the winning party -- but is unclear on whether this applies to a coalition like Mr. Ponta's. The Constitution is open to interpretation, and each side is interpreting it in its own interests.
Catalin Ivan, a spokesman for Mr. Ponta's coalition, the Social Liberal Union, said that if the coalition won the election and Mr. Basescu did not appoint Mr. Ponta as prime minister, he would face an impeachment vote as well as Europe-wide condemnation. ''We would like to think we have democracy in Romania,'' Mr. Ivan said.
Cristian Parvulescu, the dean of political science at the National School of Political Studies and Public Administration in Bucharest, said that under the Constitution, Mr. Basescu was obligated to appoint a prime minister from the party that won a majority. While Mr. Basescu can reject the candidate put forward by the winner, Mr. Parvulescu said, such a move could put him on shaky constitutional grounds.
Laura Stefan, a legal specialist at Expert Forum, an independent research institute in Bucharest, argued that it was Mr. Ponta's political immaturity that had plunged Romania into crisis and that Mr. Basescu was within his legal right to choose someone more qualified. She noted that two failed attempts to form a government within 60 days of Mr. Basescu first nominating a candidate would trigger early elections.
''It is clear that Mr. Basescu doesn't like or trust Mr. Ponta, and so we are entering a period of uncertainty,'' Ms. Stefan said. ''But I don't think anyone wants more political upheaval or early elections, and my prediction is there will be a hard-fought compromise.''
In the crowded cafes of Bucharest, many Romanians said they were deeply disillusioned. Maria Ghitu, a 34-year-old hair stylist waiting to vote in Piata Muncii, a working class neighborhood, said she was fed up with politicians. ''They are the same,'' she said. ''They only think of themselves while the economy plunges and we suffer.''
Analysts said that the poisonous atmosphere in Romanian politics showed little sign of abating given that whoever became prime minister would have to try and work with Mr. Basescu, whose mandate ends in 2014. ''We are in for a long political struggle,'' Mr. Stan said.

HEADLINE: Poor Schools Struggling To Meet State Standards, Years After Critical Ruling

BYLINE: By VIVIAN YEE

 BODY:
Six years after a landmark court ruling required New York State to increase spending on public education, many schools in poor districts lack basic resources, and some do not even meet minimum state standards in certain areas, according to a report to be released on Monday by researchers affiliated with Teachers College at Columbia University.
The researchers interviewed teachers, administrators and support staff members at 33 schools with high proportions of low-income, struggling or disabled students, including 12 in New York City. 
In many cases, schools could not afford enough staff members to meet standards in core subjects or in services like extra help for struggling students.
Thirteen were not meeting state minimums for the amount of instructional time devoted to science, including three New York City high schools that were not offering any chemistry or physics classes, according to the report.
The issue, as it has been for years, is money. The recession arrived not long after a ruling by the State Court of Appeals in 2006 and an agreement by the Legislature and Gov. Eliot Spitzer in 2007 ended a battle of more than a decade over financing of poor schools, and the state is $5 billion behind what it pledged to spend, according to the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, the group that won the court ruling.
''These constitutional rights are not conditional, and they cannot be put on hold because there is a recession or a state budget deficit,'' the report's authors wrote.
The group issuing the report, the Campaign for Educational Equity, is based at Teachers College and led by Michael A. Rebell, a lawyer and education professor who is the former executive director of the Campaign for Fiscal Equity.
The report did not identify which schools researchers visited. It said that 5 of the 33 were not meeting state requirements in social studies, and that 3 fell short of minimum standards in math. Schools could not keep up with standards in art, occupational studies, health and physical education.
None were offering the minimum amount of support services for struggling students, like remedial after-school programs. Students with disabilities were not receiving enough extra academic support in six schools, and English-language learners were affected in 13.
Cuts, meanwhile, had slashed so deeply at some schools that principals reported taking on the duties of a secretary, a social worker or a janitor.
Although a major goal of the lawsuit by the Campaign for Fiscal Equity was to limit class sizes, they remain high, the report said. All the New York City middle and high schools in the survey reported classes of 30 or more students.
According to statistics from the city's Education Department, class sizes have been steadily increasing; the average class size in elementary schools rose to 24.4 in 2011-12 from 23.7 in 2010-11, and in middle schools to 27 from 26.8 over the same periods. In high schools, they remained at 26.3.
According to the report, teachers said the minimum standards, hard as they were to follow, were still too low to ensure a meaningful education, which the court defined in its ruling as preparing students to become competitive workers and productive citizens.
Even if the schools had the resources to meet the minimum standards, teachers said, students were unlikely to meet Regents standards or the state's new Common Core learning standards, which are more stringent.
But between the recession and Hurricane Sandy, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo faces a difficult fiscal situation. The governor's office has repeatedly fretted over the fact that New York leads the nation in education spending yet apparently has little to show for it.
''The facts on the governor's priorities for education are clear,'' Matt Wing, a spokesman for the governor, said in a statement. ''Last year, he invested an additional $800 million in our schools, despite a multibillion deficit, and prioritized low-income districts with a spending formula that gives them a higher percentage of state aid.''
The $800 million restored to school districts last year followed two years of substantial education cuts, which eliminated most of the extra aid the state had given out in the years immediately after the court ruling.
Mr. Rebell said he hoped the reports would prompt Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature to incorporate more education aid into next year's budget. But if not, he said, his group would consider going to court, using the reports as the groundwork for its arguments. The Campaign for Fiscal Equity has also indicated it may sue again.
Mr. Rebell has made one concession: given the condition of New York's finances, he and other advocates have offered to help the state find ways to do more with less.
''The kids have a right to constitutionally mandated services; they don't necessarily have a right to a dollar amount,'' he said. ''I'm aware a lot's changed since 2007.''

HEADLINE: Water Piped to Denver Could Ease Stress on River

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
The federal government has come up with dozens of ways to enhance the diminishing flow of the Colorado River, which has long struggled to keep seven states and roughly 25 million people hydrated.
Among the proposals in a report by the Bureau of Reclamation, parts of which leaked out in advance of its expected release this week, are traditional solutions to water shortages, like decreasing demand through conservation and increasing supply through reuse or desalination projects.
But also in the mix, and expected to remain in the final draft of the report, is a more extreme and contentious approach. It calls for building a pipeline from the Missouri River to Denver, nearly 600 miles to the west. Water would be doled out as needed along the route in Kansas, with the rest ultimately stored in reservoirs in the Denver area. 
Experts say the plan is reminiscent of those proposed in the middle of the last century, when grand and exorbitant federal water projects were commonplace -- and not, with the benefit of hindsight, always advisable.
The fact that the Missouri River pipeline idea made the final draft, water experts say, shows how serious the problem has become for the states of the Colorado River basin. ''I pooh-poohed this kind of stuff back in the 1960s,'' said Chuck Howe, a water policy expert and emeritus professor of economics at the University of Colorado, Boulder. ''But it's no longer totally unrealistic. Currently, one can say 'It's worth a careful look.' ''
The pipeline would provide the Colorado River basin with 600,000 acre-feet of water annually, which could serve roughly a million single-family homes. But the loss of so much water from the Missouri and Mississippi River systems, which require flows high enough to sustain large vessel navigation, would most likely face strong political opposition.
''If this gets any traction at all, people in the flyover states of the Missouri River basin probably will scream,'' said Burke W. Griggs, the counsel for the Kansas Agriculture Department's division of water resources. But, he added, the proposal ''shows you the degree to which water-short entities in the Colorado River basin are willing to go to get water'' from elsewhere, rather than fight each other over dwindling supplies, as they have intermittently for about a century.
The new report addresses the adequacy of water supplies over the next 50 years in the Colorado basin, which includes the central and southern Rocky Mountains, the deserts of the Southwest and Southern California. The study, the officials said, will serve as a road map for future federal action in collaboration with the Colorado River basin states.
The Denver Post described the pipeline option in an article last week.
As far as future water supplies go, the outlook is not good. Most Colorado River water is currently used for agriculture, but that is beginning to shift as the cities of the Southwest continue to grow.
The effects of climate change could result in less precipitation over the Rockies, further stressing the supply.
Existing agreements among the states that depend on the river oblige those in the upper basin (including Colorado, Utah and Wyoming) to provide a specified amount of flow downstream. The fear, Professor Howe said, is that there will not be enough Colorado water for all, and that downstream states like Arizona and California will nonetheless call for their usual deliveries from the upstream states, renewing old water wars.
To avert that, new sources of supply or a sharp reduction in demand would be required.
Rose Davis, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Reclamation, said that during the course of the study, the analysis done on climate change and historical data led the agency ''to an acknowledged gap'' between future demand and future supply as early as the middle of this century.
That is when they put out a call for broader thinking to solve the water problem. ''When we did have that wake-up call, we threw open the doors and said, 'Bring it on,' '' she said. ''Nothing is too silly.''
Jason Bane of Western Resource Advocates, a conservation organization based in Boulder, Colo., described the Missouri pipeline option as ''fundamentally 20th-century water-policy thinking that doesn't work in the 21st century.'' He added, ''We clearly need to conserve and be more efficient with the water we have.''
It is unclear how much such a pipeline project would cost, though estimates run into the billions of dollars. That does not include the cost of the new electric power that would be needed (along with the construction of new generating capacity) to pump the water uphill from Leavenworth, Kan., to the front range reservoirs serving Denver, about a mile above sea level, according to Sharlene Leurig, an expert on water-project financing at Ceres, a nonprofit group based in Boston that works with investors to promote sustainability.
If the Denver area had this new source of water to draw on, it could reduce the supplies that come from the Colorado River basin on the other side of the Continental Divide.
But Mr. Griggs and some federal officials said that the approval of such a huge water project remained highly unlikely.
Ms. Leurig noted that local taxpayers and utility customers would be shouldering most of the expense of such a venture through their tax and water bills, which would make conservation a more palatable alternative.

HEADLINE: 25 Years Later, A South Bronx Story Might Never Have Been

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Two white people, one of them a young woman decked out in a royal-blue Avenue Foch jacket with shoulders out to here . . . enough matched luggage in the back seat for a trip to China . . . a $48,000 Mercedes roadster . . . in the middle of the South Bronx . . .Miraculous!
Twenty-five years later, a comparable Mercedes roadster would set Sherman McCoy back about $108,000. But the latest model comes equipped with a voice-activated navigation system that would have warned him away from the South Bronx where a hit-and-run accident involving a black honor student triggered a chain of events that dethroned McCoy as a Master of the Universe in Tom Wolfe's racially-charged novel "The Bonfire of the Vanities." 
Today, if McCoy were still flush with a Wall Street bonus, he might even be armed with the mobile app patented by Microsoft a year ago to warn people away from "an unsafe neighborhood."
Now, some parts of the South Bronx have become desirable residential neighborhoods "so it's possible that McCoy would be up there looking at a luxury condo development in which he's an investor," said Sarah Chinn, a professor of English at Hunter College of the City University of New York. "But of course, that GPS would in many ways make the set-up of 'Bonfire' obsolete - he wouldn't have got lost in the first place."
The South Bronx is still poor and the majority is nonwhite. Bruckner Boulevard, on which the Manhattan-bound McCoy wound up after making a fateful wrong turn on what used to be called the Triborough Bridge, remains uninviting in the shadow of the elevated expressway during the day and is still more desolate at night.
But the South Bronx is no longer the vast wasteland - "entire blocks of the city without a building left standing"- depicted in the novel. The population has grown, more apartments have been built or renovated, median household income has inched up and reported crime has declined.
The book was widely praised by critics and was a popular success. It also became a movie with Tom Hanks starring in the McCoy role that was poorly received by critics and the public.
Mr. Wolfe said he has not returned to the South Bronx in the 25 years since his novel was published to witness any changes for himself.
"I'm afraid I haven't," he said, adding, though: "I shall investigate." (He is writing his own 25-year retrospective, though he will not say where it will appear.)
Regardless of demographic differences, he said, New Yorkers are not yet living in a post-racial climate.
"Legally," he said, "Sherman McCoy would be in worse shape today than he was in 1987, because prosecutors' zeal to convict The Great White Defendant is now even more fervid in the wake of the scandals of the subprime crash of 2008 - although, of course, he may very well have been laid off, even at age 64, like so many of his brethren, making it a moot point, moot but a very sad one for him."
But Edward W. Hayes, the model for the defense lawyer in the novel ("Bonfire" was dedicated to Mr. Hayes and to Burton B. Roberts, a former judge who died in 2010), suggested that the city has, indeed, changed since 1987, mostly for the better.
"There is much less crime, racial appeals are not quite as strong and it's a much richer city," Mr. Hayes said, "but McCoy could still get lost because it's always hard to find one's way in a strange neighborhood."
Another inspiration for a character in the book, the Rev. Al Sharpton, described New York as "not as polarized as it was, but it's still a tale of two cities. I don't think we're in a post-racial period, but we're in a better racial period," he said.
"Life for blacks and Latinos is better than it was, but it is qualitatively different than for whites," he added. "You don't want to settle for better; you want to settle for equal. It is wrong to say it's not better and some of the people that fought and marched and who he demonized are people who made it better."
In the two police precincts that cover much of the South Bronx, there were 22 murders and 576 robberies last year, compared with 72 and 3,257, respectively, in 1990.
In a Mott Haven census tract near where McCoy's fictional hit-and-run occurred, the Census Bureau in 1990 recorded an unemployment rate of 18 percent, a median household income of $17,633, and 51 percent of families living in poverty.
By 2010, the unemployment rate stood at 13 percent unemployment rate, median household income at $20,253 and 40 percent of families were living in poverty.
Even more visible changes occurred in McCoy's Manhattan enclave, too. The historically impenetrable East 96th Street barrier that separated rich and poor was breached as developers planted luxury high-rise apartments deep into East Harlem.
"What's changed? Everything," said Fernando Ferrer, who had just become the borough president when "Bonfire" was published. Would Sherman McCoy and his mistress be as fearful today ("Human existence had but one purpose: to get out of the Bronx," the mistress thought)?
"Sherman McCoy would have been fearful anywhere that wasn't in his universe," Mr. Ferrer said. "Conceivably you could make a wrong turn in Paris."
Changes aside, some critics complained all along that the South Bronx of "Bonfire" was a caricature that made a bad situation worse. In fact, the book did provoke protests from Bronx boosters.
"To be honest, I never bought the premise of 'Bonfire,' " Professor Chinn said. "Rather, it was a symbol of terrifying otherness, not unlike the image of the 'inner city' that still gets invoked by apps that help us steer clear of 'bad' neighborhoods. The Bronx of 'Bonfire' is the Bronx of the white imagination, not the Bronx of, say, DJ Kool Herc or, not to press the point, Sonia Sotomayor."
To which Mr. Ferrer added: "That's why they call it fiction."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Mortgage Crisis Presents Banks A New Reckoning

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG

 BODY:
The nation's largest banks are facing a fresh torrent of lawsuits asserting that they sold shoddy mortgage securities that imploded during the financial crisis, potentially adding significantly to the tens of billions of dollars the banks have already paid to settle other cases.
Regulators, prosecutors, investors and insurers have filed dozens of new claims against Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and others, related to more than $1 trillion worth of securities backed by residential mortgages.
Estimates of potential costs from these cases vary widely, but some in the banking industry fear they could reach $300 billion if the institutions lose all of the litigation. Depending on the final price tag, the costs could lower profits and slow the economic recovery by weakening the banks' ability to lend just as the housing market is showing signs of life.
The banks are battling on three fronts: with prosecutors who accuse them of fraud, with regulators who claim that they duped investors into buying bad mortgage securities, and with investors seeking to force them to buy back the soured loans. 
''We are at an all-time high for this mortgage litigation,'' said Christopher J. Willis, a lawyer with Ballard Spahr, which handles securities and consumer litigation.
Efforts by the banks to limit their losses could depend on the outcome of one of the highest-stakes lawsuits to date -- the $200 billion case that the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees the housing twins Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, filed against 17 banks last year, claiming that they duped the mortgage finance giants into buying shaky securities.
Last month, lawyers for some of the nation's largest banks descended on a federal appeals court in Manhattan to make their case that the agency had waited too long to sue. A favorable ruling could overturn a decision by Judge Denise L. Cote, who is presiding over the litigation and has so far rejected virtually every defense raised by the banks, and would be cheered in bank boardrooms. It could also allow the banks to avoid federal housing regulators' claims.
At the same time, though, some major banks are hoping to reach a broad settlement with housing agency officials, according to several people with knowledge of the talks. Although the negotiations are at a very tentative stage, the banks are broaching a potential cease-fire.
As the housing market and the nation's economy slowly recover from the 2008 financial crisis, Wall Street is vulnerable on several fronts, including tighter regulations assembled in the aftermath of the crisis and continuing investigations into possible rigging of a major international interest rate. But the mortgage lawsuits could be the most devastating and expensive threat, bank analysts say.
''All of Wall Street has essentially refused to deal with the real costs of the litigation that they are up against,'' said Christopher Whalen, a senior managing director at Tangent Capital Partners. ''The real price tag is terrifying.''
Anticipating painful costs from mortgage litigation, the five major sellers of mortgage-backed securities set aside $22.5 billion as of June 30 just to cushion themselves against demands that they repurchase soured loans from trusts, according to an analysis by Natoma Partners.
But in the most extreme situation, the litigation could empty even more well-stocked reserves and weigh down profits as the banks are forced to pay penance for the subprime housing crisis, according to several senior officials in the industry.
There is no industrywide tally of how much banks have paid since the financial crisis to put the mortgage litigation behind them, but analysts say that future settlements will dwarf the payouts so far. That is because banks, for the most part, have settled only a small fraction of the lawsuits against them.
JPMorgan Chase and Credit Suisse, for example, agreed last month to settle mortgage securities cases with the Securities and Exchange Commission for $417 million, but still face billions of dollars in outstanding claims.
Bank of America is in the most precarious position, analysts say, in part because of its acquisition of the troubled subprime lender Countrywide Financial.
Last year, Bank of America paid $2.5 billion to repurchase troubled mortgages from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and $1.6 billion to Assured Guaranty, which insured the shaky mortgage bonds.
But in October, federal prosecutors in New York accused the bank of perpetrating a fraud through Countrywide by churning out loans at such a fast pace that controls were largely ignored. A settlement in that case could reach well beyond $1 billion because the Justice Department sued the bank under a law that could allow roughly triple the damages incurred by taxpayers.
Bank of America's attempts to resolve some mortgage litigation with an umbrella settlement have stalled. In June 2011, the bank agreed to pay $8.5 billion to appease investors, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Pimco, that lost billions of dollars when the mortgage securities assembled by the bank went bad. But the settlement is in limbo after being challenged by investors. Kathy D. Patrick, the lawyer representing investors, has said she will set her sights on Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo next.
Of the more than $1 trillion in troubled mortgage-backed securities remaining, Bank of America has more than $417 billion from Countrywide alone, according to an analysis of lawsuits and company filings. The bank does not disclose the volume of its mortgage litigation reserves.
''We have resolved many Countrywide mortgage-related matters, established large reserves to address these issues and identified a range of possible losses beyond those reserves, which we believe adequately addresses our exposures,'' said Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for Bank of America.
Adding to the legal fracas, New York's attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, accused Credit Suisse last month of perpetrating an $11.2 billion fraud by deceiving investors into buying shoddy mortgage-backed securities. According to the complaint, the bank dismissed flaws in the loans packaged into securities even while assuring investors that the quality was sound. The bank disputes the claims.
''We need real accountability for the illegal and deceptive conduct in the creation of the housing bubble in order to bring justice for New York's homeowners and investors,'' Mr. Schneiderman said.
It is the second time that Mr. Schneiderman -- who is also co-chairman of the Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group, created by President Obama in January -- has taken aim at Wall Street for problems related to the subprime mortgage morass. In October, he filed a civil suit in New York State Supreme Court against Bear Stearns & Company, which JPMorgan Chase bought in 2008. The complaint claims that Bear Stearns and its lending unit harmed investors who bought mortgage securities put together from 2005 through 2007. JPMorgan denies the allegations. Another potentially costly prospect for the banks are the demands from a number of private investors who want the banks to buy back securities that violated representations and warranties vouching for the loans.
JPMorgan Chase told investors that as of the second quarter of this year, it was contending with more than $3.5 billion in repurchase demands. In the same quarter, it received more than $1.5 billion in fresh demands. Bank of America reported that as of the second quarter, it was dealing with more than $22 billion in unresolved demands, more than $8 billion of which were received during that quarter.

HEADLINE: To Steer Students Toward Jobs, Florida May Cut Tuition for Select Majors

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
MIAMI -- Rick Scott, businessman turned politician, campaigned for governor in 2010 with promises to run Florida like a successful business -- more efficiency, lower costs, less hand-wringing and measurable results.
He meant higher education, too, but until recently that meant mostly shrinking budgets.
Now, looking for more value on the remaining dollars, Governor Scott and Republican lawmakers are prodding Florida's 12 state universities to find ways to steer students toward majors that are in demand in the job market.
The message from Tallahassee could not be blunter: Give us engineers, scientists, health care specialists and technology experts. Do not worry so much about historians, philosophers, anthropologists and English majors.
To nudge students toward job-friendly degrees, the governor's task force on higher education suggested recently that university tuition rates be frozen for three years for majors in ''strategic areas,'' which would vary depending on supply and demand. An undergraduate student would pay less for a degree in engineering or biotechnology -- whose classes are among the most expensive for universities -- than for a degree in history or psychology. State financing, which has dropped drastically in the past five years, would be expected to make up the tuition gap. 
At the same time, Mr. Scott wants the state's 28 colleges (formerly called community colleges) to offer some of their four-year degrees for $10,000. That amount is $3,000 or so less than the typical cost. So far, several colleges are planning to take him up on the challenge, which would attract new students and encourage people to complete their degrees. The idea for a $10,000-degree originated last year with Gov. Rick Perry of Texas. In Florida, the challenge has been lauded by business groups.
''Every business has to figure out how to make itself more efficient,'' Mr. Scott said when announcing the challenge at St. Petersburg College last month. ''They've got to use technology. They've got to use the Internet, things like that. We can do the same thing with our state colleges.''
Universities cannot offer four-year degrees for $10,000 -- their average is more than $24,000 -- but they are being asked to spend their money more judiciously. They are also being asked to quantify their performances by, for example, figuring out which of their students actually get jobs after graduation.
Dale A. Brill, the chairman of the governor's task force and a ''liberal arts guy,'' said universities needed to be realistic. Generous state financing is no longer an option, at least not in Florida. Universities, he said, need to be practical about the value of their degrees at a time when well-paying jobs are scarce, a position taken by a growing number of institutions and one that underscores the latest philosophical divide over education.
''The higher education system needs to evolve with the economy,'' said Mr. Brill, the president of the Florida Chamber Foundation. ''People pay taxes expecting that the public good will be served to the greatest degree possible. We call that a return on investment.''
Florida's new Senate president, Don Gaetz, a Republican, agrees. He has said he wants ''to lash higher education to the realities and opportunities of the economy.''
But the shift toward market-based degrees and greater affordability after five years of budget cuts has its detractors.
In a letter to the governor, Roberto Martinez, the vice chairman of the State Board of Education, which oversees state colleges, called it a ''very bad idea.''
''The '$10,000 Bachelor's Degree' is not a serious policy,'' he wrote. ''It will be perceived as a gimmick pretending to be a policy used as a sound bite.''
At the University of Florida, the state's most prestigious campus, a group of history professors criticized the recommendation for tiered tuition and organized a protest petition. Liberal arts devotees across the state are signing it. The professors said the move would inevitably reduce the number of students who take humanities classes, which would further diminish financing for those departments. In the end, Florida universities with nationally prominent programs, like the one for Latin American history at the University of Florida, will lose coveted professors and their overall luster.
The decision on tuition differences and policies like it rests with the Board of Governors, which oversees the university system; the governor; and the Legislature, which is controlled by Republicans. How to finance and reshape universities will be a priority in the next legislative session, which begins in March.
''If you are going to become an urban engineer, a degree in the humanities would help you do that,'' said Lillian Guerra, an associate professor of Cuban and Caribbean history who said she was lured to the University of Florida from Yale University because of its world-class Latin American studies program. ''A degree in the humanities is foundational for someone who is an urban planner or in the tourism industry, for example. It gives students a set of analytical skills and writing skills.''
''I thought this would be valued here,'' she said of the liberal arts.
The $10,000 challenge and the blue-ribbon panel's recommendations come as Florida is rethinking the role of universities and colleges in the economy. In the past five years, Florida universities and colleges have seen steep drops in financing.
State spending per student declined 26 percent from 2006 to 2011, according to a report from the State Higher Education Executive Officers, a nonprofit group of national education officials. That ranks among the sharpest reductions in the country, in part because enrollment also boomed. Last year, Mr. Scott and the Legislature lopped off another $300 million.
To make up for that money, the Board of Governors has allowed tuition rates to climb 71 percent over the last four years. Florida's universities are still among the most affordable in the nation, but Mr. Scott strenuously opposes tuition increases because they lead to student debt and limit access.
The education task force recognized the dire state of higher education financing. In its report, it indicated that the state's first priority should be to increase public money for universities and colleges next year so that they remain competitive. Barring that, tuition increases should be allowed once again, the report said.
The state cuts have made these institutions leaner and more efficient. But many university leaders have concluded that more staff reductions and reduced salaries will erode the quality and reputation of the state's universities, which will not inspire companies to invest in Florida. Last week, university presidents went to the State Capitol and asked for $118 million more in financing for next year, the equivalent of a 15 percent tuition increase.
Florida already struggles with low graduation rates for high schools and a shortage of students who are well prepared to tackle challenging majors.
''It's not sour grapes; everyone has had to tighten their belt,'' said Judy Genshaft, the president of the University of South Florida in Tampa, which is building a national reputation. ''We are still achieving the best we can, but we are near a tipping point here.''
For the colleges opting to offer $10,000 degrees in a few areas -- public safety or criminal justice, for example -- the challenge is to find ways to bridge the gap of $3,000 or so. Some are exploring great private-public partnerships, which is just what Mr. Scott wants to see happen.
''There are some niche programs where $10,000 makes perfect sense,'' said James D. Henningsen, the president of the College of Central Florida, whose school will offer a lower-cost degree in business and organization management next fall. ''Our goal is to make an impact. We want to put cash back in people's pockets and help our community.''

HIGHLIGHT: Lawsuits against banks related to the mortgage crisis continue to pile up. | The sophistication of insider trading today "dwarfs" that of the 1980s. | A.I.G. is offloading more assets as it works to pay back its taxpayer-financed rescue. | Canada gave its blessing for Cnooc of China to buy Nexen. 

 BODY:
The mortgage crisis continues to haunt banks, which face an onslaught of lawsuits, Jessica Silver-Greenberg writes in The New York Times. "Estimates of potential costs from these cases vary widely, but some in the banking industry fear they could reach $300 billion if the institutions lose all of the litigation. Depending on the final price tag, the costs could lower profits and slow the economic recovery by weakening the banks' ability to lend just as the housing market is showing signs of life." The banks are fighting prosecutors, regulators and investors. "We are at an all-time high for this mortgage litigation," said Christopher J. Willis, a lawyer with Ballard Spahr, which handles securities and consumer litigation. 
INSIDER TRADING, THEN AND NOW | The sophistication of insider trading nowadays "dwarfs" that of the 1980s, says the New York Times columnist James B. Stewart, who wrote about the earlier scandals in his 1991 book, "Den of Thieves." He writes, "The tactics and technologies available to inside traders today are more sophisticated and more difficult both to detect and to prove." At the same time, the potential gains have soared, Robert S. Khuzami, head of enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission, said. "That's a big change from the 1980s and '90s. Hedge funds can take massive positions, use short-selling and derivatives, and employ trading techniques that aren't transparent, and make huge amounts of money on small fluctuations on price."
The case against Mathew Martoma, a former portfolio manager at SAC Capital Advisors, shows the changing nature of the business. Mr. Stewart writes: "The pressure to get an 'edge,' as hedge fund traders often put it, has never been greater."
A.I.G. TO SELL MOST OF AIRPLANE LEASING UNIT | The American International Group is offloading more assets as it works to pay back its taxpayer-financed rescue. It agreed on Sunday to sell up to 90 percent of its airplane leasing unit to a group of Chinese investors in a deal that values the unit at $5.28 billion, DealBook reports.
A group of investors that includes the New China Trust Company, the China Aviation Industrial Fund and P3 Investments is buying an 80 percent stake in the International Lease Finance Corporation, with the option to buy an additional 9.9 percent stake. A.I.G. is retaining at least 10 percent of the business, and Robert H. Benmosche, the insurer's chief executive, is keeping a seat on the board.
The deal, which is one of the biggest acquisitions of an American company by Chinese investors, is expected to face scrutiny by United States regulators, DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced writes.
 CANADA APPROVES CNOOC'S TAKEOVER OF NEXEN | Canada gave its blessing for the Chinese state-run oil giant Cnooc to buy Nexen, a domestic energy company, for $15 billion. But the government said such transactions might not be approved in the future. "These decisions are not the beginning of a trend, but rather the end of a trend," Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada said at a news conference on Friday. The Canadian government has been trying to attract investors, but some politicians were uneasy about the prospect of a foreign government gaining control over energy assets. For the Chinese, Canada's decision "will be a very mixed message," said Gordon Houlden, director of the China Institute at the University of Alberta. "They had ambitions far beyond Nexen."
ON THE AGENDA | Goldman Sachs goes on trial in Boston in a civil case over whether the investment bank failed to appropriately warn the owners of the speech-recognition company Dragon Systems about risky accounting practices that led to the bankruptcy of its acquirer. Mervyn King, the outgoing governor of the Bank of England, speaks at the Economic Club of New York. Jack Bogle, founder of the Vanguard Group, is on CNBC at 3:10 p.m. Teavana Holdings, which recently agreed to be acquired by Starbucks, reports earnings after the market closes.
INGERSOLL LOOKS TO APPEASE PELTZ | Months after the activist investor Nelson Peltz began pushing for changes, Ingersoll-Rand is following some of his advice. The conglomerate, based in Dublin, plans to unite its home and commercial security operations, which have combined revenue of about $2 billion, and spin off the new entity in about 12 months; initiate a $2 billion stock buyback; and increase its dividend roughly 30 percent, to about 21 cents a share, people briefed on the matter told DealBook on Sunday.
"Ingersoll's board met at the company's headquarters in Dublin last week to approve the initiatives, one of the people briefed on the matter said. The company could announce the moves as soon as Monday." Mr. Peltz's firm, Trian Fund Management, announced in May that it had acquired a roughly 7 percent stake in Ingersoll, which eventually offered the investor a seat on the board. "But with the company's shares having risen about 60 percent this year - they closed on Friday at $48.69 - Ingersoll executives felt less pressure to pursue a full-scale breakup of the company, one of the people briefed on the matter said. The new plan has Mr. Peltz's backing, these people said."
WALL STREETERS PLAYING DIRTY | An extreme obstacle course known as Tough Mudder is "becoming the macho sport of choice for Type A men (and some women) who find marathons too easy and triathlons meh," The New York Times reports. "While the races draw a fair share of endurance athletes and ex-military, many of the muddiest, most avid, most agro participants hail from Wall Street." The race involves crawling through a pit of cold mud while being electrified by wires, scaling a 15-foot-high wall and experiencing something called an Arctic Enema. Will Dean, the 31-year-old founder of Tough Mudder, said that "Goldman brings a massive team," and "so does Morgan Stanley."

HEADLINE: Japanese Manufacturers Help Save Chip Maker Renesas

BYLINE: HIROKO TABUCHI


HIGHLIGHT: Some of Japan's largest manufacturers are contributing to a $1.8 billion bailout of the struggling chip maker Renesas, a move that will give the government and the companies a 69 percent stake. 

 BODY:
TOKYO - When a magnitude 9 earthquake knocked out a chip-making factory at Renesas Electronics, Toyota Motor and other manufacturers dispatched hundreds of workers to help get the plant in northeastern Japan running again.
On Monday, some of Japan's largest manufacturers pitched in again, contributing to a $1.8 billion bailout of the struggling company.
In a statement, Renesas said eight Japanese manufacturers, including Canon, Nikon, Nissan, Panasonic and Toyota, would contribute about $145 million to the deal. A government fund, the Innovation Network Corporation of Japan, will provide the rest of the aid. 
 The effort underscores the importance of the company's advanced microcontroller chips to Japanese industry and the country's reluctance to give the technology to foreign players.
The capital injection will help Renesas increase spending on the advanced microcontrollers used in cars and electronic devices, the company said. To prop up its finances, Renesas, which is based in Kawasaki, had requested an additional 50 billion yen, or $606 million, from the government.
Although Renesas rebounded swiftly from the quake and tsunami that struck Japan last year, it has been less successful in dealing with rivals like Samsung Electronics of South Korea. As Japan's major manufacturers have stumbled in the face of tough competition and a slowing global economy, Renesas has struggled to turn a profit. On Monday, Renesas forecast a net loss of 150 billion yen for the 12 months through March 2013, after losing 62.6 billion yen in the previous 12 months.
Shares in Renesas rose 3 percent to close at 308 yen in Tokyo on Monday. The company has lost 35 percent of its market value this year.
The industry is under pressure in Japan. Elpida Memory, a Japanese manufacturer of dynamic random access memory chips, filed for bankruptcy protection in February. Elpida is being acquired by Micron Technology, a chip maker based in Boise, Idaho.
Despite the industry challenges, Japan wants to maintain control of Renesas.
In August, reports surfaced that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, the American private equity firm, had offered to invest as much as 100 billion yen in Renesas, which sent the company's shares soaring. But the potential deal also raised concerns about foreign control of a company that supplies many of Japan's leading manufacturers.
Japan's reliance on Renesas stems, in part, from the company's legacy.
In 2003, Hitachi and Mitsubishi Electric merged their semiconductor businesses to form Renesas Technology. Then in April 2010, Renesas joined NEC Electronics, the former semiconductor division of NEC, to create the current company.
As a result, manufacturers that once employed several preferred chip suppliers ended up largely buying products from one, Renesas. In addition to automotive microcontrollers, Renesas supplies specially tailored chips for electronics companies like Canon and Ricoh.
In the bailout plan announced on Monday, Renesas said it would sell 1.25 billion new shares for 120 yen each to the government fund and the Japanese manufacturers, giving them a 69 percent stake in the chip maker. That price represents a deep discount from the company's closing price of 308 yen on Monday in Tokyo.
The aid package follows 161 billion yen in syndicated loans Renesas secured from four Japanese banks in September, and 97 billion yen it received earlier from banks and its major shareholders. In return for that support, Renesas has promised to sell or close eight of its 18 plants in Japan within three years, and to eliminate more than 7,000 jobs from its global work force of roughly 43,000.

HEADLINE: HSBC to Pay $1.92 Billion to Settle Charges of Money Laundering

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: The announcement of a settlement on Tuesday came after state and federal authorities decided against indicting the British bank in a money-laundering case. 

 BODY:
 4:37 a.m. | Updated 
State and federal authorities decided against indicting HSBC in a money-laundering case over concerns that criminal charges could jeopardize one of the world's largest banks and ultimately destabilize the global financial system.
Instead, HSBC announced on Tuesday that it had agreed to a record $1.92 billion settlement with authorities. The bank, which is based in Britain, faces accusations that it transferred billions of dollars for nations like Iran and enabled Mexican drug cartels to move money illegally through its American subsidiaries.
While the settlement with HSBC is a major victory for the government, the case raises questions about whether certain financial institutions, having grown so large and interconnected, are too big to indict. Four years after the failure of Lehman Brothers nearly toppled the financial system, regulators are still wary that a single institution could undermine the recovery of the industry and the economy.
 But the threat of criminal prosecution acts as a powerful deterrent. If authorities signal such actions are remote for big banks, the threat could lose its sting. 
Behind the scenes, authorities debated for months the advantages and perils of a criminal indictment against HSBC.
Some prosecutors at the Justice Department's criminal division and the Manhattan district attorney's office wanted the bank to plead guilty to violations of the federal Bank Secrecy Act, according to the officials with direct knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The law requires financial institutions to report any cash transaction of $10,000 or more and to bring any dubious activity to the attention of regulators.
Given the extent of the evidence against HSBC, some prosecutors saw the charge as a healthy compromise between a settlement and a harsher money-laundering indictment. While the charge would most likely tarnish the bank's reputation, some officials argued that it would not set off a series of devastating consequences.
A money-laundering indictment, or a guilty plea over such charges, would essentially be a death sentence for the bank. Such actions could cut off the bank from certain investors like pension funds and ultimately cost it its charter to operate in the United States, officials said.
Despite the Justice Department's proposed compromise, Treasury Department officials and bank regulators at the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency pointed to potential issues with the aggressive stance, according to the officials briefed on the matter. When approached by the Justice Department for their thoughts, the regulators cautioned about the effect on the broader economy.
"The Justice Department asked Treasury for our view about the potential implications of prosecuting a large financial institution," David S. Cohen, the Treasury's under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a statement. "We did not believe we were in a position to offer any meaningful assessment. The decision of how the Justice Department exercises its prosecutorial discretion is solely theirs and Treasury had no role."
Still, some prosecutors proposed that Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. meet with Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, people briefed on the matter said. The meeting never took place.
After months of discussions, prosecutors decided against a criminal indictment, but only after securing record penalties and wide-ranging sanctions.
The HSBC deal includes a deferred prosecution agreement with the Manhattan district attorney's office and the Justice Department. The deferred prosecution agreement, a notch below a criminal indictment, requires the bank to forfeit more than $1.2 billion and pay about $700 million in fines, according to the officials briefed on the matter. The case, officials say, will claim violations of the Bank Secrecy Act and Trading with the Enemy Act.
As part of the deal, one of the officials briefed on the matter said, HSBC must also strengthen its internal controls and stay out of trouble for the next five years. If the bank again runs afoul of the federal rules, the Justice Department can resume its case and file a criminal indictment. An independent auditor will also monitor the bank's progress to strengthen its internal controls, and will make regular assessments on the firm's progress.
On Tuesday, HSBC said it had "reached agreement with United States authorities in relation to investigations regarding inadequate compliance with anti-money laundering and sanctions laws." The bank is also expected to reach a settlement over the matter with Britain's Financial Services Authority, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
"We accept responsibility for our past mistakes,'' HSBC's chief executive, Stuart T. Gulliver, said in the statement. "We are committed to protecting the integrity of the global financial system. To this end, we will continue to work closely with governments and regulators around the world."
The HSBC case is part of a sweeping investigation into the movement of tainted money through the American financial system. In 2010, Lanny A. Breuer, the head of the Justice Department's criminal division, created a money-laundering task force that has collected more than $2 billion in fines from banks, a number that is set to double with the HSBC case.
The inquiry - led by the Justice Department, the Treasury and the Manhattan prosecutors - has ensnared six foreign banks in recent years, including Credit Suisse and Barclays. In June, ING Bank reached a $619 million settlement to resolve claims that it had transferred billions of dollars in the United States for countries like Cuba and Iran that are under United States sanctions.
On Monday, federal and state authorities also won a $327 million settlement from Standard Chartered, a British bank. The bank, which in September agreed to a larger settlement with New York's top banking regulator, admitted processing thousands of transactions for Iranian and Sudanese clients through its American subsidiaries. To avoid having Iranian transactions detected by Treasury Department computer filters, Standard Chartered deliberately removed names and other identifying information, according to the authorities.
"You can't do it. It's against the law, and today Standard Chartered is being held to account," Mr. Breuer said in an interview.
HSBC's actions stand out among the foreign banks caught up in the investigation, according to several law enforcement officials with knowledge of the inquiry. Unlike those of institutions that have previously settled, HSBC's activities are said to have gone beyond claims that the bank flouted United States sanctions to transfer money on behalf of nations like Iran. Prosecutors also found that the bank had facilitated money laundering by Mexican drug cartels and had moved tainted money for Saudi banks tied to terrorist groups.
HSBC was thrust into the spotlight in July after a Congressional committee outlined how the bank, between 2001 and 2010, "exposed the U.S. financial system to money laundering and terrorist financing risks." The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations held a subsequent hearing at which the bank's compliance chief resigned amid mounting concerns that senior bank officials were complicit in the illegal activity. For example, an HSBC executive at one point argued that the bank should continue working with the Saudi Al Rajhi bank, which has supported Al Qaeda, according to the Congressional report.
Despite repeated urgings from federal officials to strengthen protections in its vast Mexican business, HSBC instead viewed the country from 2000 to 2009 as low-risk for money laundering, the Senate report found. Even after HSBC's Mexican operation transferred more than $7 billion to the United States - a volume that law enforcement officials said had to be "illegal drug proceeds" - lax controls remained.
HSBC has since moved to bolster its safeguards. The bank doubled its spending on compliance functions and revamped its oversight, according to a spokesman. In January, HSBC hired Stuart A. Levey as chief legal officer to come up with stricter internal standards to thwart the illegal flow of cash. Mr. Levey was formerly an under secretary at the Treasury Department who focused on terrorism and financial intelligence.
On Monday, the bank said it was promoting Robert W. Werner, who oversaw the group at the Treasury Department that enforces sanctions, to run a specially created division focused on anti-money laundering efforts.
Regulators have also vowed to improve. The Congressional hearings exposed weaknesses at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the national bank regulator. In 2010, the regulator found that HSBC had severe deficiencies in its anti-money laundering controls, including $60 trillion in transactions and 17,000 accounts flagged as potentially suspicious, activities that were not reviewed. Despite the findings, the regulator did not fine the bank.
During the hearings this summer, lawmakers assailed the regulator. At one point, Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, called the comptroller "a lap dog, not a watchdog."

HEADLINE: Understanding How Children Develop Empathy

BYLINE: PERRI KLASS, M.D.


HIGHLIGHT: How do children develop prosocial behavior - "voluntary behavior intended to benefit another" - and is there a way to encourage it? 

 BODY:
The mother was trying to hold the baby still, and I was pulling gently on the ear, angling for a better look at the infant's eardrum. The wriggling baby didn't like any of it, and her whimpering quickly turned to full-fledged wails.
Suddenly the baby's 3-year-old brother, an innocent bystander in no danger of having his own ears examined, began to wail as well, creating the kind of harmonic cacophony that makes passers-by wince in recognition. And the poor mother, her hands full, could only look over and reassure him: Your sister is O.K., don't worry, don't feel bad. 
But really, was that why the 3-year-old was crying? Was he tired and frustrated, scared by the noise, jealous of his mother's attention? Or was he, in fact, upset because his sister was upset - an early step toward empathy, sympathy, kindness and charity?
The capacity to notice the distress of others, and to be moved by it, can be a critical component of what is called prosocial behavior, actions that benefit others: individuals, groups or society as a whole. Psychologists, neurobiologists and even economists are increasingly interested in the overarching question of how and why we become our better selves.
How do children develop prosocial behavior, and is there in fact any way to encourage it? If you do, will you eventually get altruistic adults, the sort who buy shoes for a homeless man on a freezing night, or rush to lift a commuter pushed onto the subway tracks as the train nears?
Nancy Eisenberg, a professor of psychology at Arizona State University, is an expert on the development in children of prosocial behavior, "voluntary behavior intended to benefit another." Such behavior is often examined through the child's ability to perceive and react to someone else's distress. Attempts at concern and reassurance can be seen in children as young as 1.
Dr. Eisenberg draws a distinction between empathy and sympathy: "Empathy, at least the way I break it out, is experiencing the same emotion or highly similar emotion to what the other person is feeling," she said. "Sympathy is feeling concern or sorrow for the other person." While that may be based in part on empathy, she said, or on memory, "it's not feeling the same emotion."
By itself, intense empathy - really feeling someone else's pain - can backfire, causing so much personal distress that the end result is a desire to avoid the source of the pain, researchers have found. The ingredients of prosocial behavior, from kindness to philanthropy, are more complex and varied.
They include the ability to perceive others' distress, the sense of self that helps sort out your own identity and feelings, the regulatory skills that prevent distress so severe it turns to aversion, and the cognitive and emotional understanding of the value of helping.
Twin studies have suggested that there is some genetic component to prosocial tendencies. When reacting to an adult who is pretending to be distressed, for example, identical twins behave more like each other than do fraternal twins. And as children grow up, these early manifestations of sympathy and empathy become part of complex decision-making and personal morality.
"There is some degree of heritability," said Carolyn Zahn-Waxler, a senior research scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who has done some of these twin studies. But she notes that the effect is small: "There is no gene for empathy, there is no gene for altruism. What's heritable may be some personality characteristics."
Scott Huettel, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke, described two broad theories to explain prosocial behavior. One, he said, was essentially motivational: It feels good to help other people. Economists have also looked at the question of altruism, and have hypothesized about a "warm glow effect" to account for charitable giving.
Experimental studies have shown that the same brain region that is activated when people win money for themselves is active when they give to charity - that is, that there is a kind of neurologic "reward" built into the motivational system of the brain.
"Charitable giving can activate the same pleasure-reward centers, the dopaminergic centers, in the brain that are very closely tied to habit formation," said Bill Harbaugh, an economist at the University of Oregon who studies altruism. "This suggests it might be possible to foster the same sorts of habits for charitable giving you see with other sorts of habits."
The other theory of prosocial behavior, Dr. Huettel said, is based on social cognition - the recognition that other people have needs and goals. The two theories aren't mutually exclusive: Cognitive understanding accompanied by a motivational reward reinforces prosocial behavior.
But shaping prosocial behavior is a tricky business. For instance, certain financial incentives seem to deter prosocial impulses, a phenomenon called reward undermining, Dr. Huettel said.
Consider that in the United States, historically, blood donors could be paid, but not in Britain. And the British donated more blood. "When you give extrinsic motivations, they can supplant the intrinsic ones," he said.
What would the experts say about fostering prosocial behavior in children, from kindness on to charity?
Parental modeling is important, of course; sympathy and compassion should be part of children's experience long before they know the words.
"Explain how other people feel," Dr. Eisenberg said. "Reflect the child's feelings, but also point out, look, you hurt Johnny's feelings."
Don't offer material rewards for prosocial behavior, but do offer opportunities to do good - opportunities that the child will see as voluntary. And help children see themselves and frame their own behavior as generous, kind, helpful, as the mother in my exam room did.
Working with a child's temperament, taking advantage of an emerging sense of self and increasing cognitive understanding of the world and helped by the reward centers of the brain, parents can try to foster that warm glow and the worldview that goes with it. Empathy, sympathy, compassion, kindness and charity begin at home, and very early.

 Tweet of the Week 
@ValaAfshar
"we have Twitter, we're a social business" is like "we have an oven mitt, we're a gourmet restaurant"
 The Week's Bests 
 Ryan Derousseau compares your ability to innovate to "The Nutcracker": "I question why people really go to 'The Nutcracker.' Is it because of the choreography or because it has become a staple? Do they leave with enjoyment and excitement or leave with a 'Well, I can check that off my list'? I would argue the first portion should always be the goal, but the latter is reality. And it goes the same in business. Are people leaving your company or service with a 'Well, we got that done'? If so, it's not likely to lead to repeat business. Instead, make them thrilled for coming. Make them hunger for more help. Make them want to come back. Because until you're as old as 'The Nutcracker,' you will need repeat business to survive."
 Charles Fishman celebrates the recent insourcing boom: "Oil prices are three times what they were in 2000, making cargo-ship fuel much more expensive now than it was then. The natural-gas boom in the U.S. has dramatically lowered the cost for running something as energy-intensive as a factory here at home. (Natural gas now costs four times as much in Asia as it does in the U.S.) In dollars, wages in China are some five times what they were in 2000 - and they are expected to keep rising 18 percent a year. American unions are changing their priorities. ... U.S. labor productivity has continued its long march upward, meaning that labor costs have become a smaller and smaller proportion of the total cost of finished goods."

HEADLINE: The Next Big Thing in Motorcycles: Going Small

BYLINE: RONALD AHRENS


HIGHLIGHT: Fuel economy, nimbleness and low price are factors for the new target buyers, who are variously described as first-timers from Generation Y or veteran riders re-entering the market. 

 BODY:
LONG BEACH, Calif. - Boomers who were long the motorcycle industry's primary focus could be less important to product planners if the new, smaller bikes presented last weekend at the Progressive International Motorcycle Show are indeed the future.
Not that massive bikes like the 2013 Honda Gold Wing F6B, with its 1.8-liter engine and $19,999 price, along with several anniversary editions from Harley-Davidson, didn't make prominent debuts. But fuel economy and affordability were main topics here. 
It's all part of the resolve to draw new customers. Fuel economy, nimbleness and low price are factors for the new target buyers, who are variously described as first-timers from Generation Y or veteran riders re-entering the market. Up to 15 percent of the total are women, according to several manufacturers.
For this audience, Honda revealed three 2013 bikes that share a water-cooled, 500cc engine and 6-speed transmission. Antilock brakes are available on all three. Otherwise, they're as different as vanilla, strawberry and Rocky Road.
The CB500F is an eye-catching naked bike that excels in urban environments, while the CBR500R is aimed at those sporting riders moving up from the CBR250R. Both 500s are priced at $5,499 and go on sale in April.
"We're going back to the Honda roots," Scott Proffer, an American Honda product planner, said in an interview. "People want efficient transportation, they want high fuel mileage, and our motorcycles can do that."
Focus group studies have shown that variety will pay off, Mr. Proffer said. "We've discovered that, just like cellphones, customers want multiple styles, multiple colors, multiple types. By doing that we have, on the 500-series, three versions that appeal to three different customers."
The third member of the series is the CB500X. While again sharing the same powertrain, this bike stands taller than its siblings and has a large fairing and adjustable windshield. Range is greater because of the larger fuel tank.
While Honda says the CB500X offers more off-pavement capability than its standard, street-oriented tires will deliver, Honda will offer a wide range of accessories, and Proffer said he expected buyers to modify and adapt the bike after it goes on sale in July. The price has yet to be announced.
Following a similar path, Suzuki promoted its GW250, a sleek bike that's available only in black. Styling touches inspired by Suzuki's B-King, a naked bike introduced in 2008, include the sculpted nacelle that houses the headlamp and multifaceted reflector. Turn signals are deftly integrated into the front cowling. In sportbike fashion, the rear sweeps away to an LED taillamp. Satin finish side panels add distinctive accents.
With its bracingly bold stance, the GW250 gives Suzuki a more competitive product for entry-level buyers, especially in California where the brand has been absent in this market segment, said Derek Schoeberle, product marketing manager.
"They want something with a modern flavor," Mr. Schoeberle said. "They're not finding it."
Counterbalanced for smooth operation, the bike's water cooled 250cc engine is rated at 24 horsepower; peak output of 26 pound-feet of torque is produced at just 4,000 r.p.m., which should result in responsive performance in city riding and the ability to keep pace on brief highway jaunts. Fuel economy is expected to surpass 70 m.p.g. when the GW250 goes on sale in April. The price wasn't announced.
Meanwhile, Kawasaki, which a year ago directed the spotlight to the 210 horsepower Ninja ZX-14R hyperbike, this time featured the Ninja 300, a replacement for its popular Sunday sermon of a sportbike, the Ninja 250.
But for all the emphasis on efficiency, adventure also made a strong case in the form of the new BMW R1200GS. Adding water cooling for the 1.2-liter opposed twin's cylinder heads will help in meeting future emissions restrictions. But most usefully for today, the rated output increases to 125 horsepower. It has a continuously adjustable, electronically managed suspension.
The brand's worldwide best seller, with more than 170,000 units sold in 30 years, also is updated with an LED headlamp and five new computer-controlled riding modes: Rain, Road, Dynamic, Enduro and EnduroPro. Cruise control is added for the first time, the clutch is easier to operate, and the windshield adjusts more readily.

HEADLINE: Capitalism and the Kids

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: American society does a good job of capturing the benefits of well-reared children but has been less successful at spreading the costs, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Nancy Folbre is an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. She recently edited and contributed to "For Love and Money: Care Provision in the United States." 
Now that the birthrate in the United States has fallen below replacement level (by at least one measure), more journalists are reporting on the costs of children. The New York Times columnist Ross Douthat laments the "cultural decadence" of such economic considerations even as he acknowledges their relevance.
Cultural change - what Mr. Douthat refers to as modernity and others refer to as post-familialism - is surely a part of the story. But the growth of capitalism itself - the expansion of wage employment at the expense of family-based enterprise - accounts for most of the pressures driving a process of fertility decline that has been under way for more than 200 years. 
Public policies intended to buffer the impact of capitalist labor markets on family life are a central feature of our social history.
Capitalism is not the villain of some simple morality tale. It did not intrude into an idyllic world of reciprocity and commitment. The traditional family-based economy was based on distinctly patriarchal principles. Male heads of household wielded legal and economic power over their wives and children. More children meant more labor for the family enterprise.

The growth of wage employment gradually disrupted that patriarchal regime, giving women and youth more opportunities outside the home and more bargaining power within it. The growing demand for skilled labor helped induce a shift toward smaller families, with better-educated, more costly offspring. This shift began long before modern contraceptive technologies could be had.
Women mobilized a collective effort to demand the same rights that men enjoyed and gradually began to prevail against those who claimed that feminism would destroy family life. Both women's empowerment and fertility decline accelerated the process of capitalist development that had set them into motion.
But the very structure of a new system based on competitive labor markets imposed penalties on parents, who lost the ability to capture many of the potential economic benefits of their child-rearing efforts. Prolonged school attendance raised the age at which young people began to work and the search for jobs often took them away from home.
As more single men and women flooded into the labor market, willing to work for lower wages than those with children to support, working-class advocates began to insist on the need for a "family wage" sufficient to care for dependents. Early campaigns for minimum-wage legislation warned that, without it, working-class families would not be able to successfully raise the next generation.
The movement to provide old-age pensions (first on the state, then on the federal level) emphasized the benefits of taxing the younger generation as a whole to support the elderly rather than expecting parents to recoup expenses from their own children.
The expansion of public health and education services represented a form of social investment in which taxpayer investments in children would be repaid by the future revenues that a more productive labor force would generate.
Policies offering many parents tax deductions and credits, the protections of a social safety net and the right to unpaid leaves from employment all represent explicit efforts to revalorize family commitments.
In short, many programs of the so-called welfare state, often derogated by conservatives as undermining family life, have rather proved a substantial - if not always successful - source of support for child-rearing.
Unfortunately, we have socialized the benefits of child-rearing more thoroughly than we have socialized the costs, taxing the working-age population to provide benefits to the elderly through Social Security and Medicare but providing uneven and somewhat unpredictable public support to parents. Single mothers in particular remain far more susceptible to poverty in the United States than in similarly affluent countries.
As a result, public policies have had the effect of slowing but not halting fertility decline in the United States. The resulting aging of our population is contributing to both fiscal and political stress.
A more serious problem is our failure to adequately improve adequately improve our children's capabilities, cramping their hopes for upward mobility. In a report echoing the family-wage advocates of the early 1900s, Lisa Dodson and Randy Albelda document the negative impact of parents' low-wage employment on child outcomes.
Today, in an era of serious economic stress, in which the best promises of capitalism have been broken, low-income mothers and children are threatened with major cuts to public assistance. Yet conservatives staunchly defend the unprecedented riches of the top 1 percent, resisting even small increases in marginal tax rates.
Yes, Mr. Douthat, cultural decadence is definitely in evidence.

HEADLINE: Vast Land Deal Divides Detroit

BYLINE: LESLIE MACMILLAN


HIGHLIGHT: An entrepreneur proposes to buy 140 acres in the heart of Detroit and turn it into a farm, or at the very least, urban woodland. But some residents and planners see the initiative as a land grab. 

 BODY:
John Hantz says he has a dream: to purchase 140 acres of derelict land in the heart of Detroit and turn it into the world's "largest urban farm."
A Web site set up by Mr. Hantz, a wealthy entrepreneur, to advance his proposal says the farm would return the city "to its agrarian roots." The repurposed lots - cleared of blight and planted with roughly 15,000 hardwood trees - would establish an economic zone, raise property values and return vast tracts of abandoned land to the city tax rolls, according to Mike Score, the president of the venture, Hantz Farms. Ideally, the enterprise has signaled, it would eventually become a major source of local food.
In a city where entire blocks of foreclosed homes and crumbling buildings have been bulldozed, the proposal has drawn some support, notably from the mayor, Dave Bing, and some city council members. But the proposed sale has drawn objections from some residents and city officials who say it would amount to a land grab. 
"This is not the way to grow a vibrant city," said Kwame Kenyatta, a City Council member. "Just because we have vacant land doesn't mean we should turn Detroit into a farm." 
The council is set to vote on the proposal on Tuesday.

In a marathon session just before Thanksgiving, the council drew up a formal development agreement whereby the city would sell the land to Hantz Farms at slightly over 8 cents per square foot. In return, Hantz would demolish many derelict buildings, plant 15,000 hardwood trees over three years and then maintain the land at an estimated investment of $5 million. 
Saunteel Jenkins, a City Council member who favors the proposal, argues that the city needs to think in new ways. "Farming will be one of the many things that be part of Detroit's reinvention," said Ms. Jenkins, chairwoman of the council's Planning and Economic Development Committee. "The auto industry used to be our bread and butter, but now we have to diversify."
The plan, which has been in the works since 2009 in various forms, has stirred broad concern that cash-strapped Detroit may be throwing urban planning out the window in its desperation to unload vast tracts of abandoned land that have become city property. Opponents say the city should be pursuing a long-term vision based on careful study instead.
"The concept of large-scale commercial farming has not been vetted or test-driven in an urban area," said Lottie Spady of the East Michigan Environmental Action Council, an advocacy group. No one has analyzed the long-term environmental impacts of such a venture or determined how an agricultural operation will be regulated, she said.
Yet the concept of small-scale urban farms has gained traction in Detroit, with dozens sprouting across the city to fill a void of economic activity. Last June, Michigan State University pledged $1.5 million over the next three years to help Detroit farmers and hundreds of local organizations that now see urban agriculture as a way to feed a city that has been called a "food desert" with few supermarkets and green grocers.
This urban farming is largely unregulated. The City Council plans take up an agriculture ordinance in January that would permit the sale of produce from city farms and place no limit on the size their operations. If approved, the measure would still state authorization as well. 
The measure would allow Hantz Farms to harvest its trees, but even if it is not passed, Hantz would agree to move forward as a noncommercial initiative, Mr. Score said, because its priority is not to make money but to remove blight. "As a lifelong resident of the city, John Hantz would like to contribute to a better Detroit," he said.
Critics worry that Mr. Hantz may have other long-term ideas for the land. "We know he's not buying that land to mow the grass," said Charity Hicks of the Detroit Black Community Food Security Network. 
Ms. Hicks and other critics say they fear that the trees might be a "placeholder," and that when the three-year contract with the city expires, Mr. Hantz could develop the land, which abuts Detroit's Gold Coast, a riverfront area where high-end condos and commercial real estate. 
In the last few years, Detroit has witnessed "profound land speculation," Ms. Hicks said, with opening bids starting at $500 per house in foreclosure sales.
Detroit has lost 25 percent of its population over the last decade. With roughly 40 of the city's 139 square miles vacant, according to The Detroit Free Press, some argue that the city should take whatever help it can get.
But Mr. Kenyatta of the City Council said this is no reason to "throw out all the rules."
"It's like boxing," he said. "If a guy is down and he's on his knees, there are still rules to let him get up. He still gets a 10-count. Detroit may be down, but we still have to function as a civil society."

HEADLINE: U.S. Agricultural Research Is Faltering, Report Warns

BYLINE: STEPHANIE STROM


HIGHLIGHT: A presidential panel warns that research is not keeping pace with problems like climate change, water shortages and new pathogens. 

 BODY:
A blue-ribbon panel of scientific and technology advisers to President Obama warns that the nation risks losing its longstanding supremacy in food production because research in agriculture has not kept up with new challenges like climate change, depleted land and water resources and emerging pests, pathogens and invasive plants.
The president's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology, chaired by John P. Holdren, director of the White House office of science and technology policy, and Eric Lander, president of the Broad Institute of Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, urged a commitment of $700 million in additional money for new agricultural research -- but deployed in very different ways than the money that is currently doled out. 
"Our most important conclusion is that our nation's agricultural research enterprise is not prepared to meet the challenges that U.S. agriculture faces in the 21st century," the panel states in its report, which was issued on Friday. 
The report lays out seven challenges ranging from competition for water to the impacts of climate change and biofuels production on food yields. "The need to deal with these growing challenges in agriculture, including new pests and pathogens, controlling agriculture's environmental impact, health and nutritional concerns and international food security underscores the importance of agricultural research to the health, prosperity and security of the nation," they wrote.
But the panel found that federal money for agricultural research has, in real dollars, remained roughly the same for the last 30 years, according to the report, while financing for research in other areas of science and technology has risen strikingly.

Moreover, because so little of the money is awarded competitively, the report's authors concluded, it is not spurring innovation and is often duplicating research being done by private companies. Excluding recent research on biofuels production, less than $500 million per year is available for competitive grants in agriculture, the report said. That amounts to roughly 2 percent of the competitive funding from the National Institutes of Health and 6 percent of that from the National Science Foundation," the panel wrote. 
"One consequence of the small amount of competitive funding for agriculture research is the decline in training of new agriculture scientists and the hindered recruitment of a new generation of the best young scientists into this area," the study said.
The Department of Agriculture is the largest federal grantor of funds for agricultural research, but roughly 66 percent of what it distributes stays in-house to finance its own research units like the Agricultural Research Service and the Economic Research Service -- roughly double the amount that other federal agencies retain for research purposes.
Additionally, some of the research dollars that the department distributes through land grant universities is used for permanent faculty salaries, which the report found "could unintentionally dissuade researchers from the challenging work of performing at the cutting edge of science and ultimately producing novel, innovative research."
The bulk of research money is spent on a handful of commodity crops, particularly corn and soybeans, for which private companies enlist battalions of highly educated plant breeders, geneticists, laboratory technicians and other skilled workers in research and development.
The report also underscores how deeply agriculture meshes with energy, health, environmental and even national security issues. For instance, the panel noted that despite the nation's growing reliance on biofuels, little research has been done on the impact that droughts and other extreme weather might have on the nation's energy supply. 
It also noted the growth of interest in the role of food in human health and well-being, including growing problems like obesity and diabetes. "As part of the public investment in agricultural research, funding should be provided to explore how plant and animal products can be used or modified to respond to this crisis in nutrition and health by developing new varieties of food products and new approaches to food processing," the panel wrote.
The group also called for the proposed $700 million in new money for agricultural research to be distributed through a competitive process and that a portion be used to ensure that some of the nation's most talented graduate students and post-doctoral researchers take part.

HEADLINE: Quick Defense in Insider Trading Trial of 2 Hedge Fund Managers

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Defense lawyers for Anthony Chiasson, a co-founder of the now-defunct Level Global Investors, and Todd Newman, a former portfolio manager at Diamondback Capital Management, called just two witnesses before resting their case. The move will send the insider trading trial to the jury as soon as Tuesday. 

 BODY:
Defense lawyers for two former hedge fund managers called two witnesses before resting their case, a surprise decision that will send the insider trading trial to the jury as soon as Tuesday.
In one of the largest prosecutions by the government in its broad insider trading investigation, Anthony Chiasson, a co-founder of the now-defunct Level Global Investors, and Todd Newman, a former portfolio manager at Diamondback Capital Management, are on trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan on charges that they were part of a conspiracy that made about $68 million illegally trading technology stocks.
After more than three weeks of testimony, the prosecution rested, setting the stage for the defense to begin its bid to keep Mr. Chiasson and Mr. Newman out of prison. There was chatter that the defendants might testify in their own defense. 
But after Mr. Newman's lawyer called an F.B.I. agent to the stand for brief questioning about the government's investigation. A professor of finance and economics also opined on Mr. Newman's trading patterns before the defense rested. Judge Richard J. Sullivan, who is presiding over the trial, set closing arguments in the case for Tuesday.
The decision to not put on a substantive defense is a calculated risk aimed at signaling to the jury that the defense believes that prosecutors do not have a strong case.
"There is always a gamble because the jury most likely anticipates the defendants will put up a robust defense," said Jacob S. Frenkel, a former federal prosecutor. "But they always hammer away at the government's failure to meet its burden of proof."
The defense's legal team is led by Reid Weingarten of Steptoe & Johnson for Mr. Chiasson and Stephen Fishbein of Shearman & Sterling for Mr. Newman.
The trial of Mr. Chiasson and Mr. Newman is concluding amid renewed interest in the government's insider trading inquiry.
Last month, federal prosecutors charged a former portfolio manager at SAC Capital Advisors with illegal trading in the stocks of the two drug firms Elan and Wyeth, which allowed the fund to earn profits and avoid losses totaling $276 million. For the first time in an insider trading case, Steven A. Cohen, the billionaire founder of SAC, one of the largest hedge funds on Wall Street, is linked to the trades that prosecutors say were illegal. He has not been charged with wrongdoing.
Since 2009, Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, has secured 69 insider trading convictions against hedge fund traders, corporate executives and lawyers.
Juries have not been kind to the defendants. Most of the defendants have pleaded guilty. Of the nine who took their cases to trial, all have been convicted.
The government's case against Mr. Chiasson and Mr. Newman in part grew out of the F.B.I.'s raid in November 2010 of Level Global and Diamondback. About a year later, prosecutors charged Mr. Chiasson, Mr. Newman and six others with participating in a "tight-knit circle of greed" that earned illegal profits by trading in the technology companies Dell and Nvidia. Six of the eight have pleaded guilty, including Jon Horvath, a former analyst at SAC.
Both Level Global and Diamondback were founded by former employees of SAC. Level Global closed shortly after the F.B.I. raid. Diamondback announced last week that it was closing its doors.
The prosecution's case against Mr. Chiasson and Mr. Newman, which lasted about a month, was built around the testimony of two of the former traders who pleaded guilty: Spyridon Adondakis, who worked for Mr. Chiasson at Level Global, and Jesse Tortora, who was under Mr. Newman's direction at Diamondback.
Mr. Adondakis and Mr. Tortora each testified that they had received secret financial information about the computer company Dell and passed it along to their bosses. During opening statements and on cross-examination, the defense lawyers attacked the witnesses' credibility. They have depicted the witnesses as government cooperators who are scapegoating their bosses in the hopes of receiving a lenient sentence.
An earlier version of this article and its summary misstated the number of witnesses that defense lawyers had called before resting their case. The lawyers had called two witnesses, not one. The two were an F.B.I. agent and a finance professor who commented on Mr. Newman's trading patterns.

HEADLINE: Bailout Over, U.S. Treasury Plans to Sell A.I.G. Shares

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The government will sell its final holdings of the American International Group, the insurance giant it bailed out in 2008 - and at a profit. 

 BODY:
 9:01 p.m. | Updated 
Taxpayers will soon shed their last holdings in the American International Group, more than four years after a rescue by the federal government during the most chaotic days of the financial crisis.
The Treasury Department said on Monday that it planned to sell all of its remaining 234.2 million shares, or 15.9 percent of the company, in a public offering. At current prices, that would raise more than $7.8 billion.
The stock sale, if completed, would realize a goal few dreamed possible in September 2008. As Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, government officials scrambled to rescue A.I.G., an insurance giant that had become deeply intertwined with many Wall Street and European banks through its underwriting of credit-default swaps. The fear was that a collapse of the company could bring down the global financial system. 
In the crisis, the government ended up extending lifelines to a number of financial institutions and to companies like General Motors. But it was the bailout of A.I.G. that resonated most deeply among the American public as a symbol of risk-taking and excess on Wall Street - and Washington's complicity in it. At one point, the government had made more than $182 billion available to support A.I.G. Billions of that went to pay claims that the banks had on the insurer.
Public anger over the bailout prompted Congressional hearings, litigation, protests and widespread criticism from both the political left and the right.
Even Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve's chairman and one of the architects of the bailout, has said that the necessity of the plan made him angry. "We had no choice but to try to stabilize the system because of the implications that the failure would have had for the broad economic system," he told a Senate panel in 2009.
At the time, critics feared that the company would be forced into a fire sale of assets to repay those loans, a sale that would deeply shortchange taxpayers.
Instead, the federal government has said that it expects to walk away from A.I.G. with a profit - about $15.1 billion to date, by the Treasury Department's reckoning. That has followed both a steady stream of stock sales over the last two years and a resurgence in the insurer's core operations.
"It's gone way better than anyone expected in 2008 and 2009," said Linus Wilson, an assistant professor of finance at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. "People thought we'd put money down a dry hole and would never see it again."
While the Treasury Department did not outline a timetable for its latest stock offering, the sale is expected to be completed quickly.
A spokesman for A.I.G., Jon Diat, declined to comment on the government's plans, though he noted that the company did not plan to buy any of the Treasury Department's shares in the offering.
The bailout left the federal government with a roughly 92 percent stake in A.I.G., a level of ownership that did not bode well for a recovery by the company.
Yet under Robert H. Benmosche, a strong-willed insurance executive who came out of retirement to lead A.I.G. in 2009, the company embarked on a more measured sale of assets aimed at maximizing sale prices. Mr. Benmosche repeatedly proclaimed that he would not accept cut-rate prices for the company's assets, but stressed that under his watch, the insurer would become much more streamlined.
Shrinking the company to a more manageable size meant disassembling a disparate array of businesses built over decades by Maurice R. Greenberg, the former chief. Enormously valuable operations like the AIA Group and the American Life Insurance Company, two international life insurance units, were spun off or sold to raise cash.
Even that more measured approach drew criticism from Mr. Greenberg, who had repeatedly urged the government to devise a rescue plan that would keep his former company whole.
"Obviously it's a good thing that A.I.G. is out of the government's clutches," the former chief said in an interview on Monday. "But it's a different company now, and they had to sell off a great many treasures to do that."
That campaign of asset sales has continued until as recently as this past weekend, when A.I.G. agreed to sell a majority stake in its enormous aircraft-leasing arm to a group of Chinese buyers for roughly $4.2 billion.
The insurer has focused on improving its remaining insurance operations. The company has steadily reported rising annual profits under Mr. Benmosche's tenure, having earned $26.1 billion in the 12 months that ended Sept. 30.
Shares of the company have risen about 45 percent for the year to date.
Professor Wilson, who had criticized the government for not selling off its holdings in A.I.G. sooner, said on Monday that the Obama administration probably could have reaped a bigger profit. But he added that the rescue had achieved its main goal, while sparing taxpayers the pain of an ugly loss.
"I think it did stabilize the system," he said. "The people who were the architects of the plan can be very pleased."

HEADLINE: A Cooperative Approach on 'Too Big to Fail' Banks

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: Regulators in the United States and Britain are cooperating on measures that might be used to seize an ailing financial company with global business. 

 BODY:
It is one of the thorniest problems hanging over the financial system: how should authorities deal with the collapse of a sprawling global bank to protect the financial system at large?
In an attempt to find ways to address this problem, regulators in the United States and Britain said on Monday that they were cooperating on measures that would be used to seize an ailing financial company that does a lot of business abroad.
The intent is to avoid the problems that occurred when Lehman Brothers failed in 2008. The unwinding of Lehman was complicated by the fact that it had substantial operations in London that were subject to British law. The same problem could recur because most of the largest American and British banks have major subsidiaries in each other's countries. 
 In a new joint paper, the Bank of England and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation laid out their preferred strategy for handling such bank crashes.
"It's great that these two organizations are pushing forward on it," said Phillip L. Swagel, a professor at the University of Maryland's School of Public Policy, who was assistant secretary for economic policy under Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. "If they do get it right, then, yes, 'too big to fail' has ended."
"Too big to fail" is the label for the problem that confronts governments when a large bank is on its last legs. Officials want to avoid a future large taxpayer bailout of the bank, but letting it collapse could cause a run on the financial system. In 2008, Lehman was allowed to fail but American International Group was saved because its collapse was seen as too much for the system to bear.
Since the crisis, legislators in the United States and Britain have passed laws intended to give regulators ways to avoid either outcome. In essence, they aim to take control of the sick bank and keep it operating while inflicting losses on its shareholders and, if necessary, its creditors.
The paper from the Bank of England and the F.D.I.C. focused on one way to accomplish this. The relevant regulator would take control of the bank's parent company, then embark on a restructuring. By saying they are focusing on the parent company, regulators hope to shape expectations in the market and minimize destabilizing uncertainty when a bank implodes. This approach, "will give greater predictability for market participants about how resolution authorities may approach a resolution," the regulators wrote.
The strategy then aims to put a seized bank back on its feet. In most cases, the bank would be insolvent, meaning that losses had eaten all its equity. To right the bank, the regulator would take the parent company's debt and turn it into enough equity to support the bank's operations in the future.
But questions surround the strategy. The paper is little more than a commitment to cooperate. In other words, it does not give either regulator the power to reach into a foreign jurisdiction to restructure a bank. Some of the jurisdictional problems that hampered the Lehman bankruptcy could therefore recur.
Some analysts doubt regulators would use the tools in the heat of a crisis. Fearing financial instability, officials may balk at doing anything to harm the interests of creditors and opt for some form of bailout instead. "It's about the courage to use those tools in the face of a panic," said Mark A. Calabria, director of financial regulation studies at the Cato Institute.
Whether bank parent companies have the financial resources to contribute meaningfully to balance sheet repairs is also a question. JPMorgan Chase's parent company, for instance, has $116 billion of long-term debt, which is 5 percent of the overall bank's $2.3 trillion in assets. At Goldman Sachs, the percentage is much higher at 14 percent.
Regulators would have to decide on the appropriate amount of parent company debt. As a result, they might press some banks to strengthen the financial standing of their parent companies.
But banks may resist, saying that action would make it harder for them to produce reasonable returns. "They need to consider the burdens that would be placed on banks' ability to provide credit for the global economy," said David Schraa, regulatory counsel for the Institute of International Finance, an industry group.
Skeptics also say the measures laid out Monday may not be able to cope with the collapse of several large global banks at once. "The big problems we've seen are almost always systemic," said Simon Johnson, professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management. "So, does it solve the core of the too-big-too-fail problem? No."
Still, the American-British cooperation could, in theory, cover a large majority of foreign business done in the country's banks. The five biggest American banks on average did 88 percent of their foreign activity in Britain, according to an F.D.I.C. presentation in July. "By and large, the same is true for U.K. companies," Michael H. Krimminger, a partner with Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, wrote by e-mail. "This approach would have been invaluable in 2008," said Mr. Krimminger, whose previous job was general counsel at the F.D.I.C.

HEADLINE: A World of Corruption

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: An annual ranking of countries according to how corrupt they're perceived to be gives Denmark, Finland and New Zealand the highest marks. At the bottom: Somalia, North Korea and Afghanistan. The United States barely made the top 20, with China roughly in the middle. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - Corruption can be a somewhat elastic concept, whether it's an American homeowner slipping the cable guy $20 for free HBO or a Chinese police chief setting up his twin-sister mistresses in a free apartment. 
In Afghanistan, corruption certainly means the disappearance of $900 million from a bank that has been likened to a Ponzi scheme. In Zimbabwe, it could mean hospital nurses charging pregnant women $5 every time they scream in pain, as a kind of false-alarm fee. 
Cultural norms can make it difficult to determine which countries have the most honest or most corrupt public sectors, although the annual Corruption Perceptions Index from Transparency International makes for compelling (and sometimes disturbing) reading. The rankings are widely accepted and often referenced by scholars, journalists, business executives and government officials. 
In Transparency's newly published 2012 index, Denmark, Finland and New Zealand tied for first as the cleanest countries. Sweden and Singapore rounded out the top five on the list of 176 nations.
Australia ranked No. 7 over all, with Hong Kong 14th and Japan 17th. The United States was at No. 19, followed by France (22), Spain (30), Taiwan (37) and South Korea (45).
The United States, the report said, ranked lower than many other developed nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, confirming that "Americans believe there are continued transparency and corruption issues in local, state and national government institutions and processes."
China finished in 80th place on the index, a shade dirtier than Sri Lanka but cleaner than Thailand (88) and India (94). The Philippines, Vietnam and Indonesia didn't even make the top 100. 
"Corruption is rampant in this country," President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia told the Antara news agency on Monday. "It is a serious problem, and it hinders the country's development. We should not tolerate corruption. We should not allow corruption to be a part of our lives."
Five of the bottom seven on the Transparency index were Asian nations, including North Korea and Afghanistan, both of which tied for last with Somalia. Myanmar, wrestling with historic political and economic reforms, was at No. 172.
Xi Jinping, the newly installed head of the Chinese Communist Party, has already signaled that corruption will be one of the themes of his tenure. 
"A mass of facts tells us that if corruption becomes increasingly serious, it will inevitably doom the party and the state. We must be vigilant," Mr. Xi said in his first speech to the Politburo, as reported by Edward Wong of The New York Times. "In recent years, there have been cases of grave violations of disciplinary rules and laws within the party that have been extremely malign in nature and utterly destructive politically, shocking people to the core." 
Edward noted that Mr. Xi invoked a Chinese saying - "worms come only after matter decays" - to emphasize his point.
President Hu Jintao also warned about the pernicious effects of corruption in a speech at the landmark party congress last month. "If we fail to handle this issue well," Mr. Hu said, "it could prove fatal to the party, and even cause the collapse of the party and the fall of the state."
One of the first targets of Mr. Xi's anti-corruption drive - if it can actually be called that - apparently came last week with an investigation of Li Chuncheng, 56, a ranking party official in Sichuan Province. 
And on Sunday, a Public Security Bureau chief in northwest China was relieved of duty for "allegedly keeping a pair of twin sisters as mistresses,"according to Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency. 
Qi Fang, the police chief in Wusu, has been accused of renting "a high-end apartment unit for the sisters in downtown Wusu" and charging the rent as an official expense.
Elizabeth C. Economy, an expert on China and the director for Asia studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, writes that "Xi Jinping has one overriding political mandate: clean up corruption or clear out."
An excerpt from her piece on the Asia Unbound blog:
Corruption and its manifestations are at the heart of the Party's greatest challenges: its glaring lack of legitimacy; one hundred eighty thousand mass demonstrations annually by most recent count; and an outflow of money through corruption, crime, and tax evasion as high as $3.72 trillion over the past decade. Is Xi up to the task?
In the past five years alone, over six hundred thousand Party officials have been investigated for "corruption-related activities." The challenge here is two-fold: the number that should be investigated is probably closer to six million or even sixty million; and the traditional method of attack - simply plucking out corrupt officials one by one from on high - is woefully inadequate to the task at hand.

HEADLINE: Bailout Over, U.S. Treasury Plans to Sell A.I.G. Shares

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED. 
The DealBook column by Andrew Ross Sorkin, which normally appears on this page, will be published in a special DealBook section on Wednesday this week.

 BODY:
9:01 p.m. | Updated
Taxpayers will soon shed their last holdings in the American International Group, more than four years after a rescue by the federal government during the most chaotic days of the financial crisis.
The Treasury Department said on Monday that it planned to sell all of its remaining 234.2 million shares, or 15.9 percent of the company, in a public offering. At current prices, that would raise more than $7.8 billion.
The stock sale, if completed, would realize a goal few dreamed possible in September 2008. As Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, government officials scrambled to rescue A.I.G., an insurance giant that had become deeply intertwined with many Wall Street and European banks through its underwriting of credit-default swaps. The fear was that a collapse of the company could bring down the global financial system. 
In the crisis, the government ended up extending lifelines to a number of financial institutions and to companies like General Motors. But it was the bailout of A.I.G. that resonated most deeply among the American public as a symbol of risk-taking and excess on Wall Street - and Washington's complicity in it. At one point, the government had made more than $182 billion available to support A.I.G. Billions of that went to pay claims that the banks had on the insurer.
Public anger over the bailout prompted Congressional hearings, litigation, protests and widespread criticism from both the political left and the right.
Even Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve's chairman and one of the architects of the bailout, has said that the necessity of the plan made him angry. "We had no choice but to try to stabilize the system because of the implications that the failure would have had for the broad economic system," he told a Senate panel in 2009.
At the time, critics feared that the company would be forced into a fire sale of assets to repay those loans, a sale that would deeply shortchange taxpayers.
Instead, the federal government has said that it expects to walk away from A.I.G. with a profit - about $15.1 billion to date, by the Treasury Department's reckoning. That has followed both a steady stream of stock sales over the last two years and a resurgence in the insurer's core operations.
"It's gone way better than anyone expected in 2008 and 2009," said Linus Wilson, an assistant professor of finance at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. "People thought we'd put money down a dry hole and would never see it again."
While the Treasury Department did not outline a timetable for its latest stock offering, the sale is expected to be completed quickly.
A spokesman for A.I.G., Jon Diat, declined to comment on the government's plans, though he noted that the company did not plan to buy any of the Treasury Department's shares in the offering.
The bailout left the federal government with a roughly 92 percent stake in A.I.G., a level of ownership that did not bode well for a recovery by the company.
Yet under Robert H. Benmosche, a strong-willed insurance executive who came out of retirement to lead A.I.G. in 2009, the company embarked on a more measured sale of assets aimed at maximizing sale prices. Mr. Benmosche repeatedly proclaimed that he would not accept cut-rate prices for the company's assets, but stressed that under his watch, the insurer would become much more streamlined.
Shrinking the company to a more manageable size meant disassembling a disparate array of businesses built over decades by Maurice R. Greenberg, the former chief. Enormously valuable operations like the AIA Group and the American Life Insurance Company, two international life insurance units, were spun off or sold to raise cash.
Even that more measured approach drew criticism from Mr. Greenberg, who had repeatedly urged the government to devise a rescue plan that would keep his former company whole.
"Obviously it's a good thing that A.I.G. is out of the government's clutches," the former chief said in an interview on Monday. "But it's a different company now, and they had to sell off a great many treasures to do that."
That campaign of asset sales has continued until as recently as this past weekend, when A.I.G. agreed to sell a majority stake in its enormous aircraft-leasing arm to a group of Chinese buyers for roughly $4.2 billion.
The insurer has focused on improving its remaining insurance operations. The company has steadily reported rising annual profits under Mr. Benmosche's tenure, having earned $26.1 billion in the 12 months that ended Sept. 30.
Shares of the company have risen about 45 percent for the year to date.
Professor Wilson, who had criticized the government for not selling off its holdings in A.I.G. sooner, said on Monday that the Obama administration probably could have reaped a bigger profit. But he added that the rescue had achieved its main goal, while sparing taxpayers the pain of an ugly loss.
"I think it did stabilize the system," he said. "The people who were the architects of the plan can be very pleased."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Fallen Dean's Life, Contradictory to Its Grisly End

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM, WENDY RUDERMAN and MOSI SECRET; Kitty Bennett and Jeffrey E. Singer contributed reporting.

 BODY:
She sat in her regular beauty salon, strikingly optimistic, eyeing in the mirror not a defendant but a woman whose fortunes would surely turn the next day.
The evidence and testimony in Federal District Court in Brooklyn had quickly mounted against her, but Cecilia Chang was convinced that once she took the stand at her corruption trial, things would change.
''She was extremely happy,'' Eve Lin, her longtime hairdresser, recalled recently. ''She said: 'Tomorrow, I have a court case, and if they say I've done nothing wrong, then that's it. It's over.' ''
As it turned out, Dr. Chang's turn on the witness stand last month was disastrous. She was utterly unpersuasive. The jurors laughed. She won little sympathy. 
Dr. Chang, a dean at St. John's University in Queens, associated with a whirlwind of characters: Catholic priests, Chinese gangsters, American lawmakers, a Taiwanese general and a fantastically corrupt city politician, to name a few. She had been married three times. One husband, she had told several people, was involved in organized crime; another told the police before succumbing to gunshot wounds that she was behind the attack.
It was an unlikely lifestyle for anyone, let alone a dean at St. John's, where she helped attract millions of dollars in contributions to the university from her native Taiwan. But that life, prosecutors charged in state and federal indictments, was enabled by fraud and embezzlement. Federal prosecutors accused her of forcing foreign students to perform household labor in exchange for tuition grants, stealing over $1 million from the university and taking $250,000 from a Saudi prince to organize academic conferences that never happened.
Less than 24 hours after testifying, Dr. Chang killed herself -- an act of grisly determination. She started a fire in a bedroom fireplace and closed the flue. When death did not come quickly enough, she went downstairs to the kitchen and turned on the gas. For extra measure, she slit her wrists.
Stereo speaker wire was her final weapon of choice. She took a length of it back upstairs, lowered an attic ladder and hanged herself from it.
The descent from beauty-parlor optimism to suicide took less than two days. But even at her apex, Dr. Chang, 59, was a contradictory and complicated figure; a woman whose work got her name mentioned on the floor of the United States Senate in the early 1990s, and who was at the same time suspected by the police of having a role in the murder of her first husband -- the father of her only child.
Fund-Raising Juggernaut
Through much of the 1980s and '90s, Dr. Chang flew overseas chasing dollars for St. John's and its Institute for Asian Studies, cultivating relationships with dignitaries, lawmakers and the superrich. When she was in New York, she rode around town in a Mercedes sedan. Abroad, she stayed in the finest hotels.
She was petite. Elegant. Forceful.
''She could walk into a room and dominate a conversation,'' said Jonathan Derek, a former assistant of Dr. Chang's who attended dinners where Dr. Chang entertained potential donors. ''Just by being there, she was the center of attention.''
She made her home in Jamaica Estates, Queens, in a $1.7 million Tudor-style house with seven bedrooms, maid quarters, stone fireplaces and soaring ceilings with skylights.
Yet in many ways, Dr. Chang was a woman out of place.
As her legal troubles mounted in recent years, she found friendship among bartenders and casino bus drivers. She would curry favor by lending money to people from Chinese communities in Flushing and to fellow gamblers at the Foxwoods casino in Connecticut, where she was spending more and more time.
And to her embarrassment, she never learned to speak English fluently, writing that she felt isolated from her colleagues, like a ''money tree'' that was shaken but never nurtured.
She came to New York in 1975, enrolling in the St. John's master's program in Asian studies. For decades, the Asian studies department had been functioning as a diplomatic outpost for the nationalist government of Taiwan, an arrangement forged during the cold war: the Vincentians, the Catholic religious order who ran St. John's, were conservatives who allied with the nationalists in Taiwan against the Communists in China.
Taiwanese citizens, including Dr. Chang's mother, helped raise money to build Sun Yat Sen Hall, the Chinese pagoda on St. John's campus that became the Institute of Asian Studies. The Taiwanese government also sent hundreds of thousands of dollars every year to the university for its Asian studies program.
Dr. Chang was hired at St. John's not long after graduating from its master's program. Three years later, she was named a dean. A big part of her job was to keep the Taiwanese money flowing.
''She was perceived as an incredibly successful fund-raiser: she raised millions for St. John's, there is no doubt about that, and so she operated under a different set of rules,'' said Gregory C. Pavlides, the head of the economic crimes bureau in the Queens district attorney's office, who oversaw the investigation that led to a 205-count indictment. The state prosecution was delayed while the federal trial went forward.
St. John's officials could not explain her rapid ascent, but Dr. Chang suggested that the university president at the time, the Rev. Joseph T. Cahill, had preferred an inexperienced candidate who would allow him more control of the Taiwanese money.
''They do not want to have good reputable scholar,'' she wrote in memoir-style notes. ''S.J.U. only wanted me to be the dean,'' she added, because she was perceived as a ''money tree.''
''In Chinese, 'money tree' mean that a tree can grow money, and whoever shake it, the money will fall down,'' she wrote.
One of the ways in which she raised money for the university was by offering honorary degrees to people of wealth or influence, then soliciting donations. Two such honorees were Taiwanese industrialists who were later charged with multimillion-dollar frauds.
The university gave her complete control of about 20 full-tuition grants each year. Many of the grants went to students from Taiwan; others went to the children of her friends or associates, including one given in 2004 to the granddaughter of Frank H. Murkowski, a former senator and governor of Alaska.
Mr. Murkowski was among more than two dozen or so members of Congress who had visited Sun Yat Sen Hall, giving talks at the pro-Taiwan conferences organized by Dr. Chang.
Documents from Dr. Chang's files show how she leveraged relationships with powerful people like Mr. Murkowski.
In 2003, she apparently persuaded him to lobby the Taiwanese president, Chen Shui-bian, to continue financial support of the university. In her letter, she congratulated Mr. Murkowski, who was then governor, on his daughter's election to the Senate and offered them both honorary degrees, saying ''Only the world's most prominent personalities are eligible to receive an honorary degree from St. John's.''
Four years later, Dr. Chang asked him to enlist his daughter, Senator Lisa Murkowski, to write a letter supporting the immigration application of ''a St. John's honorary alumni chairman.'' Dr. Chang did not mention that the man, Wang You-Theng, a Taiwanese businessman then under investigation for embezzling millions of dollars, was a fugitive, and remains so today.
''Please let us know when the senator is having her next fund-raiser party so that we may participate in her support,'' she wrote. There was no indication that the senator wrote the letter.
Calls seeking comment from Senator Murkowski and her father were not returned.
Closer to home, she helped arrange trips to Taiwan for political delegations from Queens that included Donald Manes, the Queens borough president who committed suicide after his role in a far-reaching bribery scandal became public in 1986.
Sid Davidoff, a lawyer, lobbyist and longtime friend of Mr. Manes's, recalled that Dr. Chang served as the borough president's political liaison to the Asian community in Queens. Dr. Chang was so close to Mr. Manes that when she renovated her Queens mansion, she asked him to manage the project, according to a former university colleague of hers who was not willing to be named. There was speculation that some of Dr. Chang's business relationships extended into her personal life.
Indeed, in her handwritten notes, she wrote that she once had an intimate relationship with Father Cahill that included another woman employed by St. John's. In addition to the sexual liaisons, Dr. Chang wrote that Father Cahill took her to the racetrack and to Atlantic City, usually removing his clerical garb ''when we go out to play.''
Joseph Oliva, the general counsel for St. John's, noted that Dr. Chang never mentioned the alleged relationship with Father Cahill, who died in 2003, in her testimony nor in any of several discussions that they had had about her tenure at the university. ''The university conducted a search of its records and has not found any information to support this uncorroborated allegation,'' Mr. Oliva added.
An Unsolved Murder
Another jarring allegation would come from police investigators, who suspected her of having some role in the 1990 shooting death of her first husband, Ruey Fung Tsai, according to more than half a dozen law-enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case is open.
They provided the following account:
Mr. Tsai was shot in front of a warehouse in Bushwick, Brooklyn, by a man dressed all in white. Three bullets struck him in the shoulder and back, with two hitting internal organs. Mr. Tsai somehow stumbled inside, where the police found him sitting in a chair.
''I know the man, I do not know his name,'' Mr. Tsai said then. ''Cecilia Chang was the person that paid the guy to shoot me.''
Mr. Tsai was taken to Elmhurst Hospital, where detectives from the 83rd Precinct visited him the next day. Unable to speak, he wrote that his wife wanted him dead so she could control the hosiery business that they shared, instead of dividing up the property in divorce court. He died 11 days after the shooting.
The couple left a trail of their enmity in divorce papers, filed by Mr. Tsai in October 1986. The records detail their dispute over millions of dollars in business proceeds and properties; a bitter custody battle over their son, Steven, then a toddler; and violent fights that brought the police to their house in Jamaica Estates.
An investigative firm, F.T.I. Global Risk and Investigations, which the university hired to conduct a forensic examination of Dr. Chang's expense accounts and other records, referred its findings to the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, in April 2010 and strongly urged another investigation of Mr. Tsai's killing, on the theory that Dr. Chang had a role.
One investigator who sifted through her 80 boxes of files said that more than a third of it was relevant or contained incriminating evidence linking her to the homicide of her first husband, the attempted bribery of Taiwanese officials in 2003 and the almost routine fraud that was detailed in her expense accounts. The investigator spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about the case.
In 2001, she began spending more time at Foxwoods, where she found solace at the baccarat tables, drinking Hennessy at dinner and coffee at the high-stakes tables. A federal agent testified at her trial that Dr. Chang would call her office at St. John's from a casino suite and request bank withdrawals just shy of $10,000, the amount at which financial institutions must report a transaction to the government. The agent, Kenneth Hosey, said that students would come to Connecticut to deliver the money, and that she subsequently bought into casino games for the same amounts.
When a prosecutor asked her in court about the transactions, Dr. Chang said that they were intended to bring good fortune; the dollar amounts coincided with her lucky numbers: nine, eight and six. People at Foxwoods remembered that she lent as much as $30,000 to fellow gamblers, and that she favored a dubious wagering strategy: doubling her bet each time she lost.
In 2010, Dr. Chang was indicted in Queens. When she tried to use her house as bail collateral, Mr. Pavlides argued that the mortgage was paid off with a $300,000 check from her second husband, Danny Lau, whose own lawyer, Mr. Pavlides explained, admitted that the money came from criminal ties.
At the same time, a related federal investigation was moving toward an indictment. A plea deal to settle both cases was discussed: two to three years in state prison. She cycled through half a dozen lawyers who all advised her to accept, but Dr. Chang refused.
At the federal trial, her lawyers, Alan M. Abramson, Joel S. Cohen and Stephen R. Mahler, sought to portray her as a pawn of St. John's, and suggested the only money she took from the university was to recover some of her unpaid fund-raising expenses.
''If you spoke to her, she sincerely believed that this was owed to her and she had not done a thing wrong,'' Mr. Mahler said.
Prosecutors offered evidence to the contrary. Mr. Oliva, the university's general counsel, testified that St. John's had reimbursed Dr. Chang for $350,000 in purported business expenses a year, more than any other employee, and about 10 percent of business expenses for the entire university. Mr. Oliva found that many of those expenses went toward cash advances at casinos, lavish dinners, skiing and surfing trips for her son, and even subscriptions to dating Web sites.
Dr. Chang used donor money to pay $20,300 toward her son's law school tuition and to buy him a car, prosecutors said. The university even paid for veterinary bills for her son's small dog, which once bit a graduate student so severely that she required hospital treatment, the student testified.
Other students who worked as chauffeurs and housekeepers for Dr. Chang in Queens testified that she had made them wash her underwear and cook for Steven, who was known to lose his temper when the food was not to his liking.
Dr. Chang contended that St. John's gave her credit cards to spend money that she had raised in Taiwan and Hong Kong. She accused Father Cahill and the university's current president, the Rev. Donald J. Harrington, of using her to ''create money for them for their personal gain.''
At trial, Father Harrington acknowledged that he had accompanied Dr. Chang on several trips to Asia, staying at the most expensive hotels and accepting gifts like a Patek Philippe watch and custom suits at Sam's Tailor and Modestos in Hong Kong.
He explained that Dr. Chang had convinced him that it was customary in Chinese culture to give gifts and impolite to refuse them.
''I knew that every member of the delegation was a recipient of gifts,'' Father Harrington testified.
Feeling Abandoned
For most of the trial, Dr. Chang seemed optimistic, smiling often. By then, she was already considering suicide, court documents show.
In September, her lawyers filed a letter under seal informing the judge, Sterling Johnson Jr., that one of the guarantors of Dr. Chang's bond asked to be removed because Dr. Chang mentioned that she was contemplating suicide. The letter raised concerns about Dr. Chang's drinking, noting that she frequently came to meetings with Poland Spring water bottles filled with vodka.
The lawyers asked that Dr. Chang undergo a detoxification treatment and be admitted to an inpatient substance-abuse program. A judge who later considered the matter instead ordered her to the federal jail. She was released a week later under the condition that she remain under house arrest and submit to daily alcohol testing.
Dr. Chang wrote of her love for her son in her suicide note, and expressed bitterness toward St. John's for abandoning her. ''She made repeated references to the fact that she worked there for 30 years,'' a law-enforcement official said.
In death, on her bathroom floor, Dr. Chang's face looked as if she were napping before her morning-court appearance. She wore a silky floral blouse paired with a black jacket. Her hair was neatly coifed. Her lipstick and rouge looked freshly applied, not at all smudged. There was barely a hint of anything askew, save for the shiny wire coiled around her throat like a necklace.

HEADLINE: Nonprofit Agency Agrees to More Openness

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration's main agency for economic development has pledged to make its operations more transparent, thanks to a new agreement with the city comptroller, John C. Liu. 
Mr. Liu, a Democrat, has long criticized the Economic Development Corporation for not disclosing more information about its finances and contracts. And in July, the attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, found that the corporation, a nonprofit organization whose president is appointed by the mayor, improperly ''played a behind-the-scenes role in the lobbying activities'' of two local groups that promoted the mayor's efforts to spur growth in Willets Point in Queens and Coney Island in Brooklyn.
But this time, Mr. Liu used the occasion of the corporation's annual contract renewal, which must be approved by his office, as an opportunity to demand additional reforms. So in the $896 million contract, signed late Friday, the corporation pledged to make some financial information that is already in the public domain more accessible.
Among other pledges, the corporation, which offers financing, tax exemptions and other development programs, is expected to publish its capital and budget expenses on the comptroller's Web site, Checkbook NYC. The corporation must also detail how companies that have received contracts from the corporation have lived up to job-creation promises -- and how they may be penalized, if they have failed.
''After years of operating in the shadows, the E.D.C.'s books have finally been cracked open,'' Mr. Liu said. ''These new measures will ensure that E.D.C. focuses on its mission of boosting employment. If they still can't get their act together, then they should close up shop and stop wasting taxpayer dollars.''
In the past, the agency has routinely, and vigorously, disputed Mr. Liu's criticisms. In one instance, the corporation accused Mr. Liu -- who is expected to run for mayor next year, despite a federal investigation into his campaign finances -- of trying ''to sensationalize the record.''
But on Monday, the corporation suggested in a statement that the new contract, in contrast to previous dealings, had been reached in a more amicable fashion.
''Mayor Bloomberg has brought more openness to all areas of city government than anyone else,'' Benjamin Branham, a spokesman for the corporation, said. ''E.D.C. is pleased to work with the comptroller to provide additional transparency to its operations so that New Yorkers can better understand the resources being committed to increase economic development and job creation throughout the five boroughs.''

HEADLINE: A Cooperative Approach On 'Too Big to Fail' Banks

BYLINE: By PETER EAVIS

 BODY:
It is one of the thorniest problems hanging over the financial system: how should authorities deal with the collapse of a sprawling global bank to protect the financial system at large?
In an attempt to find ways to address this problem, regulators in the United States and Britain said on Monday that they were cooperating on measures that would be used to seize an ailing financial company that does a lot of business abroad.
The intent is to avoid the problems that occurred when Lehman Brothers failed in 2008. The unwinding of Lehman was complicated by the fact that it had substantial operations in London that were subject to British law. The same problem could recur because most of the largest American and British banks have major subsidiaries in each other's countries. 
In a new joint paper, the Bank of England and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation laid out their preferred strategy for handling such bank crashes.
"It's great that these two organizations are pushing forward on it," said Phillip L. Swagel, a professor at the University of Maryland's School of Public Policy, who was assistant secretary for economic policy under Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. "If they do get it right, then, yes, 'too big to fail' has ended."
"Too big to fail" is the label for the problem that confronts governments when a large bank is on its last legs. Officials want to avoid a future large taxpayer bailout of the bank, but letting it collapse could cause a run on the financial system. In 2008, Lehman was allowed to fail but American International Group was saved because its collapse was seen as too much for the system to bear.
Since the crisis, legislators in the United States and Britain have passed laws intended to give regulators ways to avoid either outcome. In essence, they aim to take control of the sick bank and keep it operating while inflicting losses on its shareholders and, if necessary, its creditors.
The paper from the Bank of England and the F.D.I.C. focused on one way to accomplish this. The relevant regulator would take control of the bank's parent company, then embark on a restructuring. By saying they are focusing on the parent company, regulators hope to shape expectations in the market and minimize destabilizing uncertainty when a bank implodes. This approach, "will give greater predictability for market participants about how resolution authorities may approach a resolution," the regulators wrote.
The strategy then aims to put a seized bank back on its feet. In most cases, the bank would be insolvent, meaning that losses had eaten all its equity. To right the bank, the regulator would take the parent company's debt and turn it into enough equity to support the bank's operations in the future.
But questions surround the strategy. The paper is little more than a commitment to cooperate. In other words, it does not give either regulator the power to reach into a foreign jurisdiction to restructure a bank. Some of the jurisdictional problems that hampered the Lehman bankruptcy could therefore recur.
Some analysts doubt regulators would use the tools in the heat of a crisis. Fearing financial instability, officials may balk at doing anything to harm the interests of creditors and opt for some form of bailout instead. "It's about the courage to use those tools in the face of a panic," said Mark A. Calabria, director of financial regulation studies at the Cato Institute.
Whether bank parent companies have the financial resources to contribute meaningfully to balance sheet repairs is also a question. JPMorgan Chase's parent company, for instance, has $116 billion of long-term debt, which is 5 percent of the overall bank's $2.3 trillion in assets. At Goldman Sachs, the percentage is much higher at 14 percent.
Regulators would have to decide on the appropriate amount of parent company debt. As a result, they might press some banks to strengthen the financial standing of their parent companies.
But banks may resist, saying that action would make it harder for them to produce reasonable returns. "They need to consider the burdens that would be placed on banks' ability to provide credit for the global economy," said David Schraa, regulatory counsel for the Institute of International Finance, an industry group.
Skeptics also say the measures laid out Monday may not be able to cope with the collapse of several large global banks at once. "The big problems we've seen are almost always systemic," said Simon Johnson, professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management. "So, does it solve the core of the too-big-too-fail problem? No."
Still, the American-British cooperation could, in theory, cover a large majority of foreign business done in the country's banks. The five biggest American banks on average did 88 percent of their foreign activity in Britain, according to an F.D.I.C. presentation in July. "By and large, the same is true for U.K. companies," Michael H. Krimminger, a partner with Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, wrote by e-mail. "This approach would have been invaluable in 2008," said Mr. Krimminger, whose previous job was general counsel at the F.D.I.C.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: James D. Hodgson, 96, Labor Secretary and Ambassador

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
James D. Hodgson, who as President Richard M. Nixon's secretary of labor in the early 1970s promoted jobs for minority workers in the building trades and safer American workplaces, died on Nov. 28 at his home in Malibu, Calif. He was 96.
In a message to colleagues, Labor Secretary Hilda L. Solis said his family announced the death on Monday. 
Mr. Hodgson (pronounced HOD-sun) was later the ambassador to Japan in the Ford administration, but for most of his career he was a behind-the-scenes negotiator for the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, hammering out labor contracts in the 1950s and '60s.
After landing in Washington as the deputy to Labor Secretary George P. Shultz in 1969, he remained all but unknown, even to organized labor, as he quietly ran the department's day-to-day affairs for more than a year.
But when Mr. Shultz became White House budget director in July 1970, Mr. Hodgson was thrust into the spotlight, and for the next two and a half years he was an important figure in the administration's political and legislative fights in Congress on labor issues.
Early in his tenure, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 became law, greatly expanding the Labor Department's regulatory responsibilities and its authority to oversee federal and state compliance efforts. Toxic substances, dangerous machinery and a host of electrical, chemical and fire hazards were widespread at work sites, and Mr. Hodgson began the daunting tasks of identifying and policing them.
He also undertook a campaign to promote an early affirmative-action initiative, called the Philadelphia Plan for its city of origin. The effort set goals and timetables for major contractors doing business with the government to hire more black plumbers, electricians, ironmongers and other workers in the building trades. Many unions opposed the plan, which had limited success.
At a time of inflation and rising unemployment, strikes were mounted by longshoremen and farm workers in California, autoworkers in Ohio, teachers in Philadelphia, police officers in New York City and even Major League Baseball players, who in 1972 staged the first walkout in their history. Mr. Hodgson urged Congress to ban national transportation strikes and other walkouts that might severely affect the nation. But, conforming to administration policy, he sidestepped direct involvement in labor disputes.
Mr. Hodgson's relations with labor in general and with George Meany, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., were cool at best. Mr. Hodgson stepped down in February 1973, early in Nixon's abortive second term, and was replaced by Peter J. Brennan, a construction trades union leader who had been a major Nixon political supporter.
In June 1974, Nixon's nomination of Mr. Hodgson to be ambassador to Japan was approved by the Senate. Less than two months later, Nixon resigned in the Watergate scandal, and Mr. Hodgson served in Tokyo for the next three years under President Gerald R. Ford.
Three decades after American atomic bombs destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki to end World War II, Japan had largely been rebuilt and Washington and Tokyo had settled on a security treaty, the status of Okinawa, and trade and monetary issues. Although it was a relatively quiet period in Japanese-American relations, Mr. Hodgson was generally given high marks as ambassador.
James Day Hodgson was born on Dec. 3, 1915, in Dawson, Minn., to Fred Hodgson and the former Casaraha Day. His father owned a chain of lumber yards. James attended public schools in Dawson and studied sociology and anthropology at the University of Minnesota, graduating in 1938. He was a supervisor for a state youth employment program for two years, and in 1941 joined Lockheed in Burbank, Calif., as a personnel clerk.
In 1943, he married Maria Denend, who survives him. A son, Frederic, and a daughter, Nancy Nachman, are also among his survivors.
Mr. Hodgson joined the Navy in 1943, rose to lieutenant and became an intelligence officer in the Pacific during World War II. He was discharged in 1946 and returned to Lockheed to work in personnel and labor relations.
He participated in periodic contract negotiations with Lockheed's 100,000 employees and later with the International Association of Machinists, which represented aerospace workers. Union leaders regarded him as tough but fair-minded. He became vice president of industrial relations in 1968.
Lockheed, which built many of America's most famous wartime and postwar aircraft, was one of the first big corporations to recruit and train black and Hispanic workers in the early 1960s. Mr. Hodgson promoted that program and a company plan that chipped in 50 cents for every dollar that workers invested in stocks or savings.
In the 1960s, he was a consultant to the City of Los Angeles and the State of California on automation and staffing problems, and taught classes at the University of California, Los Angeles. With Marshall H. Brenner, he wrote ''Successful Experience: Training Hard-Core Unemployed,'' a 1968 article in The Harvard Business Review.
After returning from his ambassadorship in Japan, Mr. Hodgson was chairman of the Pathfinder Mines Corporation, a uranium mining company, from 1977 to 1982, and served on other corporate boards as well. He also taught at Harvard, Stanford and other universities. He was the author of ''American Senryu'' (1992), a collection of short poems similar to haiku, and with Yoshihiro Sano and John L. Graham wrote ''Doing Business With the New Japan'' (2000).

HEADLINE: U.S. and U.K. Propose Plan to Deal With Bank Failures

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
LONDON -- Regulators in the United States and Britain introduced a plan on Monday for averting threats to financial stability when large, cross-border financial institutions fail.
The plan, devised by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Bank of England, would allow the regulators to fire executives, force shareholders to take losses and move a company's operations into full private ownership without taxpayer support. 
The steps are intended to minimize costs for taxpayers and limit the risk that the troubles would spread, the regulators said.
''These strategies have been designed to enable large, complex cross-border firms to be resolved without threatening financial stability and without putting public funds at risk,'' the F.D.I.C. and the Bank of England said in a joint paper published on the British central bank's Web site. ''To be successful, such an approach will require close cooperation between home and foreign authorities.''
Ever since the financial crisis that began in 2007, national regulators have been working together to find ways to allow large financial institutions to fail in an orderly manner rather than forcing the respective governments to bail them out at huge costs.
At a time when the business of large financial institutions reach across borders, one of the central questions considered by the regulators was how to avoid the failure of a bank in one country spreading to another. Another question centered on how best to limit the disruption to healthy subsidiaries of a failing institution.
The strategy for large financial firms that are failing ''should assign losses to shareholders and unsecured creditors, and hold management responsible for the failure of the firm,'' the two regulators said in the paper.
''The unsecured debt holders can expect that their claims would be written down to reflect any losses that shareholders cannot cover, with some converted partly into equity in order to provide sufficient capital'' for the sound parts of the firm, according to the paper.
The paper affects the world's 28 so-called systematically important financial institutions, 12 of them based in the United States or Britain, Martin Gruenberg, the F.D.I.C. chairman, and Paul Tucker, deputy governor for financial stability at the Bank of England, wrote in The Financial Times on Monday.
''Because many of these institutions have operations that are concentrated in our two jurisdictions, we have a shared interest in ensuring that, when such a business fails, it can be resolved at no cost to taxpayers and without placing the financial system at risk,'' they wrote.
The United States and Britain had to bail out some of their financial institutions as a result of the financial crisis. The countries have since worked on separate but similar new rules for their banking sectors.
''Developing an effective strategy for the orderly failure of a systemic financial institution could hardly be more important,'' Mr. Gruenberg and Mr. Tucker wrote in The Financial Times. ''The joint paper marks a significant step in that endeavor.''

HEADLINE: China Reports a 2.9% Rise in Exports for November

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Exports from China edged up 2.9 percent in November, far less than analysts had expected, highlighting the crucial role that homegrown stimulus and reforms will play in the renewal of China's acceleration while the trajectory of global demand remains highly uncertain. 
After slowing sharply this year, the Chinese economy began to bottom out in September, but then perked up again. Data released Sunday reinforced the view that China would most likely avoid a sudden, sharp slowdown -- a so-called hard landing -- at least for now. Industrial production grew 10.1 percent and retail sales grew 14.9 percent in November from a year earlier. Both figures were higher than those recorded in October, showing that the modest rebound of the last few months had continued to gain traction.
The modest recent acceleration has been widely attributed to a combination of stronger demand for exports and the effect of intensified stimulus efforts from Beijing in recent months.
Trade data released by the Customs Department on Monday, however, served as a reminder that the trade element of the recovery remained highly vulnerable to the persistent economic turmoil that is gripping many parts of the developed world.
The 2.9 percent year-over-year expansion in exports fell far short of the average of 9 percent that economists surveyed by Reuters had expected. It also represented a sharp slowdown from 11.6 percent in October and 9.9 percent in September. Imports were flat from a year earlier.
Together, the data from Sunday and Monday painted a picture of a recovery that is solidifying, but that nonetheless faces considerable challenges.
With exports likely to grow an anemic 5 percent next year, China's recovery ''will be driven by domestic activity,'' Zhiwei Zhang, China economist at Nomura, said in a call with news media on Monday.
The prospect of tax increases and spending cuts in the United States, and the continuing debt crisis in Europe, have long been flagged by economists as significant risk factors for recovery in countries like China, which derive a large part of their growth from selling goods to the United States and Europe.
Weak demand from the world's largest developed economies -- the United States, Europe and Japan -- was the main reason for the weakness in Chinese exports in November. Shipments to the United States slipped 2.6 percent and those to Japan by 3.8 percent, while exports to the European Union plummeted 18 percent.
''Without the strengthening of the two key Western markets, the sustainability of the exports sector's rebound is questionable,'' Xianfang Ren, a China economist at IHS Global Insight in Beijing, said in a research note. ''The extremely weak exports data have thrown in one more piece of evidence about the fragility of the recovery.''

HEADLINE: Study Predicts Future for U.S. as No. 2 Economy, but Energy Independent

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A new intelligence assessment of global trends projects that China will outstrip the United States as the leading economic power before 2030, but that America will remain an indispensable world leader, bolstered in part by an era of energy independence.
Russia's clout will wane, as will the economic strength of other countries reliant on oil for revenues, the assessment says. 
''There will not be any hegemonic power,'' the 166-page report says. ''Power will shift to networks and coalitions in a multipolar world.''
The product of four years of intelligence-gathering and analysis, the study, by the National Intelligence Council, presents grounds for optimism and pessimism in nearly equal measure. The council reports to the director of national intelligence and has responsibilities for long-term strategic analysis.
One remarkable development it anticipates is a spreading affluence that leads to a larger global middle class that is better educated and has wider access to health care and communications technologies like the Internet and smartphones. ''The growth of the global middle class constitutes a tectonic shift,'' the study says, adding that billions of people will gain new individual power as they climb out of poverty. ''For the first time, a majority of the world's population will not be impoverished, and the middle classes will be the most important social and economic sector in the vast majority of countries around the world.''
At the same time, it warns, half of the world's population will probably be living in areas that suffer from severe shortages of fresh water, meaning that management of natural resources will be a crucial component of global national security efforts.
The study also warns of the risk that terrorists could mount a computer-network attack in which the casualties would be measured not by the hundreds or thousands killed but by the millions severely affected by damaged infrastructure, like electrical grids being taken down.
At least 15 countries are ''at high risk of state failure'' by 2030, the report predicts, among them Afghanistan and Pakistan, but also Burundi, Rwanda, Somalia, Uganda and Yemen.
The study acknowledges that the future ''is malleable,'' and it lists important ''game changers'' that will most influence the global scene through 2030: a crisis-prone world economy, shortcomings in governance, conflicts within states and between them, the impact of new technologies and whether the United States can ''work with new partners to reinvent the international system.''
The best-case situation for global security until 2030, according to the study, would be a growing political partnership between the United States and China. But it could take a crisis to bring Washington and Beijing together -- something like a nuclear standoff between India and Pakistan resolved only by bold cooperation between the United States and China.
The worst-case situation envisions a stalling of economic globalization that would preclude advancement of financial well-being around the world. That would be a likely outcome after an outbreak of a health pandemic that, even if short-lived, would result in closed borders and economic isolationism.
The chief author and manager of the project, Mathew Burrows, who is counselor for the National Intelligence Council, said the findings had been presented in advance in more than 20 nations to groups of academic experts, business leaders and government officials, including local intelligence officers.
In an interview, Mr. Burrows noted that the audiences in China were far more accepting of the American intelligence assessments -- both those predicting China's economic ascendancy and those warning of political dangers if there was no reform of governance in Beijing -- than were audiences in Russia.
To assess the validity of this study, the research and analysis team graded its past work on global trends, an effort undertaken every four years since 1996. Past studies, it found, underestimated the speed with which changes arrived on the global scene.
Concerns were raised that past reports may have suffered ''blind spots and biases.'' And while grand ''isms'' like fascism and communism might not be on the horizon, this study noted, previous assessments should have paid greater attention to ideology.
The risk of conflict within a state -- like a civil war or an insurgency -- is expected to decline in Latin America, but will remain high in sub-Saharan Africa, in parts of the Middle East and South Asia, and in some Asia-Pacific island hot spots, the study warns.
''A more fragmented international system increases the risks'' of conflict between states, the study says. ''Additionally, increased resource competition, spread of lethal technologies and spillover from regional conflicts increase the potential for interstate conflicts.''
Most worrisome -- and already a part of the global security dynamic -- is an assessment that future wars in Asia and the Middle East could include nuclear weapons.
Other important demographic trends will be aging populations in Europe, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, which could slow their economies further. The report warns that Russia's economy will join those places in experiencing ''slow relative declines.'' The United States will benefit from its domestic oil and natural gas supplies and new technologies to tap them, allowing the nation to become energy independent and even a net exporter of fuel.
In general, it found, ''the health of the global economy increasingly will be linked to how well the developing world does -- more so than the traditional West.''
In addition to China, the developing nations that ''will become especially important to the global economy'' include Brazil, Colombia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, South Africa and Turkey.

HEADLINE: Understanding How Children Develop Empathy

BYLINE: By PERRI KLASS, M.D.

 BODY:
The mother was trying to hold the baby still, and I was pulling gently on the ear, angling for a better look at the infant's eardrum. The wriggling baby didn't like any of it, and her whimpering quickly turned to full-fledged wails.
Suddenly the baby's 3-year-old brother, an innocent bystander in no danger of having his own ears examined, began to wail as well, creating the kind of harmonic cacophony that makes passers-by wince in recognition. And the poor mother, her hands full, could only look over and reassure him: Your sister is O.K., don't worry, don't feel bad. 
But really, was that why the 3-year-old was crying? Was he tired and frustrated, scared by the noise, jealous of his mother's attention? Or was he, in fact, upset because his sister was upset - an early step toward empathy, sympathy, kindness and charity?
The capacity to notice the distress of others, and to be moved by it, can be a critical component of what is called prosocial behavior, actions that benefit others: individuals, groups or society as a whole. Psychologists, neurobiologists and even economists are increasingly interested in the overarching question of how and why we become our better selves.
How do children develop prosocial behavior, and is there in fact any way to encourage it? If you do, will you eventually get altruistic adults, the sort who buy shoes for a homeless man on a freezing night, or rush to lift a commuter pushed onto the subway tracks as the train nears?
Nancy Eisenberg, a professor of psychology at Arizona State University, is an expert on the development in children of prosocial behavior, "voluntary behavior intended to benefit another." Such behavior is often examined through the child's ability to perceive and react to someone else's distress. Attempts at concern and reassurance can be seen in children as young as 1.
Dr. Eisenberg draws a distinction between empathy and sympathy: "Empathy, at least the way I break it out, is experiencing the same emotion or highly similar emotion to what the other person is feeling," she said. "Sympathy is feeling concern or sorrow for the other person." While that may be based in part on empathy, she said, or on memory, "it's not feeling the same emotion."
By itself, intense empathy - really feeling someone else's pain - can backfire, causing so much personal distress that the end result is a desire to avoid the source of the pain, researchers have found. The ingredients of prosocial behavior, from kindness to philanthropy, are more complex and varied.
They include the ability to perceive others' distress, the sense of self that helps sort out your own identity and feelings, the regulatory skills that prevent distress so severe it turns to aversion, and the cognitive and emotional understanding of the value of helping.
Twin studies have suggested that there is some genetic component to prosocial tendencies. When reacting to an adult who is pretending to be distressed, for example, identical twins behave more like each other than do fraternal twins. And as children grow up, these early manifestations of sympathy and empathy become part of complex decision-making and personal morality.
"There is some degree of heritability," said Carolyn Zahn-Waxler, a senior research scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who has done some of these twin studies. But she notes that the effect is small: "There is no gene for empathy, there is no gene for altruism. What's heritable may be some personality characteristics."
Scott Huettel, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke, described two broad theories to explain prosocial behavior. One, he said, was essentially motivational: It feels good to help other people. Economists have also looked at the question of altruism, and have hypothesized about a "warm glow effect" to account for charitable giving.
Experimental studies have shown that the same brain region that is activated when people win money for themselves is active when they give to charity - that is, that there is a kind of neurologic "reward" built into the motivational system of the brain.
"Charitable giving can activate the same pleasure-reward centers, the dopaminergic centers, in the brain that are very closely tied to habit formation," said Bill Harbaugh, an economist at the University of Oregon who studies altruism. "This suggests it might be possible to foster the same sorts of habits for charitable giving you see with other sorts of habits."
The other theory of prosocial behavior, Dr. Huettel said, is based on social cognition - the recognition that other people have needs and goals. The two theories aren't mutually exclusive: Cognitive understanding accompanied by a motivational reward reinforces prosocial behavior.
But shaping prosocial behavior is a tricky business. For instance, certain financial incentives seem to deter prosocial impulses, a phenomenon called reward undermining, Dr. Huettel said.
Consider that in the United States, historically, blood donors could be paid, but not in Britain. And the British donated more blood. "When you give extrinsic motivations, they can supplant the intrinsic ones," he said.
What would the experts say about fostering prosocial behavior in children, from kindness on to charity?
Parental modeling is important, of course; sympathy and compassion should be part of children's experience long before they know the words.
"Explain how other people feel," Dr. Eisenberg said. "Reflect the child's feelings, but also point out, look, you hurt Johnny's feelings."
Don't offer material rewards for prosocial behavior, but do offer opportunities to do good - opportunities that the child will see as voluntary. And help children see themselves and frame their own behavior as generous, kind, helpful, as the mother in my exam room did.
Working with a child's temperament, taking advantage of an emerging sense of self and increasing cognitive understanding of the world and helped by the reward centers of the brain, parents can try to foster that warm glow and the worldview that goes with it. Empathy, sympathy, compassion, kindness and charity begin at home, and very early.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Michigan Fight Cleaves Labor Stronghold as Limits on Unions Near Passage

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY; Mark Landler contributed reporting from Redford, Mich.

 BODY:
LANSING, Mich. -- With Democratic furor escalating and party leaders warning that Michigan was about to be plunged into lasting political discord, the state's Republican-led Legislature was on the verge of approving new limits to unions here in the birthplace of the modern labor movement.
Republicans said they intended to cast final votes as early as Tuesday on legislation abruptly announced last week that would bar workers from being required to pay union fees as a condition of employment, even as thousands of union members planned to protest at the state Capitol and as President Obama, visiting a truck factory outside Detroit, denounced the notion.
''You know, these so-called right-to-work laws, they don't have to do with economics,'' Mr. Obama said. ''They have everything to do with politics. What they're really talking about is giving you the right to work for less money.'' 
From a distance, there would seem no more unlikely a target for this fight than Michigan, where labor, hoping to demonstrate strength after a series of setbacks, asked voters last month to enshrine collective bargaining into the state Constitution.
But that ballot measure failed badly, and suddenly a reverse drive was under way that has brought the state to a moment startling in its symbolism. How the home of the United Automobile Workers finds itself close to becoming the 24th state to ban compulsory union fees -- and only the second state to pass such legislation in a decade -- is the latest chapter in a larger battle over the role of unions in the nation's midsection.
It is a reflection of mounting tension between labor leaders and Michigan Republicans who took control of the state two years ago, and the result of a change of position by Gov. Rick Snyder, a political novice who had long avoided the issue because, he had said, it was too divisive. It is also an effort being closely watched -- and fueled, labor leaders say -- by national conservative groups who see the outcome in Michigan as an emblem for similar measures in other states with far thinner union histories.
''Everybody has this image of Michigan as a labor state,'' said Bill Ballenger, the editor of Inside Michigan Politics. ''But organized labor has been losing clout, and the Republicans saw an opportunity, and now the chickens are coming home to roost.''
Since the wave of Republican wins in 2010 in statehouses in the Midwest, campaigns to limit unions have boiled over in Wisconsin, Ohio, Indiana and elsewhere. But in Michigan, where Republicans also won control, those efforts had seemed more muted, with some in the party, including Mr. Snyder, shying away from the broadest, most sweeping measures.
''When you're proposing to make changes of this magnitude in a culture that's steeped in a long legacy involving labor, it's going to take a long time to communicate with and educate people,'' said Mike Shirkey, a Republican state representative.
Supporters of such a limit on unions, which is already the law in many in Southern and Western states, say it grants workers freedom and attracts new businesses to the state. Detractors say it lowers workers' salaries and weakens unions. Indiana passed such a law this year, the first new state to do so since 2001.
Mr. Snyder, an accountant and venture capitalist in his first term as governor, prided himself on avoiding partisan labels and said over and over that a ''right-to-work'' measure was not on his agenda. ''This is not Wisconsin,'' Mr. Snyder told a group of union members last year as a battle over limits to collective bargaining raged in Madison.
Still, labor leaders complained that Mr. Snyder and lawmakers were harming unions in other ways: trying to prevent school districts from deducting dues from paychecks, for instance, and allowing state-appointed managers to toss out union contracts in the most financially troubled cities. Labor leaders went on the offensive, proposing the unusual ballot measure to enshrine collective bargaining rights into the state Constitution, a move Mr. Snyder opposed.
As it has throughout the country, membership in unions has fallen here in recent decades -- about 17.5 percent of Michigan residents are members -- and the statewide ballot proposal failed by 14 percentage points on Nov. 6 even as Mr. Obama won the state.
Not long after the election, lawmakers here say, private conversations began anew about the possibility of a law limiting unions while Republicans held a larger majority in the State House than they will come January when newly elected members are seated. Some labor leaders contended the move was retribution for the ballot measure.
But Republicans said they viewed the outcome of the election as merely a sign that public opinion had shifted, and that the timing might now be right. ''Business people are absolutely ecstatic with this possibility for Michigan,'' said Dick DeVos, a former Republican candidate for governor. ''They share my view that there was no single initiative from a business perspective that would be more powerful to put a sign out -- open for business in Michigan.''
Not long after Thanksgiving, as word spread of an effort to ban mandatory union contributions, labor leaders began holding meetings with Mr. Snyder, his aides and lawmakers. The labor leaders said they believed the talks had been going along productively until last week.
''Then, suddenly we're told that this thing is on the governor's agenda now after all, and here we are,'' said Steve Cook, president of the Michigan Education Association. Bob King, the president of the U.A.W., who took part in the talks, said he believed Mr. Snyder was eventually ''overwhelmed by pressure from right-wing sources.''
Mr. Snyder announced Thursday that he would sign a package of bills blocking mandatory payments to unions by private and most public workers, and he urged lawmakers to move it through their chambers within days. Of suggestions that he had bent to pressure from the right, a spokeswoman for Mr. Snyder said: ''The governor doesn't make decisions based on 'pressure.' Period.''
In an interview, explaining his decision, Mr. Snyder said the issue ''wasn't going to go away.''
''And my view was since it's here, it's better to be proactive to show leadership, to say O.K., let's address the issue, let's come out with a conclusion, a resolution, and then let's do something about it and then move forward.''
But on Monday, Democrats in Michigan's Congressional delegation, who met with Mr. Snyder urging him to veto the package, said moving forward appeared unlikely. Some union members were already suggesting recall efforts against Republicans, while other people called for lawsuits to block the legislation or a ballot initiative to bring the issue before voters. Still others appeared already to be gearing up for election fights in 2014.
''We're hearing from people around the country asking what in the world is happening in Michigan,'' said Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat. ''The governor had said he didn't want to be to become Wisconsin. Well, this is Wisconsin -- and worse, because we're the place, frankly, where the middle class began.''

HEADLINE: Putin Restores Worker Award Of Soviet Era

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- When secretaries, financial analysts and the like spilled onto the streets of Moscow in antigovernment protests last winter, Vladimir V. Putin took one look and dismissed them as a crowd of ''office plankton.''
And then he set about burnishing his credentials as a champion of real, working-class Russians, a project that continued on Monday with his decision to dust off a relic of Soviet heraldry: the set of lapel pins called the Hero of Socialist Labor award, now conspicuously shortened in these capitalistic times to the Hero of Labor. 
Mr. Putin, who was elected this year to his third term as president, has brought back the Soviet anthem, military parades and political repression. But until now he had not set about restoring the grandeur of the Soviet lapel pin collection for civilians -- awards marked by the heads of Lenin and ribbons that once caused jackets to sag.
''Of course, I think that it would be good for us to revive the Hero of Labor award, only we need to think -- we shouldn't make a complete copy of it from the Soviet times,'' Mr. Putin told a meeting of political supporters, the Interfax news agency reported Monday. ''We need to be sure it covers working people, no matter where they work, and those who work with their heads and their hands.''
Igor Kholmanskikh, a rough-hewed, working-class former tank factory foreman who started a pro-Putin movement in the Ural Mountain industrial area, first proposed reviving the award in August.
Mr. Putin is believed to be swiveling to the political left through the embrace of movements like Mr. Kholmanskikh's. The intention is to co-opt expected discontent in industrial regions, where support is still stronger than in the urban centers, in case the price of oil, the mainstay of the Russian economy, declines in coming years.
As wages level off, medals and awards that raise status without costing hard currency might substitute as compensation, as practiced in the Soviet period, beginning principally in the 1930s, when such status symbols, rather than salaries, measured accomplishment.
By the 1980s, medal inflation had rendered such awards all but meaningless, as nearly everybody had some, and they became the objects of near universal derision -- eventually sold by the hundreds in canning jars on the sidewalks of East bloc countries.
The Hero of Socialist Labor award was created in 1938. It went to coal miners, milkmaids, tractor drivers and others who applied more than the typical amount of elbow grease to their work, thus contributing to ''the growth of the might and glory of the U.S.S.R.,'' according to an entry about the award in the Big Soviet Encyclopedia.
The award came in the form of two pins -- a ribbon and a medal with a cameo of Lenin.
A revision of the rules in 1949 clarified that workers who received the award three times would also have a bronze bust made in their likeness, along with the six pieces of chest decoration. Mr. Putin did not say whether the new award would lead to any busts for repeat winners.
Other awards went to so-called shock workers who took on difficult jobs. Mothers who had 10 children or more were called Hero Mothers.
But in the late 1980s, after the devaluation of lapel pins under Leonid Brezhnev, the government scaled back to ban multiple awards to the same person, then abolished the Hero of Socialist Labor award altogether with the Soviet Union's demise.

HEADLINE: Britain's Departing Central Banker Is Troubled by Trade Imbalance

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
Mervyn A. King, the outgoing governor of the Bank of England, expressed confidence in his successor and discussed economic challenges facing Britain and the United States in their approaches to monetary policy and financial regulation in a speech Monday at the Economic Club of New York.
Mr. King punted, however, on a question about how America's severe fiscal budget tightening scheduled for the end of the year might affect Britain. 
''I have great confidence that one way or another,'' the United States will avoid going over the so-called fiscal-cliff, he said, if doing so means just barely hanging on by the country's ''fingertips.'' That was a reference to early next year when trillions of dollars in tax increases and automatic spending cuts begin to go into effect.
He did express concern at one point about the need to rebalance trade around the globe, as consumer-driven economies like the United States and Britain continue to run large trade deficits while export-driven countries like China run large surpluses.
''We haven't found a solution to this,'' he said, calling the pressures on deficit countries ''inexorable.''
He said he feared that ''in 2013 what we will see is growth in actively managed exchange rates'' as an alternative to letting the market decide how much currencies are worth. Letting the market decide exchange rates would eventually make goods from trade-surplus economies like China more expensive and those from trade-deficit countries like the United States cheaper, which would help to rebalance global trade.
The tension between short-term and long-term policy goals, Mr. King said, is one of the challenges for other postcrisis policies, like forcing banks to recapitalize or encouraging the government to whittle down its debt.
''What seems to be the right thing to do in the short term is absolutely the opposite of what we need to do in the long term,'' he said.
The Bank of England is Britain's counterpart to the Federal Reserve and, as in the United States, the British central bank has been providing monetary stimulus to offset fiscal austerity measures pushed through the legislature.
Britain has had disappointing economic growth in the last two years, a fact that Mr. King also attributed to rising energy and commodity prices, which are holding back consumer spending, and the euro zone's debt crisis.
''A black cloud of uncertainty has drifted across the channel,'' he said, and it has diminished what might otherwise have been a stronger recovery in investment spending.
The Bank of England has engaged in three main policy initiatives to combat these drags on the economy: large-scale asset purchases, along the lines of what the Federal Reserve has pursued; a special program that rewards banks for lending by reducing their interest rates, called the ''funding for lending scheme''; and designing new regulations intended to improve the health of the banking sector, like requiring greater capitalization.
Asked whether the Bank of England would consider providing more explicit guidance about when it might eventually raise interest rates -- as the Fed has done -- Mr. King said, ''We don't think we have a crystal ball'' about such decisions and so had no plans to provide a time frame.
Last month, the British government announced that Mr. King's successor would be Mark J. Carney, the head of the Canadian central bank. Mr. Carney, who takes over in July, will be the first non-Briton to hold the position.
''I think he'll do a great job, and they won't miss me at all,'' Mr. King said.
A major challenge for policy makers, he said, was to ''defend the market economy in the face of concerns among so many who suffered during the financial crisis,'' particularly those who did not benefit from the boom before the crisis and are still extremely angry today.
''We need to support the legitimacy of the market economy,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Japanese Companies Help Save Chip Maker

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO - When a magnitude 9 earthquake knocked out a chip-making factory at Renesas Electronics, Toyota Motor and other manufacturers dispatched hundreds of workers to help get the plant in northeastern Japan running again.
On Monday, some of Japan's largest manufacturers pitched in again, contributing to a $1.8 billion bailout of the struggling company.
In a statement, Renesas said eight Japanese manufacturers, including Canon, Nikon, Nissan, Panasonic and Toyota, would contribute about $145 million to the deal. A government fund, the Innovation Network Corporation of Japan, will provide the rest of the aid. 
The effort underscores the importance of the company's advanced microcontroller chips to Japanese industry and the country's reluctance to give the technology to foreign players.
The capital injection will help Renesas increase spending on the advanced microcontrollers used in cars and electronic devices, the company said. To prop up its finances, Renesas, which is based in Kawasaki, had requested an additional 50 billion yen, or $606 million, from the government.
Although Renesas rebounded swiftly from the quake and tsunami that struck Japan last year, it has been less successful in dealing with rivals like Samsung Electronics of South Korea. As Japan's major manufacturers have stumbled in the face of tough competition and a slowing global economy, Renesas has struggled to turn a profit. On Monday, Renesas forecast a net loss of 150 billion yen for the 12 months through March 2013, after losing 62.6 billion yen in the previous 12 months.
Shares in Renesas rose 3 percent to close at 308 yen in Tokyo on Monday. The company has lost 35 percent of its market value this year.
The industry is under pressure in Japan. Elpida Memory, a Japanese manufacturer of dynamic random access memory chips, filed for bankruptcy protection in February. Elpida is being acquired by Micron Technology, a chip maker based in Boise, Idaho.
Despite the industry challenges, Japan wants to maintain control of Renesas.
In August, reports surfaced that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, the American private equity firm, had offered to invest as much as 100 billion yen in Renesas, which sent the company's shares soaring. But the potential deal also raised concerns about foreign control of a company that supplies many of Japan's leading manufacturers.
Japan's reliance on Renesas stems, in part, from the company's legacy.
In 2003, Hitachi and Mitsubishi Electric merged their semiconductor businesses to form Renesas Technology. Then in April 2010, Renesas joined NEC Electronics, the former semiconductor division of NEC, to create the current company.
As a result, manufacturers that once employed several preferred chip suppliers ended up largely buying products from one, Renesas. In addition to automotive microcontrollers, Renesas supplies specially tailored chips for electronics companies like Canon and Ricoh.
In the bailout plan announced on Monday, Renesas said it would sell 1.25 billion new shares for 120 yen each to the government fund and the Japanese manufacturers, giving them a 69 percent stake in the chip maker. That price represents a deep discount from the company's closing price of 308 yen on Monday in Tokyo.
The aid package follows 161 billion yen in syndicated loans Renesas secured from four Japanese banks in September, and 97 billion yen it received earlier from banks and its major shareholders. In return for that support, Renesas has promised to sell or close eight of its 18 plants in Japan within three years, and to eliminate more than 7,000 jobs from its global work force of roughly 43,000.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Trains Fill the Gaps In Airline Schedules

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY. 
E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com

 BODY:
NOT long ago, I wrote about all the problems I encountered in trying to get from Tucson to Houston on short notice on a weekend. A nonstop flight would have taken less than two hours.
But because the airlines have reduced air service at midsize and small airports by about 25 percent in recent years, there were no flights out of Tucson that morning that would have got me to the strangely named George Bush Intercontinental Airport before I had to be there at 3 p.m. on a Sunday.
Instead, I had to fly out the day before, book a hotel room and then spend the next day moping around the Houston airport till 3 p.m. -- bored, indolent and increasingly irritated by those annoying constant security announcements threatening arrest to anyone making ''inappropriate remarks or jokes concerning security.'' 
Reader response to the column was lively. Some suggested that I should have just driven to Phoenix, where there are morning flights that arrive in Houston by early afternoon. But that would have entailed a two-and-a-half-hour drive from Tucson, very early in the morning.
And my car would be in Phoenix, even though there were more convenient return flights from Houston to Tucson.
Others, like Matt Fels, suggested that I could have taken the train. My reaction to that was, ''Are you serious?''
''Yes,'' said Mr. Fels, who lives in Fort Worth and belongs to an advocacy group called the National Association of Railroad Passengers.
''For a lot of business travelers, the train is off the radar screen,'' he told me. ''To the extent that people do know about trains, what they mostly know is that trains are slow. But if the train is moving while you're sleeping, I figure only the waking hours count in terms of travel time.''
In fact, given the cuts in domestic air service and the other problems of air travel, I realized that the rail option could be viable, and not just on the popular Amtrak Northeast Corridor line that carries nearly 16 million passengers a year, many of them on spiffy Acela trains that thread from Boston to New York, Philadelphia to Washington.
My Houston itinerary, for example, took about 24 hours from my front door to my destination, including the night's lodging. It cost $432.79 ($348.60 in one-way airfare and $83.29 for the airport hotel, not counting meals.) By train, the total time would have been about 25 hours on a section of Amtrak's Sunset Limited, which stops in Tucson and Houston on its long haul between Los Angeles and New Orleans. The train fare, including a private roomette with a sleeping berth, would have totaled $577, all meals included.
It's almost 1,000 miles from Tucson to Houston, so the train-versus-plane option -- though it would have worked for me on that trip -- is less persuasive there than on Amtrak routes of roughly 500 miles with overnight schedules, when you're going to be sleeping anyway.
Mr. Fels suggested more than a dozen such overnight routes with evening departures and early-morning arrivals.
These were among them: Richmond, Va., to Savannah, Ga., on the Silver Meteor route between New York and Miami; Charlottesville, Va., to Atlanta on the Crescent, which goes from New York to New Orleans; Eugene, Ore., to Sacramento on the Coast Starlight between Seattle and Los Angeles; and Chicago to Buffalo on the Lake Shore Limited, which goes from Chicago to New York and Boston.
Some critics of Amtrak in Congress and elsewhere deride the long-distance trains as a kind of subsidized luxury, providing ''land cruises'' for leisure travelers with unlimited time. But business travelers seldom go the whole route, Mr. Fels pointed out.
''Amtrak critics get preoccupied with the length of the route, end to end,'' he said. ''For example, the California Zephyr goes between Chicago and the San Francisco Bay Area, about 2,500 miles -- but few people on that train actually are riding the whole way.
''Much more typical is people riding from an endpoint to intermediate point or between two intermediate points. For another example, a couple of times a month, I take the Texas Eagle, which goes from San Antonio to Chicago. But I only ride an intermediate segment, Dallas to St. Louis.''
In places around the country, Amtrak and regional railroad authorities are improving rail lines to enable faster speeds. Acela aside, trains go 110 miles an hour on a 97-mile stretch of the Wolverine line between Pontiac, Mich., and Chicago, for one example.
True high-speed rail -- trains traveling 185 miles an hour or so -- may not be attainable in the United States anytime soon, but what rail buffs call ''higher speed'' rail like that 97-mile stretch on the Wolverine certainly is.
As a matter of national transportation policy, Mr. Fels argued, shouldn't we be having a serious conversation about improving rail service, dreams of European or Asian-style high-speed rail aside?
''By air, you can't always get there from here anymore,'' he said. ''Flights aren't as frequent, connections aren't seamless. Yet our economy is built on mobility, and has been since the national road was pushed over the Cumberland Gap.''

HEADLINE: Drought and Economics Cast a Shadow on Sheep Farmers

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
SEVERANCE, Colo. -- Since he was a boy in western Colorado, John Bartmann seemed destined to become a sheep man. He raised lambs with the local 4-H club and sheared them for elderly German farmers. His office is lined with paintings of sheep and a plaque honoring him for ''promoting culinary excellence'' in lambs.
But over the last few years, skyrocketing costs, a brutal drought and plunging lamb prices have battered Mr. Bartmann and the 80,000 ranchers across the county who raise sheep -- from a few to several thousand. It is the latest threat to shadow a Western way of life that still relies on the whims of summer rains, lonely immigrant sheep herders and old grazing trails into the mountains. 
''For the sheep industry, it's the perfect storm,'' Mr. Bartmann said, glancing out his office window here at a bleating sea of wool. ''The money is just not there.''
Many ranchers are laying off employees, cutting their flocks and selling at a loss, and industry groups said a handful had abandoned the business entirely. Mr. Bartmann has trimmed his flock of 2,000 by one-third. With prices down more than half since last year and higher costs for gasoline and corn, Mr. Bartmann said he expected to lose about $100 for every lamb he sold.
''Even in the good years, you don't make that much money,'' he said. ''We can't take that kind of hit.''
Weather and economics take big shares of the blame. The drought withered grazing grounds, killed off young lambs and dried up irrigation ditches, and a glut of meat and imported lambs from New Zealand helped send prices plummeting.
But some ranchers and officials in Washington believe that the deck was stacked against the sheep ranchers by the small number of powerful feedlots that buy lambs, slaughter them and sell them to grocery stores and restaurants. Even as prices farmers received fell to 85 cents a pound, consumers at supermarkets were paying $7 or more a pound for the same meat.
As cows, pigs, sheep and other animals make their doomed way from the range to kitchen tables, many of them end up in a matrix of feedlots, slaughterhouses and meatpacking facilities where a few companies control a vast share of the market. The top four companies control about 65 percent of the market for lamb and as much as 85 percent of the market for cows.
That kind of concentration makes it easier for a few powerful companies to manipulate prices to their advantage, said Patrick Woodall, the research director at Food and Water Watch, an environmental advocacy group.
This fall, several Western senators and ranchers' groups wrote to the Agriculture Department saying they suspected that meatpackers had been hoarding sheep in feedlots and keeping prices artificially low. The agency that oversees stockyards said it would investigate.
''We're going to force a lot of people in the lamb industry out of that business,'' said Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana. ''You want competition that's fair. If you have manipulation, that's a whole different story.''
In Kaycee, Wyo., Lisa Cunningham said she and other sheep ranchers watched with astonishment as their prices soared and then crashed over the course of the last two years. Ms. Cunningham said she was lucky to get $1 a pound for young lambs, down from more than $2.
''You can't hardly get anyone to buy your lamb,'' she said.
Still, even some sheep ranchers do not blame the packers and say they believe that the declines are related to shifts in the market.
Federal insurance has helped blunt the blow, as have government programs to buy lamb from struggling ranchers.
It is the latest twist in a brutal year for thousands of farmers and ranchers across the country. In a slow-motion disaster, a drought covering more than 60 percent of the country scorched corn stalks into parchment, dried up irrigation ponds and turned farm fields into brittle crust. Farmers begged local governments to let them tap aquifers. Scores of ranchers dumped their livestock at drought auctions.
Farmers say they are still paying near-record prices for corn and hay to feed their livestock through the winter. And if abundant snows do not come to replenish streams and coax new grass from the ground, they worry that next summer could be even worse than last.
''The drought plays into everything,'' said Fred Roberts, a sheep rancher in Rock Springs, Wyo. ''We have absolutely no feed. We're feeding as much corn to the sheep as they can eat, and you can imagine how expensive that is. Nothing grew here last year.''
Here in the northern Colorado town of Severance, Mr. Bartmann, a man with a Wyatt Earp mustache and a master's degree in animal production, spends his days managing a lamb feedlot increasingly surrounded by high-end ranch subdivisions.
Even before ''the wreck'' in prices, he said, his business had been growing increasingly tenuous. A few years ago, he lost big areas of grazing land because it was declared potential habitat for wild bighorn sheep. The summer drought claimed even more grassland. Now, many of his sheep are spending the winter on a Kansas feedlot. A few hundred others are here, munching hay under gray skies. Mr. Bartmann climbed into a battered pickup truck to check on them one recent morning, unsure what the next season would bring.
''It just keeps pulling everything down,'' he said. ''After a while, you say it isn't worth it.''

HEADLINE: When Low-Income Tenants Face Eviction

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Tipping the Scales in Housing Court'' (Op-Ed, Nov. 30), Matthew Desmond makes a compelling case for assisting low-income tenants facing eviction by providing them with lawyers. It's sound social policy and a strong showing of decent morality. 
The issue of evictions is embedded within the context of a broader goal: ensuring and increasing housing stability.
Being forced to move is disruptive to personal and family life and causes great turmoil and anger. One illustration of the damage: most of the time children must switch schools, usually mid-school-year; studies show how this negatively affects performance, lessens chances of graduating on time (or at all), and severs relations with peers and teachers.
It is vitally important that we do everything to strengthen housing security rather than forcibly disrupting a household's important social networks and connections to supportive local institutional and commercial relationships of the kind that all of us benefit from.
Eviction is but one cause of such disruption. Many elements of a progressive housing policy can and should be used toward that end.
CHESTER HARTMAN Director of Research Poverty and Race Research Action Council Washington, Dec. 1, 2012
To the Editor:
Sadly, Matthew Desmond describes the scene in eviction court all too accurately. And although there are agencies, including our own, offering free legal assistance to poor and low-income tenants facing eviction, many people do not know that such help exists, and even if they do, demand far outstrips the services available.
Now we can add to this dismal picture the impact of Hurricane Sandy. In the month since the storm, New York Legal Assistance Group has received thousands of requests for assistance. Landlord-tenant disputes over habitability and repairs are quickly becoming a major issue.
Though many banks and institutions have placed a temporary hold on evictions and foreclosures, these reprieves are set to expire soon and we expect a flood of evictions in the new year.
Tenants who stopped paying rent on uninhabitable space or who cannot afford payments after losing a job in the wake of the storm will need attorneys to protect their rights in these lengthy proceedings.
Now more than ever there are economic, social and moral reasons to give tenants a fighting chance by putting lawyers by their sides in eviction court.

HEADLINE: U.S. Students Still Lag Globally In Math and Science, Tests Show

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
Fourth- and eighth-grade students in the United States continue to lag behind students in several East Asian countries and some European nations in math and science, although American fourth graders are closer to the top performers in reading, according to test results released on Tuesday.
Fretting about how American schools compare with those in other countries has become a regular pastime in education circles. Results from two new reports, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study and the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study, are likely to fuel further debate. 
South Korea and Singapore led the international rankings in math and fourth-grade science, while Singapore and Taiwan had the top-performing students in eighth-grade science. The United States ranked 11th in fourth-grade math, 9th in eighth-grade math, 7th in fourth-grade science and 10th in eighth-grade science.
Although the average scores among American students were not significantly lower than the top performers, several nations far outstripped the United States in the proportion of students who scored at the highest levels on the math and science tests.
In the United States, only 7 percent of students reached the advanced level in eighth-grade math, while 48 percent of eighth graders in Singapore and 47 percent of eighth graders in South Korea reached the advanced level. As those with superior math and science skills increasingly thrive in a global economy, the lag among American students could be a cause for concern.
''Clearly, we have some room to improve, particularly at the number of advanced students we have compared to the world,'' said Jack Buckley, the commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics at the Education Department, which administers and analyzes the results of the tests in the United States.
The tests, which are designed by the International Study Center at Boston College in collaboration with government education officials and academic researchers in participating countries, are administered to a random selection of demographically representative students across the world.
Fourth graders in 57 countries or education systems took the math and science tests, while 56 countries or education systems administered the tests to eighth graders. (Education systems include American states or regions like Hong Kong in China or Northern Ireland in Britain.) In reading, 53 countries and education systems participated.
Hong Kong and Russia had the highest average test scores in fourth-grade reading, with American students ranking sixth. Students in Florida, one of the states to break out results separately, achieved a higher average score than students in the nation over all.
Students in Finland, which is often held up as a model education system for its teacher preparation and its relative absence of high-stakes testing, outperformed American students on all the exams. But students in countries with intense testing cultures also exceeded American students. ''Some of the high-performing math and science countries have extremely rigorous testing regimes,'' Mr. Buckley said.
The test designers included questionnaires for parents about preparation before formal schooling. Ina V. S. Mullis, an executive director of the International Study Center, said that students whose parents reported singing or playing number games as well as reading aloud with their children early in life scored higher on their fourth-grade tests than those whose parents who did not report such activities. Similarly, students who had attended preschool performed better.
''What's remarkable is that in all the countries, this concept of an early start is there over and over again,'' said Michael O. Martin, the other executive director of the center. ''You can get the early childhood experience in a variety of ways, but it's important you get it.''

HEADLINE: Bank Said to Avoid Charges Over Laundering

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS and JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG

 BODY:
4:37 a.m. | Updated
State and federal authorities decided against indicting HSBC in a money-laundering case over concerns that criminal charges could jeopardize one of the world's largest banks and ultimately destabilize the global financial system.
Instead, HSBC announced on Tuesday that it had agreed to a record $1.92 billion settlement with authorities. The bank, which is based in Britain, faces accusations that it transferred billions of dollars for nations like Iran and enabled Mexican drug cartels to move money illegally through its American subsidiaries.
While the settlement with HSBC is a major victory for the government, the case raises questions about whether certain financial institutions, having grown so large and interconnected, are too big to indict. Four years after the failure of Lehman Brothers nearly toppled the financial system, regulators are still wary that a single institution could undermine the recovery of the industry and the economy.
But the threat of criminal prosecution acts as a powerful deterrent. If authorities signal such actions are remote for big banks, the threat could lose its sting. 
Behind the scenes, authorities debated for months the advantages and perils of a criminal indictment against HSBC.
Some prosecutors at the Justice Department's criminal division and the Manhattan district attorney's office wanted the bank to plead guilty to violations of the federal Bank Secrecy Act, according to the officials with direct knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The law requires financial institutions to report any cash transaction of $10,000 or more and to bring any dubious activity to the attention of regulators.
Given the extent of the evidence against HSBC, some prosecutors saw the charge as a healthy compromise between a settlement and a harsher money-laundering indictment. While the charge would most likely tarnish the bank's reputation, some officials argued that it would not set off a series of devastating consequences.
A money-laundering indictment, or a guilty plea over such charges, would essentially be a death sentence for the bank. Such actions could cut off the bank from certain investors like pension funds and ultimately cost it its charter to operate in the United States, officials said.
Despite the Justice Department's proposed compromise, Treasury Department officials and bank regulators at the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency pointed to potential issues with the aggressive stance, according to the officials briefed on the matter. When approached by the Justice Department for their thoughts, the regulators cautioned about the effect on the broader economy.
"The Justice Department asked Treasury for our view about the potential implications of prosecuting a large financial institution," David S. Cohen, the Treasury's under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a statement. "We did not believe we were in a position to offer any meaningful assessment. The decision of how the Justice Department exercises its prosecutorial discretion is solely theirs and Treasury had no role."
Still, some prosecutors proposed that Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. meet with Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, people briefed on the matter said. The meeting never took place.
After months of discussions, prosecutors decided against a criminal indictment, but only after securing record penalties and wide-ranging sanctions.
The HSBC deal includes a deferred prosecution agreement with the Manhattan district attorney's office and the Justice Department. The deferred prosecution agreement, a notch below a criminal indictment, requires the bank to forfeit more than $1.2 billion and pay about $700 million in fines, according to the officials briefed on the matter. The case, officials say, will claim violations of the Bank Secrecy Act and Trading with the Enemy Act.
As part of the deal, one of the officials briefed on the matter said, HSBC must also strengthen its internal controls and stay out of trouble for the next five years. If the bank again runs afoul of the federal rules, the Justice Department can resume its case and file a criminal indictment. An independent auditor will also monitor the bank's progress to strengthen its internal controls, and will make regular assessments on the firm's progress.
On Tuesday, HSBC said it had "reached agreement with United States authorities in relation to investigations regarding inadequate compliance with anti-money laundering and sanctions laws." The bank is also expected to reach a settlement over the matter with Britain's Financial Services Authority, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
"We accept responsibility for our past mistakes,'' HSBC's chief executive, Stuart T. Gulliver, said in the statement. "We are committed to protecting the integrity of the global financial system. To this end, we will continue to work closely with governments and regulators around the world."
The HSBC case is part of a sweeping investigation into the movement of tainted money through the American financial system. In 2010, Lanny A. Breuer, the head of the Justice Department's criminal division, created a money-laundering task force that has collected more than $2 billion in fines from banks, a number that is set to double with the HSBC case.
The inquiry - led by the Justice Department, the Treasury and the Manhattan prosecutors - has ensnared six foreign banks in recent years, including Credit Suisse and Barclays. In June, ING Bank reached a $619 million settlement to resolve claims that it had transferred billions of dollars in the United States for countries like Cuba and Iran that are under United States sanctions.
On Monday, federal and state authorities also won a $327 million settlement from Standard Chartered, a British bank. The bank, which in September agreed to a larger settlement with New York's top banking regulator, admitted processing thousands of transactions for Iranian and Sudanese clients through its American subsidiaries. To avoid having Iranian transactions detected by Treasury Department computer filters, Standard Chartered deliberately removed names and other identifying information, according to the authorities.
"You can't do it. It's against the law, and today Standard Chartered is being held to account," Mr. Breuer said in an interview.
HSBC's actions stand out among the foreign banks caught up in the investigation, according to several law enforcement officials with knowledge of the inquiry. Unlike those of institutions that have previously settled, HSBC's activities are said to have gone beyond claims that the bank flouted United States sanctions to transfer money on behalf of nations like Iran. Prosecutors also found that the bank had facilitated money laundering by Mexican drug cartels and had moved tainted money for Saudi banks tied to terrorist groups.
HSBC was thrust into the spotlight in July after a Congressional committee outlined how the bank, between 2001 and 2010, "exposed the U.S. financial system to money laundering and terrorist financing risks." The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations held a subsequent hearing at which the bank's compliance chief resigned amid mounting concerns that senior bank officials were complicit in the illegal activity. For example, an HSBC executive at one point argued that the bank should continue working with the Saudi Al Rajhi bank, which has supported Al Qaeda, according to the Congressional report.
Despite repeated urgings from federal officials to strengthen protections in its vast Mexican business, HSBC instead viewed the country from 2000 to 2009 as low-risk for money laundering, the Senate report found. Even after HSBC's Mexican operation transferred more than $7 billion to the United States - a volume that law enforcement officials said had to be "illegal drug proceeds" - lax controls remained.
HSBC has since moved to bolster its safeguards. The bank doubled its spending on compliance functions and revamped its oversight, according to a spokesman. In January, HSBC hired Stuart A. Levey as chief legal officer to come up with stricter internal standards to thwart the illegal flow of cash. Mr. Levey was formerly an under secretary at the Treasury Department who focused on terrorism and financial intelligence.
On Monday, the bank said it was promoting Robert W. Werner, who oversaw the group at the Treasury Department that enforces sanctions, to run a specially created division focused on anti-money laundering efforts.
Regulators have also vowed to improve. The Congressional hearings exposed weaknesses at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the national bank regulator. In 2010, the regulator found that HSBC had severe deficiencies in its anti-money laundering controls, including $60 trillion in transactions and 17,000 accounts flagged as potentially suspicious, activities that were not reviewed. Despite the findings, the regulator did not fine the bank.
During the hearings this summer, lawmakers assailed the regulator. At one point, Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, called the comptroller "a lap dog, not a watchdog."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Moroccans Fear That Flickers Of Democracy Are Fading

BYLINE: By SUZANNE DALEY; Aida Alami contributed reporting.

 BODY:
TANGIER, Morocco -- Until recently, politics in Morocco involved red carpets and speeches in high Arabic that the average citizen could not understand. But on a campaign swing this fall through a working-class area of this port city, Prime Minister Abdelilah Benkirane stood on a makeshift podium in a muddy vacant lot.
He spoke without notes, kissed babies passed forward by the crowd and promised, as he has done all along, to fight corruption and return the government to the people.
''We will get stronger with the help of God and accomplish what we wanted,'' he told the crowd, which roared its approval. 
But more and more Moroccans are questioning his ability to do that, wondering whether Morocco's version of the Arab Spring brought anything more than cosmetic changes to this impoverished country, which has been one of America's most stable and staunch allies in a region marked by turmoil.
A year ago, it seemed Moroccans were giddy with the sense that they had found a gentle, negotiated answer to the popular uprisings in the streets. The country's king, Mohammed VI, 49, defused angry protesters by volunteering to share his power. Within months, Morocco had a new Constitution.
Mr. Benkirane's moderate Islamist party, the Justice and Development Party, won a plurality in parliamentary elections in November. Western governments heaped praise on the election process, satisfied that this strategically important country, just 12 miles south of Spain and atop a changing and uncertain continent, was settling in to a new more democratic order. (This week, the Friends of Syria are scheduled to meet in Morocco.)
But these days, many here are questioning whether the king and his entourage really gave up anything at all. Telquel, perhaps the country's most influential magazine, ran a cover story this fall saying that the palace had gradually taken back its concessions: the king's shadow cabinet was interfering at will and was even sending its own emissaries to the United States and Brussels when Moroccan interests needed tending to. Mr. Benkirane, the magazine pointed out, had publicly admitted that the king's advisers sometimes met with government officials without consulting him.
Some also point to a quiet clamping down on political activists. In October, the United Nations said there was evidence of a recent spike in reports of torture in Morocco. About 70 protesters associated with the pro-democracy February 20 Movement are still in prison. In May, a popular rapper was sentenced to a year in jail for a song about police corruption. And six political activists testified at a hearing in September that they had been physically -- and sexually -- abused after being arrested for protesting in July.
In other countries rocked by Arab Spring uprisings, tensions today are being felt largely over the role of Islam in government. These issues have come up in Morocco, too. But here, the larger tensions appear to be over the power of the old guard. Many Moroccans will not criticize the king, instead focusing on the network of power and privilege that surrounds him and the corruption that they believe sucks any hope of prosperity from this country.
The problems Morocco faces are enormous. The country has invested heavily in infrastructure: superhighways are everywhere and there are plans for a high-speed train, too. But 40 percent of the population cannot read or write. Forbes has estimated the king's fortune to be more than $2 billion. But the average income here is low, roughly half of what it was in Tunisia, where the Arab Spring first took off.
Mr. Benkirane took office showing a flair for the dramatic. He quickly slashed ministerial salaries and perquisites, and he refused to move to the prime minister's mansion. He also took on Morocco's notorious cronyism. To widespread amazement, his government published the names of those who had been given lucrative bus licenses. Since then, however, his efforts have foundered.
Some critics say the prime minister has been outmaneuvered at every turn. Once last spring, Mr. Benkirane seemed to lash out at the king and his entourage, suggesting that protesters could easily return to the streets. But soon after, he said the remarks had been misunderstood.
In August, he suffered what some saw as a serious public humiliation when an outdoor event at which he was to be the main speaker, planned months ahead of time, was abruptly canceled the night before by the Interior Ministry for reasons that remain unclear.
''I think there are functionaries in the ministries who have not yet changed,'' said Imane Yakoubi, a member of the governing board of the Justice and Development Party's youth league.
When Mr. Benkirane spoke to the crowd in Tangier, he rarely addressed any concrete issues. He pledged his loyalty to the king and proclaimed that the two had a good relationship and that anyone who said otherwise was a liar. Yet he repeatedly talked of the ways in which an unnamed ''they'' undermined his efforts and spread lies, a subject he took up again last week in Parliament.
In a rare interview on Al Jazeera recently, he said democracy was advancing slowly, but surely. ''If you thought the Benkirane government was going to end corruption in six months,'' he said, ''there is a problem with expectations there.''
But some say the underlying issue is that the new Constitution -- drafted by a committee appointed by the king -- did not go nearly far enough in shifting power to elected officials. The king remains head of the Council of Ministers and the Ulama Council, which runs the mosques. He also runs the military, the security forces and the intelligence service. He even chooses the prime minister, though he must choose from the majority party.
''We find ourselves with a Constitution that allows us to only pretend that things have changed,'' said Fouad Abdelmoumni, an economist and an activist involved in the pro-democracy movement who was jailed under Hassan II, the king's father.
Supporters see it differently. They say that the Constitution is exactly what the people wanted, as it was put to a referendum. They say Morocco is developing a unique way -- a ''third path'' to democracy. ''We are in a period of emergence,'' said Mokhtar el-Ghambou, who is helping to found Rabat International University. ''Morocco is in a democratic process. It is not yet a democracy. That needs time. We are not there yet.''
Certainly King Mohammed VI has proved himself to be far different from his father, who imprisoned thousands of his opponents and made many disappear. When he ascended to the throne in 1999, he established a reconciliation commission to acknowledge some of the worst abuses of his father's rule. And he has also expanded women's rights, a move that put him at odds with Morocco's conservative Muslims.
But the king's popularity remains something of an open question. Polling on this issue is illegal.
Those involved in street protests over the past year say that they have faced widespread brutality. In February, protesters took to the streets in Taza complaining about unemployment and an abrupt rise in the cost of electricity. But these days their banners sit in a puddle in the corner of the barely furnished offices of Mohammed Chiabri, who leads the local branch of the Moroccan Association for Human Rights. ''It is just too hard to keep going,'' Mr. Chiabri said of the protests. ''They used so much violence against the protesters that people just stopped.''
Still, even those who are disappointed by the slow pace of change doubt whether Moroccans have the stomach for a second Arab Spring. ''Moroccans like their comfort zone,'' said Fadel Abdellaoui, a young businessman. ''They see Syria, Libya, and they say, 'O.K., we will be going slow.' ''
The New Islamists: Articles in this series are exploring the rise of political Islam in the Middle East, as Islamic movements struggle to remake the Arab world.

HEADLINE: Defense Quickly, and Unexpectedly, Rests Its Case in an Insider Trading Trial

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
Defense lawyers for two former hedge fund managers called two witnesses before resting their case, a surprise decision that will send the insider trading trial to the jury as soon as Tuesday.
In one of the largest prosecutions by the government in its broad insider trading investigation, Anthony Chiasson, a co-founder of the now-defunct Level Global Investors, and Todd Newman, a former portfolio manager at Diamondback Capital Management, are on trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan on charges that they were part of a conspiracy that made about $68 million illegally trading technology stocks.
After more than three weeks of testimony, the prosecution rested, setting the stage for the defense to begin its bid to keep Mr. Chiasson and Mr. Newman out of prison. There was chatter that the defendants might testify in their own defense. 
But after Mr. Newman's lawyer called an F.B.I. agent to the stand for brief questioning about the government's investigation. A professor of finance and economics also opined on Mr. Newman's trading patterns before the defense rested. Judge Richard J. Sullivan, who is presiding over the trial, set closing arguments in the case for Tuesday.
The decision to not put on a substantive defense is a calculated risk aimed at signaling to the jury that the defense believes that prosecutors do not have a strong case.
"There is always a gamble because the jury most likely anticipates the defendants will put up a robust defense," said Jacob S. Frenkel, a former federal prosecutor. "But they always hammer away at the government's failure to meet its burden of proof."
The defense's legal team is led by Reid Weingarten of Steptoe & Johnson for Mr. Chiasson and Stephen Fishbein of Shearman & Sterling for Mr. Newman.
The trial of Mr. Chiasson and Mr. Newman is concluding amid renewed interest in the government's insider trading inquiry.
Last month, federal prosecutors charged a former portfolio manager at SAC Capital Advisors with illegal trading in the stocks of the two drug firms Elan and Wyeth, which allowed the fund to earn profits and avoid losses totaling $276 million. For the first time in an insider trading case, Steven A. Cohen, the billionaire founder of SAC, one of the largest hedge funds on Wall Street, is linked to the trades that prosecutors say were illegal. He has not been charged with wrongdoing.
Since 2009, Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, has secured 69 insider trading convictions against hedge fund traders, corporate executives and lawyers.
Juries have not been kind to the defendants. Most of the defendants have pleaded guilty. Of the nine who took their cases to trial, all have been convicted.
The government's case against Mr. Chiasson and Mr. Newman in part grew out of the F.B.I.'s raid in November 2010 of Level Global and Diamondback. About a year later, prosecutors charged Mr. Chiasson, Mr. Newman and six others with participating in a "tight-knit circle of greed" that earned illegal profits by trading in the technology companies Dell and Nvidia. Six of the eight have pleaded guilty, including Jon Horvath, a former analyst at SAC.
Both Level Global and Diamondback were founded by former employees of SAC. Level Global closed shortly after the F.B.I. raid. Diamondback announced last week that it was closing its doors.
The prosecution's case against Mr. Chiasson and Mr. Newman, which lasted about a month, was built around the testimony of two of the former traders who pleaded guilty: Spyridon Adondakis, who worked for Mr. Chiasson at Level Global, and Jesse Tortora, who was under Mr. Newman's direction at Diamondback.
Mr. Adondakis and Mr. Tortora each testified that they had received secret financial information about the computer company Dell and passed it along to their bosses. During opening statements and on cross-examination, the defense lawyers attacked the witnesses' credibility. They have depicted the witnesses as government cooperators who are scapegoating their bosses in the hopes of receiving a lenient sentence.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Saul P. Steinberg, 73, Icon Of the Corporate Takeover

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN; Julie Creswell contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Saul Steinberg, a swashbuckling corporate raider who for more than three decades so terrified companies with attacks on their stock that some paid him millions just to go away, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 73.
His daughter Laura Tisch Broumand confirmed the death. The same day, his mother, Anne Steinberg, who had once sued Mr. Steinberg over an unpaid debt, died in her sleep in Palm Beach, Fla., the family said. 
Mr. Steinberg came to symbolize whole eras in the fast-changing Wall Street culture. In the so-called go-go 1960s, he surfed the big waves of the buoyant stock market to capture a company, Reliance Insurance, more than 10 times the size of his own. He made that score in 1968; by the end of the year he had made more money on his own than any American under 30, Forbes magazine said. He code-named his takeover targets after famous actresses, like Raquel Welch and Faye Dunaway.
In taking over Reliance, a 150-year-old company based in Philadelphia, Mr. Steinberg used the stock of his own computer leasing company, Leasco, in a creative financing scheme that involved the company's shareholders' taking on $400 million in debt.
The next year, 1969, he made a brash bid to use cash from Reliance to buy another establishment institution, Chemical Bank. The takeover attempt drew fire from Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller and a number of United States senators, and it failed, but it vastly elevated Mr. Steinberg's national profile.
''You watch: like the Rockefellers, I'll own the world,'' Vanity Fair magazine quoted him as telling the financial writer Dan Dorfman around that time. ''I could even be the first Jewish president.''
But in the 1970s the junk-bond market and the general economy staggered, and so did Mr. Steinberg. He roared back in the '80s, however, with smaller triumphs, most of them examples of what came to be called ''greenmail,'' the practice of buying about 5 percent of a company's stock, then asking senior management for a seat on the board. His subsequent purchase of a few more shares was usually sufficient for management to pay him millions to drop the chase (or the pretense of one). In 1984, his hostile bid for the Walt Disney Company made him $60 million.
Mr. Steinberg used junk bonds and traditional financing to buy companies in a variety of industries, as well as various companies within an industry. At one point he owned both Days Inn and the Grand Hotel in Cap-Ferrat, in the South of France.
By the 1980s Mr. Steinberg, a portly man with a high-pitched voice, had become very rich, and was not afraid to show it. He and his wife, Gayfryd, lived in a 34-room, 17,000-square-foot Park Avenue apartment that had once belonged to John D. Rockefeller Jr. There they collected art treasures and antiques and gave fabulous parties. When his daughter Laura married Jonathan Tisch, of the hotel family, 500 guests mingled among 50,000 French roses. A year later, for Mr. Steinberg's 50th birthday party, Mrs. Steinberg orchestrated 10 tableaus of living models displaying scenes from paintings by the old masters.
In the 1990s, Mr. Steinberg focused more on his insurance company, opening offices around the world and announcing new business lines. But in 1995, he was dealt a double blow: just as the insurance business was slipping, he had a serious stroke. In the turmoil, Mr. Steinberg fired his brother, Robert, who had been at his side in all his business endeavors, and borrowed $5 million from his mother, Anne Steinberg.
She later sued her son seeking repayment of the loan, but what happened to the suit amid his other financial troubles is not clear. Saddled with heavy debt from its past corporate takeovers, Reliance began suffering huge losses, and Pennsylvania regulators soon liquidated it in what was then the biggest insurance company failure in American history. And the Steinbergs sold their apartment and auctioned off 61 masterpiece paintings and antiques, including a bronze-plated commode that went for more than $2 million.
Saul Phillip Steinberg was born in Brooklyn on Aug. 13, 1939, and moved with his family to Long Island as a youth. His father, Julius, operated a factory that made bathmats. Saul entered the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania at 16 and graduated at 19. At the business school, he wrote a paper on I.B.M. and hit upon the notion that there was a market niche in leasing I.B.M. computers for four years at high prices.
Returning to Brooklyn, he began managing subway station newsstands. In 1961, when he was 22, his father lent him $25,000 to finance his leasing idea. At first called the Ideal Leasing Company, the firm had by 1967 become the Leasco Data Processing Equipment Corporation. Mr. Steinberg sold stock to the public to raise $750,000, and Leasco became the vehicle he used to buy Reliance. The insurance company, in turn, became a wellspring of cash for future corporate attacks.
For 15 years, Mr. Steinberg was chairman of Wharton's board of overseers.
His first two marriages, to the former Barbara Herzog and the former Laura Sconocchia, ended in divorce. Besides his daughter Laura, from his first marriage, Mr. Steinberg is survived by his wife, the former Gayfryd McNabb; his brother, Robert; his sisters Roni Sokoloff and Lynda Jurist; two sons from his first marriage, Jonathan (who is married to the CNBC anchor Maria Bartiromo) and Nicholas; a son from his second marriage, Julian; a son, Rayne, and a daughter, Holden, from his third marriage; and a number of grandchildren. Anne Steinberg's death on Friday was reported in the New York Times death notices. No age or cause was given.
A sign on Mr. Steinberg's Park Avenue office in English and Hebrew suggested the man's immense energy. ''On the eighth day,'' it said, ''Saul rested.''

HEADLINE: Social Science Palooza III

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Elections come and go, but social science marches on. Here are some recent research findings that struck my fancy.
Organic foods may make you less generous. In a study published in Social Psychology and Personality Science, Kendall J. Eskine had people look at organic foods, comfort foods or a group of control foods. Those who viewed organic foods subsequently volunteered less time to help a needy stranger and they judged moral transgressions more harshly.
Men are dumber around women. Thijs Verwijmeren, Vera Rommeswinkel and Johan C. Karremans gave men cognitive tests after they had interacted with a woman via computer. In the study, published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, the male cognitive performance declined after the interaction, or even after the men merely anticipated an interaction with a woman. 
Women inhibit their own performance. In a study published in Self and Identity, Shen Zhang, Toni Schmader and William M. Hall gave women a series of math tests. On some tests they signed their real name, on others they signed a fictitious name. The women scored better on the fictitious name tests, when their own reputation was not at risk.
High unemployment rates may not hurt Democratic incumbents as much. In the American Political Science Review, John R. Wright looked at 175 midterm gubernatorial elections and four presidential elections between 1994 and 2010. Other things being equal, high unemployment rates benefit the Democratic Party. The effect is highest when Republicans are the incumbents, but even when the incumbent is a Democrat, high unemployment rates still benefit Democratic candidates.
People filter language through their fingers. In a study published in the Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, Kyle Jasmin and Daniel Casasanto asked people to rate real words, fictitious words and neologisms. Words composed of letters on the right side of the QWERTY keyboard were viewed more positively than words composed of letters from the left side.
We communicate, process and feel emotions by mimicking the facial expressions of the people around us. For a study in Basic and Applied Social Psychology, Paula M. Niedenthal, Maria Augustinova and others studied young adults who had used pacifiers as babies, and who thus could not mimic as easily. They found that pacifier use correlated with less emotional intelligence in males, though it did not predict emotional processing skills in girls.
Judges are toughest around election time. Judges in Washington State are elected and re-elected into office. In a study for The Review of Economic Statistics, Carlos Berdejó and Noam Yuchtman found that these judges issue sentences that are 10 percent longer at their end of the political cycle than at the beginning.
New fathers pay less. In a study for the Administrative Science Quarterly, Michael Dahl, Cristian Dezso and David Gaddis Ross studied male Danish C.E.O.'s before and after their wives gave birth to children. They found that male C.E.O.'s generally pay their employees less generously after fathering a child. The effect is stronger after a son is born. Female employees are less affected than male employees. C.E.O.'s also tend to pay themselves more after the birth of a child.
Affluent neighborhoods challenge mental equilibrium. In a study for the Journal of Research on Adolescence, Terese J. Lund and Eric Dearing found that boys reported higher levels of delinquency and girls reported higher levels of anxiety and depression when they lived in affluent neighborhoods compared with middle-class neighborhoods. Boys' delinquency and girls' anxiety-depression levels were lowest when they were from affluent families living in middle-class neighborhoods.
Premarital doubts are significant. In a study in the Journal of Family Psychology, Justin Lavner, Benjamin Karney and Thomas Bradbury found that women who had cold feet before marriage had significantly higher divorce rates four years later. Male premarital doubts did not correlate with more divorce.
Women use red to impress men. In a study for the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Andrew Elliot, Tobias Greitemeyer and Adam Pazda found that women expecting to converse with an attractive man were more likely to select a red versus green shirt than women expecting to converse with an unattractive man or another woman.
Birth date affects corporate success. In a study for Economics Letters, Qianqian Du, Huasheng Gao and Maurice Levi found that C.E.O.'s are disproportionately less likely to be born in June and July.
It's always worth emphasizing that no one study is dispositive. Many, many studies do not replicate. Still, these sorts of studies do remind us that we are influenced by a thousand breezes permeating the unconscious layers of our minds. They remind us of the power of social context. They're also nice conversation starters. If you find this sort of thing interesting, you really should check out Kevin Lewis's blog at National Affairs. He provides links to hundreds of academic studies a year, from which these selections have been drawn.

HEADLINE: In Talks, House Majority Weighs Loyalty to Voters

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN; Jennifer Steinhauer contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As their leaders inch toward agreeing to higher tax rates, dozens of House Republicans find themselves caught between the will of a larger American public that favors higher taxes on the rich and the wishes of constituents who re-elected them overwhelmingly to oppose the Obama agenda at every turn.
With the last House race decided over the weekend, the conflict between a Democratic president convincingly re-elected to a second term and the House Republicans who held their majority illustrates a striking dichotomy in the nation's body politic: the president and a majority of senators, including a growing number of Republicans, back compromise on tax rates and say the public is on their side, and a majority of the House, in artfully drawn districts, claim just the opposite. 
''We ran aggressively talking about taxes and growth and spending, as did the president,'' said Representative Sean P. Duffy, a first-term Republican from Wisconsin, who despite being a top target of Democrats easily won re-election by 12 percentage points. ''The president keeps talking about his mandate. Well, he doesn't have a mandate in the Seventh District.''
Given the electoral dynamics, the lawmakers who are broaching the possibility of raising tax rates as a way to strike a deal and prevent the possibility of a recession are beginning to appeal to House members with a term not heard often in the House -- the national interest.
The numbers explain how both the president and House Republicans see themselves on solid ground. National polling has consistently shown a public that favors raising taxes on the affluent to help bring down the deficit. But few Republicans in the House fear the political ramifications of such polls.
''My constituents want me to stand firm on cutting spending. I campaigned on that issue. That's why they elected me,'' said Representative Ted Poe, Republican of Texas, who won re-election with 65 percent of the vote. ''I don't see any scenario where raising tax rates, in any combination of compromise, will solve our problem.''
Of the 234 House Republicans who will sit in the 113th Congress, 85 percent won re-election with 55 percent of the vote; more than half of next year's House Republican Conference won more than 60 percent. And virtually every one of them ran on holding the line against tax increases and the Obama agenda.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee on Monday began automated phone calls in 35 Republican House districts accusing members of ''holding the middle class hostage to get more reckless, budget-busting tax cuts for millionaires.'' Unions and liberal interest groups have run advertisements, mounted protests and organized phone campaigns to pressure Republicans to increase tax rates for the rich.
But even most of the Republicans on the target lists won re-election handily.
''Another series of robocalls or fliers or TV ads are not going to change the opinion of my constituents,'' said Representative Scott Garrett, Republican of New Jersey, who won more than 55 percent in November but still drew the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's attention Monday.
House Democratic candidates won about 50.5 percent of the national vote in November, but took just 46 percent of the seats. In the last 40 years, only one other time -- 1996 -- did the party that won the majority of the votes end up with a minority of the House, said Nicholas Goedert, a political science researcher at Washington University in St. Louis in Missouri. Democrats actually gained two seats in the Senate.
Political scientists point to two factors influencing this divergence: a redistricting process dominated by Republican legislatures, and even more so, the concentration of Democratic voters in urban enclaves.
Gerrymandering did matter. In nine states redistricted by Republicans, the Democratic vote share was well above the percentage of seats won, Mr. Goedert said. For instance, in North Carolina, Democratic House candidates won 51 percent of the vote but only 27 percent of the House seats. Where Democrats drew the lines, in Illinois, Maryland and Massachusetts, Democratic House delegations fared better than their vote totals, but not as drastically. This points to an inherent advantage for Republicans. In closely contested years, like 2012, the concentration of Democratic voters in cities has put them at a loss -- and given House Republicans little reason to fear national opinion.
''I do believe we have to do what's right for the country,'' said Representative James B. Renacci, Republican of Ohio, who competed in one of the most expensive House races in the country against a Democratic incumbent in a redrawn district and still won by a surprisingly comfortable 4.4 percentage points. ''But I have a real problem raising tax rates as an answer.''
The Republican comfort in their districts suggests that standard political pressure tactics will not work in trying to sell a compromise. The appeal has to be loftier -- to the national interest or at least the political future of the national Republican Party, said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the House Democratic leadership's liaison to the budget talks.
Speaker John A. Boehner must appeal to his members in ways that go beyond their constituents, he said: ''Do you care more about the country, or at least the future success of the national Republican Party, or are you only interested in your political self-preservation?''
Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a loyal Boehner lieutenant who nonetheless has been advocating compromise on higher rates, puts it differently. He frames it as this: tax rates are going up Jan. 1, when the Bush-era tax cuts expire, whether Republicans like it or not. The party now has to find a victory in compromise that allows rates to rise on the affluent few while locking in long-sought spending cuts and changes to entitlement programs like Medicare.
''I don't think voting to cut spending, restrain and reform entitlements and make the Bush tax cuts permanent for 98 percent of the American people is voting against the will of anyone's constituents, including my own,'' he said. ''President Obama and the Democratic Senate have to be part of any agreement that prevents taxes from rising on almost everyone who pays income taxes. That is just political reality. Given that hard reality, I believe most voters will accept a deal that keeps their taxes from going up and makes real progress on the deficit.''

HEADLINE: McDonald's Sales Help Shares Inch Higher

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks edged higher on Monday after a strong sales report from McDonald's offset concerns about the surprise resignation of Italy's prime minister. Investors also waited for developments in budget talks in the United States.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 14.75 points, or 0.11 percent, to 13,169.88. The index traded within a range of just 56 points throughout the day. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index finished 0.48 of point, or 0.03 percent, higher at 1,418.55. The Nasdaq composite index rose 8.92 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,986.96.
McDonald's stock rose 93 cents to close at $89.41. A crucial sales figure rose in November as customers in the United States bought more breakfast offerings and limited-time offers like Cheddar Bacon Onion sandwiches. 
Robert Pavlik, the chief market strategist at Banyan Partners in Palm Beach, Fla., said the company's strength was encouraging. McDonald's, one of the 30 stocks in the Dow, traded as high as $100 at the beginning of 2012.
The pickup in McDonald's sales, he said, gave investors something positive to focus on as Italy's sudden political turmoil sent a jolt through European markets.
The Italian prime minister, Mario Monti, who has been credited with restoring confidence in the nation's economy, announced on Saturday that he would step down after the party of Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime minister, dropped its support for Monti's government.
Italian government bond yields, a critical measure of how much the country has to pay to borrow, jumped. Concern that the European debt crisis was enveloping Italy, one of the euro region's largest economies, helped stymie markets around the world earlier in the year.
Investors also followed developments in the budget talks in Washington. Tax increases and federal spending cuts will start on Jan. 1 unless a deal is reached to reduce the United States budget deficit. Economists say the measures, if carried out, could eventually push the economy back into recession.
President Obama and the House speaker, John Boehner, met at the White House on Sunday, while rank-and-file Republicans stepped forward with what they called pragmatic ideas to break the stalemate. The Obama-Boehner meeting was the first between just the two leaders since Election Day.
Hewlett-Packard shares rose 35 cents to close at $14.16 and helped push the Dow higher. The company's stock has been battered the last two months after a weak earnings forecast and a public spat with the founder of Autonomy, a company it acquired last year for $10 billion.
Among stocks making big moves, Priceline.com fell $33.14, or 5 percent, to $625.96, after Deutsche Bank cut its recommendation on the stock to hold from buy and lowered its price target to $710 from $800.
Phillips 66, the refining and pipeline company, gained $1.24, or 2.4 percent, to $53.58 after saying late on Friday that it would raise its quarterly dividend to 31.25 cents a share from 25 cents. The company also said it had approved the repurchase of another $1 billion in company stock. It approved the repurchase of $1 billion during the first quarter.
Intermec, a maker of bar code printers and radio frequency identification products, jumped $1.85, or 23.2 percent, to $9.83 after it agreed to be acquired by Honeywell for $603.4 million.
The American International Group fell 77 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $33.36 after the insurer said late on Friday that it would take $1.3 billion in losses related to Hurricane Sandy, more than other major insurance companies have reported. UBS said in a client note that A.I.G.'s Hurricane Sandy losses had exceeded its estimate.
Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note was up 1/32 at 100 2/32. The yield was unchanged at 1.62 percent.

HEADLINE: European Officials Accept Union's Nobel Peace Prize

BYLINE: By ANDREW HIGGINS

 BODY:
OSLO -- Besieged by economic woes and insistent questions about its future, the European Union accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on Monday with calls for further integration and a plea to remember the words of Abraham Lincoln as he addressed a divided nation at Gettysburg.
The prize ceremony, held in Oslo's City Hall and attended by 20 European leaders as well as Norway's royal family, brought a rare respite from the gloom that has settled on the European Union since the Greek debt crisis exploded three years ago, unleashing doubt about the long-term viability of the euro and about an edifice of European institutions built up over more than half a century to promote an ever closer union. 
Unemployment -- now at over 25 percent in Greece and Spain -- and sputtering economic growth across the 27-nation bloc are ''putting the political bonds of our union to the test,'' Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, said in his acceptance speech. ''If I can borrow the words of Abraham Lincoln at the time of another continental test, what is being assessed today is whether that union, or any union so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.''
The European Union, said Mr. Van Rompuy, will ''answer with our deeds, confident we will succeed.''
''We are working very hard to overcome the difficulties, to restore growth and jobs,'' he continued.
Aside from economic misery, the most serious threat to the bloc so far is growing pressure in Britain for a referendum on whether to pull out of the union. The British prime minister, David Cameron, did not attend the ceremony, but most other European leaders showed up, including Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and the French president, François Hollande, who sat next to each other and whose countries, once bitter enemies, have been the main motors driving European integration.
Mr. Van Rompuy's comparison of the European Union to the United States is likely to irritate critics of the European Union, who reject efforts to push European nations to surrender more sovereignty in pursuit of what champions of a federal European state hope will one day be a United States of Europe.
Just how far Europe is from such a goal, however, was made clear by the presence of three Union presidents in Oslo. In addition to Mr. Van Rompuy, whose European Council represents the leaders of the union's member states, there was José Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, the bloc's main administrative and policy-making arm, and Martin Schulz, president of the European Parliament.
Instead of the customary Nobel lecture delivered by the winner, Mr. Van Rompuy and Mr. Barroso each read parts of what Thorbjorn Jagland, chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, described as ''one speech but two chapters.''
Hailing the European Union for helping bring peace to Europe after repeated wars, Mr. Jagland said, ''What this continent has achieved is truly fantastic, from being a continent of war to becoming a continent of peace.''
Mr. Barroso spoke of the horrors of past wars and tyranny and Europe's efforts to overcome them through the building of supranational institutions, which began in 1951 with the establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community by France, Germany and four other countries. But he also cited the current conflict in Syria, describing it as a ''stain on the world's conscience'' that other nations have ''a moral duty'' to address. The European Union's member states are themselves divided about how far to go in supporting opponents of Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president.
The decision to honor the European Union with the Nobel Peace Prize stirred widespread criticism in Norway, whose citizens have twice voted not to join the union. On the eve of Monday's award ceremony, peace activists and supporters of left-wing political groups paraded through the streets of Oslo, carrying flaming torches and chanting, ''The E.U. is not a worthy winner.''
Many peace activists say they have no problem with European integration but question whether the union has lived up to conditions laid down by Alfred Nobel, the 19th-century Swedish industrialist who bequeathed the peace prize and four other Nobel Prizes.

HEADLINE: Obama, With Blue-Collar Backdrop, Presses Case for Higher Taxes on the Richest

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
REDFORD, Mich. -- Using a German-owned truck factory as a grease-stained backdrop, President Obama on Monday pressed his case for higher tax rates for the richest Americans, declaring that his economic program would cut the deficit without crimping the job market.
''Our economic success has never come from the top down,'' Mr. Obama said to a few hundred cheering autoworkers. ''It comes from the middle out; it comes from the bottom up.'' 
A day after the president and the House speaker, John A. Boehner, held face-to-face budget talks at the White House, Mr. Obama took his case again to the American public -- a tactic he has used repeatedly to go around reluctant party leaders in Congress.
This time, he chose a nearly 75-year-old truck engine maker, where the owner, the German company Daimler, announced $120 million in investments in new production that will create 115 jobs.
In a speech replete with the cadences of his late-inning campaign swings, Mr. Obama ratcheted up the pressure on Republicans, who are still resisting his call for higher tax rates on income above $250,000 a year, three weeks before a deadline that could set off across-the-board tax increases and automatic spending cuts.
Under his plan, Mr. Obama said, taxes would not increase for 98 percent of Americans, and even those whose taxes would rise would not be taxed at a higher rate on their first $250,000 of income. But fairness, he said, demanded that those earning much more pay a greater share.
''I'm not going to have a situation where the wealthiest among us, including folks like me, get to keep all our tax breaks, and then we're asking students to pay higher student loans,'' he said.
The White House is also cranking up the machinery of the Obama campaign to help in the battle. On Monday, the campaign sent an e-mail to its entire mailing list from its deputy manager, Stephanie Cutter, urging supporters in Republican districts to press their representative to agree to the mix of higher tax rates and spending cuts offered by Mr. Obama.
''Who will decide if your taxes increase in just 22 days?'' Ms. Cutter said. ''A few dozen members of the House of Representatives, that's who.'' A spokeswoman, Katie Hogan, said that the campaign had sent updates to supporters about the fiscal negotiations a few times since the election, but that this one was unusual for its wide distribution.
In Mr. Obama's first visit to Michigan since the election, he still seemed to be in election mode, presenting the fiscal debate as a choice about what kind of future America will have. But he skipped partisan attacks on the Republicans and devoted much of his remarks to extolling Detroit Diesel as an example of how the country can rebound.
Daimler, which owns Detroit Diesel, will invest in new equipment to make truck engines, axles, and transmissions on a single site at the sprawling factory in this suburb of Detroit. That will improve the integration of its components, said Mr. Obama, who took a tour of the plant floor and watched a demonstration of pistons being inserted into an engine.
Detroit Diesel, a manufacturer of heavy-duty trucks, traces its roots to 1938. It was sold to Daimler in 2000, after Daimler had acquired Chrysler. The company remained part of Daimler after it sold off Chrysler, amid heavy losses, to a private equity firm in 2007. The carmaker was rescued in a bailout by the Obama administration.
Jay Carney, the White House spokesman, said Daimler's up-and-down history in Detroit was less of an issue for Mr. Obama than what it was doing now. ''He's focused on the present and future,'' Mr. Carney said to reporters on Air Force One.
Indeed, Mr. Obama praised Daimler as a company that was willing to invest in manufacturing in the United States.
''For a long time companies, they weren't always making those kinds of investments here in the United States,'' he said, ''They certainly weren't willing to make them in the U.S. automotive industry.''
If the factory attested to Detroit's brightening future, Mr. Obama's ride from the airport spoke to the city's troubled past. Lining the president's motorcade route, which also passed the headquarters of Ford Motor Company, were boarded-up houses, storefronts and factories.

HEADLINE: Taking Aim at Michigan's Middle Class

 BODY:
The decline of the middle class in this country has paralleled that of the labor movement, which has been battered by the relentless efforts of business groups and Republicans to drive down wages, boost corporate profits and inflate executive salaries and bonuses. Now that campaign is on the verge of a devastating victory in Michigan, home of the modern labor movement, which could transform the state's economy for the worse. 
On Tuesday, the Republican-controlled Legislature is expected to pass a law that would allow workers to avoid paying dues to a union that represents their shop. Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, has reversed an earlier position and said he would sign the law. Democratic officials, labor leaders and workers are urging him to reconsider, knowing that a business victory in Michigan, of all places, would encourage other states to make the same mistake.
These measures are misleadingly known as ''right to work'' laws, and their purpose is no less deceptive. Business leaders say workers should not be forced to join a union against their will, but, in fact, workers in Michigan can already opt out of a union. If they benefit from the better wages and benefits negotiated by a union, however, they are required to pay dues or fees, preventing the free riders that would inevitably leave unions without resources.
Concern for the rights of individual workers, of course, is not the real reason business is pushing so hard for these laws. Gutting unions is the fastest way to achieve lower wages and higher profits. Last year, in support of an Indiana antidues laws that later passed, the Indiana Chamber of Commerce said the law would draw businesses to the state for lower labor costs. A study by the University of Notre Dame in January found that the average wages and benefits for nonfarm workers in right-to-work states was $57,732, while in states without the law it was $65,567. States with antidues laws have higher rates of poverty and lower rates of health coverage.
Republican officials also know that depriving unions of dues will hurt Democratic candidates, who usually win the support of labor. As President Obama said at a diesel plant in Redford, Mich., on Monday, ''These so-called 'right-to-work' laws, they don't have to do with economics, they have everything to do with politics. What they're really talking about is giving you the right to work for less money.''
Mr. Snyder's turnabout shocked workers in his state, and Democratic officials have spent the last few days urging him to reconsider and prevent a needless drive to the bottom. By withholding his signature, he can ensure that Michigan remains both the birthplace and the economic foundation of middle-class security.

HEADLINE: 'You Did It,' A.I.G. Chief Tells Workers

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Robert H. Benmosche, the American International Group's chief executive, congratulated A.I.G.'s employees on their work reviving the company as the Treasury Department sold off the government's remaining stake at a profit. 

 BODY:
Since signing on as chief executive of the American International Group, Robert H. Benmosche has made one goal clear: repaying American taxpayers in full for bailing out the insurer during the depths of the financial crisis. 
After the Treasury Department completed the sale of its remaining stake in A.I.G., bringing the government's profit on the bailout to $22.7 billion, Mr. Benmosche appears to be over the moon about accomplishing that objective.
"It marks one of the most extraordinary - and what many believed to be the most unlikely - turnarounds in American business history," he wrote in a memorandum to employees obtained by DealBook. "And you did it."
 But in the memo, Mr. Benmosche emphasized that A.I.G.'s employees still had much work to do in transforming the company into a streamlined insurer that could thrive as a privately owned enterprise.

HEADLINE: Prime Minister's Ousting Complicates Strategy to Curb Mali's Islamists

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Europe, Africa and the United States have spent months discussing what to do about an Islamist takeover of northern Mali. The situation has just gotten more complex. 

 BODY:
LONDON - Slow-moving international efforts to confront an Islamist takeover of northern Mali, described at the United Nations this week as "one of the potentially most explosive corners of the world," just got more complicated.
Early on Tuesday, a grim-faced Cheikh Modibo Diarra appeared on Mali's state television to announce what appeared to be his forced resignation as prime minister of the African desert state.
A former NASA scientist, Mr. Diarra had been arrested by soldiers as he was about to take a flight to France. They were from the same military group who staged a coup in Bamako, the capital, in March before handing power back to civilians the following month. 
The early assessment of the prime minister's departure was that he had upset the military by trying to establish his own political base ahead of future elections.
The March coup created a vacuum in the country that allowed a power grab in the north by separatist Tuareg tribesmen. 
But these were soon pushed aside by radical Islamists, some linked to Al Qaeda, who have since imposed a brutal fundamentalist regime on a fiefdom the size of Texas.
It is funded with the proceeds of drug, cigarette and people smuggling. One of the key players in the north, a one-eyed jihadist named Mokhtar Bel Mokhtar El-Aouar, is also known as "Mister Malboro."
Spain's El País reported this month that northern Mali had become a magnet for thousands of young Islamists from around the world, who were flocking to the region in pursuit of jihad and a secure income.
The newspaper quoted military experts as saying it would require six months to train a 3,000-strong intervention army at a cost of (EURO)70 million to oust the Islamists.
European and African governments, and the United States, are all too aware of the threat of an African "Afghanistan" emerging south of the Mediterranean. The challenge is what to do about it.
Differences among Africans, Europeans, the United States and the U.N., have so far stymied the formulation of a united and coherent policy.
The last time Rendezvous reported on the Mali crisis, in October, European Union states had just announced their readiness to send military trainers to Mali to prepare African troops for a planned intervention.
Since then, Ban Ki-moon, the U.N. Secretary-General, has recommended that the Security Council approve the deployment of an African peace enforcement mission. But he did not offer that the U.N. would pay for it.
He also warned that military intervention could "risk ruining any chance of a negotiated political solution to the crisis, which remains the best hope of ensuring long-term stability in Mali."
The West Africa regional bloc, the Economic Community of West African States, has agreed to commit 3,300 troops for an international force.
However, the ECOWAS plan has been described as confused and incomplete by U.N. and European critics.
Mr. Diarra's ousting is a potential blow to a policy, espoused by the United States, to put political reform and early elections at the forefront of a strategy to combat the extremists.
That has put Washington at odds with France, the former colonial power in Mali, which wants the United Nations to move quickly to back a military intervention by troops from neighboring African states. 
Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told the Security Council on Monday that it must be careful to address the crisis in Mali without destabilizing the entire Sahara region.
Johnnie Carson, the State Department's Africa spokesman, told a U.S. Senate subcommittee last week that what Mali needed more than ever was a strong democratic government "to restore its democratic tradition and provide the strong leadership necessary to negotiate a political agreement with northern rebels."
He said such a government would reform the security sector, "and lead a military intervention in the north to restore and maintain Mali's territorial integrity."
The various Islamist groups who hold sway in the north should not expect an offensive anytime soon. 
Hervé Ladsous, the U.N.'s peacekeeping chief, said last week that, although international military intervention to oust the militants was almost inevitable, nothing would happen before next September.

HEADLINE: Finding Big Start-Up Ideas, Even in Small Cities

BYLINE: SARAH MAX


HIGHLIGHT: Small cities are now nurturing start-ups by offering business incubators, accelerators and conferences for entrepreneurs. 

 BODY:
Rick DeVos could not wait to leave Grand Rapids, Mich. After high school, he made a beeline to Pepperdine University near Los Angeles and spent a year studying in London, but eventually returned home to finish his degree at Calvin College. "My family has deep roots in Grand Rapids," he said. "I missed the grounding and humility of the Midwest."
Now, Mr. DeVos, 30, the grandson of the Amway co-founder Richard DeVos, is trying to infuse the entrepreneurial spirit of big cities in his hometown of 190,000 people.
In April, he began Start Garden, a $15 million early-stage venture capital fund backed by his family. Start-ups, which initially receive $5,000 in seed capital, have three months to prove their ideas and compete for additional financing at a monthly event called Update Night. It is not nearly as cutthroat as "Shark Tank," Mr. DeVos said, referring to the reality show about entrepreneurs. "But it is a little counterculture to the Midwest, where people are used to hearing: 'That's a nice idea. Let's keep in touch.' " 
Mr. DeVos, with a growing group of venture capitalists and angel investors, is betting that budding entrepreneurs are everywhere, even in Western Michigan.
Business incubators, conferences and accelerators, or entrepreneurial crash courses - mainstays of start-ups - are increasingly appearing beyond San Francisco, Boston, New York and other hubs. Taking a page from the Silicon Valley playbook, small cities like Grand Rapids, Burlington, Vt., and Bend, Ore., are nurturing start-ups.
In Kentucky, the investor Ray Moncrief helps oversee four funds totaling $160 million that invest in start-ups in and near Appalachia. "Most venture capital is focused on either coast, but that's not to say those are the only places good deals can be found," Mr. Moncrief said. He vets 70 to 100 ideas a year, and recently financed a company that makes carbon silicon chips for electric cars and another that makes shelters for military personnel.
"The cost structure for building a company out of Silicon Valley is a lot more attractive," said Pete Bernardoni, a managing director of Wavepoint Ventures in El Dorado Hills, Calif. The company is raising its second fund focused on early-stage companies in Northern California, mainly those outside San Francisco and Silicon Valley. "There are sharp entrepreneurs all over who don't necessarily want to relocate their start-ups," he said.
That has become the battle hymn of economic developers in areas off the beaten path.
Historically, such groups have focused their efforts on recruiting large employers to a region. But they now view entrepreneurship as another option.
"When the avenues for job creation are limited, economic development organizations are looking at other ways to create jobs," said Angelos Angelou, principal of AngelouEconomics, an economic development company based in Austin, Tex. "Entrepreneurship definitely has been the focus for the last 10 or 15 years."
Success is not always measured in employment growth. Many of the best start-ups will be acquired by outside companies, and the jobs often go with them. Others will not succeed.
But even if they fail or cash out, that often creates a virtuous cycle that benefits the local economy. Assuming the founders stay, they may start other companies, finance different ventures or become mentors for the next batch of start-ups, said Brad Feld, co-founder of TechStars and Foundry Group, an early-stage fund based in Boulder, Colo.
Mr. Feld said that he had invested in hundreds of start-ups since 1995, including about 100 based in Boulder. "Places build on themselves," he added, "but it takes a very long time."
Cities rich in start-ups often share characteristics. Local universities tend to play a major role. Even if the students are not aspiring Mark Zuckerbergs, the universities offer resources and, in many cases, cheap and eager labor.
For example, Burlington draws from the University of Vermont, Middlebury College and other nearby campuses. A strong urban core with restaurants, art and night life is also important. In Austin, the Sixth Street music scene has long been a draw to would-be entrepreneurs, Mr. Angelou said.
"Each community needs to develop to its own strengths," said Richard Fox, principal at Astralis Group, a business advisory company based in Orlando, Fla., and a board member of the National Association of Seed and Venture Funds.
Many ideas are born of necessity.
About 150 miles north of the California border, Bend, Ore., was a dying mill town that experienced a renaissance beginning in the 1990s, when retirees, second-home buyers and urban refugees came in search of affordable housing and easy access to the bounties of the Cascade Mountains.
Still, newcomers and old-timers alike realized they needed or wanted to do something other than drink microbrews and ride mountain bikes. Economic developers understood that the city could not sustain itself on tourism and service industries alone.
In a little more than a decade, Bend, a town of 78,000, has created a rich ecosystem, a popular term in emerging entrepreneurial enclaves, with an accelerator, a weekend boot camp for aspiring entrepreneurs, an annual venture conference and a monthly "PubTalk" featuring successful entrepreneurs and early-stage companies seeking capital.
In 2012, a record 70 companies applied for the Bend Venture Conference, which invites start-ups to present their ideas to a group of angel investors who contribute a minimum of $5,000. The conference is open to entrepreneurs across the state.
"We want investors to feel they have the best shot of investing in the best companies, and it also raises the bar for local companies," said Jim Coonan, venture catalyst manager for Economic Development for Central Oregon, the nonprofit organization that sponsors the event. "The key is the exposure and the feedback."
The six finalists this year included a biotech company with a solution to drug resistance, a hydrogen fuel system for cell towers and a small-business loyalty app that raises money for charitable causes.
The winner, Sonivate Medical of Beaverton, Ore., received $265,000 in financing for its fingertip-mounted ultrasound probe, while two other finalists, both from Bend, received a total of $85,000. If past years are any indication, Mr. Coonan said, most of the finalists will go on to get additional financing.
Local capital is not a prerequisite for creating a robust entrepreneurial community, but local investors with deep pockets certainly help. "It's a little of a chicken-or-the-egg scenario," Mr. Angelou said. He pointed to the success of Dell beginning in the late 1980s as the turning point for Austin's makeover from college town to start-up hub.
Back in Grand Rapids, Meijer one-stop shopping stores; Steelcase, the office furniture maker; and Wolverine World Wide, a shoemaker, are helping to support the next generation of businesses, directly and indirectly. These companies and Amway have collaborated on GRid70, a design and innovation center. The Van Andel Institute, a leading cancer, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's research institute, is an anchor for other biotech companies and research organizations.
Mr. DeVos said he simply enjoyed being part of the creative process and understood the broader effect of fostering new ideas. "There's not going to be a white knight that will come in and create a new industry for us," he said. "We need to nurture our own entrepreneurial spirit."

HEADLINE: For China's 'Great Renewal,' 8 Trends to Keep an Eye On

BYLINE: BILL BISHOP


HIGHLIGHT: The Bo Xilai scandal, an economic downturn and the leadership switch from Hu Jintao to Xi Jinping made 2012 one of China's most eventful years. It is hard to imagine that next year will be as exciting, but there will be change. 

 BODY:
BEIJING -- The Bo Xilai scandal, an economic downturn and the leadership switch from Hu Jintao to Xi Jinping made 2012 one of China's most eventful years. It is hard to imagine that next year will be as exciting, but there will be change.
Here are eight likely trends for 2013: 
 SHIFT IN GROWTH The economy is rebounding after slowing sharply through the first three quarters of 2012. The recovery is mostly stimulus-driven and heavily weighted toward state-owned enterprises and large industrial companies. The 2013 official target for economic growth is expected to be set at 7.5 percent, and the economy should meet it, although excessive debt, a bloated state sector, entrenched special interests, income disparity, rural-urban inequality and lagging corporate profits will remain problems. Expect increased emphasis on the quality of growth, urbanization and rural reform as well as some painful progress in rebalancing from overinvestment to consumption-driven growth.
 NEW LEADER Xi Jinping has moved quickly in his first three weeks to project an image of change. The government faces a growing expectations gap with its citizens and needs to move quickly to rebuild public confidence. Mr. Xi is talking a lot about the Chinese dream and the "great renewal of the Chinese nation" - nationalist concepts with significant appeal. Mr. Xi's choice of Shenzhen for his first domestic inspection trip is a symbolic tribute to Deng Xiaoping's 1992 southern tour that restarted reforms after 1989. Mr. Xi's visit is most likely a signal that he is serious about pushing forward with changes. Expect renewed energy around overhauls, primarily economic and administrative but possibly some political ones.
 CRACKDOWN ON CORRUPTION The new leadership has begun a public crackdown on corruption. One relatively senior official and several minor officials have already fallen. Internet exposés brought down the minor officials, but there are reports that the Communist Party's central disciplinary inspection commission has started new investigations into money-laundering through Macau. Expect this antigraft campaign to ensnare more senior officials and to be the most effective in recent memory, yet ultimately stop short of addressing the systemic issues that have allowed corruption to flourish.
 TROUBLE WITH THE NEIGHBORS China's external environment is increasingly complex. Mr. Xi is likely to work hard maintaining stable relations with the United States, while at the same time expanding China's military capabilities and asserting its regional interests. China has unsettled its neighbors with its approach to the disputes over the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea and the various islands in the South China Sea. Both issues look intractable, so a solution is unlikely in 2013. Expect a quickening arms race in Asia, increasingly nationalist rhetoric, continued tensions with Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines and growing risks of misunderstandings - and possible mishaps - as the various countries send more vessels into the disputed areas.
 NOT EASY BEING GREEN China has some of the worst environmental problems in the world, and they increasingly pose a threat to social stability. The leadership is aware of the problems, and the report from the 18th Communist Party Congress included a section calling for improving the environment. Expect increased emphasis on clean energy, conservation and green growth, though the challenges are so huge that it is hard to be optimistic.
 RISING ACTIVISM Environmental issues are leading to political activism. In 2012 China had several not-in-my-backyard protests involving thousands of people, many of whom mobilized online. Social media use, especially via smartphones, is rapidly expanding from urban to rural users and is making it much harder to cover up problems. The government now requires that all major industrial projects pass a social risk assessment before they begin. Expect more environmental protests as citizens become more aware of their rights and are emboldened to protect them.
 INTERNET PRESSURE China has the most Internet users in the world. At some point in 2013 its population on the Internet will exceed 600 million people. China has a sophisticated Internet censorship and filtering system that is unlikely to disappear. But that does not mean the Internet will not pressure the government. Cheap smartphones with good cameras and 3G connectivity are proliferating, in large part thanks to Google's Android mobile operating system. China is expected to have several hundred million smartphone users by the end of 2013. The Internet is unlikely to bring change to the system, certainly. But all those smartphone-wielding, social media-using citizens will force a more accountable authoritarianism. Expect more scandals to break online and increasingly responsive, accountable government at all levels.
 OVERSEAS INVESTMENT Chinese companies are going global, both by expanding their operations overseas and by acquiring foreign firms. Yet Chinese investment is a contentious issue in the United States and other developed countries, and several deals failed in 2012 at the hands of regulators. Huawei, a Chinese networking and telecommunications giant, is now effectively blocked from doing business in the United States because of security concerns. Regardless, Chinese companies will continue to invest overseas, both to increase and to secure resources. Tencent, for one, is on the verge of becoming China's first globally competitive Internet company. Its WeChat mobile social networking application already has more than 200 million users and may give Facebook a run for its money in many developing countries. Expect growing overseas investment, increasing political scrutiny of Chinese deals and possibly invitations to WeChat from your social networking friends.
All in all, Mr. Xi appears to be a change-oriented nationalist. His energetic and straightforward style, his apparent commitment to fighting corruption and his determination to reinvigorate at least economic reform should buy the government time to tackle some of China's difficult problems in 2013.

HEADLINE: An Architect of Wall Street Reform Prepares for Life After Politics

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Representative Barney Frank says getting the Dodd-Frank Act passed was his hardest-fought battle in more than 30 years in Congress. 

 BODY:
When a new Congress convenes next month, Wall Street will lose a longtime foe. Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who helped lead a regulatory crackdown after the financial crisis, is retiring after more than 30 years on Capitol Hill.
An unapologetic liberal with a sharp tongue and a knack for financial minutiae, Mr. Frank built a broad legacy as an advocate for affordable housing, an opponent of the death penalty and one of President Bill Clinton's staunchest supporters during impeachment proceedings.
Mr. Frank, who in 1987 became the first sitting member of Congress to volunteer that he was gay, also championed efforts to shield gay people from discrimination - efforts like the repeal of "don't ask, don't tell," the law that banned them from serving openly in the military.
 As the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Mr. Frank scored a signature legislative victory with the passing of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the financial regulatory law. Passed in response to the crisis, the law reshaped the financial landscape and reined in some of the riskiest corners of Wall Street, including the derivatives market and proprietary trading. 
Now he is ready for a break. Mr. Frank, 72, recently married his longtime partner, Jim Ready. He also shed roughly 25 pounds and hired a book agent. In short, he is counting the seconds until life after politics.
On a recent break from packing up his Washington office, Mr. Frank reflected on his 16-term tenure. The speed-talking congressman, dressed in his usual disheveled manner, discussed his role in the Troubled Asset Relief Program, better known as the bank bailout, the battle over Dodd-Frank and his next career as an author.
The following is an edited excerpt from the interview.
 Q. 
 You are weeks away from leaving. Is the feeling bittersweet? Relief? Both?
 A. 
 Oh, it's mostly relief. I'm just tired. Look, I'm still here, and I still have responsibility. But when the people who work for me or somebody else calls me with a problem, my first reaction is, "Well, do I have to?"
 Q. 
 You come from a blue-collar family in Bayonne, N.J. You hold degrees from Harvard and Harvard Law School. You were a "Freedom Summer" volunteer in 1964. And you've spent nearly 40 years in politics. What's next?
 A. 
 I want to be an active participant in the public debate. In some ways more effectively - I hope - than I've been now. There's an awful skepticism about what we say, those of us who are in elected office. And I expect to say the same things I've been saying, but without them being screened through this, "Oh, you're just doing that to get votes."
 Q. 
 What type of platform are you seeking?
 A. 
 One, I'm going to write a book. I hope to write two. And I've always liked to write. Talking comes easily to me. Writing is harder. And I have an agent and I'm working on a couple of book proposals. At the start, one is a general advocacy piece about liberals and what we should be doing.
 Q. 
 What should liberals do?
 A. 
 First of all, stop trying to ride two horses. Stop trying to push for the expansion of important government programs while joining in the bashing of government. It doesn't work. I think liberals should say, "We think government's a good thing, done right, and we're for expanding it." But then the way you effectuate that, in my judgment, is by a substantial reduction in America's military budget.
During that memorable evening when Clint Eastwood lost a debate to a chair, the one thing he said that was coherent and that got some applause, or a lot of applause, was when he said, "Why don't we pull out of Afghanistan?" I mean, that got kind of lost in the general shambles of that performance. But the Republicans cheered him for saying, well, why don't we just get out altogether? The public's ready to do that.
 Q. 
 What about the second book?
 A. 
 The second book is a history of the gay rights movement.
 Q. 
 How has the environment on Capitol Hill changed for gay lawmakers?
 A. 
 Things have gotten tremendously better. The first thing that brought that about, very simply, was our being honest about who we are. When I started, I was closeted myself. People didn't know any gay or lesbian people, they thought.
I think the country has moved considerably on. Reality has helped. We've had same-sex marriage. We've had gays in the military. So we're on the verge of a total breakthrough.
 Q. 
 Was Dodd-Frank your most significant contribution as a congressman?
 A. 
 I don't like to answer questions like that because you start getting into self-judgments. And when you get into self-judgments, you're either unattractively arrogant, or, literally, incredibly humble.
 Q. 
 O.K., then was Dodd-Frank your hardest-fought battle?
 A. 
 It was. Well, I'm also pleased with the role I played in fighting discrimination based on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender status. Low-income housing was one. But yeah, in terms of legislative achievement, it was a major effort.
 Q. 
 What could you have done better? For example, you've been vocal about your displeasure with the so-called Durbin amendment, the Dodd-Frank rule that limits the amount banks can charge retail shops when a consumer swipes a debit card. And why allow federal regulators to pre-empt state authorities that also oversee the banks?
 A. 
 I would have liked to go further with the pre-emption issue.
In no rational world will you have a separate Securities and Exchange Commission and a Commodity Futures Trading Commission. So that one I would have liked to change. I was sorry that my three Republican friends who voted for the bill did so only after making us take the $20 billion assessment off the banks and financial houses and put it onto the taxpayer.
I'm not a fan of the Durbin amendment. I think that's not going to help the consumer. That was intervening in a fight between two economic groups that should be left to their own.
 Q. 
 Do you also have regrets about your past support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the housing finance giants that took nearly $200 billion in government bailouts? When the housing market collapsed, they did, too.
 A. 
 I was wrong in thinking that the general housing market would hold up some.
With Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, I did support an increase in their role in affordable rental housing. But by 2005, I saw the need for changes. And the key is, when I became chairman, when I had power, we regulated Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
 Q. 
 You are known for blistering outbursts about your opponents. You once sarcastically said that Newt Gingrich "considers himself one of the intellectual leaders of the free world." Who is currently the most irritating or difficult person in Washington?
 A. 
 Oh, there are obviously several. At this point, the one who I think is the least constructive is Mitch McConnell.
I've felt for some time that if you're going to be in a leadership position, you should have a very safe seat. If you're going to be in a leadership position in a legislative body, you're going to have to do some things that are going to be unpopular.
I'll give an example in my own case. I happened to be the chairman when the need came to stabilize the economy in the face of a banking collapse in a bipartisan way, at the request of the Bush administration. And we did the TARP, the loans to banks.
I think it's going to be clear, TARP will go down historically as the most highly successful, wildly unpopular policy in the history of America. And I lost 14 points in the last election because of it. Fortunately for me, I had a 68 percent majority in 2008. So when I lost 14 points, I still got 54 percent.
 Q. 
 Reflecting back on your Congressional career, what was your favorite moment?
 A. 
 Well, probably the repeal of "Don't ask, don't tell." When that got repealed, both in terms of what it meant for gay people in terms of repealing this libel that there was something the matter with us, uh, and in terms of what it meant for the country, that was a very high moment.

HEADLINE: Federal Regulators Stay on the Full-Court Press

BYLINE: PETER J. HENNING


HIGHLIGHT: Expect prosecutors, aided by a steady of stream of whistle-blowers, to focus on violations that involve hedge funds and foreign bribery. 

 BODY:
It has become the era of the star prosecutor in white-collar crime. Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan who is closely identified with a string of prominent insider trading cases, was on the cover of Time magazine in February. This fall, he even got a shout-out from Bruce Springsteen during a concert.
Robert S. Khuzami, head of the enforcement division of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is being considered for the chairmanship of the agency. That may be Wall Street's worst nightmare. Goldman Sachs, for one, knows Mr. Khuzami's aggressive approach, considering that he headed up the case that led the firm to reach a $550 million settlement over a security tied to bad mortgages.
Although some have been critical, saying that not enough criminal actions have been filed since the financial crisis, the Justice Department and the S.E.C. have been fierce in their prosecution of other white-collar crimes. That assertive tone is not likely to change over the next four years under President Obama. 
With that in mind, three areas are likely to receive special attention: hedge funds, cases involving whistle-blowers and investigations into foreign bribery and corruption.
 HEDGE FUNDS A TARGET Hedge funds long operated largely free from regulation by the S.E.C. The Dodd-Frank Act changed that for larger funds, which now have to register as investment advisers and strengthen compliance and internal controls, all at much greater cost.
The S.E.C.'s enforcement division created an asset management unit in 2010 to focus on hedge funds, and has started filing cases against firms over what the agency views as aberrational financial performance. In October, it filed fraud charges against Yorkville Advisors and two of its executives, claiming that they had overvalued assets and exaggerated returns to hide losses and increase their fees.
A greater concern may be the crackdown on insider trading and how it could affect hedge funds, especially those that trade individual stocks. The biggest bull's-eye appears to be on the back of SAC Capital Advisors and its founder, Steven A. Cohen.
Prosecutors filed charges recently against Mathew Martoma, a former portfolio manager at SAC Capital, accusing him of using confidential information about two pharmaceutical companies that allowed the firm to reap profits and avoid losses totaling about $276 million. That would make it among the most lucrative insider trading cases.
Neither Mr. Cohen nor SAC Capital is named in the criminal complaint, but the firm said that the S.E.C. was considering filing civil charges under a rarely used provision of federal securities law that authorizes a case against a so-called controlling person, like an employer or other organization that directs the actions of another.
In 1988, Congress adopted the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act to allow the S.E.C. to seek a penalty of up to three times the gain or loss avoided when a controlling person knowingly or recklessly failed to "establish, maintain or enforce any policy or procedure" designed to prevent insider trading.
The charges against Mr. Martoma are not the first against someone who had worked at SAC Capital, and the S.E.C. may take aim at the firm over failing to police its portfolio managers properly.
Hedge funds were hardly a blip on the radar when the statute was enacted, but they are now potential targets if the S.E.C. believes that they tolerated insider trading, regardless of whether managers knew of or participated in the violations.
 WHISTLE-BLOWERS WELCOME The federal government has embraced whistle-blowing as a means of gathering information. With substantial rewards for successful cases, more corporate employees are likely to turn over information about their companies. That also means that the eye-popping awards will continue to resemble lottery jackpots.
Under a 2006 law, the Internal Revenue Service gave its first whistle-blower reward, $104 million, this year to Bradley Birkenfeld for providing information about tax evasion through secret Swiss bank accounts at UBS. At the time of the award, Mr. Birkenfeld was finishing a prison sentence for his role in aiding a bank client's tax evasion, but that did not prevent him from getting a slice of the I.R.S. recovery of unpaid taxes.
His disclosures were crucial to peeling back the veil of Swiss bank secrecy, and the government is more than happy to reward even those who participate in wrongdoing when it leads to bigger players.
The S.E.C. has become a major benefactor to whistle-blowers under a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act that requires it to pay at least 10 percent, and as much as 30 percent, of any penalty of over $1 million for information that helps to prove a violation.
In a recent report, the S.E.C. said it had received 3,001 tips in the 2012 fiscal year, its first full year of operation. And it has amassed over $450 million in an account designated to reward whistle-blowers.
So don't expect the S.E.C. and other agencies to shy away from relying on corporate employees and others to bring violations to their attention.
 THE AGE OF OVERSEAS BRIBERY If there is one area that epitomizes the Justice Department's aggressive approach toward global companies, it is the enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The law, spawned in the post-Watergate era to deter the payment of bribes to foreign officials to obtain business, has become a scourge for companies caught up in an investigation because of the enormous costs of cooperating with the government.
A prime example is Wal-Mart, which responded to a New York Times report of potential bribery in its Mexican subsidiary by undertaking a global review of its operations. The company recently reported that it had expanded its internal investigation to cover operations in Brazil, China and India. Executives in its joint venture in India were suspended because of possibly illicit payments.
The internal inquiry has cost Wal-Mart $99 million so far this year, paid mostly to lawyers and accountants. Those costs will grow as the inquiry expands, and could surpass $250 million before the company works out a settlement with the Justice Department and the S.E.C.
In a recent speech, Lanny A. Breuer, the head of the Justice Department's criminal division, said that enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act had "become part of the fabric" of the department and that the law was "now a reality that companies know they must live with and adjust to."
That adjustment can mean millions of dollars if there is a realistic possibility of foreign bribery made on behalf of a company with global operations.
These cases only scratch the surface of what we are likely to see in the headlines. The aggressive approach of the Justice Department, S.E.C. and other agencies will result in more headaches for Wall Street and corporate America as new ways of breaking the law come to light.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Is Bracing for the Dodd-Frank Rules to Kick In

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Regulators are putting the finishing touches on a sprawling regulatory overhaul, leaving lawyers and compliance officials to steer banks through the new era. 

 BODY:
Wall Street lobbyists, the influential power brokers railing against regulation, may soon pass the mantle to more unassuming colleagues: bank compliance officers.
After spending three years and hundreds of millions of dollars attacking a bevy of new rules, Wall Street is begrudgingly gearing up for a new, if more mundane, phase of federal oversight.
Regulators are putting the finishing touches on the Dodd-Frank Act, the sprawling regulatory overhaul, leaving lawyers and compliance officials to steer banks through the new era. The specialists are drawing up training manuals and interactive programs to guide traders, prodding regulators to clarify the minutiae of new rules and, when all else fails, begging for more time.
"Next year is about one word: implementation," said Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which is writing derivatives trading rules under Dodd-Frank. "We've gone from a general law to the specific rules to the superspecific rollout." 
The swing from broad-scale lobbying to execution comes against the backdrop of a shifting regulatory guard. Several Dodd-Frank rules are held up until the White House adds a fifth commissioner to the Securities and Exchange Commission, a central player in Dodd-Frank rule-writing. The move would break a 2-to-2 partisan stalemate at the agency, giving the advantage to the Democrats who support the regulation.
Buoyed by President Obama's re-election, advocates of new oversight are going on the offensive. Union officials and groups like Americans for Financial Reform are screening potential nominees to the S.E.C. They are even pushing a broader anti-Wall Street agenda that goes beyond Dodd-Frank's 2,300 pages to attack the size of giant banks.
"At the top of our wish list is breaking up the big banks," said Bart Naylor, an analyst at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group. While the plan has several supporters in Washington, he conceded that it remained a long shot.
The regulatory backlash traces back to 2008, when Wall Street's risky activities nearly toppled the financial system and the broader economy. Congress responded with Dodd-Frank, which imposes the most significant reforms in a generation. The crackdown touches nearly every corner of finance, including mortgage lending, derivatives trading and hedge funds.
But the law is vague at best. Lawmakers left it to federal regulators to interpret details and churn out some 400 new rules.
Lobbyists pounced on the regulatory agencies, producing studies that claimed to show the onerous costs of new oversight and calling hundreds of meetings with the Federal Reserve, S.E.C. and Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The onslaught prompted significant delays in rule-writing.
With only a third of the regulations complete, it might seem premature for Wall Street to drill down on compliance. The S.E.C., more than any other agency, is running behind schedule.
Some bank officials acknowledge that they will continue deploying their cavalry of lobbyists to influence the policies and twist lawmakers' arms. In part, they're hoping to introduce "technical corrections" to Dodd-Frank, an effort that could start with a comma here or there before transforming into a broader assault on the law. Lobbyists are also urging Mr. Gensler to temper plans to apply new derivatives rules not only to banks in the United States, but also to the foreign units of American banks, a point of contention in the debate over Dodd-Frank.
But the last-ditch lobbying will not erase the unpleasant reality for Wall Street firms. Dodd-Frank is bearing down on them.
Mr. Gensler's agency, a central target of Wall Street ire, has checked off about 80 percent of its rules. And the so-called Volcker Rule, the bane of many big banks, is nearing completion. Even without a new commissioner at the S.E.C., banking regulators could move early next year to approve the rule, an effort to prohibit banks from making risky bets with their own money.
"The banks say, 'We don't like the rules, but just tell us what they are and we'll figure them out,' " said Brian Gardner, a Washington research executive at KBW.
The figure-it-out stage, analysts say, will define Wall Street's regulatory agenda next year. Banks like Morgan Stanley have been bulking up on compliance officers and technology experts, a natural step in anticipation of a torrent of rules. The bank allocated 100 people, new and existing employees alike, to focus on Dodd-Frank. Morgan Stanley is also holding two conference calls a month with clients to lay out the scope of compliance requirements. Goldman Sachs, like others, is testing computer systems it built to track derivatives trading.
In the lead-up to a Dec. 31 deadline to register as derivatives dealers, banks must ship out disclosure forms to trading partners. It is a Sisyphean task that to date has produced a response rate of only 17 percent, bank officials say.
The looming rules are prompting Wall Street lawyers to shift gears, too. Rather than building dense training manuals stocked with legalese, one lawyer at a major firm was told to "think like a trader," that is, translate the rules to plain English.
Jones Day has run training sessions for clients and fashioned a cheat sheet so traders have a checklist to follow every time they pick up the phone to arrange a derivatives deal, according to Joel Telpner, a partner at the law firm. Michael H. Krimminger, a former regulator and current partner at Cleary Gottlieb, noted that his firm formed a subscription service for clients, called the Regulatory Reform Group, which dispatches alerts on regulatory updates and runs conference calls providing commentary on the rules. Davis Polk created online graphics for traders, with flow charts signaling various stages of compliance.
"It's very much a transition year," said Annette Nazareth, a partner at the Wall Street law firm Davis Polk and a former regulator at the S.E.C. After rules become final, the focus immediately shifts to compliance."
Davis Polk and other white-shoe firms spent much of 2012 writing comments letters to regulators about the rules. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, or Finra, Wall Street's main lobbying group, hired Davis Polk to write five letters on the Volcker Rule alone.
Now, lawyers have shifted to letters that plead for extensions. In a Nov. 30 letter, the securities industry association warned Mr. Gensler about compliance hiccups that "our members continue to face." The challenges "will preclude full compliance by the relevant deadlines without significant interruption of normal market activity."
The delay, the lawyers wrote, stems in part from bottlenecks at outside technology vendors. The trade organization also blamed Hurricane Sandy, which sidelined a derivatives reporting "pilot program" for more than two weeks.
In response, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has shown some flexibility. Mr. Gensler's agency has issued nearly two dozen "no action" orders in recent months that award brief reprieves on rule compliance to everything from big banks to family offices.
When Wall Street doesn't get its way, the industry adopts another tactic: lawsuits. The financial industry has sued regulators five times over rules stemming from Dodd-Frank, shifting the battle to the courtroom. In one case, the securities industry association sued Mr. Gensler's agency over a rule that sought to rein in speculative commodities trading. While a judge recently struck down the rule, the agency is appealing.
"It's just part of our democratic process," Mr. Gensler said.
In the wake of the November elections, consumer advocates sense an opportunity to curb the industry's influence, especially after Wall Street threw its support behind Mitt Romney's failed presidential bid. Americans for Financial Reform, an umbrella organization for some 250 like-minded labor and consumer groups, formed more than a half-dozen task forces that meet weekly on topics like investor protection, systemic risk and executive compensation. Behind closed doors, some advocates have also wrestled expert guidance out of bankers sympathetic to their cause.
The game plan, at least for 2013, includes nudging the White House to appoint a consumer-friendly S.E.C. leader and persuading regulators to stretch the agenda beyond the rules mandated under Dodd-Frank. The groups, for example, are ramping up efforts to overhaul money market mutual funds, which played a role in the crisis. They also want regulators to impose limits on the size of big banks.
"There are many of us who feel that Dodd-Frank failed to live up to the promise of lasting reform," said Mr. Naylor of Public Citizen.

HEADLINE: Hedge Funds Stride the Stage of World Affairs

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: With the right idea and enough financial firepower, hedge fund investors can exert significant political and economic influence - even to the point of setting monetary policy. 

 BODY:
Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, was re-elected with a huge margin last year, leaving her political opponents fractured and demoralized. But in recent months, she has found herself locked in battle with a determined adversary who may outmaneuver her.
Her opponent is not a participant in Argentina's domestic political scene. Rather, he is Paul Singer, a soft-spoken New York hedge fund manager. Through one of his funds, Mr. Singer is fighting in United States courts to press Argentina to pay up on some defaulted bonds. Mrs. Kirchner has refused.
Mr. Singer may be deploying arcane legal strategies thousands of miles from Argentina, but his tactics are dominating the nation's political discourse. "This has been on the front page every day in Argentina," said Maria Victoria Murillo, a professor of political science and international affairs at Columbia University.
In other words, a hedge fund has become an important political player in a democracy of 41 million people. 
With the right idea at the right time, and with the requisite financial firepower, hedge fund investors can exert significant political and economic influence. That may even prompt political scientists and economists to consider analyzing hedge funds the way they do trade unions and political parties.
The ability of hedge funds to act as decisive change agents dates to one momentous trade: George Soros's bet against the British pound in 1992.
At the time, the British government had tied the value of the pound to that of other European currencies. Many people contended that the pound's exchange rate was too high in this arrangement and was weighing on the British economy.
Mr. Soros's fund wagered that the government would ultimately have to let the pound fall in value, prompting the fund to sell billions of pounds and buy other European currencies. The selling pressure was too much for the British government, and the pound left the currency arrangement. The day it dropped out was known as Black Wednesday.
When the dust settled, some politicians saw Mr. Soros's actions in a positive light. They said the pound's exit allowed the British economy to flourish.
The impact of Mr. Soros's trades may have been even more far-reaching. Britain's departure from the arrangement influenced its decision not to join the European single currency, according to Norman Lamont, Britain's chancellor of the Exchequer at the time.
"After Black Wednesday, it was politically impossible for any government, Conservative or Labour, to join the euro," Mr. Lamont wrote last year in The Daily Telegraph.
After the success of his pound wager, Mr. Soros's fund focused on Asian currencies. They were vulnerable because, like the pound, their value was fixed in a way that could create unsustainable economic imbalances. The bets by Mr. Soros and others forced some countries to abandon the rigid approach to managing currencies, said Sebastian Mallaby, author of "More Money Than God: Hedge Funds and the Making of a New Elite."
Since then, developing nations have mostly avoided fixed currency arrangements, a choice that has generally served their economies well. "The upshot was that emerging markets broadly adopted flexible exchange-rate regimes," Mr. Mallaby said.
Hedge funds never make bets as a selfless way to free nations from suffocating currency regimes. And those regimes might have collapsed anyway. But the hedge funds probably hastened their demise, leading to relief sooner rather than later.
Hedge fund actions also contributed to a landmark legislative change in the United States a decade ago.
Kynikos Associates and other hedge funds had doubts about Enron's books and were betting that its shares would decline. Eventually, fraud was exposed, and Enron, an energy trading company, went bankrupt in 2001.
The company's collapse, with the crash of other fraudulent businesses, helped create the political climate for an overhaul of how companies report their financial condition. A result was the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
It is possible, even likely, that something like Sarbanes-Oxley would have developed anyway. But the hedge funds' ability to pick up on the fraud played an important role in shaming the main players. Auditors, regulators and banks largely missed Enron's skulduggery, underscoring the need for big changes.
"I can't think of one major financial fraud in the United States in the last 10 years that was uncovered by a major brokerage house analyst or an outside accounting firm," James S. Chanos, founder of Kynikos, said in testimony before Congress soon after Enron's collapse.
Hedge funds also played an early role in the housing bust, which affected millions of people and led to deep societal changes. Managers like Michael Burry of Scion Capital and John Paulson saw the shakiness of the housing market well before regulators, politicians and banks did.
While house prices would have collapsed without hedge funds, the funds helped lead to the crash. In particular, their bearish housing bets helped convince Wall Street, a critical part of the mortgage machine, that the good times were ending.
As early as 2005, Mr. Burry pestered investment banks for ways of betting against housing, according to "The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine," by Michael Lewis. Eventually, the banks provided the financial instruments that allowed Mr. Burry to place the bearish trades. Soon, firms like Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs were betting heavily against housing in a similar way.
Once the establishment started to turn against subprime mortgages, the game was up. Again, hedge funds helped end a bubble earlier and clear out excesses. Again, their prescience shamed those who should have seen the trouble brewing, fueling the postcrisis overhaul.
But funds' efforts are often frustrated, and their antagonistic actions can backfire. For example, Mr. Singer's lawsuits may actually be making Mrs. Kirchner more popular, some specialists in Argentine politics said. "This is a beautiful thing for her," said Ms. Murillo, the Columbia professor. "It's a unifying cause." Hedge funds may now think twice before taking on a government in the same way.
Also, some markets are so big that funds may struggle to gain sway, especially if other investors do not share their theories.
J. Kyle Bass, managing partner of Hayman Capital Management, is outspokenly gloomy about Japan, saying its government debt levels may soon become overwhelming. But he says his fund is not a meaningful catalyst. "I am a very small asset manager," he said. "When there's a quadrillion yen of debt outstanding, it's nonsense to think I can have an influence."
Now, hedge funds can also be outgunned by government entities aiming to shore up markets.
Since the financial crisis in 2008, the world's central banks have shown a willingness to print trillions of dollars to support financial assets. This makes it much harder for some bearish bets to work. Hedge funds betting on the collapse of the euro have had a hard time since the European Central Bank stepped up its support in September, agreeing to buy government bonds of stressed countries.
In many ways, it looks as if central banks will be able to dictate market prices for a long time, which might deter hedge funds from trying to upset the apple cart. After all, central banks can effectively print money to protect the prices of assets singled out by funds.
But Mr. Bass said he was not convinced that central banks could maintain their support indefinitely. "They are not allowing natural forces to react in the marketplace," he said. "No one's willing to say, 'Maybe central banks can't fix it.' "

HEADLINE: Not All Companies Would Welcome a Lower Tax Rate

BYLINE: VICTOR FLEISCHER


HIGHLIGHT: Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have shown an interest in reducing taxes for businesses, but there are many complications. 

 BODY:
 Tax Assessment 
Reaching an agreement to cut the corporate tax rate should be easy. Major figures from both political parties have expressed interest in reducing the tax from 35 percent, which is the highest rate among the country's main trading partners. Corporations would generally benefit from paying less tax and having more cash to reinvest in new projects or pay out in dividends to shareholders.
The 35 percent rate is more of a "sticker price" than a reflection of the average tax burden. Corporations can pay a lower rate by lobbying for special deductions and credits, employing aggressive transfer pricing strategies to shift profits offshore, and structuring operations to minimize how much they pay in taxes in the United States. 
The average effective corporate tax rate is around 20 percent, and even lower in some industries. Cutting the nominal rate to 25 percent while broadening the base would discourage wasteful tax planning and, some believe, would make United States-based multinationals more competitive.
 But the politics of changing the rate and eliminating loopholes are thorny. Not everyone benefits.
The political economy of corporate tax rates is complicated by the fact that corporations act through their managers, who tend to view things from their own perspective.
Consider two main areas for corporate managers. First, executives try to maximize shareholder value, not social welfare. Business strategy is geared toward finding and maintaining a competitive advantage, not toward improving the overall economy. For some companies, tax planning provides a competitive advantage.
Second, corporate managers tend to focus on reported earnings, not cash flow. For a few major companies, cutting the corporate tax rate could have a negative impact on reported earnings, which shareholders might perceive as bad news.
Many companies use tax planning to create a competitive advantage. If your competitors pay taxes at a 35 percent rate, but you have figured out a way to greatly reduce your effective tax rate, then the status quo is valuable to you.
General Electric is probably the most familiar example of such a company. With nearly 1,000 employees, G.E.'s tax department is viewed as a profit center, not a cost center. G.E.'s global financing operations effectively reduce the tax owed from its manufacturing operations, making the conglomerate more competitive.
Less obvious examples are companies that pay no corporate income tax at all, like partnerships or so-called subchapter S corporations. These structures allow companies to pass tax liability through to their individual owners, leaving little, if any, tax burden on the firm at the entity level.
Some publicly traded entities, like master limited partnerships in the energy sector, also avoid being treated as corporations for tax purposes. This group has expanded in recent years to include some financial firms (mostly private equity firms like Carlyle, Oaktree and Blackstone), and certain businesses that qualify as real estate investment trusts, or REITs. For these businesses, a corporate rate cut diminishes their competitive advantage.
Now consider companies for whom a lower tax rate would decrease reported earnings. Citigroup, for example, suffered major losses in the financial crisis and carries a $55 billion deferred tax asset on its balance sheet, largely from net operating losses it was unable to use at the time. These losses are carried forward and can be applied to reduce future income tax.
A deferred tax asset is an accounting concept arising from differences in timing between book income and taxable income. For example, if a corporation rapidly depreciates a piece of machinery for tax purposes, and will therefore have less tax depreciation available to shelter book income from that piece of machinery later, it creates a deferred tax liability to account for this temporary difference in timing.
Conversely, if a corporation has a tax benefit, like a net operating loss that will shelter future economic income from tax, it creates a deferred tax asset on the balance sheet.
The value of a deferred tax asset or liability is a function of the tax rate. A cut in the statutory tax rate would require companies with deferred tax assets to take an immediate charge to earnings. In Citi's case, a rate cut to 25 percent could cause a decline in the value of its deferred tax assets by several billion dollars, leading to a big one-time charge to earnings.
If markets were perfectly efficient, this kind of write-down would be easily ignored. But corporate managers are concerned that analysts will inadvertently assume that these one-time charges are persistent, and there is some research suggesting that this concern is valid.
Many other companies face a similar situation. A recent study by James Poterba, Nirupama Rao and Jeri Seidman in The National Tax Journal provides some data. For the average company in their sample, reducing the statutory corporate tax rate by five percentage points (to 30 percent from 35 percent) would result in a $328 million increase in reported earnings. But not all corporations are alike.
For companies with a net deferred tax asset, the rate reduction would cause an average reduction of $315 million in reported earnings. The study used data from 1993 to 2004, and the figures for firms with large deferred tax assets would most likely be much larger today, particularly for Citigroup, Bank of America and many regional banks that suffered large losses during the financial crisis.
A final tax package is likely to include many things other than a simple reduction in the corporate tax rate. Congress may offer special deductions and credits to soften the blow for companies that take a big charge to earnings or lose a competitive advantage.
The policy argument for these sweeteners is especially weak. Usually, when companies strive for a competitive advantage by offering superior service or building a better mousetrap, we all benefit. But when companies gain an advantage by aggressively managing their tax liability, they benefit only themselves and shift the burden to others.
Changing the tax code is never easy. Cutting the corporate tax rate provides a rare opportunity for bipartisan lawmaking. Congress shouldn't make it harder on itself by promising to hold harmless every company that has manipulated the status quo to its advantage.

HEADLINE: Forecasting Wall Street With a Finger in the Wind

BYLINE: JEFF SOMMER


HIGHLIGHT: The markets are pessimistic for the near term, but could become optimistic if good news arrives. 

 BODY:
THE consensus outlook on Wall Street is gloomy for the immediate future, with glimmers of optimism for the longer term. This forecast might have been borrowed from Al Sleet, the "Hippy dippy weatherman" created by George Carlin.
Mr. Sleet could not actually predict the weather, but this did not deter him. Despite his manifest shortcomings, he learned how to issue gripping and reliable forecasts, which usually went like this: "Tonight's forecast - dark." Then he would pause, and continue, "Later tonight, continued darkness." Like all good pundits, he also took the long view, adding a hopeful coda: "Turning to partly light in the morning."
That's about where the Wall Street consensus stands right now: the short-term outlook is dark, but it will start to clear when the immediate troubles are over.
With a weak economy, flagging corporate earnings and the prospect of a budget impasse in Washington, many investment houses are issuing warnings of impending market turmoil. 
There are "clear and present downside risks to the market in the near term," Goldman Sachs said in a recent report. At Barclays, Barry Knapp, the United States equity strategist, said that such risks were "underappreciated by investors." And Michael Hartnett, chief global equity strategist at Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch, warned that investors were "bipolar" at the moment, lurching between exuberant "risk-on" and depressive "risk-off" moods.
The Treasury market, which has largely held on to the gains of an extraordinarily long bull market in bonds, could benefit if stock investors panic. High demand from safety-seeking investors, combined with the Federal Reserve's aggressive interventions in the bond market, has kept Treasury yields very low, by historical standards, with 10-year notes hovering close to 1.6 percent.
Prices, which move in the opposite direction of yields, have been pinned at very high levels. But the fixed-income rally has been doom-ridden, and isn't likely to be sustained if the economic horizon brightens.
A major economic upturn is not part of mainstream, short-term forecasts. That helps explain why Goldman has been forecasting a year-end close of 1,250 for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, a substantial 13 percent decline from the index's Monday level of 1,418. And the investment bank expects Treasuries to maintain their rich prices in the near future.
Of course, these are merely probabilities.
It is not really clear where the economy - or stocks, bonds, gold or other asset classes - is heading in the near future. Plenty of analysts say that the major short-term trends are not positive, and that most discernible factors seem likely to weaken the American economy further.
First, the global economy as a whole has been slowing. And the domestic economy is bracing for a painful short-term shock: the dreaded combination of tax increases and spending cuts, also known as the fiscal cliff, that is scheduled to start on Jan. 1.
This would be a self-inflicted blow, which President Obama and Congress can prevent. While they are expected to reach a negotiated agreement, their bargaining could continue until the last minute, creating tumult in the market. However the politics play out, it appears likely that at least some taxes will rise in 2013, that some spending will be cut and that the net economic impact over the short term will be negative.
That uncertainty alone is likely to weigh on the market.
Based on historical precedent, Goldman says that the stock market may endure negative returns in December simply because of the possibility of an increase in the capital gains tax rate in January. The rate is scheduled to rise to 23.8 percent in 2013, including the 3.8 percent tax associated with the Affordable Care Act, from 15 percent now. And the firm is estimating that when the Washington negotiations are over, "spending cuts and expiring policies will create a $233 billion fiscal headwind in 2013."
Mr. Knapp of Barclays put it this way: "It seems unlikely the tax cliff negotiations will produce a comprehensive solution that will significantly reduce the macroeconomic risks related to fiscal and monetary policy for 2013, at least not without the markets falling sharply and forcing compromise. In other words, these risks should linger into 2013."
Goldman says that fiscal tightening is likely to hurt consumer discretionary stocks, particularly autos, consumer electronics, home furnishings and home improvement companies. Consumer-oriented companies like drugstores, food and tobacco companies could better weather the turbulent conditions.
Over all, Goldman favors energy and information technology companies. And while it is decidedly gloomy for the short term, the investment bank is quite bullish through 2013, with an S.& P. 500 target of 1,575 at the end of the year.
After so much darkness, where might this light be coming from?
First, American companies continue to gush profits, even if their growth rates are slowing. Consensus earnings-growth expectations for the S.& P. 500 for the fourth quarter dropped to 4.7 percent on Dec. 3, from 9.8 percent on Oct. 8. Still, Goldman estimates that earnings per share in the S.& P. 500 will amount to $100 in 2012, rising to $107 to $114 a share in 2013. This, combined with a moderately successful resolution of the nation's short-term fiscal problems, could propel the market upward.
Underlying the strength of the stock market are two related factors. One is the low cost of corporate borrowing, which is helping to keep profit margins high. The other is the near-zero yield on money market funds, which, if only by contrast, makes stocks relatively attractive.
Behind these ultralow interest rates is the accommodative policy of the Federal Reserve. The central bank was likely to reiterate on Wednesday that it would continue this policy well into 2015, or even after the economy begins to strengthen, whenever that may be. Low mortgage rates appear to be reviving the long-moribund housing market, an important pillar of the domestic economy.
The policy of the Fed, and similarly expansionary monetary policies by other central banks, is bound to keep the price of gold high, in the view of many analysts. Goldman favors Freeport-McMoRan, for example, the global mining company, which has interests in copper and gold.
But unexpected shocks could alarm stock investors. Should Washington fail to reach an agreement in the fiscal negotiations, the markets could plummet. "I think we'd see a return to extreme volatility," said John Linehan, director of United States equities for T. Rowe Price, the mutual fund firm. And a heightened crisis in the European Union - or in the Middle East or any other important region - could derail the American profit machine.
For some certainty in the market, the best option is to follow the final and still operative forecast of Mr. Sleet. "The weather will continue to change on and off for a long, long time," he said, before departing the prediction business at the top of his game.
Enjoy the sunshine when it arrives, he suggested, but be prepared for periodic bouts of darkness. Investors could find worse advice.

HEADLINE: When Looking at Job Numbers, Add In a Changing America

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: With growth in the American labor force slowing, in part because of demographic changes, the usual measures may not give an accurate picture of the economy's health. 

 BODY:
FOR decades, the American labor force grew at a rapid rate, helping to spur strong economic growth.
Those days are past.
In the coming years, the labor force should grow at a more moderate pace, as significant demographic changes take hold. The number of workers in the prime age category of 45 to 54 is expected to decline about 8 percent by 2020 from the previous decade. The fact that there are fewer people in that age range could both increase the demand for older people to stay on the job and provide opportunities for younger workers to move into positions normally filled by people in their 40s and 50s.
With those demographic shifts, the usual measures of the labor force may not give an accurate picture of the economy's health. The United States, for example, most likely will not need to create the same number of jobs to keep unemployment steady or bring it down.
After World War II, the growth in the American labor force was driven by the swelling population and the increasing number of women who chose, or felt compelled, to work outside the home. But the proportion of women who worked began to stabilize in the 1990s, and the baby boomers, the largest cohort of workers in recent decades, have started to retire. 
 The labor force is continuing to grow over all, in part because many of the boomers have delayed retirement. But the growth is much slower.
An increasing pool of workers is critical to economic growth.
The Congressional Budget Office calculated that from 1948 to 2001, the growth in the work force contributed about 1.7 percentage points a year to the American economy. But its contribution to the economy began shrinking after that, and over the next few years it is expected to be only half a percentage point a year. All other things being equal, the next decade will have slower growth than we have come to expect.
Of course, the economy today is still recovering from the credit crisis and worldwide recession, and there are not enough jobs for the current work force. The slow growth of the work force, however, has allowed the unemployment rate to fall rapidly even though job creation is far below the level of a few years ago.
Decades ago, a rule of thumb was established that the economy needed to add 150,000 jobs a month to accommodate new entrants to the labor force. That number has been repeated often during the recent recovery, reflecting worries that the unemployment rate will remain very high unless the pace of job creation rises significantly.
But in the last 24 months, the unemployment rate has fallen by 2.1 percentage points - one of the fastest declines on record - to 7.7 percent. Unemployment has dropped significantly even as job growth has averaged 167,000 jobs a month, little more than the supposed break-even rate. Given the changes in the labor force, the break-even rate now is probably around 90,000 per month, and it might be lower.
Mitra Toossi, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, estimates that the labor force will reach 164.4 million by 2020, up from last month's level of 155.3 million. If that happens, 100,000 people a month will enter the labor force, on a net basis.
If we added around 93,000 jobs a month during that period, the unemployment rate would stay around 7 percent. A higher rate of job creation could bring the unemployment rate down rapidly.
One reason that people perceive a job problem that may be larger than reality is the "participation rate," the percentage of working-age people who are in the labor force, either working or looking for work. That rate peaked at 67.3 percent in 2000, and was just 63.6 percent last month. Back in 2010, when the unemployment rate peaked at 10 percent, the participation rate was 65 percent.
It is important to understand why that rate fell, and why it is likely to continue doing so even if the economy becomes much better.
One reason for it to decline - and the one that people tend to talk about - is that workers become discouraged and drop out of the labor force. To the extent that is happening, it is a bad sign. Over time, however, the principal reason for a declining rate is something else entirely. It is the aging of the population. The participation rate covers all people aged 16 and over. Obviously, someone who is 16 is more likely to be in school, and someone who is 75 is more likely to be retired, so the mix of the work force is important in evaluating the raw number.
Researchers for the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago concluded last year that roughly half the decline in the participation rate over the last decade was related to the changing work force, and the rest was caused by the economic slowdown.
The accompanying chart, produced by the Fed, shows the participation rate for the work force between 16 and 79, not for the entire work force. The researchers conclude that for the economy to grow at its full potential, the participation rate should have fallen from a peak of 69.4 percent in 2001 to 67.6 percent this year.During the late 1990s, the rate was higher than their target, reflecting the overheating economy that sent unemployment rates down to historical lows.
Now, the rate is about 66.6 percent, or one percentage point below the expected. If the rate were to stay at the current level until 2015, the economy would then be running at full steam or close to it, according to the calculations.
The expectation is that older workers will play an increasingly important part in the work force. During the mid-1990s, people in what were historically considered the prime working ages, 25 to 54, made up as much as 72 percent of the work force. That is expected to be down to about 64 percent by 2020, and the share of younger workers is also expected to decline, in part because more people will choose to seek higher education.
But the proportion of workers who are over 55, which was less than an eighth in the mid-1990s, is forecast to rise to more than a quarter by 2020, with increasing numbers of people working past 65.
Those demographic trends could affect many aspects of life in the United States. With fewer young workers to pay Social Security taxes, pressure may increase to raise retirement ages. Immigrants, who have been vilified by some politicians in recent years, may be looked to as a way of both increasing the number of workers and lowering the average age.
One wild card is the changing pension policy. The era of guaranteed retirement income may be ending, as some government workers lose the promise of a defined-benefit pension. With more people dependent on investments for income, a prolonged period of strong growth and a good stock market could encourage more older workers to retire. But the opposite could lead many of them to try to hang on to their jobs as long as possible.

HEADLINE: HSBC to Pay Record Fine to Settle Money Laundering Charges

BYLINE: JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: HSBC, the British banking giant, agreed to pay $1.92 billion to settle charges that it transferred billions of dollars for sanctioned nations, facilitated Mexican drug cartels to launder tainted money and worked with Saudi Arabian banks with ties to terrorist organizations. 

 BODY:
Federal and state authorities announced on Tuesday that they had secured a record $1.92 billion payment from HSBC to settle charges that the British banking giant transferred billions of dollars for sanctioned nations, facilitated Mexican drug cartels to launder tainted money and worked with Saudi Arabian banks with ties to terrorist organizations.
The case, a major victory for the government, represents the conclusion of a multi-agency investigation. It convened the Justice Department, the Manhattan district attorney's office, bank regulators and the Treasury Department. 
In a filing in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, federal prosecutors said the bank had agreed to enter into a deferred prosecution agreement and to forfeit $1.26 billion. The four-count criminal information filed in the court charged HSBC with failure to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program, failure to conduct due diligence on its foreign correspondent affiliates and violating sanctions and the Trading With the Enemy Act. 
"HSBC is being held accountable for stunning failures of oversight - and worse - that led the bank to permit narcotics traffickers and others to launder hundreds of millions of dollars through HSBC subsidiaries, and to facilitate hundreds of millions more in transactions with sanctioned countries, " Lanny A. Breuer, the head of the Justice Department's criminal division, said in a statement. 
At a news conference in Brooklyn, Mr. Breuer defended the decision to not indict the bank, calling the action "a very just, very real and very powerful result."
The deal, which required the bank to admit to the accusations, lasts for five years. If the bank violates the terms of the agreement, prosecutors can move to indict the bank.
In addition to forfeiting the $1.26 billion, HSBC agreed to pay the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced $500 million as part of a civil penalty against the bank, while the Federal Reserve assessed a $165 million civil penalty. 
HSBC also entered in a deferred prosecution agreement with the Manhattan district attorney's office, admitting that it violated New York State law by falsifying the records of New York financial institutions. 
The Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., said in a statement: "New York is a center of international finance, and those who use our banks as a vehicle for international crime will not be tolerated." 
In a statement, Stuart Gulliver, the chief executive of HSBC, said: "We accept responsibility for our past mistakes. We have said we are profoundly sorry for them, and we do so again. The HSBC of today is a fundamentally different organization from the one that made those mistakes."
The turmoil at HSBC is playing out amid a broad crackdown on foreign by federal and state authorities to stanch the flow of illegal money across the world. The officials have been working to clamp down the financing pipeline to cartels and terrorist organizations. 
For the most part, though, the investigations have centered on so-called sanctions violations. In June, the ING Group reached a $619 million settlement with government authorities to resolve accusations that it had moved billions of dollars through its United States subsidiaries for rogue nations like Iran. 
In the latest action, federal and state authorities reached a $327 million agreement with another British bank, Standard Chartered, on Monday. The bank admitted to processing thousands of transactions worth hundreds of millions of dollars for Iranian and Sudanese clients. 
Beyond the sanctions violations at HSBC, prosecutors unearthed evidence that the bank enabled Mexican drug cartels to launder money into the American financial system. 
Problems for HSBC mounted in July when the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations accused the bank of exposing the United States "financial system to money laundering and terrorist financing risks."
At the upper echelons of the organization, the Senate report found, some bank executives had ignored warning signs and permitted the illegal behavior to continue unabated from 2001 to 2010. 
The original problems began when agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement spotted questionable trails of money between HSBC's Mexican and United States operations.
Despite a chorus of warnings from federal banking regulators about the vulnerability of HSBC's operations throughout the world, the bank didn't fortify its controls, the Senate report found.
One of HSBC's branches in the Cayman Islands, the Senate report said, had virtually no oversight despite holding roughly 50,000 client accounts.
Alarmed, a compliance officer complained, Senate investigators found, and asked whether practices at the bank were part of "the School of Low Expectations Banking."
Particularly concerning to prosecutors was the seeming complicity of senior bank executives, according to law enforcement officials briefed on the matter.
For example, an HSBC executive rallied for the firm to continue dealings with Al Rajhi Bank of Saudi Arabia, even though some of the owners of the firm had substantive links to the financing of terrorism, according to the report.
HSBC's Mexican operations moved at least $7 billion from 2007 to 2009 into the United States. Such a large volume of money, law enforcement authorities warned, had to include "drug proceeds."
In July at the Congressional hearings, HSBC executives vowed to reform. As part of that, David Bagley, who served as head of compliance at the British bank since 2002, announced his resignation during the hearings.
HSBC has since on a hiring spree, fortifying its ranks with seasoned executives. On Tuesday, prosecutors praised those efforts, noting that the bank cooperated with the investigation
HSBC brought in Stuart A. Levey as chief legal officer in January. Mr. Levey, a former under secretary at the Treasury Department who focused on terrorism and financial intelligence, has been working out new internal standards that span the company for monitoring and policing the movement of money. In August, the bank hired Robert Werner, who formerly oversaw the group at the Treasury Department that enforces sanctions. In its latest move to improve controls, HSBC promoted Mr. Warner on Tuesday to oversee a special unit dedicated to anti-money laundering.
 William Alden and Ben Protess contributed reporting.

 Connecting the Cold War to Current Events 
Many of the lesson plans above connect key events in the cold war, like the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War. Below are additional ideas for connecting the cold war as a geopolitical dynamic to events covered in any day's New York Times. 
 1. Trace how the cold war shaped current events. Students can choose a country in the news, like Iran, Syria or Afghanistan. 
For example, students can read about the current civil war raging in Syria, and learn about the diplomatic chess game taking place between the United States and Russia. Then students can research how the cold war helped sow the seeds for the current dynamic in Syria. They can read about how the cold war helped lead to thousands of Russian women marrying Syrian men and raising families in Syria. Students can also read about how the rift between Syrian intellectuals has echoes of the cold war. 
Challenge yourself: How many echoes of the cold war can you find in a day's edition of The New York Times? For example, how does this week's story about (among other things) American teenage baby sitters connect?
 2. Consider whether the United States and China are headed for a new cold war. Students can learn about historic relations between the United States and China before reading the related Room for Debate feature. Then, students can hold a discussion about relations between the two countries, and what advice they would give the president for dealing with China. 
 3. Your Ideas Here. How do you connect the cold war to current events? Post a comment, below, and we may add it to our list.
 Search Tips for Finding Cold War Articles in The New York Times 
The Times is a treasure trove of cold war documents for the classroom, including famous headlines, news articles, opinion pieces and photographs. Here are some ways to find the best pieces to use in the classroom:
 1. Use Times Topics pages. The Times has thousands of Topics pages, which collect all the news, reference and archival information, photos, graphics, audio and video files published on a topic. Here are some cold war examples:
Times Topic: Cuban Missile Crisis (1962)
Times Topic: Berlin Airlift (1948-49)
Times Topic: Vietnam War
Times Topic: Korean War
Times Topic: Joseph R. McCarthy
 2. Use the advanced search feature. With this page you can search by keyword, date range, section or author. 
For instance, some articles you might find while searching for the term "cold war" are:
1989 Op-Ed | The Cold War Is Over

HEADLINE: Poverty and Perverse Incentives

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: How the welfare state can impede upward mobility. 

 BODY:
My colleague Nick Kristof has earned some deserved praise from conservatives for using his Sunday column to reflect on the perverse incentives that welfare programs can sometimes create for their beneficiaries. Here's his arresting opening example:
This is what poverty sometimes looks like in America: parents here in Appalachian hill country pulling their children out of literacy classes. Moms and dads fear that if kids learn to read, they are less likely to qualify for a monthly check for having an intellectual disability.
Many people in hillside mobile homes here are poor and desperate, and a $698 monthly check per child from the Supplemental Security Income program goes a long way - and those checks continue until the child turns 18. 
"The kids get taken out of the program because the parents are going to lose the check," said Billie Oaks, who runs a literacy program here in Breathitt County, a poor part of Kentucky. "It's heartbreaking."
Right now, of course, Washington is consumed by the endlessly-recurring left-right debate over whether to raise marginal tax rates on the rich. But the problem Kristof is describing is a reminder that effective marginal tax rates may matter more at the bottom of the income ladder, where benefit cut-offs can discourage precisely the kind of choices that enable intergenerational mobility, and make striving of any sort seem like a dicier proposition than sticking with the benefits you have.
The loss of the $698 disability subsidy is a stark, all-or-nothing example - not just a marginal tax on advancement, but a flat penalty on the act of getting an education for your children. But in more subtle and complicated ways, a similar problem plays itself out across the range of anti-poverty programs, from food stamps and Medicaid to the earned income tax credit and S-CHIP, that phase out or cut off as their recipients' take-home pay increases. As of 2012, a new C.B.O. report finds, low and moderate-income workers face an effective tax rate of about 30 percent on every extra dollar earned, which will rise to 35 percent (almost as high as the marginal bite on upper-class paychecks) as the subsidies for the new health care law take effect. And that clean-sounding figure was obtained by only looking at a relatively narrow range of taxes and benefits: The more programs and variables you include in your analysis, the more byzantine the incentives for people trying to make it up the economic ladder start to look - complete with a number of "cliffs" where taking a higher-paying job can actually leave you with less disposable income than you had before.
Now to some extent these incentives are a problem inherent to any means-tested welfare system - and given that our current system probably needs more means-testing to stay solvent, they are likely to be with us in some form forever. As John Cochrane notes in the post linked just above, "if you means-test any benefit, you introduce a steep marginal tax rate at means-testing point ... [but] if you don't means-test a benefit, you blow out the budget. It's a hard nut, that you can't get around."
But the problem of marginal tax rates does suggest at least a few lessons for policymakers focused on mobility and the working poor. First, benefits that phase out gradually (as the earned-income tax credit currently does) are preferable to benefits that just disappear abruptly when you pass an income threshold - or when your learning-disabled child starts mastering the ABCs. Second, benefits pegged straightforwardly to income (again, like the earned-income tax credit) are preferable to benefits that require their recipients "to demonstrate that they have a problem before they qualify for the payment," as Charles Murray puts it - because the latter creates an incentive to just live with problems (like illiteracy) rather than escaping them. Third, flat credits have certain advantages over sliding subsidies: Instituting a fixed health care tax credit for people who don't get insurance through their employer, for instance, might not insure as many people as the Obama health care bill's subsidies, but it also wouldn't add to the marginal tax rate for people trying to work their way into the middle class.
Finally, any policy that avoids the marginal-tax trap entirely by increasing disposable income the old-fashioned way - that is, by just letting low-income workers keep more of what they already earn - has a great deal to recommend it: Hence the advantages of (to return to my usual hobbyhorses) payroll tax cuts, or a family-friendly tax reform that doubles as a payroll tax cuts. Yes, lowering taxes on work wouldn't directly help some of the people who currently rely on the welfare state - people who can't find jobs, people who do black-market work of one kind or another, people who can't work at all. But all the decisions that promise to take Americans from that kind of dependency into self-sufficiency - moving from off-the-books labor to on-the-books work, from disability to employment, from a low-wage job to a better-paying one - would be easier to make if the available jobs paid a little more, and if every paycheck and potential raise were taxed a little less.

HEADLINE: Small-Business Optimism Plunges

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: The Small Business Optimism Index is starting to look misnamed. 

 BODY:
The Small Business Optimism Index is starting to look misnamed.
The index, reported monthly by the National Federation of Independent Business, had one of the steepest declines in its history in November, and is now at one of its lowest readings ever. The industry group has reported a lower index value only seven times since it began conducting monthly surveys in 1986. Businesses, it seems, are about as optimistic today as they are during the typical recession. 
Hurricane Sandy did not seem to have driven the decline in optimism, either, given that the survey did not show much difference between sentiment at businesses in states hit by Sandy and those in states it spared.
The big drag on overall optimism came from small businesses' view of the future.
In October, businesses were slightly more likely to say that they expected business conditions to improve in the next six months than they were to say that conditions would worsen. But by November, the outlook darkened substantially. The net percentage of business owners saying they expected better conditions -- that is, the share saying they expect improvement minus the share saying they expect deterioration -- was negative 35 percent.
That is the worst outlook since the federation began collecting this data on a monthly basis. Bill Dunkelberg, the chief economist at the National Federation of Independent Business, attributed the pessimism about the future to looming fiscal austerity measures scheduled for 2013, higher health care costs and "the endless onslaught of new regulations."
While businesses have been gloomy for a while, consumers had been resisting warnings about the impending so-called fiscal cliff of rising taxes and spending cuts. Until recently, that is.
The latest consumer sentiment survey from the University of Michigan showed consumer sentiment nose-diving. Gallup's Economic Confidence Index likewise slid recently, mostly because of declining expectations about the future, although the overall index was still higher than it was for most of this year.
The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index reported a small increase in November, at least.

HEADLINE: Water Pollution and the Farm Economy

BYLINE: JUSTIN GILLIS


HIGHLIGHT: By exempting farmers from restricting fertilizer-laden runoff from their fields, the United States is making no headway on the water pollution front, a new study suggests. 

 BODY:
As many people know, the astounding increase in agricultural output that marked the latter half of the 20th century came at a high environmental price. Agriculture is a major contributor to global warming, and runoff from farm fields helps to pollute rivers and streams. 
In the United States, nothing quite symbolizes this issue like the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico, near the mouth of the Mississippi River, which is largely a consequence of fertilizer runoff from the Midwestern farming region.
Now the Environmental Working Group, a Washington outfit known for its work on agricultural issues, is calling attention to the lingering problems with a new report titled "Muddy Waters."
While it focuses on water quality in Iowa, the report makes a broader point about the relationship between agriculture and the environment. When the Clean Water Act was adopted in 1972, farms were largely exempted from its requirements. That means getting farmers to adopt practices that limit runoff has been a voluntary activity.

The new report throws the effectiveness of this approach into doubt. (So did an ambitious series this year by the reporter Perry Beeman in the Des Moines Register that covered similar ground.) "The Clean Water Act has done a great job of cutting industrial pollution, but farm pollution continues unabated," Craig Cox, a co-author of the new report, said in a statement. 
The idea of imposing major pollution requirements on farmers is a touchy subject in Washington. The Obama administration's agriculture secretary, Tom Vilsack, is a former Iowa governor who advocates the voluntary approach. No doubt, Mr. Vilsack is aware of the firestorm he would face from farm groups if he came out for mandatory controls on farm runoff.
It's true, as farm groups argue, that as yields continue to rise over time and farmers adopt techniques that allow them to mete out fertilizers more judiciously, fertilizer pollution per unit of farm output is falling. Yet that factor has been substantially offset in recent years as high farm prices encouraged farmers to plant more acreage.
The numbers compiled by the Environmental Working Group suggest that in absolute terms, we are basically making no headway on the pollution problem.

HEADLINE: Union Members Protest at Vote on Michigan Labor Law

HIGHLIGHT: Michigan lawmakers approved legislation limiting union powers amid loud protests from thousands of union members. 

 BODY:

But their angry shouts and chants, as my colleague Monica Davey reports, did not sway the Republican-led House of Representatives, which approved the so-called"right-to-work" legislation in a state that has long been at the center of American labor activity and history. The legislation bars both public and private sector workers from being required to pay fees as a condition of employment. The Senate passed it last week.
Gov. Rick Snyder signed the legislation later Tuesday. 
Protesters began lining up before dawn as one bus after another brought union members from around the country to Lansing. At least two school districts in Michigan canceled classes because so many teachers said they planned to join the protests. 
At 6:40 a.m., there's about 90 people in line for the right-to-work protests. #RTW http://t.co/aqWovCqI

HEADLINE: China Woos Overseas Companies, Looking for Deals

BYLINE: KEITH BRADSHER and MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: With the government's encouragement, Chinese companies have begun what is expected to be a large number of overseas acquisitions. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - Even as Wall Street deal makers await a revival of the moribund merger market, Chinese companies are shopping abroad with their wallets out.
Yet they are also facing scrutiny, particularly in Washington, as Chinese corporate buying trips coincide with a growing assertiveness in Chinese foreign policy, including the deployment in recent months of surveillance vessels and even naval destroyers and frigates in a series of territorial confrontations with American allies like Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines.
So far this year, the dollar volume of Chinese acquisitions overseas is up 28 percent from the same period a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. That compares with a 2.8 percent slump in global merger and acquisition volume over all.
 Chinese international acquisitions are ahead for the year despite a slump during the third quarter, as state-owned enterprises, which are the main Chinese buyers, and some private enterprises waited for a change in the country's political leadership at the Communist Party Congress in mid-November. But now the Chinese buyers are back. 
Two deals by Chinese companies were announced this week, and bankers and lawyers say that discussions are starting or are already under way on numerous other transactions. Many of those, however, may take as long as a year to complete given China's bureaucratic approval processes.
"You will see an acceleration - you see it now," although it would not amount to an immediate flood of transactions, said André Loesekrug-Pietri, the chairman and managing partner of A Capital, a Hong Kong-based private equity fund.
Indeed, Beijing is pushing for additional deals, and has encouraged the state-controlled banking sector to finance them.
"An increase in overseas investment by Chinese companies is an inevitable trend," the commerce minister, Chen Deming, said at a conference two weeks ago, adding that China did not want to remain overwhelmingly invested in fixed-income securities.
"With foreign reserves of $3 trillion in hand," he added, "we will not sit back and watch the assets depreciate with the third round of quantitative easing. We must inject it into the real economy and make our contribution to global prosperity."
Wanxiang Group agreed on Sunday to pay $256 million to buy most of A123 Systems, a bankrupt manufacturer of high-tech batteries. And a consortium of Chinese investors agreed on the same day to pay $4.2 billion for a controlling stake in the American International Group's aircraft leasing business.
On Friday, Canada approved the $15 billion acquisition of Nexen, an energy company, by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, or Cnooc. That deal is still pending approval by the American committee that reviews foreign investments on national security grounds, commonly known as Cfius.
A few deals may be completed this winter, but the real surge is likely to happen by next summer, bankers and lawyers said. State-owned enterprises account for as much as four-fifths of China's overseas acquisitions by value and many of their top executives are expected to change jobs this winter as the country's new leaders start promoting their followers.
While the Communist Party Congress in November produced a new Politburo, a new slate of government ministers and vice premiers must still be selected at the National People's Congress in March, a process that could also slow down deals.
Chinese regulations further require that at least three different agencies approve each overseas acquisition - the Ministry of Commerce, the National Development and Reform Commission and the State Administration of Exchange Control. The assent of a fourth, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, is needed to qualify for extra financing and faster approval in certain sectors deemed strategic, like clean energy, said Mao Tong, a partner at the law firm Squire Sanders.
But despite the long lead time for Chinese deals, bankers say the process is clearly starting.
Two of the biggest deals by Chinese companies this year were for control of North American companies. The bid for the A.I.G. business, the International Lease Finance Corporation, or I.L.F.C., is the biggest takeover by Chinese entities on record, according to data from Thomson Reuters.
The roots of that transaction were planted last fall. Members of China's new government wanted to show the country's seriousness in pursuing investments outside of China, and spent time assembling the most fitting consortium to pursue a deal for the business.
The government chose as the face of the deal Weng Xianding, a veteran of China's financial regulatory agencies who has turned to investing. His company, New China Trust, is essentially a major Chinese commercial lender, counting Western firms like Barclays among its investors.
Once the preferred consortium was formed around September, it began talking with A.I.G., with many of the details being negotiated between Mr. Weng and the American insurer's chief executive, Robert H. Benmosche. A goal for the Chinese, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said, was to conduct the talks in a "Western way," using Western advisers and not getting bogged down in traditional bureaucratic mire.
The talks were completed in just over three months, and the buyers successfully negotiated a discount of nearly half of I.L.F.C.'s book value.
Two evolving trends are apparent in Chinese international deal making, Chinese government officials, bankers, lawyers and trade experts said in interviews.
The government is putting heavy pressure on Chinese companies to seek minority stakes, and not to automatically seek full control, so as to tap foreign management expertise, two officials said. At the same time, Chinese companies are broadening their range of acquisition targets to include more industrial manufacturers and consumer brand companies, even as they maintain their interest in natural resources and financial services.
"I wouldn't say there's a desire to buy minority stakes, but I think there's a greater acceptance that's an appropriate thing to do," said Michael S. Weiss, the head of China mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley.
Other bankers said that one big obstacle to the purchase of minority stakes lay in the wariness of many foreign companies in accepting a Chinese partner - particularly since nearly four-fifths of Chinese acquirers are state-owned enterprises, and most of the rest tend to have Chinese government links.
Many of today's buyers have drawn lessons from past failures and moved to assuage government regulators before striking deals. Cnooc, in particular, learned from its failed bid to buy the oil company Unocal seven years ago, and tried to apply those lessons in its pursuit of Nexen.
The Chinese company considered the deal in part because it believed that a takeover could win approval, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. While a big player in Canada's energy community, Nexen was not one of the country's iconic companies, heading off the sort of brutal fight that surrounded a takeover battle for Potash, the producer of an important fertilizing ingredient.
Cnooc hired an army of advisers, including lobbyists and public relations specialists, to press the point that a deal would only strengthen the Canadian energy company. And Cnooc was open about much of its financing, aiming to halt concerns that it was being financed cheaply by state-run banks.
Still, national security concerns could also slow some deals. Bankers and lawyers say that Cfius, which stands for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, can sometimes prove frustrating to would-be buyers. The group scrutinizes deals to ensure that they do not harm the country's national security interests.
Unlike the process in Canada, where negotiations with the foreign investment watchdog are public, the Cfius review takes place largely behind closed doors, and buyers are not always told why deals are rejected.
A Treasury spokeswoman, Natalie Earnest, said in a statement: "As we consider foreign investments in the United States, of course, we have an obligation - like any country - to protect our national security, and that is the exclusive focus of Cfius."
Michael R. Wessel, a Democratic appointee to the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission, said that bipartisan concern was growing in Congress about the first of the Chinese deals to be announced this autumn, a $117.6 million acquisition of Complete Genomics, a company in Mountain View, Calif., that does DNA sequencing.
Mr. Wessel, who also advises the United Steelworkers union on trade issues, was also critical of the A.I.G. deal. He said that the Chinese government could pressure airlines to buy Chinese-made parts for their leases, and could eventually urge airlines to lease Chinese-made civilian airliners now being developed.
A spokesman for the buyers' group said in a statement that I.L.F.C. already had one of the largest aircraft order books in aviation, with a commitment to purchase up to 279 Boeing and Airbus aircraft between now and 2020. "We will continue to add to this order book as we see opportunities in the marketplace based on the market appeal of the aircraft and the economics offered by the manufacturers," he added.
Some would-be Chinese buyers have not fully considered how much work is needed to ensure that their investments will go through, advisers say.
"I think many Chinese companies in particular have not taken into account the need to be in touch with Washington policy makers about their needs," said Nancy L. McLernon, the chief executive of the Organization for International Investment, a group that represents domestic subsidiaries of foreign companies. "Those who do, fare best."
 Keith Bradsher reported from Hong Kong, and Michael J. de la Merced from New York.

HEADLINE: HSBC in Record Settlement

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: HSBC agrees to a $1.92 billion settlement in a money laundering inquiry. | Britain arrests three men in connection with the manipulation of interest rates. | The Treasury sells its remaining shares in A.I.G. | British and American regulators are working together on ways to address the "too big to fail" problem of global banks. 

 BODY:
HSBC has agreed to pay $1.92 billion to settle accusations that it laundered billions of dollars. But state and federal authorities decided not to indict the bank "over concerns that criminal charges could jeopardize one of the world's largest banks and ultimately destabilize the global financial system," Ben Protess and Jessica Silver-Greenberg report in DealBook.
"While the settlement with HSBC is a major victory for the government, the case raises questions about whether certain financial institutions, having grown so large and interconnected, are too big to indict," DealBook writes. HSBC was accused of transferring money for nations like Iran and enabling Mexican drug cartels to move money illegally. "Behind the scenes, authorities debated for months the advantages and perils of a criminal indictment against HSBC." Some prosecutors wanted the bank to plead guilty to violations of the federal Bank Secrecy Act, a law that requires financial institutions to report cash transactions of a certain size, officials with direct knowledge of the matter said. That option was seen as a compromise, whereas a "money-laundering indictment, or a guilty plea over such charges, would essentially be a death sentence for the bank." 
The deferred prosecution agreement that authorities ultimately reached with HSBC requires the bank to forfeit more than $1.2 billion and pay about $700 million in fines, according to the officials briefed on the matter. "As part of the deal, one of the officials briefed on the matter said, HSBC must also strengthen its internal controls and stay out of trouble for the next five years." The chief executive, Stuart T. Gulliver, said in a statement, "We accept responsibility for our past mistakes."
Another British bank, Standard Chartered, agreed on Monday to pay $327 million to settle accusations that it transferred money illegally. Its settlement with the Justice Department, the Manhattan district attorney's office, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Treasury Department gives the bank closure. In August, the New York State Department of Financial Services broke from other regulators to move against the bank.
THREE ARRESTED IN BRITAIN OVER RATE RIGGING | Britain's Serious Fraud Office announced on Tuesday that three men, all British citizens, were arrested "in connection with the investigation into the manipulation of Libor."
TREASURY EXITS A.I.G. | The Treasury Department said on Tuesday that it had sold the last of its shares in the American International Group, four years after taxpayers rescued the insurance giant. The Treasury sold 234.2 million shares at $32.50 each, earning about $7.6 billion from the sale. The price was a small discount from the closing price of $33.36 on Monday. In all, taxpayers have gained about $22.7 billion from the bailout.
The sale realized "a goal few dreamed possible in September 2008," DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced writes. Critics at the time feared the government would post a big loss on the bailout. "People thought we'd put money down a dry hole and would never see it again," said Linus Wilson, an assistant professor of finance at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.
COOPERATIVE APPROACH TO BANK FAILURES | Regulators in the United States and Britain are working together on ways to address the "too big to fail" problem of global banks. In a joint paper, the Bank of England and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation outlined a strategy for handling a sick financial company that operates in multiple jurisdictions. The paper expands on laws passed after the financial crisis, regulations intended to prevent taxpayers from having to step in to save a bank. "If they do get it right, then, yes, 'too big to fail' has ended," said Phillip L. Swagel, a professor at the University of Maryland's School of Public Policy, who was assistant secretary for economic policy under Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr.
"But questions surround the strategy," DealBook's Peter Eavis writes. "The paper is little more than a commitment to cooperate. In other words, it does not give either regulator the power to reach into a foreign jurisdiction to restructure a bank."
ON THE AGENDA | The Senate Banking Committee holds a hearing at 10:30 a.m. on the rental housing assistance programs of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Mark Carney, the current governor of the Bank of Canada and newly appointed governor of the Bank of England, is speaking at the Toronto CFA Society at 1:20 p.m. SolarCity, the solar energy provider led by Elon Musk, is scheduled to price its I.P.O., which would value the company at about $1 billion. Ralph Schlosstein, the chief executive of Evercore Partners, is on Bloomberg TV at 8:15 a.m. Larry Fink, head of BlackRock, is on Bloomberg TV at 10 a.m. Travis Kalanick, chief executive of Uber, is on CNBC at 10 a.m. Roger Altman, chairman of Evercore, is on CNBC at 4:15 p.m. Alan Greenspan is on CNBC at 4:30 p.m. The two-day meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee begins. Data on the international trade deficit for October is released at 8:30 a.m.
DEFENSE RESTS IN INSIDER TRADING TRIAL | The insider trading trial of Anthony Chiasson, a co-founder of the now-defunct Level Global Investors, and Todd Newman, a former portfolio manager at Diamondback Capital Management, will go to the jury as soon as Tuesday. Lawyers for the defense called just one witness before resting their case. An F.B.I. agent, called to the stand by Mr. Newman's lawyer, was questioned briefly about the government's investigation. "The decision to not put on a substantive defense is a calculated risk aimed at signaling to the jury that the defense believes that prosecutors do not have a strong case," DealBook's Peter Lattman writes. The prosecution, for its part, had built an argument over more than three weeks, with testimony from the defendants' former employees who had pleaded guilty.
MONGOLIA'S PROSPECTS SHIFT WITH RIO TINTO | Mongolia, the world's fastest-growing economy last year, has been a darling of the emerging markets. But that may be changing. William MacNamara reports in DealBook: "In May, the Parliament passed a law that restricted foreign investment in the country's most attractive asset, its mineral deposits. The government is also taking aim at a crucial deal with the multinational mining giant Rio Tinto, a pact that many see as the foundation of the country's recent economic growth. Now, the underlying fundamentals of the country look increasingly shaky. Mongolia faces a financing crunch, as investment dollars flowing from abroad have fallen. And revenue from coal, the country's main export, has dropped along with Chinese demand." He continues: "Mongolia's star rose - and is now falling - with the fortunes of one company: Rio Tinto, the country's largest investor."

HEADLINE: Fiscal Cliff and Global Troubles Create a Fog for Deal-Making

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSS SORKIN


HIGHLIGHT: For all the talk about the uncertainty of fiscal problems and new financial regulations, the fact is that businesses have long operated in uncertain times, capitalizing on the weakness to uncover opportunities. 

 BODY:
Wall Street has always been more concept than place. By the late 18th century, a couple of blocks in Lower Manhattan had already become synonymous with stock trading. Later, they became shorthand for the entire American financial system.
But even those broad definitions have become too parochial. In an era of globalization, Wall Street finds itself at the center of the world economy.
It makes for uncertain times. Four years after the financial crisis, the fortunes of Wall Street - and the broader business world - are inextricably tied to myriad issues beyond financiers' control. 
President Obama and Congress are debating tax increases and spending cuts that have implications for companies, consumers and investors. The European debt crisis is smoldering, dimming the region's prospects. The Chinese economy, the global engine of growth, is moderating.
Those macroeconomic conditions are weighing on stocks. In this environment, investors are more interested in the next Federal Reserve Board meeting than the next earnings report from Coca-Cola.
"Policy issues have joined and in many cases overly displaced corporate fundamentals in driving intraday price movements and volatility," said Mohamed El-Erian, the chief executive and co-chief investment officer at Pimco, one of the largest money managers in the world. "Part of this is warranted, as corporate behavior is being influenced by policy uncertainty in a meaningful manner, be it here, China or in Europe."
As lawmakers and policy makers across the globe debate the future, business and financial leaders are trying to influence the decision-making. In the United States alone, companies, trade organizations and consumer advocacy groups have spent more than $2.5 billion this year on lobbying and have deployed an army of 12,000-plus lobbyists, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
Few issues have captured the attention of business leaders like the so-called fiscal cliff, the combination of spending cuts and tax increases that will take effect at the first of the year barring action in Washington to forestall it. President Obama and Congress face a delicate balancing act as they try to cut the deficit while preserving economic growth.
Everything is on the table in the budget debate. Tax policies. Financial regulation. Health care coverage. Immigration reform. Entitlement benefits. Housing. Education. Energy.
Wall Street and corporate America are increasingly pushing for a "balanced approach," with loud calls for compromise on both sides of the aisle. Support for the Simpson-Bowles proposal - the bipartisan fiscal plan put together in 2010 by the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform headed by Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles - is resurfacing.
But even as business broadly backs Simpson-Bowles, few executives have read the 65-page document. The details could make a budget bargain difficult.
The banking and real estate industries are hardly expected to support a plan to rethink the home mortgage interest deduction, a core proposal in Simpson-Bowles. Health care companies aren't in favor of capping and eliminating the deduction for employer-provided insurance. The big mutual fund players won't be happy if capital gains and dividends are subject to the same tax as normal income. And military contractors don't want to accept significant cuts to Pentagon spending.
It's all part of the great uncertainty that is paralyzing some businesses. Companies say they're not willing to invest and hire without a clearer picture of public policy. Wall Street banks complain that the new regulations, some yet to be completed, make it difficult to develop a long-term strategy.
For all this sturm und drang, the talk may be harsher than the reality. Businesses have long operated in uncertain times, capitalizing on the weakness to uncover opportunities.
When Ben S. Bernanke wrote his doctoral thesis in 1979, he could have been channeling the quandary that C.E.O.'s face today. "Uncertainty about the long-run environment which is potentially resolvable over time thus exerts a depressing effect on current levels of investment," he wrote at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "Uncertainty provides an incentive to defer such investments in order to wait for new information."
But deferral need not be paralysis. They may complain, but businesses keep running and executives muddle through, if burdened by the weight of diminished expectations.
"You know, all time is uncertain," Warren E. Buffett once said. "I mean, it was uncertain back in 2007; we just didn't know it was uncertain. It was uncertain on Sept. 10, 2001. It was uncertain on Oct. 18, 1987, you just didn't know it. We always live in an uncertain world."
What to expect in the malaise of the months ahead? Little in the way of bold, strategic moves. Look for smaller, more defensive bolt-on deals rather than big, splashy transactions that put companies into new kinds of businesses. Companies will step up hiring and expansion, but only slowly and with caution.
As confidence rebuilds, so should the economy.

HEADLINE: Rate Inquiry Accelerates With Arrests In London

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: British authorities have arrested three men in connection with a rate-rigging inquiry, including Thomas Hayes, a former trader at Citigroup and UBS. 

 BODY:
 9 p.m. | Updated 
American and British authorities are shifting to an aggressive new phase in their broad investigation of interest-rate manipulation as they identify potential criminal targets and complete settlements with some of the world's biggest banks.
In a sign of the escalation, Britain's Serious Fraud Office made the first arrests in connection with the rate-rigging inquiry on Tuesday.
In a predawn raid, police took three men into custody at their homes on the outskirts of London. One of the men is Thomas Hayes, 33, a former trader at UBS and Citigroup, according to people briefed on the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity. The other two men arrested worked for the British brokerage firm R P Martin, said another person briefed on the matter.
British authorities typically make arrests in the early stages of an inquiry, and the actions on Tuesday do not necessarily signal that the individuals will be charged with wrongdoing. 
UBS, Citigroup and R P Martin declined to comment. A lawyer for Mr. Hayes, who has not been accused of any wrongdoing, could not be reached for comment.
Mr. Hayes also faces scrutiny from American authorities. The Justice Department could file criminal charges against him in the coming weeks, according to people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing. The people cautioned that American authorities had not made a decision about charging Mr. Hayes and might have difficulty extraditing him to the United States.
The evidence against Mr. Hayes is considered a linchpin in a broader case involving UBS, the Swiss banking giant. UBS is expected to settle accusations that Mr. Hayes and other employees carried out a scheme to push interest rates up and down to bolster trading profits, according to the people briefed on the matter. The people said the expected settlement, which could come as early as Friday, would include more than $450 million in fines and wider sanctions, the largest penalties to date related to the rate-rigging inquiry.
Building on the momentum in the UBS inquiry, authorities are preparing a spate of civil and criminal actions. After gathering thousands of internal bank e-mails and interviewing dozens of employees over the last four years, regulators and prosecutors are using the evidence to negotiate settlements with banks and draw up arrest orders for individuals.
The cases have deep roots. Regulators around the world have been investigating more than a dozen big banks that help set benchmarks like the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. Such benchmark rates are used to determine the borrowing costs for trillions of dollars in financial products, including credit cards, student loans and mortgages.
In June, authorities scored their first major victory, extracting a $450 million settlement with Barclays, the big British bank. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Justice Department and the Financial Services Authority of Britain claimed that Barclays traders tried to manipulate Libor to bolster profits. They also claimed that Barclays had submitted low rates to deflect concerns about its health during the financial crisis.
Other banks are bracing for the potential fallout, including major fines and regulatory sanctions. The Royal Bank of Scotland, which is in settlement talks with regulators, said it would probably disclose fines before its next earnings report, in February. Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, said in November that it had put aside money for potential penalties related to the Libor case.
Even as authorities prepare a new wave of actions, they have not always coordinated with each other. Some American authorities were caught off guard when the Serious Fraud Office announced the arrests on Tuesday. And the various regulators are still not certain if they will jointly announce the UBS settlement this month, according to the people briefed on the matter.
The Justice Department's criminal division and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's enforcement unit, in contrast, have kept close ties. Lanny A. Breuer, head of the Justice Department's criminal division, and David Meister, who runs the commission's enforcement team, are said to be friends. As they built Libor cases over the last two years, the units have shared evidence that they say points to a systemic problem with the rate-setting processes.
The Serious Fraud Office is a relative newcomer to the Libor case. After hesitating to enter the investigation, the agency opened a criminal inquiry into Libor manipulation in July, in response to the furor over the rate-rigging scandal at Barclays.
"The S.F.O. works incredibly slowly," said a defense lawyer representing other individuals implicated in the Libor inquiry, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "It's not surprising that people have been arrested. But how long it will take to lead to criminal charges is another matter."
Under British law, London police can hold the three men arrested on Tuesday for 24 hours. Authorities can apply for an extension if they need more time for questioning the men.
Mr. Hayes, who got his start at the Royal Bank of Canada, built his reputation as an interest rates trader at UBS, a person briefed on the matter said. He worked at UBS's Tokyo office from about 2006 to 2009 before departing for Citigroup. At the American bank, he received a promotion, earning a director title.
Mr. Hayes spent less than six months trading at Citigroup. The bank suspended him in 2010 after he approached a London trading desk about improperly influencing the yen-denominated Libor rates, a person briefed on the matter said. He was fired in September 2010, and the bank reported his suspected actions to authorities.
UBS also raised concerns about Mr. Hayes to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, according to another person briefed on the matter. In the course of an internal investigation, the Swiss bank concluded that Mr. Hayes had worked with traders at other banks to influence rates, according to officials and court documents.
At the time, the trading commission ordered other institutions that helped set Libor rates to conduct similar inquiries. Those investigations have formed the basis of the agency's cases.
Mr. Hayes also emerged in court documents filed this year by Canadian authorities. The documents - collected by Canada's Competition Bureau, the country's antitrust authority - highlight an alleged scheme in which Mr. Hayes and other traders may have colluded to influence yen Libor rates. The Canadian investigation, which covers conduct from 2007 to 2010, also referred to traders at JPMorgan Chase, HSBC, Deutsche Bank and the Royal Bank of Scotland.
The traders, the documents said, at times corresponded using instant messages on Bloomberg machines. While the activity took place outside Canada, the trading affected financial contracts in the country that were pegged to yen Libor.
The traders further asked middlemen at brokerage firms "to use their influence" on other banks that set Libor, according to the documents. The brokers included employees at R P Martin, a person briefed on the matter said.
"Traders at participants' banks communicated with each other their desire to see a higher or lower yen Libor to aid their trading positions," the Canadian documents said.
 Azam Ahmed and Ian Austen contributed reporting. 
An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a British agency. It is the Serious Fraud Office, not the Series Fraud Office.

HEADLINE: Not All Companies Would Welcome A Lower Tax Rate

BYLINE: By VICTOR FLEISCHER. 
Victor Fleischer is a professor at the University of Colorado Law School, where he teaches partnership tax, tax policy and deals. Twitter: @vicfleischer

 BODY:
Tax Assessment
Reaching an agreement to cut the corporate tax rate should be easy. Major figures from both political parties have expressed interest in reducing the tax from 35 percent, which is the highest rate among the country's main trading partners. Corporations would generally benefit from paying less tax and having more cash to reinvest in new projects or pay in dividends to shareholders.
The 35 percent rate is more of a "sticker price" than a reflection of the average tax burden. Corporations can pay a lower rate by lobbying for special deductions and credits, employing aggressive transfer pricing strategies to shift profits offshore and structuring operations to minimize how much they pay in taxes in the United States. 
The average effective corporate tax rate is around 20 percent, and even lower in some industries. Cutting the nominal rate to 25 percent while broadening the base would discourage wasteful tax planning and, some believe, would make United States-based multinationals more competitive.
But the politics of changing the rate and eliminating loopholes are thorny. Not everyone benefits.
The political economy of corporate tax rates is complicated by the fact that corporations act through their managers, who tend to view things from their own perspective.
Consider two main areas for corporate managers. First, executives try to maximize shareholder value, not social welfare. Business strategy is geared toward finding and maintaining a competitive advantage, not toward improving the overall economy. For some companies, tax planning provides a competitive advantage.
Second, corporate managers tend to focus on reported earnings, not cash flow. For a few major companies, cutting the corporate tax rate could have a negative impact on reported earnings, which shareholders might perceive as bad news.
Many companies use tax planning to create a competitive advantage. If your competitors pay taxes at a 35 percent rate, but you have figured out a way to greatly reduce your effective tax rate, then the status quo is valuable to you.
General Electric is probably the most familiar example of such a company. With nearly 1,000 employees, G.E.'s tax department is viewed as a profit center, not a cost center. G.E.'s global financing operations effectively reduce the tax owed from its manufacturing operations, making the conglomerate more competitive.
Less obvious examples are companies that pay no corporate income tax at all, like partnerships or so-called subchapter S corporations. These structures allow companies to pass tax liability through to their individual owners, leaving little, if any, tax burden on the firm at the entity level.
Some publicly traded entities, like master limited partnerships in the energy sector, also avoid being treated as corporations for tax purposes. This group has expanded in recent years to include some financial firms (mostly private equity firms like Carlyle, Oaktree and Blackstone), and certain businesses that qualify as real estate investment trusts, or REITs. For these businesses, a corporate rate cut diminishes their competitive advantage.
Now consider companies for whom a lower tax rate would decrease reported earnings. Citigroup, for example, suffered major losses in the financial crisis and carries a $55 billion deferred tax asset on its balance sheet, largely from net operating losses it was unable to use at the time. These losses are carried forward and can be applied to reduce future income tax.
A deferred tax asset is an accounting concept arising from differences in timing between book income and taxable income. For example, if a corporation rapidly depreciates a piece of machinery for tax purposes, and will therefore have less tax depreciation available to shelter book income from that piece of machinery later, it creates a deferred tax liability to account for this temporary difference in timing.
Conversely, if a corporation has a tax benefit, like a net operating loss that will shelter future economic income from tax, it creates a deferred tax asset on the balance sheet.
The value of a deferred tax asset or liability is a function of the tax rate. A cut in the statutory tax rate would require companies with deferred tax assets to take an immediate charge to earnings. In Citi's case, a rate cut to 25 percent could cause a decline in the value of its deferred tax assets by several billion dollars, leading to a big one-time charge to earnings.
If markets were perfectly efficient, this kind of write-down would be easily ignored. But corporate managers are concerned that analysts will inadvertently assume that these one-time charges are persistent, and there is some research suggesting that this concern is valid.
Many other companies face a similar situation. A recent study by James Poterba, Nirupama Rao and Jeri Seidman in The National Tax Journal provides some data. For the average company in their sample, reducing the statutory corporate tax rate by five percentage points (to 30 percent from 35 percent) would result in a $328 million increase in reported earnings. But not all corporations are alike.
For companies with a net deferred tax asset, the rate reduction would cause an average reduction of $315 million in reported earnings. The study used data from 1993 to 2004, and the figures for firms with large deferred tax assets would most likely be much larger today, particularly for Citigroup, Bank of America and many regional banks that suffered large losses during the financial crisis.
A final tax package is likely to include many things other than a simple reduction in the corporate tax rate. Congress may offer special deductions and credits to soften the blow for companies that take a big charge to earnings or lose a competitive advantage.
The policy argument for these sweeteners is especially weak. Usually, when companies strive for a competitive advantage by offering superior service or building a better mousetrap, we all benefit. But when companies gain an advantage by aggressively managing their tax liability, they benefit only themselves and shift the burden to others.
Changing the tax code is never easy. Cutting the corporate tax rate provides a rare opportunity for bipartisan lawmaking. Congress shouldn't make it harder on itself by promising to hold harmless every company that has manipulated the status quo to its advantage.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Hedge Funds Stride the Stage Of World Affairs

BYLINE: By PETER EAVIS

 BODY:
Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, was re-elected with a huge margin last year, leaving her political opponents fractured and demoralized. But in recent months, she has found herself locked in battle with a determined adversary who may outmaneuver her.
Her opponent is not a participant in Argentina's domestic political scene. Rather, he is Paul Singer, a soft-spoken New York hedge fund manager. Through one of his funds, Mr. Singer is fighting in United States courts to press Argentina to pay up on some defaulted bonds. Mrs. Kirchner has refused.
Mr. Singer may be deploying arcane legal strategies thousands of miles from Argentina, but his tactics are dominating the nation's political discourse. "This has been on the front page every day in Argentina," said Maria Victoria Murillo, a professor of political science and international affairs at Columbia University.
In other words, a hedge fund has become an important political player in a democracy of 41 million people. 
With the right idea at the right time, and with the requisite financial firepower, hedge fund investors can exert significant political and economic influence. That may even prompt political scientists and economists to consider analyzing hedge funds the way they do trade unions and political parties.
The ability of hedge funds to act as decisive change agents dates to one momentous trade: George Soros's bet against the British pound in 1992.
At the time, the British government had tied the value of the pound to that of other European currencies. Many people contended that the pound's exchange rate was too high in this arrangement and was weighing on the British economy.
Mr. Soros's fund wagered that the government would ultimately have to let the pound fall in value, prompting the fund to sell billions of pounds and buy other European currencies. The selling pressure was too much for the British government, and the pound left the currency arrangement. The day it dropped out was known as Black Wednesday.
When the dust settled, some politicians saw Mr. Soros's actions in a positive light. They said the pound's exit allowed the British economy to flourish.
The impact of Mr. Soros's trades may have been even more far-reaching. Britain's departure from the arrangement influenced its decision not to join the European single currency, according to Norman Lamont, Britain's chancellor of the Exchequer at the time.
"After Black Wednesday, it was politically impossible for any government, Conservative or Labour, to join the euro," Mr. Lamont wrote last year in The Daily Telegraph.
After the success of his pound wager, Mr. Soros's fund focused on Asian currencies. They were vulnerable because, like the pound, their value was fixed in a way that could create unsustainable economic imbalances. The bets by Mr. Soros and others forced some countries to abandon the rigid approach to managing currencies, said Sebastian Mallaby, author of "More Money Than God: Hedge Funds and the Making of a New Elite."
Since then, developing nations have mostly avoided fixed currency arrangements, a choice that has generally served their economies well. "The upshot was that emerging markets broadly adopted flexible exchange-rate regimes," Mr. Mallaby said.
Hedge funds never make bets as a selfless way to free nations from suffocating currency regimes. And those regimes might have collapsed anyway. But the hedge funds probably hastened their demise, leading to relief sooner rather than later.
Hedge fund actions also contributed to a landmark legislative change in the United States a decade ago.
Kynikos Associates and other hedge funds had doubts about Enron's books and were betting that its shares would decline. Eventually, fraud was exposed, and Enron, an energy trading company, went bankrupt in 2001.
The company's collapse, with the crash of other fraudulent businesses, helped create the political climate for an overhaul of how companies report their financial condition. A result was the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
It is possible, even likely, that something like Sarbanes-Oxley would have developed anyway. But the hedge funds' ability to pick up on the fraud played an important role in shaming the main players. Auditors, regulators and banks largely missed Enron's skulduggery, underscoring the need for big changes.
"I can't think of one major financial fraud in the United States in the last 10 years that was uncovered by a major brokerage house analyst or an outside accounting firm," James S. Chanos, founder of Kynikos, said in testimony before Congress soon after Enron's collapse.
Hedge funds also played an early role in the housing bust, which affected millions of people and led to deep societal changes. Managers like Michael Burry of Scion Capital and John Paulson saw the shakiness of the housing market well before regulators, politicians and banks did.
While house prices would have collapsed without hedge funds, the funds helped lead to the crash. In particular, their bearish housing bets helped convince Wall Street, a critical part of the mortgage machine, that the good times were ending.
As early as 2005, Mr. Burry pestered investment banks for ways of betting against housing, according to "The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine," by Michael Lewis. Eventually, the banks provided the financial instruments that allowed Mr. Burry to place the bearish trades. Soon, firms like Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs were betting heavily against housing in a similar way.
Once the establishment started to turn against subprime mortgages, the game was up. Again, hedge funds helped end a bubble earlier and clear out excesses. Again, their prescience shamed those who should have seen the trouble brewing, fueling the postcrisis overhaul.
But funds' efforts are often frustrated, and their antagonistic actions can backfire. For example, Mr. Singer's lawsuits may actually be making Mrs. Kirchner more popular, some specialists in Argentine politics said. "This is a beautiful thing for her," said Ms. Murillo, the Columbia professor. "It's a unifying cause." Hedge funds may now think twice before taking on a government in the same way.
Also, some markets are so big that funds may struggle to gain sway, especially if other investors do not share their theories.
J. Kyle Bass, managing partner of Hayman Capital Management, is outspokenly gloomy about Japan, saying its government debt levels may soon become overwhelming. But he says his fund is not a meaningful catalyst. "I am a very small asset manager," he said. "When there's a quadrillion yen of debt outstanding, it's nonsense to think I can have an influence."
Now, hedge funds can also be outgunned by government entities aiming to shore up markets.
Since the financial crisis in 2008, the world's central banks have shown a willingness to print trillions of dollars to support financial assets. This makes it much harder for some bearish bets to work. Hedge funds betting on the collapse of the euro have had a hard time since the European Central Bank stepped up its support in September, agreeing to buy government bonds of stressed countries.
In many ways, it looks as if central banks will be able to dictate market prices for a long time, which might deter hedge funds from trying to upset the apple cart. After all, central banks can effectively print money to protect the prices of assets singled out by funds.
But Mr. Bass said he was not convinced that central banks could maintain their support indefinitely. "They are not allowing natural forces to react in the marketplace," he said. "No one's willing to say, 'Maybe central banks can't fix it.' "
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: When Looking at Job Numbers, Add In a Changing America

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
For decades, the American labor force grew at a rapid rate, helping to spur strong economic growth.
Those days are past.
In the coming years, the labor force should grow at a more moderate pace, as significant demographic changes take hold. The number of workers in the prime age category of 45 to 54 is expected to decline about 8 percent by 2020 from the previous decade. The fact that there are fewer people in that age range could both increase the demand for older people to stay on the job and provide opportunities for younger workers to move into positions normally filled by people in their 40s and 50s.
With those demographic shifts, the usual measures of the labor force may not give an accurate picture of the economy's health. The United States, for example, most likely will not need to create the same number of jobs to keep unemployment steady or bring it down.
After World War II, the growth in the American labor force was driven by the swelling population and the increasing number of women who chose, or felt compelled, to work outside the home. But the proportion of women who worked began to stabilize in the 1990s, and the baby boomers, the largest cohort of workers in recent decades, have started to retire. 
The labor force is continuing to grow over all, in part because many of the boomers have delayed retirement. But the growth is much slower.
An increasing pool of workers is critical to economic growth.
The Congressional Budget Office calculated that from 1948 to 2001, the growth in the work force contributed about 1.7 percentage points a year to the American economy. But its contribution to the economy began shrinking after that, and over the next few years it is expected to be only half a percentage point a year. All other things being equal, the next decade will have slower growth than we have come to expect.
Of course, the economy today is still recovering from the credit crisis and worldwide recession, and there are not enough jobs for the current work force. The slow growth of the work force, however, has allowed the unemployment rate to fall rapidly even though job creation is far below the level of a few years ago.
Decades ago, a rule of thumb was established that the economy needed to add 150,000 jobs a month to accommodate new entrants to the labor force. That number has been repeated often during the recent recovery, reflecting worries that the unemployment rate will remain very high unless the pace of job creation rises significantly.
But in the last 24 months, the unemployment rate has fallen by 2.1 percentage points - one of the fastest declines on record - to 7.7 percent. Unemployment has dropped significantly even as job growth has averaged 167,000 jobs a month, little more than the supposed break-even rate. Given the changes in the labor force, the break-even rate now is probably around 90,000 per month, and it might be lower.
Mitra Toossi, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, estimates that the labor force will reach 164.4 million by 2020, up from last month's level of 155.3 million. If that happens, 100,000 people a month will enter the labor force, on a net basis.
If we added around 93,000 jobs a month during that period, the unemployment rate would stay around 7 percent. A higher rate of job creation could bring the unemployment rate down rapidly.
One reason that people perceive a job problem that may be larger than reality is the "participation rate," the percentage of working-age people who are in the labor force, either working or looking for work. That rate peaked at 67.3 percent in 2000, and was just 63.6 percent last month. Back in 2010, when the unemployment rate peaked at 10 percent, the participation rate was 65 percent.
It is important to understand why that rate fell, and why it is likely to continue doing so even if the economy becomes much better.
One reason for it to decline - and the one that people tend to talk about - is that workers become discouraged and drop out of the labor force. To the extent that is happening, it is a bad sign.
Over time, however, the principal reason for a declining rate is something else entirely. It is the aging of the population.
The participation rate covers all people aged 16 and over. Obviously, someone who is 16 is more likely to be in school, and someone who is 75 is more likely to be retired, so the mix of the work force is important in evaluating the raw number.
Researchers for the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago concluded last year that roughly half the decline in the participation rate over the last decade was related to the changing work force, and the rest was caused by the economic slowdown.
The accompanying chart, produced by the Fed, shows the participation rate for the work force between 16 and 79, not for the entire work force. The researchers conclude that for the economy to grow at its full potential, the participation rate should have fallen from a peak of 69.4 percent in 2001 to 67.6 percent this year.
During the late 1990s, the rate was higher than their target, reflecting the overheating economy that sent unemployment rates down to historical lows.
Now, the rate is about 66.6 percent, or one percentage point below the expected. If the rate were to stay at the current level until 2015, the economy would then be running at full steam or close to it, according to the calculations.
The expectation is that older workers will play an increasingly important part in the work force. During the mid-1990s, people in what were historically considered the prime working ages, 25 to 54, made up as much as 72 percent of the work force. That is expected to be down to about 64 percent by 2020, and the share of younger workers is also expected to decline, in part because more people will choose to seek higher education.
But the proportion of workers who are over 55, which was less than an eighth in the mid-1990s, is forecast to rise to more than a quarter by 2020, with increasing numbers of people working past 65.
Those demographic trends could affect many aspects of life in the United States. With fewer young workers to pay Social Security taxes, pressure may increase to raise retirement ages. Immigrants, who have been vilified by some politicians in recent years, may be looked to as a way of both increasing the number of workers and lowering the average age.
One wild card is the changing pension policy. The era of guaranteed retirement income may be ending, as some government workers lose the promise of a defined-benefit pension. With more people dependent on investments for income, a prolonged period of strong growth and a good stock market could encourage more older workers to retire. But the opposite could lead many of them to try to hang on to their jobs as long as possible.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Is Bracing for the Dodd-Frank Rules to Kick In

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
Wall Street lobbyists, the influential power brokers railing against regulation, may soon pass the mantle to more unassuming colleagues: bank compliance officers.
After spending three years and hundreds of millions of dollars attacking a bevy of new rules, Wall Street is begrudgingly gearing up for a new, if more mundane, phase of federal oversight.
Regulators are putting the finishing touches on the Dodd-Frank Act, the sprawling regulatory overhaul, leaving lawyers and compliance officials to steer banks through the new era. The specialists are drawing up training manuals and interactive programs to guide traders, prodding regulators to clarify the minutiae of new rules and, when all else fails, begging for more time.
"Next year is about one word: implementation," said Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which is writing derivatives trading rules under Dodd-Frank. "We've gone from a general law to the specific rules to the superspecific rollout." 
The swing from broad-scale lobbying to execution comes against the backdrop of a shifting regulatory guard. Several Dodd-Frank rules are held up until the White House adds a fifth commissioner to the Securities and Exchange Commission, a central player in Dodd-Frank rule-writing. The move would break a 2-to-2 partisan stalemate at the agency, giving the advantage to the Democrats who support the regulation.
Buoyed by President Obama's re-election, advocates of new oversight are going on the offensive. Union officials and groups like Americans for Financial Reform are screening potential nominees to the S.E.C. They are even pushing a broader anti-Wall Street agenda that goes beyond Dodd-Frank's 2,300 pages to attack the size of giant banks.
"At the top of our wish list is breaking up the big banks," said Bart Naylor, an analyst at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group. While the plan has several supporters in Washington, he conceded that it remained a long shot.
The regulatory backlash traces back to 2008, when Wall Street's risky activities nearly toppled the financial system and the broader economy. Congress responded with Dodd-Frank, which imposes the most significant reforms in a generation. The crackdown touches nearly every corner of finance, including mortgage lending, derivatives trading and hedge funds.
But the law is vague at best. Lawmakers left it to federal regulators to interpret details and churn out some 400 new rules.
Lobbyists pounced on the regulatory agencies, producing studies that claimed to show the onerous costs of new oversight and calling hundreds of meetings with the Federal Reserve, S.E.C. and Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The onslaught prompted significant delays in rule-writing.
With only a third of the regulations complete, it might seem premature for Wall Street to drill down on compliance. The S.E.C., more than any other agency, is running behind schedule.
Some bank officials acknowledge that they will continue deploying their cavalry of lobbyists to influence the policies and twist lawmakers' arms. In part, they're hoping to introduce "technical corrections" to Dodd-Frank, an effort that could start with a comma here or there before transforming into a broader assault on the law. Lobbyists are also urging Mr. Gensler to temper plans to apply new derivatives rules not only to banks in the United States, but also to the foreign units of American banks, a point of contention in the debate over Dodd-Frank.
But the last-ditch lobbying will not erase the unpleasant reality for Wall Street firms. Dodd-Frank is bearing down on them.
Mr. Gensler's agency, a central target of Wall Street ire, has checked off about 80 percent of its rules. And the so-called Volcker Rule, the bane of many big banks, is nearing completion. Even without a new commissioner at the S.E.C., banking regulators could move early next year to approve the rule, an effort to prohibit banks from making risky bets with their own money.
"The banks say, 'We don't like the rules, but just tell us what they are and we'll figure them out,' " said Brian Gardner, a Washington research executive at KBW.
The figure-it-out stage, analysts say, will define Wall Street's regulatory agenda next year. Banks like Morgan Stanley have been bulking up on compliance officers and technology experts, a natural step in anticipation of a torrent of rules. The bank allocated 100 people, new and existing employees alike, to focus on Dodd-Frank. Morgan Stanley is also holding two conference calls a month with clients to lay out the scope of compliance requirements. Goldman Sachs, like others, is testing computer systems it built to track derivatives trading.
In the lead-up to a Dec. 31 deadline to register as derivatives dealers, banks must ship out disclosure forms to trading partners. It is a Sisyphean task that to date has produced a response rate of only 17 percent, bank officials say.
The looming rules are prompting Wall Street lawyers to shift gears, too. Rather than building dense training manuals stocked with legalese, one lawyer at a major firm was told to "think like a trader," that is, translate the rules to plain English.
Jones Day has run training sessions for clients and fashioned a cheat sheet so traders have a checklist to follow every time they pick up the phone to arrange a derivatives deal, according to Joel Telpner, a partner at the law firm. Michael H. Krimminger, a former regulator and current partner at Cleary Gottlieb, noted that his firm formed a subscription service for clients, called the Regulatory Reform Group, which dispatches alerts on regulatory updates and runs conference calls providing commentary on the rules. Davis Polk created online graphics for traders, with flow charts signaling various stages of compliance.
"It's very much a transition year," said Annette Nazareth, a partner at the Wall Street law firm Davis Polk and a former regulator at the S.E.C. After rules become final, the focus immediately shifts to compliance."
Davis Polk and other white-shoe firms spent much of 2012 writing comments letters to regulators about the rules. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, or Finra, Wall Street's main lobbying group, hired Davis Polk to write five letters on the Volcker Rule alone.
Now, lawyers have shifted to letters that plead for extensions. In a Nov. 30 letter, the securities industry association warned Mr. Gensler about compliance hiccups that "our members continue to face." The challenges "will preclude full compliance by the relevant deadlines without significant interruption of normal market activity."
The delay, the lawyers wrote, stems in part from bottlenecks at outside technology vendors. The trade organization also blamed Hurricane Sandy, which sidelined a derivatives reporting "pilot program" for more than two weeks.
In response, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has shown some flexibility. Mr. Gensler's agency has issued nearly two dozen "no action" orders in recent months that award brief reprieves on rule compliance to everything from big banks to family offices.
When Wall Street doesn't get its way, the industry adopts another tactic: lawsuits. The financial industry has sued regulators five times over rules stemming from Dodd-Frank, shifting the battle to the courtroom. In one case, the securities industry association sued Mr. Gensler's agency over a rule that sought to rein in speculative commodities trading. While a judge recently struck down the rule, the agency is appealing.
"It's just part of our democratic process," Mr. Gensler said.
In the wake of the November elections, consumer advocates sense an opportunity to curb the industry's influence, especially after Wall Street threw its support behind Mitt Romney's failed presidential bid. Americans for Financial Reform, an umbrella organization for some 250 like-minded labor and consumer groups, formed more than a half-dozen task forces that meet weekly on topics like investor protection, systemic risk and executive compensation. Behind closed doors, some advocates have also wrestled expert guidance out of bankers sympathetic to their cause.
The game plan, at least for 2013, includes nudging the White House to appoint a consumer-friendly S.E.C. leader and persuading regulators to stretch the agenda beyond the rules mandated under Dodd-Frank. The groups, for example, are ramping up efforts to overhaul money market mutual funds, which played a role in the crisis. They also want regulators to impose limits on the size of big banks.
"There are many of us who feel that Dodd-Frank failed to live up to the promise of lasting reform," said Mr. Naylor of Public Citizen.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: American Tariffs, Bangladeshi Deaths

BYLINE: By SANCHITA B. SAXENA. 
Sanchita B. Saxena is a political scientist and associate director of the Center for South Asia Studies at the University of California, Berkeley.

 BODY:
Berkeley, Calif.
THE fire that killed 112 workers at a garment factory in the suburbs of Bangladesh's capital last month was a stark reminder of the human costs of producing and consuming cheap clothes.
While American officials have condemned poor safety conditions at the factory and have urged the Bangladeshi government to raise wages and improve working conditions, the United States can do much more: It should bring down high tariffs on imports from Bangladesh and other Asian countries, which put pressure on contractors there to scrimp on labor standards in order to stay competitive.
The United States imported more than $4 billion worth of apparel and textiles from Bangladesh last year. So it has an interest in giving the country's garment industry some financial room with which to improve conditions for the three million employees, most of them female, who work in the industry. 
Monitoring systems have, in many cases, achieved progress at the higher levels of the industry: the contractors that deal directly with American retailers. But oversight is lax, and conditions particularly dire, in factories run by subcontractors, like the Tazreen Fashions factory, the site of the deadly blaze on Nov. 24.
A bill introduced in Congress in 2009 by Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington, could have improved the situation by including Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka on the list of developing countries, like Mexico, that receive duty-free access to the American market as a result of free-trade agreements. But the bill never even made it to committee, and Bangladesh still faces a cost squeeze that is ultimately felt most acutely on those lowest on the production chain, especially the lowest-paying subcontractors, among whom corruption is endemic. It takes its greatest toll on workers.
The distortions created by the current trade policy are striking. In the United States federal fiscal year that ended in September 2011, Bangladesh exported $5.10 billion in goods to the United States, of which less than 10 percent were eligible for exemption from import duties. On the rest, Bangladesh had to pay at least 15.3 percent in tariffs. The tariffs were equivalent to imposing a $4.61 tax on every person in Bangladesh, a country with a per-capita annual income of $770.
This year, according to news accounts, Bangladesh will have paid more than $600 million annually in American tariffs, even as the United States Agency for International Development said it was committed to $200 million in development aid to Bangladesh. Of course, no free trade legislation is controversy-free. One argument against reducing restrictions on Bangladeshi imports is that it might hurt even poorer countries, in sub-Saharan Africa, that enjoy duty-free access under a 2000 law, the African Growth and Opportunity Act. But studies have shown that extending duty-free access to South Asian goods would have negligible costs, yield huge benefits for Bangladesh's economy and have minimal negative impact on African exports.
Bangladesh's government and industries have a moral duty to prevent catastrophes like the November fire from ever occurring again. They need to insist that factory operators meet safety standards, that inspections are conducted honestly and that recommendations are enforced.
But leveling the playing field of international trade could advance all of these goals. International brands like Tommy Hilfiger, Gap, H&M, Target and Walmart demand low prices and fast turnaround. In that context, high tariffs work against the goals of fair-labor standards and factory safety.
In the fire's aftermath, it's tempting to focus only on local corruption and lax labor standards. But there have been positive changes in recent years; labor groups, businesses, nongovernmental organizations and even some international buyers have formed coalitions to improve safety at many factories. In a survey I conducted of garment workers at established factories, 62 percent said labor conditions had improved.
But for improvements in workers' well-being to have lasting effect, tariffs on exports to the United States, the world's largest consumer market, must be eased.

HEADLINE: Finding Big Start-Up Ideas, Even in Small Cities

BYLINE: By SARAH MAX

 BODY:
Rick DeVos could not wait to leave Grand Rapids, Mich. After high school, he made a beeline to Pepperdine University near Los Angeles and spent a year studying in London, but eventually returned home to finish his degree at Calvin College. "My family has deep roots in Grand Rapids," he said. "I missed the grounding and humility of the Midwest."
Now, Mr. DeVos, 30, the grandson of the Amway co-founder Richard DeVos, is trying to infuse the entrepreneurial spirit of big cities in his hometown of 190,000 people.
In April, he began Start Garden, a $15 million early-stage venture capital fund backed by his family. Start-ups, which initially receive $5,000 in seed capital, have three months to prove their ideas and compete for additional financing at a monthly event called Update Night. It is not nearly as cutthroat as "Shark Tank," Mr. DeVos said, referring to the reality show about entrepreneurs. "But it is a little counterculture to the Midwest, where people are used to hearing: 'That's a nice idea. Let's keep in touch.' " 
Mr. DeVos, with a growing group of venture capitalists and angel investors, is betting that budding entrepreneurs are everywhere, even in Western Michigan.
Business incubators, conferences and accelerators, or entrepreneurial crash courses - mainstays of start-ups - are increasingly appearing beyond San Francisco, Boston, New York and other hubs. Taking a page from the Silicon Valley playbook, small cities like Grand Rapids, Burlington, Vt., and Bend, Ore., are nurturing start-ups.
In Kentucky, the investor Ray Moncrief helps oversee four funds totaling $160 million that invest in start-ups in and near Appalachia. "Most venture capital is focused on either coast, but that's not to say those are the only places good deals can be found," Mr. Moncrief said. He vets 70 to 100 ideas a year, and recently financed a company that makes carbon silicon chips for electric cars and another that makes shelters for military personnel.
"The cost structure for building a company out of Silicon Valley is a lot more attractive," said Pete Bernardoni, a managing director of Wavepoint Ventures in El Dorado Hills, Calif. The company is raising its second fund focused on early-stage companies in Northern California, mainly those outside San Francisco and Silicon Valley. "There are sharp entrepreneurs all over who don't necessarily want to relocate their start-ups," he said.That has become the battle hymn of economic developers in areas off the beaten path.
Historically, such groups have focused their efforts on recruiting large employers to a region. But they now view entrepreneurship as another option.
"When the avenues for job creation are limited, economic development organizations are looking at other ways to create jobs," said Angelos Angelou, principal of AngelouEconomics, an economic development company based in Austin, Tex. "Entrepreneurship definitely has been the focus for the last 10 or 15 years."
Success is not always measured in employment growth. Many of the best start-ups will be acquired by outside companies, and the jobs often go with them. Others will not succeed.
But even if they fail or cash out, that often creates a virtuous cycle that benefits the local economy. Assuming the founders stay, they may start other companies, finance different ventures or become mentors for the next batch of start-ups, said Brad Feld, co-founder of TechStars and Foundry Group, an early-stage fund based in Boulder, Colo.
Mr. Feld said that he had invested in hundreds of start-ups since 1995, including about 100 based in Boulder. "Places build on themselves," he added, "but it takes a very long time."
Cities rich in start-ups often share characteristics. Local universities tend to play a major role. Even if the students are not aspiring Mark Zuckerbergs, the universities offer resources and, in many cases, cheap and eager labor.
For example, Burlington draws from the University of Vermont, Middlebury College and other nearby campuses. A strong urban core with restaurants, art and night life is also important. In Austin, the Sixth Street music scene has long been a draw to would-be entrepreneurs, Mr. Angelou said.
"Each community needs to develop to its own strengths," said Richard Fox, principal at Astralis Group, a business advisory company based in Orlando, Fla., and a board member of the National Association of Seed and Venture Funds.
Many ideas are born of necessity.
About 150 miles north of the California border, Bend, Ore., was a dying mill town that experienced a renaissance beginning in the 1990s, when retirees, second-home buyers and urban refugees came in search of affordable housing and easy access to the bounties of the Cascade Mountains.
Still, newcomers and old-timers alike realized they needed or wanted to do something other than drink microbrews and ride mountain bikes. Economic developers understood that the city could not sustain itself on tourism and service industries alone.
In a little more than a decade, Bend, a town of 78,000, has created a rich ecosystem, a popular term in emerging entrepreneurial enclaves, with an accelerator, a weekend boot camp for aspiring entrepreneurs, an annual venture conference and a monthly "PubTalk" featuring successful entrepreneurs and early-stage companies seeking capital.
In 2012, a record 70 companies applied for the Bend Venture Conference, which invites start-ups to present their ideas to a group of angel investors who contribute a minimum of $5,000. The conference is open to entrepreneurs across the state.
"We want investors to feel they have the best shot of investing in the best companies, and it also raises the bar for local companies," said Jim Coonan, venture catalyst manager for Economic Development for Central Oregon, the nonprofit organization that sponsors the event. "The key is the exposure and the feedback."
The six finalists this year included a biotech company with a solution to drug resistance, a hydrogen fuel system for cell towers and a small-business loyalty app that raises money for charitable causes.
The winner, Sonivate Medical of Beaverton, Ore., received $265,000 in financing for its fingertip-mounted ultrasound probe, while two other finalists, both from Bend, received a total of $85,000. If past years are any indication, Mr. Coonan said, most of the finalists will go on to get additional financing.
Local capital is not a prerequisite for creating a robust entrepreneurial community, but local investors with deep pockets certainly help. "It's a little of a chicken-or-the-egg scenario," Mr. Angelou said. He pointed to the success of Dell beginning in the late 1980s as the turning point for Austin's makeover from college town to start-up hub.
Back in Grand Rapids, Meijer one-stop shopping stores; Steelcase, the office furniture maker; and Wolverine World Wide, a shoemaker, are helping to support the next generation of businesses, directly and indirectly. These companies and Amway have collaborated on GRid70, a design and innovation center. The Van Andel Institute, a leading cancer, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's research institute, is an anchor for other biotech companies and research organizations.
Mr. DeVos said he simply enjoyed being part of the creative process and understood the broader effect of fostering new ideas. "There's not going to be a white knight that will come in and create a new industry for us," he said. "We need to nurture our own entrepreneurial spirit."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Health Centers Find Opportunity in Brownfields

BYLINE: By RONDA KAYSEN

 BODY:
PHILADELPHIA -- The community health center rising on a derelict corner here in West Philadelphia never would have broken ground if not for the asbestos inside the building that was demolished to make way for it. Because of the contamination, Spectrum Health Services received a $2 million federal cleanup grant, the first piece of a $14 million construction financing puzzle.
When complete, the 36,000-square-foot building will provide a new home for a health center that has been squeezed into a deteriorating strip mall nearby for decades. It will also be the latest in a nationwide trend to replace contaminated tracts in distressed neighborhoods with health centers, in essence taking a potential source of health problems for a community and turning it into a place for health care. In recent years, health care facilities have been built on cleaned-up sites in Florida, Colorado, New Hampshire, Minnesota, Oregon and California.
''These health care providers are getting good at it,'' said Elizabeth Schilling, policy manager for Smart Growth America, an advocacy group. ''They have internalized the idea that this is an opportunity for them.'' 
Because these sites are contaminated, many qualify for government tax credits and grants, providing health centers with vital seed money to build. Community health centers, by design, exist to serve populations in poor neighborhoods, where there also tend to be available but contaminated properties like old gas stations, repair shops and industrial sites.
In fact, many of the country's 450,000 contaminated sites, known as brownfields, are in poor neighborhoods, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. These tracts are disproportionately concentrated in poor communities because contaminated sites are more difficult to redevelop if property values are depressed. Banks are often reluctant to finance construction on a property that might require a costly cleanup.
''In communities where the real estate market isn't working that well, you end up with a brownfield,'' said Jody Kass, executive director of New Partners for Community Revitalization, a brownfield advocacy group.
''It's a Catch-22,'' said Phyllis B. Cater, chief executive of Spectrum Health Services. ''The environmental issues are significant and yet there are scarce resources for communities to do the cleanup and remediation that's required.''
But if the state or federal government provides the first piece of financing, other funders are more likely to fall into step.
Community health centers, in particular, are under pressure to grow. By 2015, the number of Americans who rely on community health centers for care is expected to double to 40 million from the 20 million who relied on the centers in 2010, according to the National Association of Community Health Centers. The Affordable Care Act allocated $11 billion to expand these centers. Of that, $1.5 billion was allotted to construction.
But finding a viable site is not always easy. It took Spectrum 15 years to find its new home on Haverford Avenue. The original building, an aging medical office, went up for auction in 2007 after the owner was arrested on a tax evasion charge. Spectrum bought the property for $650,000. Ms. Cater speculated that if Spectrum hadn't bought the site, it most likely would have fallen into disrepair like the decaying row houses and the dilapidated bodega across the street that Spectrum hopes to redevelop eventually.
Spectrum currently occupies 10,000 square feet in a rundown strip mall four blocks away. The center is divided among three crowded spaces, so employees must walk outside to get from the medical offices to the billing department. The treatment rooms are dreary and cramped, with holes in the drywall and collapsing ceiling panels.
''I've seen better centers in rural Mississippi. This is not how you support a community,'' Ms. Cater said.
When it opens next summer, the new, three-story center will have 34 exam rooms, eight dental rooms, a spacious community center and a full-service laboratory. It will also employ twice as many people as the current facility, adding 66 jobs to Spectrum's payroll.
The 50-year-old building was in poor shape, but it was the presence of asbestos that allowed Spectrum to qualify for the critical first piece of financing: a $2 million brownfield redevelopment grant from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. The organization also received an additional $2 million H.U.D. loan that was tied to the brownfield grant, a $1.7 million redevelopment grant from Pennsylvania and $3.45 million in other loans.
''Brownfield cleanup dollars tend not to be very big dollars, but they're important dollars as a funding mix,'' said Allison Coleman, chief executive of Capital Link, a nonprofit group that helped Spectrum secure financing for the development.
There is no data on how many health centers sit on cleaned brownfields. The effort is gaining traction, however, particularly in Florida, where local government officials, environmental advocates and health center developers have led an ad hoc movement. As an incentive, the state provides developers who redevelop a brownfield into a health center with tax credits of up to $500,000.
Supporters in Florida have toyed with various names for the concept, like Doc in a Box, healthfields and Highway to Healthcare.
''The concept in Florida has proven to be not only needed, but viable,'' said Michael R. Goldstein, an environmental lawyer in Florida who specializes in brownfield redevelopment. ''We are just at the beginning of the journey here. I predict that in the next two years we'll have close to two dozen across the state.''
The first of these centers to open in Florida was a tiny clinic in Clearwater on a redeveloped abandoned gas station in 2001. Since then, other health center organizations have opened similar facilities around the state.
In 2010, Tampa Family Health Centers opened an 18,000-square-foot facility on the site of a former Saturn dealership that had underground fuel storage tanks, hydraulic lifts in its service center and oil disposal tanks. The $6.7 million project was partly financed with federal stimulus money.
The new center, in a working-class neighborhood, serves about 10,000 patients a year. Situated on a busy commercial strip, the location was critical for the organization, which has 12 other centers in the area.
''This was an ideal location for us in so many respects,'' said P. David Bonham, chief operating officer of Tampa Family Health Centers. ''We simply knew that we had the need here.''
In some cases, the cleanup involved is extensive. In 2011, Elliot Hospital opened a 240,000-square-foot ambulatory care facility on the site of a former Tyson meatpacking plant in Manchester, N.H. The plant, which dated to the 19th century, had at one time been a slaughterhouse. Among the contaminants was a 10,000-gallon concrete tank that had stored the blood of slaughtered animals.
''We had to assure ourselves that we would be able to appropriately clean the site,'' said Doug Dean, president and chief executive of Elliot Hospital. As part of the demolition, the original building was crushed and used as gravel fill for the parking lot.
The former plant had been shut for five years and added to the blight of what had become a red light district. The new $100 million ambulatory center is the first phase of a 17-acre redevelopment plan that will include an 111,000-square-foot medical office building, a three-story residential building, 13,000 square feet of commercial space and a four-acre riverfront park.
''When you look at revitalizing a community, these kinds of uses tend to be the first anchors,'' said Mathy Stanislaus, an assistant administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency.
For the Centennial Mental Health Center in rural Sterling, Colo., the neighborhood eyesore, a 1920s coal processing plant, has been sitting across from Centennial's main clinic for decades. But a local development team has begun to clean the site and Centennial hopes it will be able to expand onto part of the site, using it for patient parking.
Elizabeth Hickman, Centennial's executive director, said: ''If all goes well we will feel pretty privileged to have a piece of that corner of Sterling that nobody wanted or knew what to do with.''

HEADLINE: Firm Is Accused of Monopolizing Double-Decker Bus Trade

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ

 BODY:
The federal and New York State governments sued the joint venture that operates New York City's popular hop-on, hop-off tour bus service on Tuesday, accusing it of being a monopoly and using its dominant position to overcharge customers. 
The joint venture, Twin America, was created in 2009 by the merger of two tour bus companies, City Sights and Gray Line New York, which was operated by Coach USA. The complaint claimed that the merger eliminated competition, paving the way for a price hike of about 10 percent.
''This lawsuit is an important step toward restoring competition and protecting tourists in New York City,'' Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman said in a statement. ''The iconic double-decker Gray Line and City Sights buses are seen all over New York City, but few people know they are run as a monopoly.''
George Lence, a spokesman for Twin America, which is based in Delaware, denied the accusations, saying in a statement that the company would ''robustly'' defend itself.
The lawsuit, he said, did ''not reflect the improvements, increased services and greater value our joint venture has delivered to customers over the past three years, despite a very challenging economy.''
The double-decker buses, which take visitors on guided tours around the city and allow them to get on and off at different locations, serve about two million tourists a year, the attorney general said. The business has about $100 million in revenue a year.
Before the joint venture agreement, Gray Line and City Sights accounted for about 99 percent of the hop-on, hop-off market, the suit said. Between 2005, when City Sights began operations, and the merger in 2009, the two companies engaged in ''vigorous'' competition, which benefited customers, the filing said.
According to the lawsuit, which was filed in United States District Court in Manhattan, increasing profits and eliminating competition were central reasons for entering into the joint venture. Immediately after the merger, Twin America raised its base fares by $5, from $49 to $54, according to the suit.
''By merging their hop-on, hop-off bus tour operations, the parties ended the fierce competition between them that had benefited consumers,'' the filing said.
No other company has emerged to challenge Twin America's dominance of the market.

HEADLINE: Co-op Laws in Cuba Are Seen as Progress

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY -- The Cuban government authorized a wide range of co-ops on Tuesday, allowing workers to collectively open new businesses or take over existing state-run businesses in construction, transportation and other industries.
The new laws published Tuesday are the latest step in a slow, fitful process of opening Cuba's economy to free-market ideas. The latest announcement calls for the creation of more than 200 co-ops as part of a pilot program. If it grows, analysts said, the experiment could do more for economic growth and productivity than earlier efforts to allow for self-employment, or to reform agriculture.
Co-ops that are run independent from the government could shift a large portion of the island's economy to free-market competition from government-managed socialism, analysts contend, a change from earlier co-op efforts within state-run agriculture. 
''The potential is large,'' said Richard E. Feinberg, a professor of international political economy at the University of California, San Diego. ''The Cubans are looking for something in between the old state-owned enterprise and a pure free market. Cooperatives are an answer, so looking forward, they could play a significant role.''
For some Cubans, the new laws will just legalize what is already going on in the black market. But the government also seemed interested in encouraging consolidation among small entrepreneurs. The new laws call for lower tax rates for co-ops than for self-employed workers. That means barbers or fishermen or carpenters who now work as individuals will have an incentive to join co-ops, companies in which each worker has a vote.
The new laws also say that co-ops can be formed with as few as three people, and that in addition to converting state businesses into co-ops -- with first preference given to workers already there -- co-ops will be able to bid for leases of idle government properties.
The co-ops ''will not be administratively subordinated to any state entity,'' the government said in a summary of the laws in Granma, the state-run newspaper. But the government will play a large role in determining who gets the chance to open businesses. Workers seeking to start co-ops must submit applications that go to local government offices that pass them up to the Council of Ministers, which includes President Raúl Castro, for approval.
It is not yet clear whether higher-skilled professionals, like architects or doctors, will be able to form co-ops. Philip Peters, a Cuba expert at the Lexington Institute, a nonpartisan policy group, said that initially the co-ops would probably fill a gap in basic services, like transportation for farm products. He predicted co-ops would most likely reduce the likelihood of theft.
''People pilfer from the state; they don't from a business in which they have a stake,'' he said. But to fully reach the co-ops' potential, he and other experts said, questions about the government's interaction with them will need to be answered.
''They have not been liberated overnight from operating in the Cuban context,'' said Professor Feinberg, who was an adviser to the Clinton administration. ''How do they get credit? How do they get inputs? How are workers going to be properly trained? How will management be properly trained? These are all outstanding issues.''

HEADLINE: A Bill to Extend a Deposit Insurance Program Moves Forward in the Senate

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A bill extending a federal program guaranteeing deposits in noninterest-bearing accounts at federally insured banks easily cleared a procedural hurdle on Tuesday, setting it up for a vote on final passage later this week.
But the bill, which is supported by most of the banking industry and by the White House, still faces an uphill battle in the Senate and the House.
The Senate voted 76-20 to continue debate on the bill, which would extend by two years a program created to help stabilize the banking system in the 2008 crisis. It was extended in 2010 until the end of this year. 
Managed through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the so-called Transaction Account Guarantee program provides unlimited federal deposit insurance to what are known as transaction accounts -- basically noninterest-bearing accounts generally used by businesses for payroll, accounts payable and other immediate needs.
Bankers at nearly all but the largest financial institutions have pleaded with Congress to extend the program after Dec. 31. About $1.5 trillion in transaction accounts would be affected, according to the Independent Community Bankers of America, and industry officials said they expected $200 billion to $300 billion to move out of banks if the program ended.
The F.D.I.C.'s standard deposit insurance covers amounts up to $250,000 per account, a limit that was raised from $100,000 before the financial crisis. The higher limit was made permanent in 2010; it is not being considered for change.
The Transaction Account Guarantee program is financed through assessments on banks by the F.D.I.C., similar to the standard deposit insurance program. Taxpayer money could be at risk if the fund did not have enough money to pay the insured accounts, but that has never happened. The F.D.I.C. says that accounts covered by transaction guarantee program have accounted for 3 percent of all losses because of bank failures.
The program is critically important to the smallest community banks, Senator Tim Johnson, a South Dakota Democrat and supporter of the bill, said on the Senate floor Tuesday. ''This program allows these institutions to serve the banking needs of the small businesses in their communities, keeping deposits local,'' he said.
But procedural moves by the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, have left the bill's future uncertain. Immediately after the 76-20 approval to move the bill forward, Mr. Reid said he would not allow any amendments to the bill, something Republicans oppose.
The two sides were still negotiating on whether amendments to the bill would be allowed. If an agreement is not reached, it is unlikely that Senate Republicans will help provide the 60 votes needed for the bill to pass the next procedural milestone.
The debate is occurring against the backdrop of the Senate's fight over its rules regarding the filibuster, which center on whether every bill essentially should continue to require the support of 60 senators -- rather than a simple majority of 51 -- to pass.
The deposit insurance bill could also face a much tougher time in the House, where the mood has been one of allowing the supports and bailout programs put in place during the financial crisis to expire.
While the extension is being supported by the powerful American Bankers Association and by the Independent Community Bankers of America, it is opposed by the Financial Services Roundtable, which represents roughly 100 of the largest financial institutions, including banks, mutual fund companies and other asset managers.
Industry analysts say the big banks oppose the extension because they figure they are viewed by many depositors as too big to fail. ''They basically are saying, 'No one views us as a failure risk and so our clients are not going to flee,' '' said Joshua Siegel, managing principal of StoneCastle Partners, an asset management firm that invests in banks.
Community bankers say their ability to make loans to small businesses will suffer if the program is withdrawn. Cynthia Blankenship, vice chairwoman of Bank of the West in Grapevine, Tex., a Dallas suburb, said that about 15 percent of its $350 million in assets were protected under the program.
''I don't think all of our deposits under the program would go away if it expired,'' she said. ''But a lot of them will convert to interest-bearing accounts, which cost us more and drives up the price of credit.''
Curiously, the Credit Union National Association opposes the extension, putting its relatively small institutions on the same side as behemoths like Bank of America and Citigroup. Credit unions are trying to expand their lending to small businesses, and think ending the guarantee program would put them on a more level playing field.
''TAG is a crisis-inspired program which Congress intended to be temporary,'' Bill Cheney, president of the credit union association, wrote in a letter to Senate leaders. ''The crisis is over. The program should expire.''

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
Abandoned houses with overgrown yards may be the image most people associate with Detroit, but the city's downtown and midtown neighborhoods have the opposite problem: a shortage of rental apartments to meet a growing demand for an urban lifestyle.
Developers say occupancy rates in these areas are at least 96 percent, spurred by young professionals, students and empty nesters who want an easy commute to school or work and a short walk to local cafes and bars.
''To us it feels like there's an insatiable demand,'' said Fred Beal, manager of Motown Construction Partners, which led the recent renovation of the 124-unit Broderick Tower downtown.
Built in the late 1920s, the 34-story building near Comerica Park had been vacant for decades, but is fully leased after opening in November. Penthouse units that are 2,300 square feet command $5,000 a month, Mr. Beal said, though most of the studios and one- and two-bedroom apartments rent for $2,000 or less. 
To take advantage of tax credits available for renovating historic buildings, the apartments must be rented, not sold, but developers say the demographic currently testing the waters in Detroit -- many young, first-time city dwellers -- isn't ready for the commitment of buying a condominium anyway.
These tax credits make it easier to renovate old buildings than build new ones, but one exception is the three-story Auburn building, which also opened in November. Located near Wayne State University in midtown, the Auburn has 58 apartments and 11 retail spaces, that are ''leasing very well,'' according to David Di Rita, a principal at the Roxbury Group, one of the building's developers.
Retail tenants include a spinning studio, a bookstore, a Thai restaurant and a home goods store, Mr. Di Rita said, while the apartments -- mostly one-bedrooms around 600 square feet -- rent for ''just south of $1,000 a month.''
The thriving apartment market in these neighborhoods is a bright spot in an otherwise grim financial picture for Detroit. Once the nation's fourth-largest city, its population has dwindled and its finances are floundering. State officials have warned that a state-appointed emergency financial manager may be in the city's future, so enticing former suburbanites to live and not just work or go to school in Detroit has involved some financial incentives. But a crucial factor is creating the thriving neighborhood hubs that places like San Francisco and New York have long offered.
''It turns out it's the same thing that attracts people in other cities,'' Mr. Di Rita said. ''We just never tried it.''
The challenge in downtown Detroit has been figuring out how to reuse high-rise buildings and turn an area that once emptied out at night into a 24-hour community. The smaller scale and college-town feel in midtown Detroit, however, make more modest new developments feasible.
''It's possible to put together a project of reasonable scale and have a huge impact on the neighborhood,'' Mr. Di Rita said.
While the Auburn was a $12 million project, his company is also working on an $82 million renovation of the nearly century-old David Whitney building downtown, across the street from Broderick Tower. Plans are for 108 apartments and an Aloft hotel, and completion by early 2014.
There is still an approximately 10-block gap between midtown and downtown ''where the urban fabric drops off,'' Mr. Di Rita said. That area is gradually filling in, but he acknowledged that much of the city was still struggling with empty buildings and abandoned single-family homes.
''Detroit has figured out a solution for its center city, which maybe encompasses five to seven square miles of a 140-square mile city,'' he said. ''The predominant condition outside those strongholds is substantial vacancy.''
A factor that has helped draw people to live in apartments either in midtown or downtown is up to $3,500 in rental rebates available to employees of companies like Quicken Loans and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, which have brought jobs back to Detroit.
Wayne State University, the Detroit Medical Center and the Henry Ford Health System, longtime anchors in midtown, also participate in the rental rebate program, which is supported by participating employers, foundation grants and the Michigan State Housing Development Authority.
''A key strategy for the neighborhood for quite some time has been about introducing a lot more residential options,'' said Susan Mosey, president of Midtown Detroit, a nonprofit organization that supports economic development in the neighborhood.
The group was involved in the Auburn project and is also a partner in the renovation of the historic Forest Arms building, which will add another 75 apartments in midtown.
Along with these real estate projects, Midtown Detroit is also helping to attract or develop the amenities that city dwellers want around their apartments, like bike paths, parks where residents can walk their dogs, and places to eat and shop. A Whole Foods is to open in midtown next year, and a light rail project is in the planning stages.
''These are all pieces of a larger revitalization puzzle,'' Ms. Mosey said. ''If you're not doing all of it, you're never going to be successful.''
Another important factor is the degree to which developers, employers, community groups and public entities are working together to bring about the types of changes long overdue.
''This is truly a public-private sector driven strategy,'' said George Jackson, president and chief executive of the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation. ''What's interesting is that the momentum and the partnerships are getting stronger even in light of the city's financial situation.''
Mr. Jackson said many of the current efforts began in preparation for the Super Bowl Detroit hosted in 2006, with improvements along downtown streets that led to a more robust night life and an opportunity to persuade suburbanites to live closer to where they work and go out. ''You build an entertainment district -- all of a sudden people are not going home at 5, they're sticking around until midnight or beyond,'' he said. ''Next they're saying 'Why am I driving 20 miles back home?' ''
But Mr. Jackson also acknowledged that there was much more work to be done, like redeveloping Detroit's waterfront, attracting more businesses and improving local schools so young professionals don't leave Detroit after they start having children.
''We'd be crazy to think that we're going to fix everything at the same time,'' he said. ''We developed a strategy to work on several things at one time, but not all things at once.''

HEADLINE: Slowing Demand Widened U.S. Trade Deficit in October

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The nation's trade deficit widened in October as exports suffered the biggest decline in nearly four years, indicating that slowing global demand was spilling over into the nation's already struggling economy. 
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday the trade gap increased 4.9 percent to $42.2 billion. In a sign of weak domestic demand, imports hit the lowest level in one and a half years.
''The report tells a tale of weakening economic growth momentum both domestically and globally,'' said Millan Mulraine, a senior economist at TD Securities in New York.
Economists, who had expected the trade deficit to widen to $42.6 billion in October, said Hurricane Sandy, which struck the East Coast in late October, could have disrupted trade flows.
But the Commerce Department did not indicate that the storm was a factor. The wider trade gap in October reflected a 3.6 percent decline in exports of goods and services to $180.5 billion. That was the biggest percentage drop in exports since January 2009.
Imports of goods and services fell 2.1 percent, to $222.8 billion, in October, the lowest since April 2011.
Economists said the decline in imports was hardly surprising, given a weakening in consumer demand in recent months.
Fears that tighter fiscal policy, set to kick in early next year, could push the economy into recession have sapped domestic demand and caused businesses to cut back on spending.
Trade was a modest boost to the third quarter's 2.7 percent annual growth pace. Revisions to September's data showed a narrower trade gap than previously reported and suggested the contribution from trade was probably slightly bigger.
In October, the inflation-adjusted trade deficit narrowed to $46.2 billion from $46.6 billion in September.
While that implied trade would make another small contribution to gross domestic product in the fourth quarter, economists said the size of the decline in exports raised the bar high for that.
Weak domestic demand was underscored by a 0.6 percent rise in wholesale inventories in October, which came as sales fell for the first time in three months, a second Commerce Department report showed.
That pushed the inventories/sales ratio, a measure of how long it would take wholesalers to clear their warehouses, to a three-year high. Inventories accounted for more than a quarter of the economy's growth pace in the third quarter.
While exports to the 27-nation European Union rose 1.4 percent in October, there were substantial declines in goods shipped to France, Germany, Italy and Britain.
Exports to the European Union in the first 10 months of 2012 were down 0.7 percent compared to same period in 2011.
American exports to Latin America also fell in October, and shipments to Japan dropped 8 percent.
Although exports to China, which have been growing more slowly than in recent years, surged 23.1 percent in October, imports rose to a record.
That pushed the United States' trade deficit with China to a record $29.5 billion.

HEADLINE: As Fiscal Talks Heat Up, Questions on Whether Boehner Can Get the Votes

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With negotiations quickening on Tuesday to prevent a year-end fiscal crisis, White House officials once again are confronting a vexing question: Can Speaker John A. Boehner deliver enough Republican votes for whatever deficit-reduction plan he and President Obama might decide?
Eighteen months ago the White House was forced to answer in the negative after secret negotiations between the two leaders collapsed once word leaked of their tentative deal, with its proposed revenue increases. But once again, Mr. Obama must put his fate in Mr. Boehner's hands on the issue that will help define the president's second term, and his legacy. 
On Monday, the president presented a new offer and on Tuesday, Mr. Boehner answered back as he and the president conferred by telephone. That talk came two days after a one-on-one meeting in the Oval Office without staff members present -- their first solo meeting since those failed talks toward a ''grand bargain'' in July 2011. While neither provided details, one person familiar with the White House proposal said Mr. Obama had reduced his call for $1.6 trillion in additional revenues from the wealthy over the first 10 years to $1.4 trillion, still $600 billion higher than the Republicans' position. And another said the president also proposed that the two sides commit to working on overhauling the corporate tax code next year.
Earlier Tuesday, Mr. Boehner made a rare statement from the floor of the House admonishing the president to offer more, and more specific, spending cuts.
In an interview with ABC News, Mr. Obama said that if Republicans relent on their resistance to tax rates going up on the wealthy, ''then we are prepared to do some tough things on the spending side.''
''Taxes are going to go up one way or another,'' he said, ''and I think the key is that taxes go up on high-end individuals.''
The direct discussions followed a week in which preliminary negotiations among top-level staff advisers had not gone well, according to people in both parties, with time running out before a year-end deadline for action.
The president has no choice but to rely on Mr. Boehner, who leads Republicans' only center of power. ''It's not like there's another path; he's the speaker of the House,'' said a senior administration official, who would not comment further about the relations between Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner, which were strained by last year's failure.
But Democrats in the White House and Congress also say that they believe Mr. Boehner does hold greater sway among Republican colleagues than he did in the summer of 2011, his first year as speaker, given the chastening experience for junior Republicans of both last year's budget fights and the 2012 election results.
Contributing to that sense of Mr. Boehner's greater empowerment was the letter he sent to Mr. Obama last week, in which he acknowledged Republicans' willingness to raise new revenues as part of a deal: It was also signed by the House Republican leadership team, including Mr. Boehner's occasional intraparty rival, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader, and Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the House Budget Committee chairman and former vice-presidential nominee who has a following among antitax conservatives.
Both men and their advisers continued on Tuesday to be silent on the leaders' private discussions, which many in both parties took as a sign of potential progress. But the speaker sought to turn up the public pressure on Mr. Obama -- and dispel the sense of progress, Republican aides said -- with his blast before the C-Span cameras.
''Where are the spending cuts?'' Mr. Boehner asked. ''The longer the White House slow walks this process, the closer our economy gets to the fiscal cliff.''
His statement seemed directed as much at Republican lawmakers and party activists -- to reassure them that he was fighting the good fight against government spending, given Republicans' likely concessions on taxes -- as at the president and the broader public.
Conservatives have been growing nervous about any deal with Mr. Obama. ''I have great respect for the speaker,'' said Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the senior Republican on the Budget Committee, ''but he doesn't have my proxy.''
And Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, a Tea Party favorite, disparaged any deal that could be struck by ''two elected officials and their unelected staff.''
''This is not the end of the world if we go over the fiscal cliff,'' he said.
The ambitious goal of the talks is twofold: a framework for long-term deficit reduction through both tax increases on affluent Americans and cuts in spending for Medicare and other entitlement-benefit programs, with many details to be hashed out next year, and an immediate measure to block more than $500 billion in economically threatening spending cuts and tax increases that would take effect in January absent the alternative deficit-reduction compromise.
Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, emerged from a luncheon caucus with other Senate Democrats to say a resolution would be ''extremely difficult'' before Christmas. Failure would force lawmakers to return to the Capitol in the week before the New Year's deadline for 11th-hour legislative drama -- risking a voter backlash much like last year. He also pointed to what he called ''infighting going on with the House leadership'' about the direction of the talks, but Republicans dismissed that notion.
That 2011 showdown between Mr. Obama and Congressional Republicans over increasing the nation's debt limit hurt both the recovery and the public-approval ratings of both sides, but especially Republicans, who lost seats in the House and Senate. The $1 trillion spending-cuts deal that ended that fight followed the collapse of the Obama-Boehner talks for a $3 trillion deal to stabilize the growth of federal debt.
This week the president and speaker took direct control after staff-level talks bogged down late last week, largely over what one person close to the White House called ''the big 2'': Republicans' demands that Mr. Obama agree both to a slow increase in the eligibility age for Medicare, to 67 from 65, and to a new formula that would reduce cost-of living increases for Social Security.
Mr. Obama has balked; he opposes both ideas and faces heavy pressure from unions and other progressive groups to reject them. But his stance is undercut by the fact that he had tentatively agreed to both proposals in last year's secret talks, in return for Mr. Boehner's support for raising taxes on high-income earners.
The president and his aides have told Mr. Boehner and his team that both proposals would be a hard sell to other Democrats, people close to the talks say.

HEADLINE: Single Patent System Moves Forward in Europe, and Banking Rules Could Be Next

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- It took only four decades of wrangling.
On Tuesday, the European Parliament adopted a uniform patent system for Europe. If the plan goes into effect as expected by early 2014, it would try to remedy the country-by-country approach whose time and costs have long been an impediment to innovation across the European Union.
Achieving the new unified system could conceivably provide encouragement for another, far more ambitious project that European leaders will be grappling with at their summit meeting this week: a uniform system of banking regulation and supervision for the euro area. But the long, tortuous route to the patent agreement might also serve as a cautionary tale.
The banking union has already bogged down in national battles that some experts warn could drag out the process for years -- particularly if changes to the bloc's treaties are needed to give the central bank new and wide-ranging supervisory powers, or to set up a joint financial backstop to ensure the orderly winding down of failing banks. 
''What's clear is that the E.U. continues to operate on a hopelessly optimistic time scale,'' Mats Persson, the director of the research group Open Europe, wrote in a briefing note on Tuesday. Mr. Persson was referring to the time it would take to set up a ''proper safety net'' for Europe's banks, including a bank resolution fund.
In the case of the patent system, decades of discussions resulted in an unsatisfactory compromise, according to Bruno van Pottelsberghe, the dean of the Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management. The new system will ''still be a mess'' and ''we should not expect any of a change in Europe's innovative performance,'' Mr. van Pottelsberghe said.
Meeting in Strasbourg on Tuesday, the European Parliament voted 484 to 164 to pass the key plank of the new patent system. Nation-by-nation vetting of the new system will formally start in February, when governments are expected to sign a treaty creating special patent courts.
The system would supplement the current patchwork of patent rules in the European Union; under the current system, a ruling in one of the union's 27 countries has no automatic bearing on another. The patchwork approach has made protecting inventions and innovations in Europe 15 times more expensive than in the United States, harming competitiveness, according to the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union.
The cost of patent protection should initially drop to around 6,500 euros, or $8,400, from about 36,000 euros, or $46,500, the commission said. That change is largely because the new so-called unitary patents granted by the European Patent Office in Munich would no longer need to be validated in all of the countries where protection is sought. Nor would they need to be translated into all local languages. Instead, English, German or French would suffice.
Benoît Battistelli, the president of the European Patent Office, said the decision on Tuesday would ''equip the European economy with a truly supranational patent system.''
Yet the long, tangled history of working toward a common patent -- repeatedly shelved after bumping up against national interests and with squabbling over languages -- is a timely reminder of how much easier it is to make commitments to a unified Europe than to put unity into practice.
In the case of the banking rules, also known as banking union, European governments still must overcome differences over the system's most fundamental element: a single banking supervisor operating under the aegis of the European Central Bank.
European finance ministers are expected to work through the night on Wednesday in Brussels debating whether a new supervisor would oversee all 6,000 lenders in the euro area. France, Germany, Sweden, Hungary and Britain are among countries with concerns about the plan. The timing for an agreement ''is likely to slip, as member states remain far apart on a number of key substantive issues,'' Mujtaba Rahman, an analyst for the Eurasia Group, wrote in a briefing note on Tuesday.
On Thursday, the finance ministers will give way to the European Union's 27 leaders, gathering for their year-end summit meeting. When the leaders met in June, their joint decisions were cast as the starting point for tighter economic and monetary union in Europe. A central pillar of that agreement was a banking union, which would end the so-called doom loop in which frail banks endanger national finances and cause countries to need bailouts.
But with borrowing costs in Spain and Italy having fallen to moderate levels after a late-summer pledge by the European Central Bank to buy the bonds of troubled countries, the urgency to institute sweeping reforms has waned. And although the euro area is in recession and the scale of debt in countries like Greece and Spain still could lead to a wider crisis, leaders on Thursday are expected to reiterate aims and goals, rather than take practical steps.
To be sure, the banking union has a weightier and more urgent mission than the single patent. But even the new patent system has been cobbled together by compromises that critics say will undermine it.
One major problem, according to Mr. van Pottelsberghe, the economics school dean, is that national patent offices will continue operating in tandem with the new system by granting their own patents. ''That's catastrophic,'' he said, because it increases the chances that firms will impede the market with patent challenges.
Concrete efforts to create a European patent began in earnest in the mid-1970s. But repeated disputes over the expense of translations into all of the official European languages killed those initiatives. A breakthrough came in March 2011, when 25 members of the bloc went ahead under a specialized procedure that allows like-minded nations to move forward.
Spain and Italy, upset that their languages will not be given prominence, have sued to overturn that decision at the European Court of Justice, the bloc's highest tribunal. But in a preliminary opinion issued on Tuesday, the court's advocate general rejected the Spanish and Italian claims that the specialized procedure was misused. The court should issue a final decision next year.
There are also concerns about the new system of patent courts.
Graham Taylor, the chief executive of OpenForum Europe, an industry group that includes Google, Oracle and I.B.M., said that the plans for the new court system, split among Paris, London and Munich, were especially troubling. ''While the new rules may reduce the cost of filing patents, our concern is how to appeal against bad patents,'' Mr. Taylor said.
As the banking union is only likely to apply to countries that use the euro, those that do not are unlikely to support the effort.
Britain has no plans to join the single currency but wants to protect its banking sector from rulings it disagrees with. Then there are member states like Hungary, which will eventually join the single currency but remain out for now. Some of those countries say they fear their banks will be at a competitive disadvantage in the interim.
Also in the case of banking union, members still must overcome differences over which institutions should oversee the new system, and even where they should be located.
Germany, in particular, says it is concerned about placing the new banking supervisor within the European Central Bank. German officials are especially wary that the central bank's record on monetary policy could be compromised if, for example, it were to adjust interest rates to ease the conditions for banks falling under its supervision.
One possibility under discussion is allowing the single bank supervisor to be based in another city besides Frankfurt, where the E.C.B. has its headquarters.

HEADLINE: Jobs, Productivity and the Great Decoupling

BYLINE: By ERIK BRYNJOLFSSON and ANDREW McAFEE

 BODY:
Cambridge, Mass.
A WONDERFUL ride has come to an end. For several decades after World War II the economic statistics we care most about all rose together here in America as if they were tightly coupled. G.D.P. grew, and so did productivity -- our ability to get more output from each worker. At the same time, we created millions of jobs, and many of these were the kinds of jobs that allowed the average American worker, who didn't (and still doesn't) have a college degree, to enjoy a high and rising standard of living.
Productivity growth slowed in the 1970s but revved up again in the 1990s and has stayed strong most years since. But as shown by the accompanying graph, which was first drawn by the economist Jared Bernstein, productivity growth and employment growth started to become decoupled from each other at the end of that decade. Bernstein calls the gap that's opened up ''the jaws of the snake.'' They show no signs of closing. 
We are creating jobs, but not enough of them. The employment-to-population ratio, or percentage of working-age people that have work, dropped over 5 points during the Great Recession, and has improved only half a point in the three and a half years since it ended [pdf].
As the jaws of the snake opened, wages suffered even more than job growth. Adjusted for inflation, the average U.S. household now has lower income than it did in 1997. Wages as a share of G.D.P. are now at an all-time low, even as corporate profits are at an all-time high. The implicit bargain that gave workers a steady share of the productivity gains has unraveled.
What's going on? Why have job volumes and wages become decoupled from the rest of the train of economic progress? There are several explanations, including tax and policy changes and the effects of globalization and off-shoring. We agree that these matter but want to stress another driver of the ''Great Decoupling'' -- the changing nature of technological progress.
As digital devices like computers and robots get more capable thanks to Moore's Law (the proposition that the number of transistors on a semiconductor can be inexpensively doubled about every two years), they can do more of the work that people used to do. Digital labor, in short, substitutes for human labor. This happens first with more routine tasks, which is a big part of the reason why less-educated workers have seen their wages fall the most as we moved deeper into the computer age.
As we move ahead the Great Decoupling will only accelerate, for two reasons. First, computers will keep getting cheaper over time. Digital labor will become cheaper than human labor not only in the United States and other rich countries, but also in places like China and India. Off-shoring is only a way station on the road to automation.
Second, technologies are going to continue to become more powerful, and to acquire more advanced skills and abilities. They can already drive cars, understand and produce natural human speech, write clean prose, and beat the best human Jeopardy! players. Digital progress has surprised a lot of people, and we ain't seen nothing yet. Brawny computers, brainy programmers, and big data are a potent combination, and they're nowhere near finished. The implications of their work for the labor force are nicely summarized by the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who says: ''The spread of computers and the Internet will put jobs in two categories: People who tell computers what to do, and people who are told by computers what to do.'' Only one of these two job categories will be well paid.
The Great Decoupling is not going to reverse course, for the simple reason that advances in digital technologies are not about to stop. In fact, we're convinced that they are accelerating. And this should be great news for society. Digital progress lowers prices, improves quality, and brings us into a world where abundance becomes the norm.
But there is no economic law that says digital progress will benefit everyone evenly. As technology races ahead it can leave a lot of workers behind. In the short run we can improve their prospects greatly by investing in infrastructure, reforming education at all levels and encouraging entrepreneurs to invent the new products, services and industries that will create jobs.
While we're doing this, however, we also need to start preparing for a technology-fueled economy that's ever-more productive, but that just might not need a great deal of human labor. Designing a healthy society to go along with such an economy will be the great challenge, and the great opportunity, of the next generation.
We have to acknowledge that the old ride of tightly coupled statistics has ended, and start thinking about what we want the new ride to look like.
