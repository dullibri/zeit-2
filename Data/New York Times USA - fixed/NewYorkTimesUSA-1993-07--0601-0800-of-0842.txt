HEADLINE: Airlines Clash in Court on Fares

BYLINE: By KATHRYN JONES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GALVESTON, Tex., July 21

 BODY:
With videotapes, flip-charts, enlargements of once-secret memos and thousands of documents, armies of lawyers in Federal District Court here are re-enacting the airline fare war of 1992.
In an elegantly restored courtroom with carved wooden panels and silk drapes, Continental Airlines and Northwest Airlines are trying to draw blood, demonstrating that American Airlines engaged in "predatory pricing." That means setting fares so low that American would lose money, but so would its weaker rivals, who might be forced out of business. 
 Continental and Northwest say American's policies cost them at least $1 billion last year. American Airlines, whose executives deny they engaged in predatory pricing, say Continental and Northwest stumbled because of mismanagement.
 
Crandall Meets Jamail
 For many people at the courthouse here, the anticipated highlight of the trial will come next week, when Robert L. Crandall, the chairman of American Airlines' parent, the AMR Corporation, will take the stand. Mr. Crandall is known for his outspoken views, and his grilling at the hands of Joseph D. Jamail, the folksy Houston lawyer representing Continental, is much awaited.
"Joe Jamail is no wilting flower," said the presiding judge, Samuel B. Kent, of the man best known for winning a multibillion-dollar judgment against Texaco Inc. in 1985 for his client, Pennzoil, in a fight over who would acquire Getty Oil. "I may have to eat a power bar that day."
Of the testimony so far, the highlights have been the appearance today of Robert R. Ferguson 3d, president and chief executive of Continental Airlines, and of John Dasburg, chief executive at Northwest Airlines, last week.
Mr. Ferguson testified that he believed American's pricing strategy and its half-price summer sale last year delayed Continental from emerging from bankruptcy, derailed the airline's ambitious improvement plans and thrust the airline into a fight for survival.
After Continental matched American's new and lower fares in April 1992, Mr. Ferguson said, the airline lost $30 million a month and an additional $60 million to $70 million during the summer fare war.
By July, he said, Continental had only two days' worth of cash on hand, about $29 million, but managed to win concessions from some lessors of its planes so it could continue operating.
Mr. Ferguson told the court that American's deep fare cuts were "both predatory and below cost." If Continental and Northwest had gone out of business, he said American could have raised prices by 10 to 20 percent in selected markets.
On cross-examination, Irv Terrell, a lawyer for American Airlines, produced a Continental marketing report on the airline's plans for fall 1992 that said American's pricing strategy left business customers "up for grabs" and had the effect of "leveling the playing field." Mr. Ferguson said he did not recall seeing the document.
Mr. Ferguson will be back on the stand on Thursday morning.
In testimony last week, Mr. Dasburg told the court that Mr. Crandall had put pressure on him, in a conversation in September 1991, to join in raising airline ticket prices.
Mr. Dasburg said Mr. Crandall and Donald V. Carty, an AMR executive vice president, took him aside after a dinner gathering of airline and aerospace executives and "lectured me with regard to pricing at Northwest Airlines."
Mr. Crandall, he testified, "stated that we were a discount carrier and I personally ought to make sure I was supervising pricing." Mr. Dasburg said he interpreted that to be a suggestion that Northwest raise its fares, and he said he reported the discussion to Northwest's general counsel.
American Airlines executives have disputed that the conversation ever took place.
 
'Value Pricing' at Heart
 At the heart of the case is what American Airlines called "value pricing," introduced on April 9, 1992. The airline said the approach was a way to end the confusing array of ticket prices by offering only four fares: first class, coach and two discount fares requiring advance purchase.
American hoped that other carriers would go along with plan, and many did. But a month later, Northwest fired the first shot of the summer fare war by offering a promotion of a free ticket for each adult paying a fare for a child. American volleyed back, offering 50 percent on domestic fares to all leisure passengers who could meet certain restrictions.
An all-out fare war ensued, and industry losses mounted. Continental, which at the time was operating under bankruptcy protection, and Northwest, which Mr. Dasburg said was almost out of money, say they lost a combined $1 billion as a result of American's actions.
In court documents, American has denied pricing its fares below its costs.
Lawyers for Northwest and Continental have been trying to use American's own internal documents to make their case that American slashed prices even though it would cost it hundreds of millions of dollars.
 
Economist on Stand
 On Monday and Tuesday, these lawyers questioned a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist who performed a computer analysis of American's projections for its value-pricing plan.
The economist, Franklin Fisher, said it was "preposterous" for American officials to believe the would make money under the value-pricing plan. "It's plain that unless they damaged or weakened competition, it could never pay off," he testified.
American reported a $935 million loss last year, and Dr. Fisher said hundreds of millions of those dollars came from the value-pricing plan and the summer half-price sale.
But if American succeeded in pushing weaker rivals out of business, he said, it would reap about a $500 million a year in additional profits by raising fares, recouping its losses in no more than two years.
A lawyer for American Airlines, Robert Cooper, countered that that Dr. Fisher's estimates for recoupment were based on theory and not market realities. He defended American's simplified fares as a legitimate competitive strategy and noted that in 1990, Northwest said predatory pricing "just can't happen" in the airline industry because of the competitive environment.
Northwest and Continental lawyers say they expect to finish presenting their evidence by Friday.
 
Parade of Charts
 The proceedings have been moving at a brisk pace: the jury of three women and nine men has viewed videotaped testimony by several American pricing officials and its chief financial officer, listened to testimony by a Northwest pricing executive and expert witnesses and seen a dizzying parade of air fare charts, route maps and memos on projector screens.
If the jury should conclude that American Airlines violated antitrust laws, it could assess punitive damages up to three times the amount claimed.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Dun & Bradstreet President Ascends to Chief Executive

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON

 BODY:
The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation said yesterday that its president and chief operating officer, Robert E. Weissman, would become chief executive on Jan. 1, a planned succession that was generally praised by industry analysts.
Charles W. Morris, currently the chairman and chief executive, will remain as chairman, the company said. 
 Mr. Weissman, 53, joined D.& B. in 1979 when his computer time-sharing firm was acquired. He is well regard ed by financial analysts, who say his technical expertise and charismatic presence are likely to bring new vigor to D& B, where he faces significant challenges.
In an interview, Mr. Weissman said he expected future expansion for the company in Asia and the countries in the former Soviet Union, where rudimentary economies make information-gathering a harder task. "That means we don't have a minute to lose," he said.
Through a series of acquisitions in the 80's, D.& B. became the world's largest marketer of information to business through such well-known companies as Nielsen, the television-audience and consumer-products research firm, and Moody's Investors Service, the bond-rating agency.
 
Hurt by Rival and Recession
 But the company's record of rapid and consistent revenue growth during the decade, peaking at 16 percent in 1984, has slowed in recent years. With 40 percent of its revenue from foreign sources, D.& B. has been hurt by the recession, particularly in Europe, the emergence of a new domestic rival in consumer-product marketing, Information Resources Inc., and structural changes in the business of mainframe software and Yellow Pages publishing.
"It's been knocked off its pedestal as a glamour, growth stock," said James C. Goss, a media and information services analyst with Duff & Phelps.
Shares in D.& B., which also reported second-quarter results showing a 3.6 percent increase in income on flat revenue growth, rose 62.5 cents yesterday, to $60.125, in New York Stock Exchange trading.

HEADLINE: Bothered and Bewildered

BYLINE: By Katha Pollitt; Katha Pollitt is an associate editor of The Nation.

 BODY:
Murphy Brown's baby apparently has a lot of real-life company. A just released Census Bureau report tells us that among white women and women with some college education, the percentage who have become mothers without marrying has more than doubled in the last decade, to 14.6 percent and 11.3 percent, respectively; among women with professional or managerial jobs, it has almost tripled, to 8.3 percent. While the numbers are small -- most unwed mothers are poor and thus disproportionately black or Hispanic -- they show that single motherhood cannot be explained by words like "inner-city," "welfare dependency" and "pathology."
Nonetheless, you can virtually hear the hum of word processors as family-values advocates labor through the hot summer nights, turning out articles and speeches bemoaning the new statistics and rounding up the usual suspects: feminism, promiscuity, the media, the 60's. 
 What if instead of trying to bully women to the altar, we ask why they're no longer running up the aisles?
Maybe marriage no longer serves women very well. Historically, lucky women married for love and still do -- I'm sure that most of today's unwed employed moms would be pleased to tie the knot with a diaper-changing Mr. Right -- but beneath the hearts and flowers, middle-class marriage was an economic bargain. He supported her; she minded the house and children.
With rare exceptions, marriage was the only path to female adulthood: a home of one's own, community standing, a sex life, children. Barred from professional training and good jobs, threatened with disgrace and the loss of her baby if she got pregnant, mocked as a spinster if she stayed unwed past her early 20's, a woman was pushed into marriage by just about every social institution: family, religion, neighbors, custom, law, school, the workplace, doctors of soul and body.
None of this is so true today. If women can support themselves, they don't need to marry for what was politely called security but was, to put it bluntly, money. If single women can have sex, their own homes, the respect of friends and interesting work, they don't need to tell themselves that any marriage is better than none. Why not have a child on one's own? Children are a joy; many men are not. To take care of a child makes sense: Children cannot cook their own meals, make their own doctor's appointments, do their own laundry. To take care of a husband after working all day makes much less sense, but most men still seem to expect it. All around them, single women see divorced women raising their kids, often with little or no child support, and hear married moms say that they might as well be single for all the help they get from their mates. If single women increasingly see marriage and motherhood as separate commitments, perhaps the reason is that they are.
The collapse of the traditional middle-class marriage bargain has left both sexes bewildered, and is a major cause of the much-discussed open hostility between men and women. But how can you make the sexes act as if they needed each other to survive when they don't? All they need each other for is love, and love is hard to find. That is the nettle the family-values proponents refuse to grasp. They keep talking as if women can be coralled into marriage by appeals to morality and self-sacrifice or punitive social policies. But the futility of their cause is shown by the feeble measures they propose: deglamorizing single motherhood, emphasizing fatherhood, stigmatizing single moms or their kids.
Critics of single motherhood cite studies showing higher rates of everything from crime to kids' visits to shrinks. What they don't tell you is that most of this results from the crushing poverty in which so many single mothers live. Among middle-class kids, the only fair comparison is between those raised by single parents and those raised by unhappily married couples. That is at best the real-life alternative that single mothers face. Here, too, the difference to the children vanishes.
There's isn't any way, in our modern, secular society, to reconnect marriage and maternity. We'd have to bring back the whole 19th century: Restore the cult of virginity and the double standard, ban birth control, restrict divorce, kick women out of decent jobs, force unwed pregnant women to put their babies up for adoption on pain of social death, make out-of-wedlock children legal nonpersons.
None of this will happen, so why not come to terms with reality? Instead of trying to make women -- and men -- adapt to an outworn institution, we should adapt our institutions to the lives people actually live. Single mothers need paid parental leave, day care, flexible schedules, child support, pediatricians with evening hours. Most of all, they need equal pay and comparable worth. What they don't need is sermons.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Near Low vs. Yen But Gains on the Mark

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar sank close to its record low against the Japanese yen yesterday as the United States renewed calls for currency rate changes to slash Japan's huge trade surplus.
But the dollar rebounded against the German mark as fresh tensions in the European Monetary System set off a flight to safer investments. 
 Meanwhile, gold prices rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, the actively traded gold contract for August delivery gained $1.80 an ounce, to $391.30. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted spot gold at $391.75 an ounce, up $3.05 from Wednesday.
The dollar plunged as low as 105.10 yen yesterday afternoon after Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman said changes in currency rates might help lower Japan's trade surplus. The level was the weakest since June 15, when the dollar hit a new postwar low of 104.82 yen. In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 105.25 yen, down from 108.13 yen on Wednesday.
"It shows that the Clinton Administration believes that by manipulating dollar-yen, it's going to help reduce the United States trade deficit," said Ken Nixon, corporate foreign exchange dealer at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, of Altman's remark.
The yen had risen earlier as many fled the mark amid renewed speculation that the European Monetary System could soon collapse, leading to lower interest rates and weaker currencies in Europe.
The system, which ties several currencies to a tight trading range, came under siege as the French franc, Danish krone, Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo plunged despite central bank intervention and Government statements to stop the selloff.
The mark, followed by sterling and the Swiss franc rose against other European currencies on safe-haven buying. The dollar was preferred over the mark, but the yen was the most favored currency.
 
 
'Bailing Out of Europe'
 "Everybody is selling marks and buying yen. Everybody's bailing out of Europe now," said Tom Moore, senior director at American Express Bank.
The dollar rose to 1.7044 German marks in late New York trading, from 1.6975 marks late Wednesday. The British pound, meanwhile, fell to $1.5120 late in New York, below $1.5150 Wednesday. Earlier in London, the pound fell to $1.5095, from $1.5160 Wednesday.
At the height of the European selloff, the Bank of France denied rumors of a news conference to announce a sharp rise in interest rates or devaluation of the French franc.
 "The market's confused about the validity of these rumors," said Jim Blackwelder, vice president at First Union National Bank. "On one hand you say you don't think it'll happen. But on the other hand, just in case, it's better to be positioned."

HEADLINE: Fed Abandons Policy Tied to Money Supply

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve said today that the main yardstick it used in guiding the economy's growth for more than 15 years had become so unreliable that it would largely abandon it.
Alan Greenspan, the central bank's chairman, said the Federal Reserve would stop relying on growth in the money supply -- its traditional tool -- and begin relying on interest rates, an approach more akin to the way it worked before it started relying on the money supply figures.
 
Changes in Investments
 In an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee today, Mr. Greenspan said the central bank was jettisoning the money supply approach because changes in the way Americans invest their money meant it could no longer predict how much economic growth would be produced by a certain amount of growth in the money supply. 
 "The relationship has completely broken down," Mr. Greenspan said.
Some economists predicted, however, that the new approach could present just as many problems as the one being discarded, and would make it harder for investors, economists and politicians to predict the Federal Reserve's actions.
The move comes at a time when the Fed has been criticized for keeping monetary growth so low, thus hampering economic growth. It also comes at a time when President Clinton and others are counting on low interest rates to spur the economy to greater growth.
The Federal Reserve has long sought to influence the economy through interest rates, lowering them to encourage growth and raising them to quell inflationary pressures.
How much attention to pay to the money supply in setting policy has long been a matter of disagreement among economists. Some argue that slow, steady expansion of the money supply is the key to noninflationary growth.
Since the late 1970's, the Federal Reserve has made many of its most important decisions by setting a specific target for growth in the money supply -- loosely the amount of money in circulation plus savings and checking accounts -- and often adjusted interest rates to meet them.
Federal Reserve officials said they were happy with the way money supply targets worked from the late 1970's until last year. Paul A. Volcker, the Fed's former chairman, used these targets to help bring down the double-digit inflation of the late 1970's, and then used them to help steer the record economic expansion after 1982.
Lower interest rates encourage businesses and individuals to borrow more, putting more money into the economy, some of which comes back to the banks, which then make further loans; in these circumstances, money supply grows faster. Higher rates tend to have the opposite effect.
Federal Reserve officials say the decision by millions of Americans to move their money from savings accounts into mutual funds, and particularly money market funds that many people use like savings and checking accounts, is the main factor that has damaged the relationship between money supply growth and economic growth. The reason is that M-2, the Federal Reserve's main measure of the money supply, includes money in savings and checking accounts but does not include money in mutual funds.
 
Like Carpenters Without Tools
 The central bank's predicament is akin to that of a team of carpenters who discover that their levels, plumbs and tape measures are no longer reliable and thus have to rely on the naked eye to make sure walls are vertical and floors horizontal.
"What Greenspan said in effect is he's junking M-2," said David M. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a New York brokerage. "That's historic."
The new tool that the central bank is turning to involves real interest rates -- which are determined by subtracting the inflation rate from nominal interest rates, which have inflation built into them. A 5 percent interest rate, for example, effectively amounts to a 2 percent "real" interest rate if inflation is running at 3 percent. The Fed said it would seek to set real interest rates at a level that creates steady growth with minimal inflation.
The plans to stop relying on monetary growth not only leave the Federal Reserve searching for new guideposts to help steer the nation to a desired level of growth but, critics say, leave the Fed steering by the stars, rather than by science, in trying to bring about steady growth with low inflation.
Mr. Greenspan said it now appeared that the Fed could produce satisfactory economic growth with far lower growth in the money supply than previously believed. In the view of many economists, the Fed's reliance on a new tool -- real interest rates -- indicates that the central bank will raise rates sooner rather than later.
 
Excuse for Raising Rates?
 Several economists interviewed said real short-term interest rates of between 1 percent and 2 percent could be expected to produce moderate growth with low inflation. Because Mr. Greenspan is concerned that real interest rates are below zero at the moment, many economists say he will use the new tool as an excuse for raising short-term interest rates soon. The Federal funds rate -- the rate at which banks lend each other money overnight -- is 3 percent, while the inflation is running slightly above that.
As Senate Democrats badgered Mr. Greenspan to keep interest rates low to speed up job growth, Mr. Greenspan repeated the central bank's concerns about holding down inflation.
"The signal we are endeavoring to send here is at some point rates are going to have to move up," he said, giving no indication of how soon the central bank might act. The consensus among economists is that the Federal Reserve would raise rates in two months if inflation news over the next two months is bad, but that it could hold off indefinitely if inflation simmers down, as it seems to be at the moment.
 
 
End of Monetarism
 Economists said the central bank's decision to abandon the use of money supply growth as a tool was a nail in the coffin for an economic theory known as monetarism. Under this theory, central banks should keep the money supply growing at a steady, predetermined rate for many years, and that will produce a moderate rate of growth with minimal inflation.
"The Federal Reserve's move shows that the influence of pure monetarists has clearly faded," said Scott Pardee, a former senior Federal Reserve official who is chairman of Yamaichi International America, a brokerage firm. "Even the practical monetarists have found it is hard to use the different measures of the money supply for policy purposes."
Under the Humphrey Hawkins Act of 1978, the Federal Reserve must state its targets for monetary growth every six months. Mr. Greenspan's statement today means the central bank will continue to announce such targets, even though it will largely ignore them in determining monetary policy.
In interviews today, some economists said they had little idea how the Federal Reserve would set targets for real interest rates.
"We're all asking the same questions about how this will work," said John Silvia, chief economist for Kemper Financial Services in Chicago. "Under one definition, the real interest rate is zero, but I pay 18 percent on my consumer interest and when you subtract 3 percent inflation doesn't that mean a 15 percent real interest rate? The Fed hasn't analyzed this very much."

HEADLINE: Summer Air Fares Are Up Sharply Despite Return of Multiple Prices

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
In a turnabout that has surprised even airline officials, the average ticket price is sharply higher this year -- not only compared with air fares last summer, when a half-price sale helped put 24 million Americans in the air, but with those in the first six months of 1991.
With money-losing carriers striving to show profits, the increase shows signs of holding, despite sporadic sales, and even though upstart regional carriers are forcing the biggest airlines to lower prices on competitive routes. 
 One consequence of the shifts: a year after the airlines abandoned efforts to simplify air fares, the fare categories are as numerous as ever, and just as confusing to passengers and as worrisome to travel agents. Moreover, while bargains can still be had on selected routes, sales and discounts are more narrowly focused than they were in the past.
 
 
Small but Steady Rises
 As a result, analysts say, if all goes according to script -- in an industry where lately very little has gone that way -- prices will continue to rise in small but steady increments.
"There have been very substantial fare increases since last year, both in leisure and business fares," said Robert Harrell, vice president of the air-fare management unit of American Express Travel Related Services. "Through a series of steadily creeping increases that began the end of last summer, and went up month after month, the carriers got the fare levels way back up."
The average domestic ticket price was $535 last month, according to Topaz Enterprises of Portland, Ore., an air-fare auditing firm. That was not only higher than the $458 average of June 1992 but was up almost 12 percent from the $479 average in June 1991.
The nation's big airlines have put through the increases in an attempt to stanch their flow of red ink, and have done so even though traffic remains sluggish. In December alone, the carriers pushed through three price increases totaling 20 percent on unrestricted coach fares, the highest-priced economy fares used mostly by business travelers. Several other increases have since been tacked on.
In fact, from June 1992 through June 1993, leisure fares rose 81 percent, according to the monthly American Express air-fare index, while full coach fares climbed 47 percent and the lowest economy fare for business travelers rose 44 percent.
From the viewpoint of the carriers, which lost $3 billion last year and almost $10 billion since 1989, higher fares are long overdue. Spokesmen argue that more revenue is necessary to finance enormous capital requirements -- including $130 billion just to replace or modify airline fleets to meet noise standards that take effect by the end of the decade.
 
 
American Posts Modest Profit
 At a news conference on Wednesday, Michael J. Durham, the chief financial officer of American Airlines, acknowledged that average ticket prices were up. But in constant dollars, he added, they are "dramatically lower" than in 1980.
This week, American reported a modest $47 million profit for the second quarter, and Delta and several other carriers have similarly crept into the black in the quarter. But profits remain razor-thin, and not since 1988 has the airline industry earned a net profit margin of as much as 3 percent.
One feature that survived the short-lived "value pricing" system introduced by American Airlines 15 months ago, and which briefly became the industry standard, is allowing leisure travelers to change their flights for a nominal fee. But many travel agents wish that most of the system had remained.
"The idea of trying to simplify fares was a great idea," said Phyllis Swiden of Village Travel in Brookings, S.D. "Now we never know what to expect from day to day -- or even during the same day."
Ms. Swiden is not alone in her complaint, or her bewilderment. "There are 17 different fares just from Phoenix to New York," Rosemary Janicki, the head of Seven Continents Travel in Phoenix, said recently.
Among those fares are unrestricted tickets, leisure fares booked 3, 7 or 14 days in advance, fares for night departures and fares for travel on Tuesday, Wednesday or Saturday, to be completed within 30 days.
Other fares that have returned on many routes, despite efforts last summer to end most of them, are special rates for students, children, members of the military, bereavement fares, negotiated fares for corporate clients and group fares for meetings and conventions. Many carriers also have vacation packages that offer air fare, hotels and ground transportation at a discount. Southwest Airlines has added a twist: one-way fares for tickets bought 14 days in advance; normally, the industry requires a round-trip purchase to qualify for special advance-purchase fares.
Despite these promotional fares, the overall trend is up. While the carriers worry that higher prices will erode traffic, most industry executives attribute the sluggish traffic to a weak economy. And almost all officials say that the carriers need to disabuse the public of the notion, as Mr. Durham of American put it, that "they need not buy a ticket until a fare promotion is announced."
This week, William R. Howard, the new chairman of Trans World Airlines, said the Government should consider reimposing some controls on fares to protect airlines against fare wars, which he called "terribly, terribly destructive." Yet before the recent reorganization of T.W.A. into an airline owned by employees and creditors, it had initiated several fare wars to raise cash as it struggled under bankruptcy protection.
Some of the fare increases, especially for leisure fares, are predictable after last summer's unprecedented and money-losing half-price sale, which began in early June.
 
 
Cut-Rate Competition
 Still, it is noteworthy that overall ticket prices have risen despite the introduction of several low-fare carriers, including Reno Air and Kiwi International, and despite the broadening impact of Southwest Airlines, which last year had more passengers than any other carrier in the 100 busiest markets.
 Fares last year in markets served by Southwest averaged $56 for distances of less than 250 miles and $58 for routes of 251 to 500 miles -- less than half of the cost of routes over equivalent distances that are not served by Southwest.
Last month, USAir cut fares an average of 28 percent on flights in the Northeast of less than 750 miles each way, on tickets requiring a 14-day advance purchase and a Saturday night stay. Industry officials viewed the move as an attempt to blunt the thrust of low-fare airlines.
 
 
Special Weekend Deals
 Hoping to stimulate business among impulse passengers "who have quite a bit of income," as one carrier put it, airlines are offering so-called weekend fares in certain markets -- requiring a three-day advance purchase, a maximum stay of four days, departure on Thursday through Saturday and a Saturday night stay. They cost about half the price of an unrestricted coach fare.
"Value pricing assumed that the market only demanded three fares," said Michael W. McCormack, director of industry relations for Rosenbluth Travel, a large Philadelphia-based agency. "But the market is more complex, and airlines are looking to fill the niches in order to maximize yield. Rather than squeeze customer demand into a few buckets, they're creating more buckets."
 The leading airlines again offer corporate discounts, and Delta Air Lines, once content merely to match its rivals, is aggressively pursuing business travelers. Business Travel News, an industry newspaper, said Delta had put together a 20-person headquarters sales staff in a quiet bid to transform itself into a leader in corporate travel.
But discounts for corporate clients differ from those of the past. "Before value pricing, some of those commitments were implied," Mr. McCormack said. "Now the carriers want explicit commitments as to how much business the corporations will deliver to them."

HEADLINE: Tax Fight Protects Lautenberg's Seat

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, July 22

 BODY:
Fifteen months before he comes up for re-election in New Jersey, Senator Frank Lautenberg is already running hard for a third term. His chief opponent at the moment appears to be Bill Clinton.
On one of his frequent forays onto his home turf recently, Mr. Lautenberg seemed to relish talking about how he told the Democratic President in Washington that his deficit reduction plan was no good for New Jersey. 
 "It's not pleasant to sit across from the President of the United States and say, 'It's no go,' " Mr. Lautenberg said.
And what did Mr. Clinton say?
"I think he said, 'Frank, that's not nice," said Mr. Lautenberg, one of six Senate Democrats who voted against the Clinton tax package. His reason, the Senator said, was that it did nothing to aid the Northeast's economy while making major concessions to oil and agricultural states.
 
Guarding His Own Future
 But Mr. Lautenberg may also have been looking out for something more personal than regional economics: his own political future.
He is up for election in 1994 and it is shaping up to be a tough fight. New Jerseyans are sour on taxes. Mr. Clinton won the state with only 43 percent of the vote, and Mr. Lautenberg, who will be 70 years old, may face no less formidable an opponent than former Gov. Thomas H. Kean, who is being urged by national Republicans to run and says he is considering it.
Republicans at both the state and national level think Mr. Lautenberg is vulnerable if they can paint him as a free-spending liberal Democrat in this tax-weary state.
If Mr. Kean does not run, the Congressman from the 12th District, Dick Zimmer, says he will, and is already sniping at Mr. Lautenberg as "a tax-and-spend Democrat" only recently converted to a "born-again fiscal conservative."
Marge Roukema, now in her seventh term in the heavily Republican Fifth District, has also said she is seriously interested but she, too, is waiting for Mr. Kean to make his plans known. Other Republicans being mentioned as possible candidates are Assembly Speaker Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian and former Attorney General Cary Edwards, who lost in the Republican primary for Governor by Christine Todd Whitman.
 
Anti-Tax Sentiment
 Mr. Lautenberg is well aware of the anti-tax sentiment that almost cost Bill Bradley, a fellow Democrat, his Senate seat in 1990. And so Mr. Lautenberg, a bootstrap multimillionaire who went to college on the G.I. Bill and leans generally liberal, has lately tilted toward fiscal conservatism.
Besides voting against the President's deficit reduction package, which includes new taxes as well as spending cuts, Mr. Lautenberg supported a Republican-sponsored measure that would have withheld assistance from states that failed to require able-bodied welfare recipients to go to work. The bill ultimately died.
Mr. Lautenberg also sided with Republicans in a successful battle to defeat a House initiative that would have allowed a $1.2 billion increase in military spending without commensurate reductions in other spending.
Although once burned, Mr. Lautenberg's colleague in the Senate, Bill Bradley, is not twice cautious. He voted for the Clinton deficit reduction package, although he did concede that it was "an easy bill to oppose and a tough one to support."
 
'Positioning Himself'
 Mr. Lautenberg's vote against it was likely a win-win decision, in the view of Thomas V. O'Neill, a former executive director of the Democratic State Committee in New Jersey.
"I think he would say he voted that way for New Jersey, but he is also positioning himself for next year, and it was very astute of him," Mr. O'Neill said. "If the deficit reduction plan does not work, he can say, 'I voted against it.' If it works, he benefits as a Democrat, and the state is likely to be better off economically."
At the same time, if Mr. Clinton is an unpopular President when Mr. Lautenberg is seeking re-election next year, he has effectively distanced himself from the White House and can run as a New Jersey Democrat, not a national Democrat.
For his own part, Mr. Lautenberg said he would concentrate on his Senate record, chiefly in the areas of environment and transportation.
 
Came Out of Nowhere
 Mr. Lautenberg is chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation and makes sure New Jersey gets its share of Federal money for roads and other transportation projects. He sponsored the laws banning smoking on airline flights and tightening airport security, and played important roles in laws banning ocean dumping and encouraging pollution control technology.
Mr. Lautenberg, a cofounder of Automatic Data Processing whose net worth has been estimated at $50 million, essentially came out of nowhere when he ran for the Senate for the first time in 1982.
He had been a Democratic campaign donor and a member of the Port Authority board with no elective experience, but he quickly demonstrated that he knew how to run for office. He won the primary over several better-known opponents, then came from behind to upset Millicent Fenwick, the Republican Congresswoman and odds-on favorite, spending $5 million of his own money in the campaign.
Republicans were convinced that the victory was a fluke, and in 1988 virtually hand-picked his opponent, Pete Dawkins, winner of the Heisman Trophy, Rhodes Scholar, Princeton Ph.D., brigadier general and a Wall Street executive.
 
'A Scholar of Roads'
 But Mr. Lautenberg ran an aggressive campaign with the help of James Carville, the political consultant who went on to advise Bill Clinton. Mr. Lautenberg's television ads on the theme, "Get Real, Pete," attacked his opponent as a fake and a carpetbagger who had moved to New Jersey in 1987 only to run for the Senate. Mr. Lautenberg won handily, 54 percent to 46 percent, and Mr. Dawkins still has not paid off his campaign debt.
"I said Pete Dawkins was a Rhodes Scholar, but I was a scholar of roads," Mr. Lautenberg recalled with a laugh, apparently relishing the possibility of a rough fight next year.
He already has $2 million in the bank for the 1994 race, and says: "I have every intention of running for re-election and have done all the things I need to do to prepare for the campaign. It is just not time yet to begin."
Does he expect an expensive race if Mr. Kean runs? He and Mr. Dawkins each spent close to $8 million in 1988, a very high figure for the time.
"Oh, Tom Kean would have to spend $25 million," Mr. Lautenberg said.

HEADLINE: Pentagon Keeps Silent on Rejected Gay Troop Plan

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
Back in April, the Defense Department commissioned two studies on how to carry out President Clinton's intention to lift the military's ban on homosexuals. One, conducted by a panel of generals and admirals, led to the new policy. But the Pentagon is refusing to make public or even talk much about the other one, a $1.3 million report by the influential Rand Corporation. 
 The Rand report concluded that gay men and lesbians could serve openly in the armed forces if its proposed policy was given strong support from the military's senior leaders, and it offered a detailed plan for carrying out the President's order.
But it was the study by the panel of generals and admirals, who maintained that open homosexuality would undermine discipline and combat readiness, that prevailed.
Defense Secretary Les Aspin said that he tried to draft a plan closer to Mr. Clinton's original promise to lift the ban entirely, but that the compromise that eventually emerged was the best he could negotiate with the Joint Chiefs, whose support was essential to win approval in Congress.
 
Lack of Chiefs' Support
 The report by Rand, a conservatively oriented research group with longstanding ties to the military, suggested that the obstacle might have been neither the lack of a practical option nor the universal opposition of those familiar with military life, but rather the resistance of the six Joint Chiefs.
Senior civilian Pentagon officials said they never seriously considered the Rand report as a basis for a new policy on gay rights because the Joint Chiefs would not support it.
Mr. Clinton's compromise, allowing homosexuals to serve but only if they keep their sexual orientation private, differs only marginally from existing policy, and bows to the chiefs' insistence that open homosexuality could never be tolerated.
The Rand report started from the assumption that the ban would be lifted entirely, as Mr. Clinton originally ordered, and set out to devise a way to carry out the policy in a way that would preserve morale and order. Rand found that a policy based on strict requirements for professional conduct could work if strongly supported by the military's senior leadership.
"While heterosexuals will be asked to tolerate the presence of known homosexuals, all personnel, including acknowledged homosexuals, must understand that the military environment is no place to flaunt one's sexual identity or orientation," a summary of the report said.
Executive summaries of the Rand report, titled "Homosexuals and U.S. Military Personnel Policy: Policy Options and Assessment," as well as briefing slides presented to Mr. Aspin last month, were provided to The New York Times by individuals who felt the study should be made public.
Rand's proposed policy was based on these principles:
*An emphasis should be placed on behavior and conduct, not on teaching tolerance or sensitivity to troops.
*Military commanders at all levels must be empowered to carry out the policy and do so forcefully, but reassuringly.
*No extensive revisions to existing military rules and regulations are necessary.
*List categories of inappropriate conduct, including personal harassment, abuse of authority, displays of affection and explicit discussion of sexuality. Such a policy "requires tolerance and restraint to foster the good of the group, but implies no endorsement of a 'homosexual life style,' " the report said.
Rand assigned more than two dozen historians, economists, sociologists, psychologists, anthropologists, doctors and lawyers to the study. The head of the study was Bernard D. Rostker, a former head of Selective Service.
Rand researchers visited Canada, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Norway and Israel, as well as fire and police departments in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Seattle, Houston and San Diego, to gain insights and lessons from analagous organizations and institutions.
"The departments visited report that, over all, the effectiveness of the organization has not been diminished by the presence of homosexuals on the force," an overview of the report said. "Morale and discipline have been maintained, and recruitment and retention rates appear to be unaffected by the presence of known homosexuals."
The report acknowledged that none of those organizations was an exact model for the military, but Rand said comparisons were instructive for assessing changes in policy toward homosexuals in the military. Military commanders argue that open homosexuals would disrupt "unit cohesion," an almost mystical bond that permits soldiers to fight effectively.
But the Rand report said, "Military leaders have many tools available to prevent this from occurring, including the existence of regulations and norms regulating conduct."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Bond Yields Rise Again

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury bonds and notes fell again yesterday as yields rose for the third day in a row. And as on Tuesday, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, was the catalyst for the rise in yields, traders and analysts said.
Mr. Greenspan testified before the Senate Banking Committee, as he gave the second installment of the central bank's semiannual report on monetary policy to Congress. He testified on Tuesday before a House banking subcommittee. 
 While Mr. Greenspan was expected to give the same general testimony, some traders and analysts suggested that many in the market appeared to be hoping that the chairman would moderate his Tuesday statement. But he did not, staying with his message of disappointment about inflation and sending again a signal that the Fed's next move on interest rates may be to push them higher.
 
Greenspan 'Held the Line'
 "What hurt the market today was that Greenspan held the line," said Alan Levinson, money market economist at UBS Securities.
The price of the 30-year bond due in February 2023 fell 13/32 as the yield rose to 6.66 percent, up from 6.63 percent Wednesday. Since Friday, the yield has jumped up from 6.54 percent, a 16-year low.
But because a Fed move to dampen inflation would mean an increase in short-term interest rates, the damage this week has been more severe on short and intermediate Treasury securities. Yesterday, the price of the two-year Treasury note fell 2/32 as the yield rose to 4.18 percent, almost a full quarter of a percentage point above last Friday's close.
The discount rate on the six-month Treasury bill, which quickly reflects expectations of interest rate moves by the Fed, inched two basis points or hundredths of a percentage point higher to 3.21. It was 3.11 percent Friday.
There were several other factors that also played into the selling. One was a rumor, apparently starting in the bond futures trading pit in Chicago, that Representative Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois and chairman of the House Ways and means Committee, was going to resign. His aides denied the rumor.
 
Implicated in Scandal
 Mr. Rostenkowski has been implicated in the House Post Office scandal and officials have said that he is likely to be indicted soon. He is a close ally of President Clinton and is considered crucial to the negotiations going on now as the House and the Senate try to hammer out a compromise between their two deficit reductions plans.
Both the rumor and the selling inspired by it seem to indicate an underlying concern about the entire deficit reduction process, as traders and investors wonder whether a compromise can be reached and if it is whether it will be meaningful.
Another factor was selling of Treasury securities, especially 5- and 10-year notes, to hedge against the corporate bonds that firms have bought this week.
"The market selling is overdone but that does not mean that it can not get worse until some of the uncertainties are cleared up," said Peter McTeague, a fixed income analyst at Technical Data in Boston.
Mr. Greenspan accentuated his message yesterday with more discussion of the fact that the Fed was turning to the level of real interest rates -- interest rates after adjustment for inflation -- as a guidepost for its monetary policy because its money supply data was proving so unreliable.
And he made clear the current level of real short-term interest rates -- which is zero -- is not conducive to long-term low inflation. This point was quickly taken as another sign that the next move by the Fed would be to go to higher interest rates so that real rates would be positive.
 
100 Years of Coke
 Coca-Cola joined the 100-year bond derby yesterday, following the Walt Disney Company by one day. The soft-drink maker sold $150 million of 100-year bonds at a yield of 7.455 percent.
The big difference between the Disney 100-year bond and the Coke version is that the Disney bond can be called or paid off by the company after 30 years. The Coke bond cannot.
This guarantee of keeping the 100-year bond made the Coke version much more attractive, as was reflected in the spread over the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond. The Disney deal was done at 95 basis points over the 30-year bond yield, while the Coke deal was just 80 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point.
The following are the results of the Treasury auction of one-year bills yesterday:

HEADLINE: Robert M. Kossick, Chief Executive, 53, At New Jersey Bank

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Robert M. Kossick, chairman and chief executive officer of the National Community Bank of New Jersey, died on Tuesday at his home in Ridgewood, N.J. He was 53 years old and also had a home in Tuxedo Park, N.Y.
The cause was a heart attack, the bank's announcement said. 
 A native of New Brunswick, N.J., Mr. Kossick was an industrial-engineering graduate of the Georgia Institute of Technology and earned a master's degree in economics at St. Mary's University in San Antonio. After two years of service in the Air Force there, he started out as a systems engineer with the E.I. DuPont Company in Parkersburg, W. Va.
His banking career began in 1968 with Citicorp in New York. In the next seven years he worked in domestic and overseas departments with increasing responsibilities. His final position was in London as senior operating officer of the Citibank UK Retail Bank.
He then became executive vice president of the Bank of the Southwest in Houston and, in 1979, chairman and chief executive of Empire National Bank in New City, N.Y. The following year he joined National Community Bank as president and chief executive at its headquarters in West Paterson. He traded the presidency for the chairmanship five years ago.
During his tenure, the bank quadrupled its assets to $4.2 billion and grew from 49 to 117 branches, with nearly 2,900 employees statewide. Most recently, he negotiated the bank's pending merger with the Bank of New York.
He was a sought-after speaker for free enterprise. James Peters, the bank's current president, said with his death the "industry lost one of its most successful and colorful leaders."
Mr. Kossick is survived by his wife, the former Sherry Lynne Stamey, of Houston; two sons, Robert and Mark; and two daughters, Kristen and Alicia.

HEADLINE: The Midwest Flooding;
Like Sandbags, Flood Losses Pile Up

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DES MOINES, July 22

 BODY:
With heavy rains and overflowing rivers continuing to inundate the Midwest, many companies and individuals are canceling construction plans, postponing car purchases and asking creditors for deferrals of payments as they assess their losses.
The Des Moines Chamber of Commerce estimated this evening that lost sales from the flood amounted to $525 million in that city alone, and were nearly three times greater than the $182 million in damage to business property. Federal Reserve economists in St. Louis and Chicago said the figures showed the flood's extensive damage to the Midwest, although they cautioned that some of Des Moines' sales may have been diverted to neighboring towns, and that Des Moines had been particularly hard hit because the city lost its running water for 12 days. 
 Businesses and residents of downtown Des Moines were given permission by city officials today to reopen their taps, nearly two weeks after a sudden rise in the Raccoon River disabled the water treatment center here. The water may only be used at first for sprinkler systems, showers and toilets. The rest of the city will be allowed to resume using water in stages over the next several days.
 
Damage Estimates Rising
 Even as damage estimates were being revised upward, a $3 billion Congressional aid package for flood victims became mired today in a dispute over how to pay for the assistance. The current bill would call for extra Federal borrowing, whereas most Republicans and some Democrats want spending cuts to pay for the aid.
Kevin L. Kliesen, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank at St. Louis, said damage along the Mississippi for 100 miles north and south of the city had been steadily increasing as the river stayed high and more levees broke, inundating previously unharmed fields and neighborhoods. Using damage data from a 1973 flood, Mr. Kliesen said that the losses of crops, buildings and roads had reached about $1 billion and might continue rising.
Robert H. Schnorbus, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank at Chicago, said the bank was almost done with its preliminary calculation of damage in Illinois and Iowa. "The flooding has gone on longer and spread as the levees have broken, so my estimates have gone up," he said, while refusing to provide any specific figures until his calculations were complete.
Interviews across eastern Iowa suggest that many business owners and residents are cutting back on discretionary purchases while they wait to see how much the flood will cost them.
At the Front Street Brewery in Davenport, the red-brick walls and wood ceiling beams are unscathed but the hardwood floor is damp and a fetid pool of dark gray water has completely filled the 40-seat bar and brewery in the basement. Steven J. Zuidema, one of the two owners, estimates that the brewery has sustained nearly $100,000 in damage and will lose another $100,000 in sales because it cannot reopen until mid-August.
To make ends meet, Mr. Zuidema sold on Tuesday the vacant lot on which he and his wife had planned to build a house this summer. He has also laid off his 30 employees and postponed the planned purchase of a car.
"We had waited a long time, we're driving an older car and it's starting to rust and runs terrible," said Mr. Zuidema, who has a 1986 Gand Am. "Now, it looks like we're going to hold on to it for a while."
Vernon W. Eden, the 62-year-old owner of the Saylorville Marina in Polk City, estimated that the flood had caused $70,000 in damage to his docks and the loss of $450,000 in sales of boats, gasoline, food and repairs. His parking lot is now under 42 feet of water, and fishermen are staying away because the fish would rather munch on submerged grass than artificial lures.
To save money, Mr. Eden has canceled plans to build a warehouse this summer for boat storage, and has hired only two sandwich shop workers instead of the planned eight. "We've got to make sure we've survived this," he said. "We don't know what this flood is going to cost us in the end, and nobody downtown knows either."
Nobody knows how many people have been laid off because of the flood. Monfort Inc., a subsidiary of Omaha-based ConAgra Inc., has sent home without pay almost all of its 1,400 employees at its meat-packing plant in Des Moines, which needs potable water. City officials predict that such water will not be available for as much as three more weeks.
Clemente Miranda, a Monfort cattle slaughterer with eight children, was laid off more than a week ago, and the family has been trying to figure out since then how to meet their next mortgage payment.
 
Running Up Against Paperwork
 "We fall between the cracks -- we're not flood victims" according to most Federal rules, Mrs. Miranda said while fetching water for her 36-day-old infant at a Salvation Army site in southwestern Des Moines. Mrs. Miranda said that her husband was applying for unemployment but that it would take up to five weeks for checks to arrive.
Ben Dew, a community relations worker for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said that disaster unemployment assistance was the best option for Mrs. Miranda. He also said that she should explain her difficulties to the owner of her mortgage, and ask for an extension of the next payment.
"What she is running up against is not something we're going to be able to avoid and that is paperwork," Mr. Dew said.
Much of the losses estimated by the Des Moines Chamber of Commerce consisted on ripple effects from reduced spending by flood-damaged businesses. Michael Reagan, the head of the chamber, said that a survey of 298 businesses in the city had found that they had lost $175 million in sales. The chamber's statisticians had then estimated that this would result in an additional loss of $350 million through the community.
 
Benefiting From the Flood
 Yet while some families and businesses struggle, many are unaffected and a few may even benefit from the flood. Mr. Schnorbus said that carpet, wallpaper and hardware stores could gain from the flood, along with the businesses that supply them.
K & K True Value Hardware Store in Bettendorf, Iowa, has sold hoses, plastic piping and four water pumps to the Front Street Brewery. David A. Fiebich, the hardware department manager, said that sales of mops and other cleaning gear had also increased.
But the gain has been almost entirely offset by lower sales of hammers, nuts, bolts and other necessities for home improvement projects. "It definitely hurts us in the long run, because people can't afford to put up the new porch if the carpet is ruined and needs to be replaced," Mr. Fiebich said.
Mr. Eden of Saylorville Marina and Mr. Zuidema of Front Street Brewery were both hatching plans this week for how the flood might work to their advantage. Mr. Eden waxed enthusiastic about the number of baby fish that will be born this year in Saylorville Lake, and how quickly they will take lures when the lake goes back down and reduces their food supply.
Mr. Zuidema said that he was preparing to start selling bottles of Raging River Ale. "We have a lot to do with the flood, we were creamed by this flood and we have a right to take advantage of it," he said.
Yet for every optimist like Mr. Zuidema, there are other business people for whom the flood is an unmitigated disaster.
Binh Nguyen, the 42-year-old owner of the Mekong Restaurant in Coralville, had spent all day laboring with his 17-year-old son, Hieu, to erect a sandbag wall separating the restaurant from a nearby creek, so as to pump out the water. But now the creek behind the restaurant had risen a little more, and begun flowing around the new wall.
Mr. Nguyen had borrowed all the money for the restaurant earlier this year from a state program for small businesses, and now said he feared that he would never be able to raise enough additional money to replace the furnishings and reopen the eatery.
"We were only open for three months, and now what do we do," Mr. Nguyen said.

HEADLINE: Frances R. Grant, 96, Champion Of Rights in Latin America, Dies

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Frances Ruth Grant, who spent her life opposing dictatorships and promoting human rights in the Americas, died on Wednesday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 96.
Miss Grant's dedication to Latin American culture, art and human rights began in her childhood. The daughter of a pioneer of New Mexico's statehood, she was born and raised in the remote pueblo of Abiquiu in the foothills of the Valle Grande mountains. It was there that she absorbed the atmosphere of Hispanic-American culture. 
 She was educated at Barnard College and graduated from Columbia University's School of Journalism in 1918. She also received extensive tutoring in economics, political science, music and the arts.
 
A Museum Founder
 She was a founder in 1923 of the Nicholas Roerich Museum in Manhattan, under whose auspices she went to the Far East and wrote about the philosophies and cultures of India and Tibet. She served as a vice president of the museum until 1937.
Miss Grant first visited Latin America in 1929 and after that devoted most of her energy to the republics of the hemisphere. She lectured at virtually all of its universities and centers of learning and started some of the first cultural interchanges, including exhibitions, musical programs and public forums.
Her work was primarily responsible for the Roerich Pact, an inter-American agreement for the preservation of cultural sites signed at the White House by 21 republics in 1935. She founded the Pan American Women's Association in 1930 and the Inter-American Association for Democracy and Freedom in 1950 and headed both of them into her late 80's.
 
A Journal Editor
 From 1951 until the mid-1980's, she edited the English and Spanish editions of Hemispherica, a journal published by the Inter-American Association. For this she received a special citation in 1982 at Columbia University from the trustees of the annual Maria Moors Cabot prizes in inter-American journalism.
Recognized as a leader in the defense of civil and politcal liberties, she was a past chairman of the Latin American section and secretary of the International League for Human Rights. The league is a nongovernmental agency accredited by the United Nations whose predecessors date back to the Dreyfus affair in France nearly a century ago.
Jose Figueres Ferrer, then the President of Costa Rica and himself a resolute champion of democracy, paid tribute to Miss Grant in a public address in New York in 1951. He called her "the greatest fighter for democracy and human rights in the hemisphere."

HEADLINE: At the Bar;
Temporary lawyers and the price of prosperity: when a job agency puffs, the competition huffs.

BYLINE: By David Margolick

 BODY:
Lesley Friedman would not have thought of knocking her competition six years ago, when she began her business finding temporary jobs for lawyers. There was next to no competition, to begin with. And she had more serious problems on her hands, like an opinion from the New York City bar association that her entire operation was unethical.
The bar association soon reversed itself. And a dismal economy, cost-conscious corporations and legions of disaffected or unemployed lawyers available for comparatively cheap, part-time service have made legal temping a growth industry. 
 Customers of Ms. Friedman's company, Special Counsel, now include companies like Citicorp and MCI Communications and law firms like Mudge, Rose, Guthrie, Alexander & Ferdon and Proskauer, Rose, Goetz & Mendelsohn. The company's billings have increased from $800,000 in 1988 to a projected $8 million this year.
Prosperity cuts both ways, however. Ms. Friedman now has plenty of competition, with companies like Attorneys Per Diem, Lawyer's Lawyer, Valuable Consideration, Counsel Temps, Co-Counsel and Assistant Counsel chasing the same business.
Ms. Friedman even grew concerned that her staid advertising -- featuring a gauzy portrait of herself that appeared to be her graduation photograph from Mount Holyoke, circa 1975, but in fact is only six years old -- was no longer enough.
So she produced a pamphlet about Special Counsel and its rivals that was about as subtle as a sonic boom. It sounded soothing -- "If you're skeptical about temporary attorneys, Special Counsel understands," it said on the cover -- until one turned the page. "After all," it said inside, "with any other temporary attorney service, your concern would be justified."
There follows a series of superlatives, in which Special Counsel claimed to place more lawyers for temporary work than any other company and to have done so longer. The brochure went out to 9,000 members of the American Corporate Counsel Association. But copies of it soon reached the competition. And now, what might be a not-so-temporary war has broken out in the legal temp industry, one that threatens to reach the Federal Trade Commission.
The first to weigh in was Warren Hernand, a legal search consultant in San Francisco. He called the brochure "insulting," and disputed the claim that Special Counsel was either first, most or best at anything. Unless Special Counsel stopped circulating it and published a full-page apology in the newsletter of the counsel's association, he wrote, he would file a complaint with the F.T.C.
Then, a few days later, came word from Chere Estrin of the Quorum Group in Los Angeles. She called the brochure "shabby," threatened to drag in an attorney general -- she did not specify which one -- and declared that what led Ms. Friedman's father, a Los Angeles lawyer for whom Ms. Estrin once worked, to urge his daughter to start up Special Counsel was partly Ms. Estrin's own success at the same business.
"Really, Lesley, I had a much better impression of you," Ms. Estrin wrote. "You've gone over the edge on this one."
Rose Ors of Project Professionals in Santa Monica, Calif., accused Special Counsel of "mudslinging." And, in a long and legalistic "My Dear Ms. Friedman" letter, Robert Webster of the Lawsmiths in San Francisco maintained that his company long antedated hers. He further demanded that Special Counsel "abjure" claims that the competition was unqualified.
The letters sent Ms. Friedman scurrying to her dictionary (to look up "abjure") and to her trademark counsel at Darby & Darby in New York, who concluded that while the brochure contained "aggressive puffery," it did not amount to unfair competition. Nor, Ms. Friedman insists, does it contain anything untrue.
"I don't understand what all the uproar is about," she said. "I notice that the agencies that have sent me letters are all from California. Perhaps they're concerned about my plans to open a Los Angeles office." But to maintain good will in the industry, she said, she will soften some of her harsher language.
That has not mollified Mr. Hernand. He is off on a 10-day Caribbean cruise but says that if he gets no satisfaction by the time he returns, he will take his case to the F.T.C.
At that point, the parties will need some lawyers. There is no word yet on whether Special Counsel or any of its rivals will be furnishing legal temps to handle the dispute.

HEADLINE: Conferees on Budget Agree To Raise Tax Rate on Rich

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
Inching toward a final deficit-reduction bill, House and Senate conferees agreed today to a steep increase in the top Federal income tax rate and to leave the capital gains tax rate unchanged.
This was one of the easiest matters for the conferees to resolve. They basically split the difference between the House and the Senate bills, which were quite similar to begin with. 
 Since members of Congress almost never make tough decisions until they are up against a deadline, issues like energy taxes and limits on Medicare spending are not likely to be settled until next week.
But the Senate conferees did send the signal that they expected some kind of energy tax to be in the final legislation. Some Democratic Senators, including Max Baucus of Montana and David Pryor of Arkansas, had argued that all energy taxes should be dropped in the interest of making the final legislation more attractive politically.
 
Taxes on Social Security
 On Social Security, the conferees accepted the Senate version of the bill. They agreed that single retirees with gross incomes above $32,000 and couples with incomes above $40,000 would have to pay income taxes on up to 85 percent of their Social Security benefits. Only 50 percent is taxable now, and that would continue to be the case for single retirees with incomes from $25,000 to $32,000 and for couples with incomes from $32,000 to $40,000.
Technically, these step-by-step decisions of the budget conferees are subject to change before the conference committee finishes its work, presumably some time next week. But in the case of the higher tax rates, what the conferees approved today will almost certainly become law if any deficit-reduction bill is enacted.
The White House continued its hard-sell approach today. Reporters from New York and New Jersey were called in for a series of briefings and news conferences on the budget, first from Treasury Department and White House officials and then, in the afternoon, by President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore themselves.
They used as their text the testimony this week of Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, who said interest rates would rise and the markets would react unfavorably if Congress failed to enact a big deficit-reduction measure.
"There is no question that the failure to pass the budget would have a destabilizing effect on the economy," the President asserted.
 
Burden on Very Affluent
 The White House continued to stress that the increased taxes in the bill would fall overwhelmingly on the wealthy, a point the Clinton Administration believes has gotten lost in all the Republican criticism of the higher taxes. Presumably, the reason the conferees publicly locked the higher income tax rates into the bill today, while doing little else that was newsworthy, was to draw attention to how only the very affluent would be affected.
The higher tax rates on the wealthy would raise more than $112 billion over the next five years, the single biggest element of a package meant to lower the deficit by about $500 billion over the next five years.
Under the agreement of the conference committee, the top income tax rate, now 31 percent, would be increased to 35.2 percent this year and 36 percent afterward for single taxpayers with taxable incomes from $115,000 to $250,000, and for couples with taxable incomes from $140,000 to $250,000. For taxpayers with taxable incomes above $250,000, the rate would be 38.2 percent this year and 39.6 percent next year.
Taxable income is the amount left after all deductions and personal exemptions are subtracted.
 
Calculating the Impact
 According to the Treasury, a taxable income of $140,000 generally corresponds to an adjusted gross income of about $180,000, and a taxable income of $250,000 is equivalent to an adjusted gross income of more than $300,000.
The Treasury calculates that only 1 percent of the nation's taxpayers would be affected by the rate changes, and that only four-tenths of 1 percent would pay taxes at the highest rate.
The tax on capital gains, which are the profits from the sale of investments, would remain at 28 percent for all taxpayers. The Senate bill would have raised it to 30.8 percent for taxpayers with incomes above $250,000.
In a further blow to upper-income taxpayers, the legislation would require that employers and employees pay the 1.45 percent Medicare payroll tax on all earnings. Now, wages above $135,000 are not subject to the tax.
Altogether, a taxpayer with a salary of $350,000 could owe an additional $20,000 in taxes.
 
One-on-One Negotiations
 The conferees decided this afternoon that the lawmakers most expert in health care would get together to work out how to lower the expected growth in Medicare costs by about $54 billion over the next five years. They also agreed that the top conferees on tax matters, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, would try to settle the tax differences in one-on-one negotiations.
Actually, the ultimate problem is not getting Mr. Moynihan and Mr. Rostenkowski to agree. Staff members say there is hardly a whit of difference between them. Rather, the problem is finding solutions that can unite all the different elements of the Democratic Party in Congress, from conservatives like the Senators from oil-producing states to the liberal Representatives who belong to the Black Caucus.
Because every Republican in Congress plans to vote against whatever bill comes out of the conference, almost all Democrats must support it if it is to become law.

HEADLINE: 41,000 Graduates Await the Test of a Lifetime

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 23

 BODY:
"This is war," said Brad Call, who had just graduated from George Washington Law School. "It's war, man."
Still, he seemed calm for someone who had spent $1,000 on a review course and had been studying 10 hours a day since early June. 
 Next week Mr. Call, 29, and more than 41,000 others around the country will take the bar examination to become lawyers. In 12 hours over two days they will take the equivalent of 20 law school exams on everything from contracts to evidence to criminal law. And if the past is any guide, about 30 percent of them will fail.
If this were not daunting enough, recent law school graduates are hearing horror stories about the job market that awaits them even if they do pass the exam. Traditionally, law graduates are hired before they take the bar exam to begin work in the fall after passing it. But a sluggish economy has forced many firms to cut back on hiring.
A drop in job placement for 1993 graduates is affecting those of all law schools. A survey by the legal magazine Of Counsel found that the 67 largest firms employed fewer lawyers last year than in the previous year, 31,132 to 31,048.
 
Drop in Starting Pay
 Starting salaries have fallen, too. Last year the median salary for first-year associates was $47,500, almost $4,000 less than in 1991, according to the National Association for Law Placement, which does not expect any increase this year.
Some students get jobs at large firms that pay the costs of the bar review courses. But that does not make the exam any easier. Neal McCoy, managing partner in Washington for Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, said, "We would expect they would pass it the first time."
In addition, some students have not been able to afford the critical bar review courses.
Steven H. Levine, head of BAR/ BRI, the most widely used course in the country, estimates that 85 percent of this year's law school graduates are taking a bar review course, compared with more than 90 percent last year.
A review course like that given by BAR/BRI (pronounced BAR-bree) is necessary, law professors say, because it offers a thorough review of all courses the students have taken over three years and because it teaches the students how to manage their time in taking the exam.
The exam varies from state to state, and in some, like California, stringent requirements to practice law are reflected in a more difficult as well as a longer exam. Students in California will sit down to a three- day exam; for students in Texas the ordeal will last two and a half days. All other states and the District of Columbia have a two-day exam.
The test, administered by the National Conference of Bar Examiners, has been the licensing criterion for more than 100 years. The exam consists of a multistate section with 200 multiple-choice questions on contracts, torts, real property, constitutional law, criminal law and evidence. The remainder of the exam covers law in the state (or the district) in which the exam is given and includes essay questions dealing with, for example, domestic relations, taxation and wills.
Mr. Levine of BAR/BRI says pretest stress may pale in comparison with the anxiety of waiting four months to receive results. Those taking the test next week will not get their results until Thanksgiving.
"You wake up in the middle of the night," Mr. Levine said, "with a will question shooting across the ceiling and sit up sweating, screaming, 'If I only had one more week!' "
 
Scant Help for Seizure
 But for next week, taking the bar exam may be punishment enough. In Southern California, a man suffered an epileptic seizure during the February exam, which is mainly for those who failed the July exam. Only three people got up to help him. The three students were expected to finish taking the exam within the allotted period, although their scores were specially reviewed by the National Conference of Bar Examiners to take into account the time they lost in administering aid.
Those who fail can take the exam again (and continue taking it until they pass), but if the graduate has already been hired by a firm, the failure can be crippling, both to the lawyer and the firm. They are prohibited from signing documents, using the firm's letterhead or appearing in court until they have been accredited by the American Bar Association.
Bentley Saul, a recent graduate of Widener Law School in Chester, Pa., has narrowed the problem of studying for the bar exam. "The material is do-able," he said. "The other people are the problem. When you go outside of the library to get a drink of water, someone tells you how many hours a day they're studying."
No matter how much they study, there will be high anxiety. Mr. Levine says he invariably gets calls from men and women a few weeks before the exam who just need tender loving care.

For even the 70 percent that pass, job prospects are tight as the economy has forced many firms to cut back on hiring.

HEADLINE: Walter D. Fackler, 71, Economist Known for Accurate Predictions

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Walter D. Fackler, an economist known for the accuracy of his annual forecasts of national trends, died yesterday at a hospital in Chicago. He was 71 and lived in Chicago.
The cause was a stroke, his family said. 
 Mr. Fackler was a professor and former associate dean and acting dean of the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business. He had also served as director of its master's degree program for business executives.
For 31 years he made annual forecasts of the nation's economy that were widely quoted and considered among the most reliable. His expertise included industry, public finance, monetary policy and the economic effects of government actions.
He served as a senior economist for President Dwight D. Eisenhower's Cabinet Committee on Price Stability for Economic Growth in 1959-60. Before that, from 1956-59, he was the assistant director of economic research for the United States Chamber of Commerce.
As an economist, he wrote many articles, gave speeches, testified before Congressional committees and was a consultant to business, government agencies and foundations.
Mr. Fackler was born in Aitkin, Minn. A veteran of World War II, he served as a captain in the Army in Europe and won a Bronze Star.
He graduated from George Washington University and studied for his doctorate at Johns Hopkins University, where he also taught briefly. He worked for six years at George Washington as a teacher, assistant to the Dean of Faculties and director of the Foreign Service Review Program.
His survivors include his wife of 42 years, the former Hazel Shepardson; three sons, Paul, of Durham, N.C., and Mark and Neil, both of the Chicago area; a brother, James, of Minneapolis; three sisters, Charlotte Collins of King City, Ore., Joyce Pershall, of Olympia, Wash., and Rachel Rennick of British Columbia, Canada, and two granddaughters.

HEADLINE: Dow Falls From Heights, Off 30.18 Points

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks retreated yesterday, a day after the Dow Jones industrial average set an all-time high. The average fell 30.18 points, to 3,525.22, in heavy trading.
Traders said the bond market failed to give backbone to stocks, which moved in a tight range until late afternoon, when prices fell on programmed selling. 
 Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange reached 249.6 million shares, down from 278.6 million on Wednesday. Losing issues far outnumbered gainers, 1,208 to 767. Lower oil prices again buoyed the transportation issues, with the Dow transportation index rising 2.78 points, to 1,575.99.
 
 
Link to Bond Market
 Lawrence R. Rice, market strategist for Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said he was not surprised by the decline yesterday. He said the market rise on Wednesday was not as solid as it had appeared, especially on a day when bond prices were down sharply. Indeed, he said, the Dow achieved its new high on the back of only a few issues.
"The selloff of bonds continued yesterday, which by the way was due," Mr. Rice said.
He said cautious comments yesterday by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, on the outlook for interest rates and inflation may represent a warning of an uptick in inflation caused by flooding in the Midwest.
But, he added, yesterday's stock market decline was orderly.
"Investors failed to panic," he said, "suggesting that we may still be within a bull market and equities still represent an attractive alternative to other investments. That's not to say the market still doesn't need a correction in the averages."
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 2.67 points, to 444.51. The Nasdaq composite dropped 4.56 points, to 695.52, and the Big Board composite lost 1.34 points to end at 246.26. The American Stock Exchange was also down, losing 1.95 points to 431.36.
The Stant Corporation was the most actively traded issue on the Nasdaq. The company's initial public offering of 6.5 million shares was priced at $16 a share, compared with an expected range of $14 to $16 a share, according to its preliminary prospectus. Shares of the maker and distributor of auto parts closed at $17.
United International Holdings, which holds interests in overseas broadcast, radio and television operations, made an initial public offering of 3.5 million shares priced at $19. The stock closed at $22.50.
 Blockbuster Entertainment gained 1 3/4, to 24 1/8, in active trading. The video chain reported second-quarter earnings of 23 cents a share, compared with 17 cents for the period a year earlier.
Advance Circuits fell 1 5/8, to 9, as the maker of printed circuits said it was withdrawing its proposed public offering of 1.4 million shares. Citing a weak market for computers and computer products, the company said it had become more difficult to project future operating results.
Traders said that according to two studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine, Heart Technology's device to clear arteries may not be better than conventional balloon angioplasty. Shares of the medical supply company slipped 7/8, to 19 5/8.

HEADLINE: Personal Income Growth Is Laggard

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
Americans' personal incomes grew at a 4.6 percent annual rate from the first quarter of 1991 to the first quarter of 1993, a Commerce Department report showed today.
That is less than half the 9.8 percent annual rate of increase in the three previous recoveries that lasted as long as the current one, the report noted. 
 In another report, the Labor Department said the number of newly laid-off people filing claims for jobless benefits jumped by 24,000 last week. Some analysts said the spike was caused by problems in adjusting for seasonal variations.
New applications for unemployment benefits totaled 352,000 during the week ended July 17, up from a revised 328,000 a week earlier, the Labor Department reported today. The July 10 number was originally estimated to be 334,000.
 
Moving Average Up
 The less volatile four-week moving average of new claims totaled 338,000, up marginally from 337,750 during the period ended July 10.
Despite the end of the recession two years ago, personal income growth in many East Coast states and California is being curbed by military spending cuts and the lingering effects of 1980's overbuilding, the department said.
The report said the 10 states with the fastest personal income growth were in the interior. Payroll increases there ranged from 8.7 percent in North Dakota and 8.4 percent in Nebraska to 6.1 percent in both Kentucky and Utah.
The 10 states with the slowest personal income growth were Connecticut, 2.3 percent; Maine and Massachusetts, 2.9 percent; California, 3.1 percent; Virginia, 3.6 percent; Maryland and Florida, 3.8 percent; New York, 3.9 percent, and New Hampshire and Vermont, 4 percent.
The department defines personal income as income received from all sources, less personal contributions for Social Security insurance. It is measured before tax deductions and is not adjusted for inflation.
The report said inflation rose at a 3.2 percent annual rate during the two years since the recession officially ended in March 1991.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
BANKAMERICA CORP. (N)

 BODY:
The BankAmerica Corporation reported essentially flat results yesterday, reflecting the slow California economy.
The country's second-largest banking company earned $488 million for the quarter that ended June 30, compared with $240 million for the same period a year earlier. 
 Last year's second-quarter results were affected by merger-related expenses and a gain on the sale of BankAmerica's payroll processing business. If the nonrecurring items had been excluded, net income for the 1992 period would have been $421 million.
Delinquent loans for the most recent quarter totaled $3.44 billion, down 10 percent from $3.84 billion for the first quarter and down 25 percent from $4.62 billion for the second quarter a year earlier.
Net interest income rose, despite a drop in loans. It totaled $1.85 billion, up from $1.84 billion for the first quarter and $1.67 billion for the second quarter a year earlier. Loans amounted to $124.4 billion, compared with $124.1 billion for the first quarter and $132.5 billion for 1992's second quarter.
The bank reported moderate profitability, as measured by a return on equity of 13.3 percent, which is relatively low for the banking industry.

HEADLINE: Clinton Urges Haitian Leader To Appoint a New Premier

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
President Clinton urged today that Haiti's exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, move swiftly toward restoring democratic institutions in his country as part of an agreement that is to return him to power on Oct. 30.
The Administration particularly wants Father Aristide to appoint a new prime minister to replace the military Government headed by Gen. Raoul Cedras. That step is part of a peace settlement reached on Governors Island on July 3 by Father Aristide and Haiti's military leadership. 
 Joining Mr. Clinton in an appearance at the White House, Father Aristide said, "We are doing our best" to carry out the provisions of the accord. He specified reforms of Haiti's army, police and judiciary, but he did not mention the naming of a Prime Minister.
The conditions of the settlement, reached under United Nations mediation, would lift an international embargo on oil shipments to Haiti upon the naming of a Prime Minister.
 
Naming of Premier a Problem
 But the nomination appears to have become a sticking point for Father Aristide. His problem is that there is not only a Prime Minister in exile, Rene Preval, who is clamoring to be restored to office, but also a two-chamber Parliament in Port-au-Prince where Father Aristide's supporters and opponents are entangled in a struggle over who legitimately represents the Haitian electorate. The new Prime Minister is to be chosen with Parliament's approval.
[In Port-au-Prince, the lower house of Haiti's Parliament chose Antoine Joseph as its speaker, defeating Pierre Canel Ridal, the candidate favored by Aristide supporters.]
One aide said today that Father Aristide's nomination of a head of government might take place next week, after consultation with Parliament.
Father Aristide said that in his view, the peace settlement and its provisions meant "having something for every single citizen of the country."
The Clinton Administration has pledged military assistance and economic aid. It has offered about 350 United States military personnel, including engineers, to assist in "modernizing the armed forces of Haiti," as Mike McCurry, the State Department spokesman, described it today.
Haiti's police force is to be supervised by foreign specialists under the United Nations agreement. In his remarks, President Clinton emphasized the importance of "getting the international police force in place." That force is to be drawn from France, Canada and possibly Caribbean countries.
The sanctions imposed on Haiti's military Government also included the freezing of financial assets of people linked with General Cedras and a bar on shipments of weapons to the nation.
Assuming that the other provisions of the 10-point agreement reached at Governors Island are carried out, Father Aristide could return to Haiti on Oct. 30, fully 25 months after he was ousted in a military coup. The agreement provides that he grant an amnesty to the military coup leaders. In addition, General Cedras is called on to resign as commander of the army, which has 7,000 troops.
Before sitting down with Father Aristide for about 30 minutes, President Clinton praised him for "the courage he showed" in signing the peace accord and said: "I'm excited about this process. There's a major potential for a victory for democracy here."

HEADLINE: Now Takeover of Canal Makes Panama Uneasy

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PANAMA, July 17

 BODY:
Until recently, there was still no greater act of nationalist faith among Panamanians than to declare that the 51-mile canal that cuts through the psyche of this country as completely as it bisects its geography must revert to full local ownership and control.
But with the turnover of the canal and the 500-square-mile corridor surrounding it fast gathering momentum and due to be completed by the end of the decade, there has been a tidal shift of attitudes among Panamanians. 
 Many have begun to wonder aloud how their small country can digest its gargantuan prize.
From its completion in 1914 through the end of the cold war, the United States-controlled canal was a dependable inspiration for political appeals and popular riots, with sovereignty over it the equivalent of the American dream for most Panamanians.
The faces of Panamanian officials still often light up with enthusiasm when they are asked what they will do with the bases over which they will assume control. They speak of the huge regional universities, modern containerized ports, luxury resorts and retirement communities for affluent Americans and others that they say will ultimately match, perhaps surpass, the hundreds of millions of dollars generated nowadays from the United States military presence.
 
'The Mess of the Century'
 But contributing to the doubts now are a lack of confidence in a young and still uncertain democracy and a fear of mismanagement, readily apparent in many of the canal-related properties that have already been turned over. These quickly went from their pristine state to overgrown eyesores decaying under the tropical sun.
Foremost, however, is concern over the loss of an estimated $500 million -- about one-tenth of the gross national product -- injected into the Panamanian economy by the presence of about 10,000 American troops, 2,000 civilians and 20,000 dependents living in the country.
These anxieties were captured in a poll in May conducted for the country's leading newspaper, La Prensa, in which nearly 71 percent of the respondents said they either agreed or felt strongly that it would be better for American bases to remain in the country after the year 2000. Only 18 percent disagreed.
"We have a treaty, and that is something we cannot hide from, because once 1999 comes we'll be down to zero Americans and zero jobs," said Ray Bishop, the secretary general of the 6,000-member Panamanian Syndicate of Employees of United States Armed Forces. "The problem is that the Panamanian Government is not ready for this kind of responsibility. This is going to be the mess of the century."
The United States Southern Command, which makes its headquarters in Panama, has worked hard to convince disbelieving Panamanians that its pullout is for real. This drive began with the turnover of a 288-acre fuel storage installation, or tank farm, at the end of 1991, and a steady stream of other properties have been handed over since. Next year, American military officials say, the schedule calls for the closing of the first two of the 10 bases they operate in the country.
"Our feeling was that since nobody wants to believe that we are leaving, let's shock the system by handing over a bunch of things quickly," a senior officer said.
The tank farm was expected to be converted to a commercial fuel storage center, but since its turnover, the officer said, it has remained empty and in danger of rusting. Other properties, including officers' housing at Coco Solo, a point jutting into the sea on the Atlantic side of the canal, have been overrun by squatters.
Many see in these experiences an ominous reminder of how badly things could go.
"We paint these buildings all the time," an American official said. "We change the roofs all the time and we cut the grass all the time. The windows are sealed, and the air-conditioners are running all the time. You don't have to stop this kind of maintenance very long around here before the jungle is back."
Asked what level of preparation and planning there had been in the Panamanian Government for taking over complex properties like these, another senior American officer said: "Below line zero. Zip."
Under the treaty the American Government is not required to help maintain any properties after their transfer.
Although there are widespread expectations of the imminent decay and collapse of properties, both Panamanian and American officials said they felt confident that the Government could be counted upon to manage the canal itself properly.
Fears on this subject were raised by American opponents of the treaty negotiated by President Jimmy Carter with Panama in 1977, which sets up terms for the turnover. Panamanians have been phased in to the day-to-day running of the canal, and American and Panamanian officials alike say this change has brought few hitches.
Far more difficult, experts say, will be the profitable conversion of thousands of properties in the former Canal Zone to civilian or commercial use.
Many of the sprawling American bases appear to be monotonous versions of the planned communities on the outskirts of many American cities, except for the visible presence of thousands of soldiers barbecuing or golfing on endless, scrupulously manicured lawns, or tooling around in army vehicles, Originally, plans for the turnover foresaw the replacement of these troops by members of the Panamanian Defense Force, who, it was expected, would take over everything from the training grounds to the hundreds of spacious officers' villas.
After the arrest of the military dictator, Manuel Noriega, in 1990, however, the Panamanian Army was disbanded, replaced by a much smaller civilian police force.
Panamanian officials' plans for the bases now include universities and resorts. By early August, they say, a competition among more than 60 international consulting firms to draw up a master plan for the properties will be winnowed to six finalists, from which a winner will be chosen by late October.
"There wasn't the political will to do what we needed to do before," said Carlos Valencia, a prominent businessman who is a board member of the Regional Interoceanic Authority, which was set up to oversee the transition. "Finally, there is a will, and the ideas, and I am sure there will be the money, and we are hellbent on doing a good job."
So far, however, there is not so much as an administrator for the authority. Officials of both countries agree that, so far, Government planners have little more in hand than what one called a list of "five-word descriptives" of the 4,800 or so buildings that will become Panamanian property.
"This is something that has been built and managed by foreign powers and it is hard for us to get it in our own heads that we are soon going to be in charge of this whole enterprise," said Jorge R. Riba, a professor of city planning at the University of Panama. "In 1977, when the treaty was signed, we had 23 years ahead of us to get ready. We have done a lot of things, but mostly, we have lost a lot of time. Now it is going to be a neck-and-neck race against the clock."

'Fool Moon' to Close
True sadness is but a tear in the eye of a clown. "Fool Moon," the two-man romp at the Richard Rodgers Theater starring the clowns David Shiner and Bill Irwin, will be closing on Sept. 5.
"We hate bringing down a hit show earlier than any of us would want to," said James B. Freydberg, one of the producers. "But it's because of David Shiner's health that the producers have decided to close for now." His co-producers are Kenneth Feld, Jeffrey Ash and Dori Berinstein. 
 "I'm just exhausted, and I need a break," said the 39-year-old Mr. Shiner, who explained that he suffered a severe bout of flu at the start of the run in February but performed "because if I'd dropped out then, the show would have closed."
He never fully recovered, and he said the regimen of eight two-hour shows a week is "both physically and mentally demanding, since I'm walking the wire every night." During two acts of slapstick, mime and farcical mayhem, Mr. Shiner interacts with audience members, taking them on stage for a bout of mock movie making. "You would not believe how much energy you expend to bring that off," he said.
The producers, of course, cannot employ an understudy. Mr. Freydberg added, "It's not true that we're losing money." He said the show had netted $650,000 in its first four months and needed $100,000 more to recoup, probably in August.
Mr. Freydberg said that after a break, the show would tour the United States and Europe, "and maybe come back to New York." The new Neil Simon comedy, "Laughter on the 23d Floor," arrives at the Richard Rodgers in October.
 
'She Loves Me' Is Moving
 Rumors to the contrary, Mr. Freydberg will not be a producer of the commercial run of the Roundabout Theater's "She Loves Me," and it will not move to the Brooks Atkinson. The much-praised musical will begin previews at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater on Sept. 28, opening on Oct. 7; the producers are James M. Nederlander and Elliot Martin.
 
Fall at the Nonprofits
 Two of Manhattan's premier nonprofit theaters, the Manhattan Theater Club and Playwrights Horizons, are unveiling their seasonal plans. A third, the New York Shakespeare Festival, has firmed up staffing under its producer, George C. Wolfe.
First: Lynne Meadow, artistic director at M.T.C., as everyone calls it, announced that the main-stage season would open Oct. 26 with "The Loman Family Picnic," by Donald Margulies. The cast is to include Christine Baranski, Liz Larsen and Peter Friedman, with Ms. Meadow directing. The play, about a Brooklyn family, was previously produced at the theater's Stage II.
Oct. 12 is the date for the world premiere on Stage II of "Four Dogs and a Bone," a comedy about Hollywood, written and directed by John Patrick Shanley. The players include a screenwriter (Loren Dean), a starlet (Mary-Louise Parker) and a seasoned actress (Polly Draper).
The world premiere of Philip Kan Gotanda's "Knife in the Heart," directed by Oskar Eustis, is to be Dec. 20 on Stage II. And on Jan. 25, on Stage I, M.T.C. is to present Timberlake Wertenbaker's "Three Birds Alighting on a Field," which won the British Critics' Circle Award in its production at the Royal Court Theater in London. Max Stafford-Clark, that theater's artistic director, is to direct; Harriet Walter, star of the Royal Court production, will be the featured actress in the play about a woman who becomes embroiled in the art world.
Terrence McNally's "Love! Valour! Compassion!" is about three couples sharing a summer house.The debut is scheduled for April 26; director and cast are not set. The theater will announce two more shows to round out its season.
At the 5,500-subscriber Playwrights Horizons, Don Scardino, the artistic director, said "Sophistry" would begin the season on Sept. 21 at 416 West 42d Street. The play, by Jonathan Marc Sherman, is to be directed by Nicholas Martin; it shows how a sexual harassment charge triggers an uproar at a New England college.
Mr. Scardino is to direct "An Imaginary Life," a comedy by Peter Parnell opening on Oct. 29. The Pirandellian escapade examines the line between fantasy and fact in a story about a man and his midlife crisis. "Moe's Lucky Seven," by Marlene Meyer, is to begin on April 22. The drama, directed by Roberta Levitow, is a romantic comedy set in a seedy waterfront bar.
As for the Shakespeare Festival: Wiley Hausam, an agent at International Creative Management, will be director of special projects; Morgan Jenness will be director of play development; Shelby Jiggetts will be literary manager, and Carol Fineman will become general press representative.
 
Giving a Union Its Due
 That isn't just some ho-hum, garden-variety professional meeting spilling out of the ballroom and conference suites of the New York Hilton these days. The gathering, which ends today, is the 100th anniversary convocation of I.A., the name everyone uses to avoid having to invoke the organization's full title: the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees and Moving Picture Machine Operators of the United States and Canada.
It has been a heady season for the union of artisans who work in theater, film and television. First, there was that centenary recognition during the Academy Awards, then an honor on the Tony Awards broadcast. At the convention, Mayor David N. Dinkins underscored the union's economic importance to the city and reminded 1,000 delegates that "it all started back in 1893 on 26th and Broadway." The union now has 73,000 members in 50 states and Canada.
Not everything has changed since the early days. In private, some producers still rail against rehearsal rules, overtime and penalties, and lay Broadway's decline to the supposed pinochle-playing idlers backstage. And some union members counter, among themselves, that it's the uncreative producers' fault they don't have more work, and that earnings haven't kept pace with inflation.
"The whole economics of the theater has changed, yet everyone blames the unions when it comes to high costs," said Alfred W. Di Tolla, the union's international president, who spent much of his life as a prop man in the theater. "But our wages haven't increased commensurate with the price of tickets."
The debate may never end. But for the delegates themselves, the convention has been a family affair because of the group's closeness and its multi-generational membership. Is there any consensus about how the rank and file views its union? "No, some love it, some criticize it, but it's all very simple," said one veteran who spoke on condition of anonymity. "If you're working, it's the greatest union in the world. And if you're not working, you say, 'What do they do with my dues, anyway?' "

GRAPHIC: Photo: "Another Hard-Knock Life" -- Leapin' lizards, can that be Andrea McArdle? Yes, the actress who created the title role in "Annie" when she was 13 will take over the part of the ill-fated Fantine in "Les Miserables" on Aug. 16 at the Imperial Theater. In other words, Broadway's most famous orphan will become mother to the Great White Way's most famous waif, the plucky Cosette.

If security is having money in the bank or a package of chocolate chip cookies carefully stashed away, knowing of a charming and affordable little restaurant not too far from the theater district can make one feel positively smug.
Topaz, just around the block from Carnegie Hall, serves gently seasoned Thai food that is notable for its harmony and balance. The lunchtime crowd of business executives is large enough to make reservations advisable. 
 Topaz doesn't look like a Thai restaurant. The rectangular 50-seat dining room's warm brown Art Deco paneling and triangular sconces, which could have come from the interior of a 1920's yacht, are remnants of a seafood restaurant, Wharf 56, that once occupied this site. The Deco look is supplemented by wooden captain's chairs and incongruously, track lighting and worn gray industrial carpeting.
Meals start with a basket of crisp shrimp chips, addictive with the accompanying peanut sauce, just the right mixture of sweet and peppery. These are handy to have, because the menu is complex and takes time to peruse completely. For a shortcut, go directly to the soup section and try the tom kha gai ($3.50), fragrant chicken stock deliciously rich with coconut milk but still light with its layers of ginger, chili and lime. Mee krob ($5.95), the popular appetizer, was an excellent contrast to the soup, delicately crisp rice noodles served cool in a sweet tamarind sauce that packed a spicy kick.
Light, airy curry puffs ($4.25), filled with ground chicken, potato and onion, and tender chicken satay ($7.95 for five sticks) were also fine starters, but the tod mon ($4.50), cakes of minced shrimp, were rubbery.
Yum woonsen ($7.95) is a bright, aptly named salad of crystalline noodles, minced pork and shrimp, nice as a light meal. For heartier appetites, there is gai yang ($11.95), tender moist chicken pieces marinated in garlic and lime and grilled. Spareribs ($11.95) are called "giant ribs" on the menu, calling to mind all sorts of gargantuan possibilities. It was a letdown to receive ordinary-size pork ribs, even if they were terrifically meaty and tender.
The soupy curries are the spiciest dishes and are served with the meat or seafood of your choice. Jungle curry ($11.95) with scallops and green beans was delicious, but masamaan curry ($11.95), with avocado and peanuts, tasted only of chili.
The best accompaniments are the brisk Singha beer ($3.75) and iced tea ($2). There is little in the way of dessert, but take a moment to contemplate the small bar in the rear. An altar with a cigar, flowers and glasses of whisky and water pays tribute to a Siamese prince, a sort of patron saint of Thai restaurants, who opened Thailand economically.

HEADLINE: A Sensible Look at the Airline 'Crisis'

 BODY:
For the last three years, anyone scanning the headlines could easily have concluded that America's airline industry was on its last legs, trapped by inexorable forces it could not control. A commission appointed by President Clinton to fix the industry rightly rejects this dismal scenario.
It will recommend minor tightening of government oversight, tax cuts, some regulatory relief and increased foreign investment. But the commission's draft recommendations reject Government fare-setting and other major structural changes. These small fixes will disappoint some in Congress, but the commission has aimed well. 
 U.S. carriers have lost more than $6 billion since 1990. But as Clifford Winston and Steven Morrison of the Brookings Institution show, these losses are due largely to managerial mistakes, not deep-seated structural flaws in the industry. The industry overpredicted demand for air travel because it overpredicted the health of the economy.
Once recession hit, the airlines found themselves buried in debt from buying airplanes they could not fill. So they engaged in waves of destructive price cutting to lure travelers from competitors. Excessive investments in operations at hub airports -- a mistake that followed the quick traverse from the pre-1978 world of regulation to the unseen world of competition -- haven't helped. These losses won't recur; once the economy recovers, so will profits.
The commission did not overreach by proposing widespread structural reform. For example, it would not have the Government regulate fares -- a system that did not work well before 1978 and would not work any better now. Competition has brought sharply lower fares and more convenient schedules.
The commission wisely recommends relaxing limits on foreign investment if host countries grant U.S. carriers unfettered access to their airports. Less wise is its call for exempting airlines from some taxes; the industry does not seem overtaxed.
Some airline executives have asked Washington to regulate fares to put a stop to self-destructive price cutting. Travelers, grab your wallets. What these executives really have in mind is for government to keep the likes of Southwest Airlines at bay. Southwest is anything but self-destructive. True, it charges rock-bottom prices. But it also makes the biggest profits.
Fortunately, the commission rejected government fare-setting, thus allowing upstarts like Southwest to fly high and force competitors to catch up -- the best travel protection the commission could possibly design.

HEADLINE: Free Trade's Fine, as Long as It's Really Free;
Pulling Workers Down

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your July 12 editorial on the North American Free Trade Agreement is on target. Judge Charles Richey's decision requiring en environmental impact statement is warranted. Mexico has a poor record of enforcing weaker environmental and consumer laws. United States companies could pack up and move their businesses across the border to reduce their operating costs.
Under the trade agreement, food and products from Mexico would be treated as if they were produced domestically. Thus, United States companies that want to do the right thing by way of their workers and the environment would be put at a competitive disadvantage. 
 Given the experience of Canadian workers with the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement, which saw more than 400,000 Canadian jobs migrate to the United States, where wages and benefits were only slightly lower than in Canada, one can't help believe that many United States jobs will go south across the border. If businesses moved to the United States for only slightly lower wages and benefits, the much lower wages and lax environmental and workplace regulations of Mexico will look very attractive to many businesses.
Patrick J. Lucey would have us believe, in "The Lies of Nafta's Critics" (Op-Ed, July 13), that the trade agreement would create high-tech, high-wage jobs. The implication is that low-wage jobs will move to Mexico, while United States workers will move up the ladder to the high-tech, high-paying jobs that will be created as a result of the agreement. There are no data to support such a claim.
The available data would show that United States workers displaced by trade end up moving down the job ladder, or off the ladder to permanent unemployment. The effect of this agreement would be to throw United States, Mexican and Canadian workers into competition with one another to attract investment by offering the lowest wages and the least restrictive environmental regulations.
As the consumer advocate Ralph Nader noted, "it should be the role of the world's largest economy to lift the standards of other nations around the world, instead of having our standards pulled down to the lower common denominators of other countries."

A Menu of Benefits

Q I've heard "cafeteria plan" used in connection with employee benefits. What is it?
 
 GUNTER HAIMANN, Jamesburg, N.J.
A Cafeteria plans are employer-sponsored benefit plans that give tax advantages to employees by allowing them to choose between receiving taxable benefits like cash or tax-free benefits like health insurance. Its name comes from Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code, which has authorized these plans since 1978. 
 "The sole breadwinner with dependents, the single employee, the person nearing retirement all have different benefit needs," said Michael J. Langan of Towers Perrin, the consulting firm. "Some want more life insurance, others more health insurance and others more disability protection."
A cafeteria plan allows an employee to pick from a menu of benefits and pay for them with pretax salary dollars. As a result, an employee's contribution may stretch 30 to 40 percent further than if it was made after taxes were withheld -- depending on the individual's tax rate.
 But health-care changes proposed in Washington could affect cafeteria plans, especially if the tax treatment of benefits is changed to make some of them taxable to employees or nondeductible by employers.
 
Convertible Bonds
Q How can I calculate the break-even time of a convertible bond?
 
 HYMAN DUDAKOFF, Brooklyn
A The break-even period refers to the time required for the convertible's current yield advantage to recapture the conversion premium. Break-even analysis is one of several means of evaluating the relative attractiveness of convertible securities.
"Convertible security holders usually pay a premium over conversion value for the ability to participate in the appreciation in the underlying stock, while limiting downside risk," said John Georgantas, convertible securities analyst for Kidder, Peabody & Company.
There are limitations to break-even analysis, though, since it assumes such factors as unchanged interest rates and a static level of common dividends over the investment period.
In addition, the analysis does not consider either the risks associated with the issuer's credit quality or the appreciation potential in the underlying stock price.
 
Credit Card Criteria
Q What criteria do banks use for evaluating credit card applications?
 
ABE DUBROWSKY, West Palm Beach, Fla.
A Every bank has its own guidelines. But a big consideration for most banks is how well the applicant has handled credit. Usually people establish credit elsewhere before applying for a credit card.
"We want to see some depth of credit experience," said Cynthia A. Graham, president of Barnett Card Services Corporation. "We expect applicants to show that they can handle several different creditors and have never filed for bankruptcy."
Banks are also interested in an applicant's current obligations, income and employment history.

When Selling Stocks, Monday's Child Fares Less Well

BYLINE: By Andree Brooks

 BODY:
Say you're spending a quiet weekend reviewing your stock portfolio, deciding what to sell. You hope to place the order before the busy workweek begins, using the toll-free lines that so many brokerage houses operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
That may not be such a good idea. A number of studies have found that share prices tend to fall at the start of the week -- especially early on Monday. 
 The Institute for Econometric Research in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., which publishes a monthly newsletter called The Mutual Fund Forecaster, recently reviewed Monday trading for 64 years ended in 1990 and concluded that the market, on average, lost 15/100 of 1 percent on Monday while making gains on other business days.
A similar pattern emerged from a study of 2,000 smaller stocks in the Nasdaq system that was conducted by Richard D. Fortin, assistant professor of finance at the University of New Mexico at Las Cruces, and O. Maurice Joy, professor of finance at the University of Kansas.
The pair's analysis, which appeared in the Journal of the American Association of Individual Investors in March, was based on stock trading for seven years beginning in 1982. The professors computed the average weekly price for a stock and then looked at the stock's price each day. One finding: stock prices rose during the week so that a $10,000 purchase typically cost $40 more on a Friday than on a Tuesday.
The fluctuations, recognized by professional investors for some time, have been dubbed "the Monday Effect." All sorts of explanations have been offered, including the general feeling of gloom that characterizes a Monday morning.
In his book "One Up on Wall Street," Peter Lynch, former manager of Fidelity's Magellan Fund, suggested that unreasonable fears and suspicions build up during the weekend. The cycle then reverses, he said, because by late Monday investors have done additional research and discovered that their fears were unfounded.
Yet the numbers speak for themselves. "My advice is to buy late on a Monday or early Tuesday and sell on a Friday," said Norman G. Fosback, editor of The Mutual Fund Forecaster. The two academics reached the same conclusion.

HEADLINE: U.S. Increases Fund To Outbid Terrorists For Afghan Missiles

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 23

 BODY:
The Central Intelligence Agency's covert operations division will spend $55 million in a new effort to buy back more than 300 Stinger antiaircraft missiles it gave to guerrillas fighting the Soviet-backed Government of Afghanistan in the 1980's, Government and intelligence officials say.
The effort reflects the agency's fear that it may be outbid by terrorists and hostile governments in the black market for the Stinger, a lightweight, shoulder-carried, highly accurate antiaircraft missile considered the best weapon of its kind, the officials said. 
 They said Iranian and North Korean espionage agents and Islamic militant groups were bidding to buy Stingers from demobilized Afghan rebels starved for cash in a country shattered by years of war and privation.
 
Some Obtained by Iran
 "The Iranians have already captured or otherwise obtained some Stingers and continue to try to accumulate them," said Edward S. Juchniewicz, who was the C.I.A.'s associate director for covert operations from 1982 to 1986. "I understand why people are exercised. I wouldn't want one to hit the airplane I'm on."
The Stinger, which finds its targets with a homing sensor that locks on to the heat of an aircraft's engines, is capable of destroying aircraft at a range of seven miles or more.
The new effort to reclaim the missiles, which was first reported in The Los Angeles Times today, followed a $10 million effort that proved insufficient, the officials said. The spending increase reflected the intensity of bidding for the weapons, they said.
The fate of the Stingers is a particularly messy aftermath of one of the cold war's great struggles. The C.I.A. and the Pentagon secretly shipped nearly 1,000 Stingers to the Afghan rebels from 1986 to 1989. At least 300 are now unaccounted for, officials say. The missiles were a small but highly significant part of a $3 billion covert action program, the intelligence agency's biggest paramilitary operation since Vietnam.
The Stingers helped turn the tide in the rebels' nine-year war against the Soviet Union, which sent troops into Afghanistan in 1979. Their deployment in Afghanistan represented the only known front of the cold war in which American missiles shot down Soviet pilots.
 
Use Against U.S. Is Feared
 Now the C.I.A. fears that the missiles, gone astray, could be used against Americans.
"The Stinger problem is very complicated," said Zalmay Khalilzad, a former Pentagon and State Department official involved in the program to support the Afghan rebels. "The problem is you get in competition with Iran, and they can outbid you. A lot of different Afghans have the missiles, and they are in bad economic shape. The price can go up when Iran and others compete for buying them."
Mr. Juchniewicz said Iran might try to exchange the highly valued Stingers for military equipment it covets, including long-range ground-to-ground missiles being developed by North Korea.
Despite the threat posed by the Stingers, Mr. Juchniewicz said he had few regrets about supporting the Afghan guerrillas, known as mujahedeen, or holy warriors.
"One makes the assumption when one goes to battle that one's equipment will be captured by the enemy," he said. "So unfortunately we lost some Stingers, and now our enemy has one of our best weapons. But the Stingers turned the war in the mujahedeen's favor."
 
Blow to the Soviet Union
 Reflecting a widely held view among American intelligence officials that the Soviet loss in Afghanistan was a fatal blow to the Soviet Union, he added: "The Stingers broke the Soviets' back. Isn't the danger posed by a handful of Stingers worth the dissolution of the Soviet empire?"
The bidding for the missiles will take place in a strange international bazaar. In Afghanistan today there is little law and order, and weapons and heroin are the primary commodities. Travelers from more than 40 Islamic countries go there to learn from the rebels who stared down the Soviets.
Among them were two World Trade Center bombing suspects, Ramzi Ahmed Yousef and Ahmad M. Ajaj, and two men indicted on charges of conspiring to murder politicians and blow up Federal buildings in New York, Clement Hampton-El and Siddig Ibrahim Siddig Ali, Federal investigators say.
Some of the Afghan rebels have turned against their former patrons. "Some of the same people who are actual or potential terrorists in this country are former guerrilla fighters in Afghanistan," said David Whipple, the C.I.A.'s former national intelligence officer for counterterrorism.
To reclaim the missiles, the agency must depend on Pakistan's intelligence service, which distributed the C.I.A.'s weaponry during the war.
The Pakistanis favored the most radical and anti-American of the Afghan rebel leaders, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. By dint of his superior arsenal, Mr. Hekmatyar became Prime Minister of Afghanistan earlier this year. He and commanders loyal to him are believed to control a significant number of the Stingers. Mr. Hekmatyar also has made alliances of convenience with Iran.
"Hekmatyar was occasionally close to the Iranians, and we were not blind to that," said Fred C. Ikle, who fiercely supported the Afghan program as Under Secretary of Defense for Policy in the Reagan Administration.

HEADLINE: Stocks Bounce Higher; Dow Up 21.52, to 3,546.74

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks bounced higher in active trading yesterday, with the market showing a resiliency that had been lacking most of the week.
The Dow Jones industrial average finished at 3,546.74, up 21.52 points for the day and 18.45 points for the week. 
 Not even a 1 1/8-point decline in I.B.M., which closed at 42 1/4 after falling to a new 52-week trading low of 41 1/2, could temper yesterday's rally. Traders are expecting the giant computer company to announce its turnaround strategy on Tuesday, along with a cut in its quarterly dividend and a restructuring charge, which some analysts speculate could be as much as $5 billion, to cover added layoffs.
 
 
Volume Is Lower
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange reached 222.2 million shares, down from 249.6 million on Thursday, as the composite index rose 1.20 points, to 247.46. The number of advancing issues outnumbered losers by 1,026 to 865.
Market analysts at MMS International remain bullish on stocks, given the downward trend in interest rates, moderate inflation and respectable earnings growth. As such, they say, any near-term weakness in the stock market is likely to be a result of a pullback in the bond market.
"However, the market still remains suspect," said Harry W. Laubscher, senior vice president and market analyst at Tucker Anthony.
"Confusion continues over the trend of interest rates, but even so, the market could enjoy a summer rally," he said. "Looking further ahead, the second half of the year remains poor, despite the potential for that normal summer rally."
Mr. Laubscher attributed some of the gain yesterday to technical factors. "Short coverings helped firm up prices in afternoon trading, as some investors covered short positions ahead of the weekend on the chance that some positive news could come out of Washington on Saturday or Sunday regarding the budget," Mr. Laubscher said.
Among individual issues, shares of Petsmart Inc., a retail pet-supply chain, closed at $25 a share in heavy Nasdaq trading. The company had made its initial public offering of 7.2 million shares on Thursday at a price of $18 through an underwriting group led by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
Sunbeam-Oster rose 2 5/8 to 18 3/8. The household products company announced that it had bought back 12.4 million shares in connection with the settlement of litigation with its former chairman, Paul B. Kazarian.
Amgen rose 1 5/8, to 36 1/8. The biotechnology company reported that second-quarter earnings rose 40 percent, to 70 cents a share from 49 cents a year earlier.
In Tokyo yesterday, Japanese stocks ended sharply lower, pushed down by concerns over a higher yen and political uncertainties. The Nikkei index of 225 issues lost 381.24 points, or 1.90 percent, to 19,734.57. It was the first close below 20,000 in almost two weeks.

HEADLINE: U.S. Eases Rules Governing Telephone Links With Cuba

BYLINE: Special to The New York TimesSpecial to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 23

 BODY:
In what could be the most significant easing of the economic embargo of Cuba in years, the Clinton Administration has decided to permit American telephone companies to expand communications links to Havana and share some of their revenues with the Castro Government, officials said today.
The move is a response to a surge in calls through Canadian-based companies that relay telephone calls from the United States to Cuba, evading the embargo and charging higher rates than American companies. 
 The regulations would allow carriers in the United States like A.T.&T., MCI and Sprint to share the proceeds from telephone charges to and from Cuba with Fidel Castro's Government. State Department officials have begun briefing members of Congress about the proposal and will soon inform prominent Cuban-American leaders and officials of American companies.
 
Opposed by Cuban-Americans
 The proposal, which could net the Castro Government about $50 million to $60 million a year, is expected to generate significant opposition among Cuban-Americans.
A.T.&T. maintains limited telecommunication service to Cuba, but because of the trade embargo the company cannot split the revenues derived from that service with Cuba's state-owned telephone company. Instead, Cuba's share of the proceeds are placed in an escrow account that totals more than $80 million.
While American companies will be able to share revenues from the calls with Cuba, officials said the money in the escrow account will continue to be frozen. As a result, United States officials are not sure whether its proposal will be acceptable to Cuba.
A spokesman at the Cuban diplomatic mission here, Jose Luis Ponce, said that the escrow provision could pose a major stumbling block, The Associated Press reported.
Cuba's position is that the funds in the frozen account should be turned over in order to reach an agreement, Mr. Ponce said. He added that Cuban authorities will study the United States proposal carefully.
Officials said today that it had yet to be determined how many circuits the Administration will allow American telephone carriers to establish with Cuba. It is estimated that for every 100 circuits that American companies set up, Cuba will garner about $15 million in the first year of operation.
At the same time it has decided to expand telephone service to Cuba, the Administration has sent letters to A.T.&T., MCI and Sprint seeking information about seven Canadian-based companies that provide telephone service to Cuba via toll-free 800 numbers.
Callers to the 800 numbers are connected to switchboards in Canada that relay their calls to Cuba. The customers are then billed by the companies for the calls, though at a higher rate than for calls placed through A.T.&.T. The so-called resellers have proliferated recently because A.T.&T. service to Cuba has deteriorated due to damage to relay towers in Florida caused by Hurricane Andrew last August.
The Treasury Department has determined that these so-called telephone resellers are violating the American trade embargo because these companies share the proceeds from the calls with Cuba.

HEADLINE: Russia Aid Plan Promotes Role for U.S. Companies

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 23

 BODY:
Revising its aid proposals for the former Soviet Union, the Clinton Administration has told the Senate that it wants to get American companies more involved in efforts to build a private sector and to expand money allocated for republics other than Russia.
The new proposal came in the form of a request for $2.5 billion in appropriations sent to the Senate Thursday night and intended to carry out the Administration's aid pledges for Russia and the other former republics of the Soviet Union. 
 The Administration's request calls for allocating larger sums for loan guarantees to be administered by the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. This move would provide opportunities for American businesses as well a more direct route for help to fledgling Russian companies.
The new proposal involves a reshuffling of money after the seven wealthiest industrial nations agreed in Tokyo this month to help finance a $3 billion fund to speed privatization in Russia, down from the $4 billion fund they originally hoped to create.
 
Involving U.S. Industry
 Under that agreement, the United States pledged to provide a $125 million grant to help privatization and $250 million in export credits, much of which will be used to push American industry to get more involved in helping the former Soviet Union.
"A very heavy emphasis throughout our program is to help not just Russia but also American businesses that want to get involved there," said Strobe Talbott, the Administration's special adviser for Russia and the former Soviet republics.
The plan sent to the Senate involves $1.8 billion that the United States pledged for the former Soviet Union in April when the finance and foreign ministers from the seven wealthiest nations met in Tokyo. It also includes an additional $700 million in aid that the Administration is seeking for the fiscal year 1994.
The $1.8 billion was part of an overall $28 billion promised by the Group of Seven, which comprises the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and Italy.
One focus of the program will be to help revive Russia's worn-down oil and gas industry, which American officials say can someday be a much larger source of hard-currency exports.
"One of the biggest areas we will be involved in is in oil and gas," said Kenneth Brody, chairman of the Export-Import Bank. "They have a tremendous need to take existing fields and increase the production."
Much of the money from the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation is used to encourage American investment in Russia and to help Russian enterprises finance the purchase of American goods and services. For instance, a Russian oil drilling enterprise might purchase American oilfield equipment that will make it more efficient and more attractive to private investors.
According to Administration officials, every $1 billion in American exports to Russia might create 20,000 jobs here.
Some Administration officials say the plan's emphasis on helping the private sector should make it easier for hesitant Senators, including many Republicans, to approve the plan. Despite all the attention on President Clinton's budget package, Administration official say they still hope that the Senate will approve the aid package before the August recess. The House approved a somewhat different package in June.
Under the proposal submitted to the Senate, more than $100 million would be used to help modernize enterprises in non-Russian republics and to assist them in privatization.
The proposal also calls for $60 million in transportation funds to pay for the shipment of tens of millions of dollars of privately donated food and medicine for Russia.
"There has been a shift of emphasis away from humanitarian assistance, which you might call quick-delivery, short-term, high-impact, to a series of programs that we feel reflect our commitment to stay in for the long haul," Mr. Talbott said.

HEADLINE: Out on a Limb on Job Data

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 23

 BODY:
They say that politics runs in cycles, but these days the cycles seem to spin faster and faster.
Only last summer Bill Clinton mocked President George Bush, saying he had failed to meet his pledge to create 30 million jobs in four years. The lesson, some Democrats said, is that such a specific promise is always folly. 
 Then Mr. Clinton declared that he would create 8 million jobs by 1996. Today, the Administration went a step further, listing the number of jobs that would be created in each state by the Clinton economic package that is likely to be passed by Congress.
The precision is supposed to help lawmakers explain support for the Clinton plan and to counter opposition to the plan by business groups. But it is bound to help the President's opponents hold him to account.
Should Arizona, say, fall short of the 320,745 new jobs predicted, Mr. Clinton may find himself pilloried as a failure even if he meets his broader goal.
At the White House, however, a senior official today shrugged off the potential for political liability later.
"As long as you show progress, I think you're O.K.," the official said. "It's not as stark a target as Bush set."

HEADLINE: Moynihan Scolds the White House, Saying It Must Be Flexible to Win a Budget Deal

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 23

 BODY:
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the chief Senate negotiator on the deficit-reduction legislation, accused the Clinton Administration today of inflexibility and naivete and said that if the White House did not agree to some compromises next week, he would not be able to produce a budget bill that could pass the Senate.
Mr. Moynihan's outburst came as Congressional negotiations on the budget broke for the weekend. It represented growing tension between Congress and the White House just as the differences between the Senate and House conferees were narrowing, including the emergence of the outlines of a compromise on a gasoline tax. 
 "They have absolutely no sense that they cannot have everything they want," Senator Moynihan said of Administration officials. "I'm beginning to feel they think I'm from the backwoods or something."
The Senator, a New York Democrat who until now has been circumspect when he talked about the budget negotiations, was buttonholed by a reporter in the Capitol Rotunda as he walked back to the Senate after a meeting with Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is the chief House negotiator on taxes; Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, and Leon E. Panetta, President Clinton's budget director.
 
Sending a Message
 He seemed to be eager to send a public message to the White House that he had been unable to get through privately.
"There are just no negotiations going on with them," Mr. Moynihan said. "We have the President's position presented to us, and that's it."
Mr. Bentsen and Mr. Panetta would not comment on Mr. Moynihan's complaint. Earlier, Mr. Panetta told reporters, "We've reached a sensitive stage in the negotiations."
George Stephanopoulos, a senior adviser to the President, said, "We just feel that the negotiations are going well, and we hope they continue to make progress."
 
Rift Expected to Close
 The rift between Democrats in Congress and the Administration seemed likely to be patched up next week, since all sides understand they must stick together if they are to pass the budget legislation over the opposition of every Republican in Congress.
In fact, after a session this afternoon, Mr. Moynihan's frustration had eased. "We had a much better meeting," he said in an interview at the end of the day. "They began to realize that you can't have all those things they want. It was a lot more collaborative."
Over the last two days, a compromise seemed to be developing on energy taxes, the issue on which the Senate and House conferees had been furthest apart. The House bill would raise $72 billion over five years with a broad tax on most forms of energy, including oil, coal, natural gas, electricity and hydroelectric and nuclear power. The Senate measure included only a 4.3-cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline, which would raise $22 billion over the five years.
On Thursday evening, Mr. Rostenkowski proposed that the Senate's tax on gasoline be combined with a new tax on utility bills. The senators rejected that, and today Mr. Rostenkowski made an offer of a 6-cents-a-gallon gasoline tax that would rise a penny each year, to 9 cents after four years.
Once an issue can be boiled down to dollar amounts, conference committees can usually reach a resolution by splitting the difference. A staff member involved in the conference put it this way: "So one side says 9 cents and the other says 4.3 cents. Where do you think they will come out?"
A gasoline tax of 6 or 7 cents a gallon would raise $30 billion to $35 billion over five years, an amount the Clinton Administration has said it could support.
The House conferees also agreed today to a gimmick in the Senate bill that can be recorded as saving $9 billion over five years, although it actually saves no money at all. The House bill would permanently extend the expiring tax credit for business expenses on research. The Senate bill would extend it for only one year, and that would save money on paper even though everyone knows it will be extended again after it expires next year.
The Administration continued to devote almost all its energy to promoting its economic plan, passing out a state-by-state breakdown showing how many jobs would be created if the economic program became law.
 
Moynihan's Frustration
 Senator Moynihan's criticism of the White House seemed to result from days of mounting frustration. He became annoyed at midweek when, just as he was trying to convince his fellow senators that they would have to accept a gasoline tax high enough to raise about $35 billion over five years, Mr. Bentsen and Mr. Rostenkowski emerged from Mr. Rostenkowski's office and said the Administration wanted a gasoline tax that would raise $22 billion to $35 billion.
Mr. Moynihan complained that the only number his colleagues heard had been the lower one. What apparently set him off today was the Administration's insistence that the conferees retain generous tax breaks for investors in small businesses. Mr. Moynihan said he believed that these breaks were bad tax policy and wasted money.
The House and Senate approved provisions, called "expensing" in tax lingo, that would let small businesses deduct a sizable amount spent on equipment in the year the money is invested, instead of having to depreciate the investment over several years.
The House bill would also halve the capital gains tax on the profits from investments made in certain small businesses and held for at least five years.
Mr. Moynihan and Mr. Rostenkowski would like to cut back these tax breaks for small businesses and use the money, more than $1 billion a year, to pay for another program the Administration wants -- tax advantages for businesses in certain poor neighborhoods, called "enterprise zones."
But President Clinton has been touting the tax help for small businesses in recent speeches, even though the expensing provisions, the most costly of the tax breaks, were added by Congress and were not part of his original budget proposal.

HEADLINE: THE MIDWEST FLOODING;
Dry St. Louis Is Furiously Battling a Flood of Misperception

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST LOUIS, July 23

 BODY:
In this city that has been at the epicenter of the Mississippi's soggy wrath for the last week, a lot of people are desperate to get a simple message out: they're dry.
The flooding across the Midwest is likely to continue for weeks, and it could be almost a month before the Mississippi moves below flood stage here. But virtually all the city remains dry, its tourist attractions are all open and officials hope the message gets out before the natural disaster in the region turns into a bigger economic one here. 
 "There are 2.5 million people in the metropolitan area here, and I would say that less than 1 percent are truly affected," said Nancy Milton, a spokeswoman for the St. Louis Convention and Visitors Commission. "I don't want to minimize the tragedy that those people are going through, but most St. Louisans are going on about daily life without seeing any effect at all."
The dichotomy is partly a result of this city's particular geography -- its downtown located on a high bluff and protected by a 52-foot flood wall that has left attractions like the St. Louis Gateway Arch and Busch Stadium, just off the river, completely dry. And it is partly a result of the odd nature of floods, which can wreak havoc as this one has for hundreds of miles but largely spare areas that are not directly along a river.
In any case, tourism-related businesses here are desperately trying to fight off the perception that visitors need to bring scuba gear.
"We receive about 150 phone calls a day asking, 'Are you flooded?' " said Kathy Strauser, a spokeswoman for Meramec Caverns, a popular tourist attraction with an underground river where Jesse James used to hide out. "We tell them, 'We're fine. Come on out.' But it's like they don't believe us. They're afraid they're going to come out and get washed away."
Ms. Strauser said Meramec Caverns was averaging about half the 1,500 to 2,000 visitors a day it usually receives this time of year. The campground, which usually has 100 to 150 campers a night, now has about 10 or 20, she said.
Jeff Wehling, public relations director for the St. Louis Cardinals, who play their home games three blocks from the Mississippi, said the team was receiving the same kind of calls.
"We field calls daily from groups, from individuals, who are calling in and saying, 'Hey, I've got tickets for the first week of August. Is the stadium under water?' " he said. "The perception is the entire city of St. Louis is flooded."
He said it was unclear how much the fears had affected attendance. The Cardinals' attendance is up over last year, but they are contending for a pennant in a way they were not last year, and it is possible that the crowds would be even larger without the fears.
Still, Ms. Milton, the spokeswoman for the visitors commission, said there was no indication of significant cancellations at hotels. And at least one local attraction, the Gateway Arch, is benefiting. People are buying up all available tickets for the ride to the top of the arch so they can see the surging river from 630 feet above it.
She said she hoped that with the passing of time the right picture would get out.
"You really can't fault the media or the people who are watching it, but together there's an impression created that could be an economic problem at some point," she said. "It's like a game of telephone you played when you were a little kid. You start with a message that sounds perfectly clear to you, and by the time it ends up, it's totally different."

HEADLINE: Threat of Statehood in Puerto Rico Leads to a Restored Tax Break

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 23

 BODY:
Worried about reopening the debate on Puerto Rican statehood, budget negotiators agreed today to reinstate $2.6 billion in tax breaks for big American companies that do business on the island.
President Clinton had originally proposed to move quickly to phase out Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code, which exempts mainland companies from Federal taxes on income earned in Puerto Rico as long as it remains a commonwealth. Intended to save the Treasury $6.8 billion over five years, the provision passed the House intact as part of the President's deficit-reduction package two months ago. 
The provision attracted little debate in the House, despite opponents' predictions that it would precipitate everything from the loss of tens of thousands of jobs to a violent political reaction on the island to a new wave of Puerto Rican immigration.
 
Large Lobbying Campaign
 They were right at least about the political reaction. The issue shook the barrios of the South Bronx and San Juan as well as the boardrooms of the big New Jersey-based pharmaceutical companies that operate on the island.
Puerto Rican politicians of various political stripes united with mainland and Puerto Rican businessmen in organizing a lobbying campaign that combined a press relations blitz in the Hispanic news media, large demonstrations on the island and the mainland, and back-room cajoling on Capitol Hill.
The dispute is becoming intertwined with the political campaign preceding a nonbinding plebiscite on whether the island should remain a commonwealth or become a state or new nation. Puerto Ricans are to vote on Nov. 14.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, gave the Administration a private warning that proved to be decisive. An abrupt change in tax policy, he told President Clinton, could push Puerto Ricans to vote for statehood -- and the enhanced welfare and economic benefits that go with it -- before the Senate is prepared to accept the island as a state.
Responding to the pressure, President Clinton pledged to the Congressional Hispanic Caucus on Thursday night that he was now committed to a compromise proposal backed by Senators Moynihan and Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, to restore more than $2.6 billion in tax breaks.
 
'There Will Not Be a Shock'
 Representative Charles B. Rangel, the New York Democrat who is a senior House budget conferee, said his House colleagues were ready to go along with the provision, whose main outlines were already passed by the Senate last month.
Mr. Moynihan, who as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee is a prime mover of the conference committee now working on the President's budget package, said, "It means there will not be a shock in Puerto Rico." He noted that the Administration and Congress had agreed to a gradual phase-down of Section 936 over more than a decade, so Puerto Ricans "can get ready for it and think about it."
Senator Moynihan had also argued that withdrawing the tax breaks could foster a diplomatic embarrassment that would kick up anti-American nationalistic responses throughout the third world.
By revoking Section 936, Mr. Moynihan argued, the Administration would make it more likely that Puerto Rican voters would opt for statehood. Mr. Moynihan said there was no way the Senate would approve statehood, even if Puerto Ricans vote for it, validating the charges of Fidel Castro and Puerto Rican nationalists that the island is nothing but a colony.
 
Original Plan Dropped
 Mr. Moynihan recalled his efforts as Ambassador to the United Nations during the Ford Administration to head off a resolution condemning Puerto Rico's commonwealth status as an "act of colonialism," and he predicted that the Administration would face the same diplomatic embroglio should the Senate refuse to honor a plebiscite result favoring statehood.
As Mr. Clinton pondered Mr. Moynihan's concerns, the House's three Puerto Rican members met with the President at the White House last month to urge him to reconsider his position. "We reminded the President," recalled Representative Jose E. Serrano, Democrat of the South Bronx, "that the House passed the package because of three votes, and in this room there were three Puerto Ricans."
The Administration quietly dropped its original proposal, which was to reduce the Section 936 benefits to companies like Abbott Laboratories and Bristol-Myers Squibb to a tax credit equal to 60 percent of a company's wages paid in Puerto Rico.
With the help of the Treasury Department, Senators Bradley and David Pryor, Democrat of Arkansas, hammered out the general outlines of the new proposal, which would allow companies operating on the island to choose between two tax credit options.
Under one, the current 100 percent income credits would be reduced to 60 percent in 1994, and reduced by an additional 5 percent each year until 1998. The second would limit tax credits to 95 percent of wages and benefits paid in Puerto Rico, along with depreciation deductions.

HEADLINE: Treasury Bond's Yield Jumps to 6.70%

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices fell yesterday for the fourth straight session as the yield on the 30-year bond jumped to its highest level in nearly a month.
The bond market has been disturbed this week by the Congressional testimony of the Federal Reserve's chairman, Alan Greenspan. Also, traders said, the market has been weighed down by a heavy supply of new corporate and municipal issues. 
 In trading yesterday, the 30-year Treasury bond dropped 18/32 of a point. Its yield rose to 6.70 percent, from 6.66 percent late Thursday.
Before Mr. Greenspan began his testimony, the Treasury market had been in the midst of a powerful monthlong rally. The advance was fueled in part by hopes that inflationary pressures were not strong enough to warrant an increase in short-term interest rates.
 
Rate Hopes Are Dashed
 But market expectations were dashed on Tuesday when Mr. Greenspan, delivering the central bank's report on monetary policy to a House Banking subcommittee, said the Fed was ready to raise interest rates to control inflation. On Thursday, he reiterated that message before the Senate Banking Committee.
Most traders and analysts were not surprised by the substance of Mr. Greenspan's testimony. They were, however, jolted by the central bank chairman's determined tone, which seemed to signal the Fed's intention to raise rates even if inflation pressures were not that obvious.
That prompted selling that pushed up the long bond's yield by 16 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, this week.
"The logic is that the probability of the Fed tightening has increased compared to what the market thought earlier," said Sung Won Sohn, an economist with the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis.
Many traders saw the testimony as an excuse to cash in on the recent run-up in bond prices, said Richard Estabrook, vice president of mortgage trading at Clayton Brown & Associates in Chicago.
Mr. Estabrook said he did not expect bond yields to rise much higher in the near term. But, he added, the 30-year bond's yield is unlikely to dip to the 6.50 percent level again soon, particularly with the Treasury preparing a surge of new issues over the next two weeks.
The Treasury is scheduled to sell $16 billion in five-year notes on Tuesday and $11 billion in five-year notes on Wednesday. It is selling longer-term debt in the following week as part of its refunding.
In other trading yesterday, short-term Treasuries were unchanged to 1/32 point lower and intermediate maturities fell 3/16 point to 5/16 point.
The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills was unchanged at 3.08 percent, while the discount rate on six-month bills rose one basis point, to 3.22 percent. And the discount rate on one-year bills gained four basis points, to 3.46 percent.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 10111/32 , down 7/32 from late Thursday. The average yield to maturity was 5.81 percent, up from 5.79 percent.

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Add to Defiance of Yeltsin

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 23

 BODY:
The Russian Parliament recessed for the summer today after rushing through an extraordinary string of measures. If put into force, they threaten to disrupt the economy, undermine the turning over of public property to private interests, fracture relations with Ukraine, jail a key Yeltsin aide and, among many other things, expand the privileges of the legislators.
The long list ranges from a budget that is twice as large as anticipated revenues to little-noticed actions like closing K.G.B. archives for an extra 20 years. It includes a declaration claiming the Crimean port of Sevastopol to be Russian, not Ukrainian -- and another condemning the United Nations Security Council for denouncing the measure. 
 It includes a bill that would give control over transferring public property to private ownership to separate ministries, another canceling President Boris N. Yeltsin's decree on accelerating such transfers, another restoring a sensitive rocket engine deal with India that was opposed by the United States, another giving Parliament full control over the Central Bank and another calling for restrictions on foreign religious organizations.
 
Yeltsin Out of Town
 Though technically many of the bills have the force of law, most commentators anticipated that President Yeltsin would veto them or that his Government would simply ignore them, as they have done with such legislation in the past.
But to the despair of his supporters, Mr. Yeltsin remained silent at his vacation retreat in central Russia.
For themselves, the legislators took over Moscow apartments they had been given as temporary residences, expanded retirement benefits and authorized travel in military planes, which Mr. Yeltsin has denied them.
At the same time, the legislators stripped parliamentary immunity from one of Mr. Yeltsin's top aides, Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir F. Shumeiko. And agents from the office of Procurator General Valentin G. Stepankov -- Russia's chief prosecutor and a political ally of Parliament -- questioned one of Mr. Yeltsin's closest friends, Mikhail N. Poltoranin, the former Minister of Information and a bitter enemy of Parliament. Both officials have been accused by Parliament of corruption.
The bills, many prepared in secret, marked the lifting of any veil from the intentions and hostility of Parliament. Since the April referendum in which a majority of voters declared their preference for Mr. Yeltsin and his program of change, the legislators have voted as if under siege, churning out measures that even six months ago would have given them pause.
 
Votes Are Nearly Unanimous
 Most votes were virtually unanimous, reflecting the fact that the liberal minority has simply stopped taking part in a legislature in which its voice and votes have no useful force. Nonetheless, as insurance, Parliament voted to require only half the members to be present for a quorum.
Liberal legislators and newspapers anxiously called on Mr. Yeltsin to return quickly to Moscow. "It is completely inadmissible that the president continues vacation during such developments," declared Lev Ponomaryov, cochairman of the Democratic Russia movement. "The tense situation demands his immediate return to Moscow."
Sergei A. Filatov, Mr. Yeltsin's chief of staff, said the President was monitoring the situation. "Any haste on the President's part would be undesirable," Mr. Filatov said in an interview. "What they want is to provoke hasty actions, to heat up the atmosphere and divide the population."
For his part, Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, the Speaker of Parliament, who has evolved into an inexorable foe of the President, closed the session with a warning to the members not to lower their guard.
"We are closing our session in a complex situation," he said. "Sharp turns in the political situation cannot be ruled out. Deputies themselves should be ready to resume their duties without any special notice if the situation comes to a head. They should be ready, if need be, to get together immediately to react to possible complications."
The "sharp turns" Mr. Khasbulatov evidently fears, and the ones that seemed to spur Parliament's actions, are Mr. Yeltsin's declared goal of disbanding the standing Parliament and the larger Congress of People's Deputies from which it is drawn and holding elections for a new, two-chamber Parliament.
The President has yet to declare how he would hold elections over Parliament's resistance. But his major instrument has been a constitutional conference he called in June, which has drafted a new charter. Mr. Yeltsin has said the conference can be reconvened to draft a new election law.
 
Heading for a Showdown
 These moves have effectively put the long political standoff between Mr. Yeltsin and Parliament into a showdown, with Mr. Khasbulatov openly using his threatened legislators to undermine the Government.
The measures that have most concerned liberal commentators and politicians are those that take direct aim at economic changes. The one they consider the most dangerous threatens to push Russia to hyperinflation.
On Thursday, Parliament passed a 1993 budget with projected spending of 44.7 trillion rubles ($44.7 billion at the current exchange rate), more than double the anticipated revenues of 22.3 trillion rubles ($22.3 billion). The budget included a 20 percent increase in military spending, to 8 trillion rubles ($8 billion).
"We cannot live with such a high deficit," declared Aleksandr Pochinok, chairman of the parliamentary budget commission, who had argued against it. He noted that the budget deficit was equal to 25 percent of Russia's gross national product -- far above the 5 percent target recommended by the International Monetary Fund.
The budget violated the Parliament's own resolution that inflation by the end of 1993 must be reduced to 10 percent a month, and it threatens further loans from the monetary fund.
Above all, the measure threatens to undermine a campaign by Mr. Yeltsin's tough Finance Minister, Boris G. Fyodorov, to stabilize the ruble. Monthly inflation has fallen sharply in recent months, down to 17.4 percent from 28 percent in January. The ruble has held firm against the dollar for several weeks, and Mr. Fyodorov has bet that it will remain so through September.
 
Presidential Veto Expected
 Mr. Fyodorov was conspicuously absent from the Thursday session, and it seemed likely that President Yeltsin would veto the measure. Parliament can overrule a veto with a two-thirds vote.
In other measures over the last three days, Parliament voted to restore full control over the Central Bank and its director, threatening a deal Mr. Fyodorov struck with the bank in May to tighten monetary policy.
It has also attacked the program led by Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly B. Chubais to transfer state-owned property to private ownership. On Tuesday they suspended Mr. Yeltsin's decree accelerating the selloff. And on Wednesday they voted to transfer control of the property from Mr. Chubais's State Property Committee to the ministries that used to control them.
Parliament also waded into Mr. Yeltsin's foreign policies. On one front, it voted to declare Sevastopol part of Russia, drawing immediate cries of rage from Ukraine. Sevastopol is the home port of the contested Black Sea Fleet, and is situated on the Crimean peninsula -- a part of Ukraine also claimed by Russian nationalists.
On another front, the legislators ruled that all agreements dealing with missile technology must be ratified by Parliament. The measure was intended to combat a decision by the Government to suspend the sale of cryogenic rockets powered by liquid nitrogen to India, a deal strongly opposed by the United States, which wants to prevent the spread of missile technology.

HEADLINE: SOUTH ASIANS SEEK A SECURITY FORUM

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, July 22

 BODY:
Anxious over the growing power of China and over the pullout of American armed forces from Asia, several large Southeast Asian countries are moving to create a regional security forum with the United States and Japan that will meet regularly to discuss military stability in the region with the world's fastest-growing economy.
The security forum, which is being established at the suggestion of Japan and with the blessing of the Clinton Administration, represents an important shift in strategy for the major non-Communist countries of Southeast Asia, which had long depended on Washington to keep peace in the region. 
 The creation of the forum, which does not yet have a name, is expected to be formally announced here on Saturday at the end of a two-day meeting of foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean.
Southeast Asian diplomats said the United States, China, Japan, Russia, Vietnam, Australia and several other countries with interests in Asia will be included in the forum, which for now will take the form of annual or semi-annual high-level conferences on security issues.
 
Possibility of More
 The diplomats did not rule out the possibility that the forum would someday develop into something more -- perhaps even a defense alliance.
"The nations of Southeast Asia have had the luxury for such a long time of not worrying about defense issues," a senior Asian diplomat said. "We all much prefer to focus on economic growth. But we must be logical about this. The region is changing, the United States is reducing its presence and we must be willing to discuss ways of protecting ourselves."
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations -- comprising Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand -- focuses on economic development and trade. Until this year, security matters were left off the agenda of Asean meetings, an understandable decision given the reliable American security umbrella.
Asian officials said the new talk of military cooperation was being driven by the departure of American troops from Southeast Asia as part of the reduction of forces worldwide, and by a distrust of China's growing economic power and recent military purchases.

HEADLINE: Alaska Governor, Once Pro-Secession, Sues Over Federal Land

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, July 23

 BODY:
Gov. Walter J. Hickel of Alaska, who was elected as a candidate of a party that advocated seceding from the union, filed a lawsuit against the Federal Government today, charging that the United States has violated the terms of statehood and deprived the state of its ability to raise revenue.
The $29 billion suit, which Alaska officials say is the largest ever filed by a state against the Government, is the loudest broadside yet in Mr. Hickel's continuing battle with the Federal Government. In the last year, he has stepped up his criticism, accusing the Government of treating Alaska, the nation's biggest state, like a distant colony. 
 In the suit, filed in Federal Claims Court in Washington, Alaska officials say that the establishment of national parks and wilderness areas in their state over the last 34 years has violated the 1959 statehood pact.
Legal experts say the suit is a long shot. But the 74-year-old Mr. Hickel, perhaps the last major Alaska politician who still evokes the fervor of old territorial days, is feeding a longtime antagonism against the Federal Government among some Alaskans.
 
Fan of Development
 Mr. Hickel, 74, came to Alaska in 1940 and was the state's second Governor, serving from 1966 until 1969, when he joined President Nixon's Cabinet as Interior Secretary. Since taking office again three years ago, he has proposed a variety of schemes to open Alaska for further oil and natural gas development, to pipe Alaskan water to California and to build highways and railroads into tracts of wilderness. But the Governor has been thwarted by his own Legislature and by Federal laws that prohibit development in national parks, wilderness areas and wildlife refuges.
Now, using a legal stick to promote his political philosophy, Mr. Hickel is contending that the Federal Government owes the state at least $29 billion for all the land it has taken out of development. The statehood compact requires that 90 percent of all revenue from oil, mineral and gas leasing on Alaska's Federal land be given to the state. By withdrawing more than 100 million acres from potential development, the suit says, the Government has taken away the state's ability to derive income from those lands.
In effect, the suit asserts that Alaskans were induced to become part of the union by a Federal promise that has been repeatedly broken.
"It's a form of bait-and-switch," said Charles Cole, Alaska's Attorney General, in an interview. "No sooner had we accepted statehood than the Government started withdrawing land from revenue-producing status."
Other Alaskans say the Federal lands produce plenty of income, but in a different way. They note that the state's booming tourism industry is based on attracting visitors to the very national parks and wildlife refuges that are protected from development.
Mr. Hickel said the statehood compact had been broken on many occasions. "It cannot be legally changed without the consent of both parties, yet Congress has unilaterally amended it many times, at great cost to the people of Alaska," Mr. Hickel said.
That view was countered by John Havelock, who served as Alaska's Attorney General in the 1970's, when much of the land was protected from development. He said the lawsuit would have little chance of succeeding because the statehood compact appeared to allow the Federal Government to protect lands from development without Alaska's consent.
Mr. Havelock called the lawsuit "a political statement." But he added: "I think Governor Hickel is sincere, though. He genuinely believes all this. You might say there are a lot of old-timers here for which this is gospel, and he's one of them."
Other Western states, notably Idaho, Nevada, Montana and Wyoming, have long complained about Federal ownership of land in their state. But Mr. Cole said Alaska's situation was different because its statehood pact explicitly says how the land can be used.
When Alaska became the 49th state in 1959, it was granted 103 million acres for its use, almost 30 percent of the state. Corporations representing Alaska's Eskimos, Aleuts and Indians control 12 percent of the state's land. The Federal Government manages 59 percent, and a small percentage is in private hands.
The Federal lands in Alaska are normally open to a variety of commercial uses, like mining and oil drilling. But over the years, particularly in the 1970's, the Government has carved large national parks and wildlife refuges from the land it controls. That designation makes those lands off-limits to mining and oil development, irking pro-development forces and fueling periodic calls for secession.
 
No Longer for Secession
 The secession forces rallied behind Mr. Hickel, a multimillionaire hotel developer and entrepreneur, in 1990, when he ran as the candidate of the Alaskan Independence Party. He won with 39 percent of the vote in a three-way race. Although that party advocates secession, Mr. Hickel has disavowed that idea since the election.
Some political observers in Alaska, noting the state's high per capita income and the fact that its 550,000 residents pay no state taxes, say that Alaska has been able to prosper under current Federal regulations.
"To say that parks and wilderness discourage significant development cannot be supported by the record," said Dr. Tom Morehouse, director of the Institute of Social and Economic Research at the University of Alaska at Anchorage. "This idea that we are just a colony is old territorial rhetoric."

HEADLINE: Gang Membership Grows In Middle-Class Suburbs

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: YONKERS

 BODY:
A few of the middle-class teen-agers in baggy shorts and backwards baseball caps smoking cigarettes on the lawn behind Mark Twain Junior High School were quick to claim membership in a street gang.
"Ooh, ooh, I'm in one!" said George Clementi, a 14-year-old in a Looney Tunes T-shirt. Actually, he said, he belongs to two groups, the Crime Related Artists and the United Crime Kings. 
 His crimes? He said he paints graffiti on underpasses and drinks occasionally. Once, he said, he was arrested for trespassing. In the most serious incident he could recall, a group of Irish boys known as the Woodlawn Kidz shot up a friend's pink Geo jeep, just three days off the lot.
Suburban youth gang activity is so different from urban gang warfare that it is considered almost a separate phenomenon by police officers across the region, who say the number of youth gangs is on the rise in New York suburbs, particularly in Westchester County.
 
From Pranks to Shootings
 Generally, the police said, the activities of suburban gangs fall somewhere between youthful pranks and the drive-by shootings that have left bystanders dead in big cities around the country. There is vandalism, from graffiti to property destruction. And there is violence, though the weapon of choice is less likely to be a gun than a baseball bat and the victims are more likely to end up in the emergency room than the morgue.
"Kids go to the hospital, but nobody dies," said George Clementi's friend, Ernie Ila, 17, who took a drink of Snapple, let out a long burp then excused himself. "They get hit with golf clubs," he said with a shrug.
In fact, people have died. The police said they were concerned that two fatal shootings, including one drive-by, in Yonkers in the last year could mark the beginning of more serious problems. In any case, the police said, the proliferation of suburban gangs, with members affecting the pose of criminals and aspiring to a rap sheet, is troubling because it indicates a generalized breakdown in values.
Many of the suburban gang members do not fit the classic description of the disadvantaged youth drawn to crime as a way out of a bad neighborhood and an impoverished family.
In generally affluent Westchester County, where officials said there were 70 gangs with about 1,500 members, the police said they had cracked down on incipient middle-class gangs, including a Yorktown group known as the "Benzi Boyz," who named themselves after the Mercedes-Benz hood ornaments they steal and wear around their necks; a bunch of Peekskill middle school boys who gave themselves gang names and started fighting one another about a year ago, and the Mount Vernon Boyz, a gang of upper middle-class teen-agers, including prep school students, who have reportedly been involved in a number of assaults. In each case, the police said they were able to stop or significantly slow the gang's activities within recent months.
"They're rich kids and we contacted their parents," Ken Davis, a Yonkers police officer who sometimes works with the Mount Vernon police, said of the Mount Vernon Boyz.
Not all the gangs are equally fearsome: In Yonkers, members of the "Lawrence Street Posse" are believed to be responsible for two deaths and at least one other shooting. On the other end of the spectrum, a group of 12- and 13-year-olds in Hackensack, N.J., called themselves a gang for 48 hours, pushing around other kids in their middle school until school officials called in the police.
Indeed, short-lived alliances are one of the hallmarks of suburban gangs, which unlike city gangs do not always revolve around neighborhood groups protecting their home turf and, often, the drug business that goes with it. In the suburban sprawl, gang members are more likely to meet at school than on the block, and when trouble breaks out it is often at malls and movie theaters. Both the police and gang members said most fights in suburbia were not about territory at all, but start when a member of one group offends, or "disses," a member of another group.
 
Drive-By Beatings
 Revenge is usually less final here: Instead of drive-by shootings, there are drive-by beatings in which a group with baseball bats jumps out of a car and attacks a rival group. When guns are used, it is often for what the police call "walk-bys," in which gang members fire into the air.
As a result, the antagonisms are much more fluid. Because the disputes are often fleeting, suburban gang members are less likely to form long-term allegiances or wear gang colors that identify their affiliation. And suburban gang rosters and even gang names are constantly changing.
"Every couple of days you hear new names crop up," said Walter Young, deputy police chief in Stamford, Conn.
Many groups are gangs in name only, made up of youths who mouth "gangsta" rap lyrics and wear prison-inspired fashions like pants with no belts and boxers showing -- a look that began with inmates who are not allowed to wear belts. "There are a million wannabes," said Mr. Davis.
 
Girls Forming Gangs, Too
 Some of the wannabes "emulate themselves into jail," said Lieut. Frank Messar of the Yonkers police. At least 40 percent of the 700 arrests of 7- to 16-year-olds in Yonkers last year were gang-related, he said.
Gangs are attracting more teen-agers from all backgrounds and socio-economic groups, Mr. Davis said. Several female gangs have organized in Yonkers and Mount Vernon in recent years, too, with bad-girl names like "Bitches in Charge."
"There's no common denominator," said Karyn Addison, a detective in the youth division of the Mount Vernon Police Department. "Black, white, Hispanic -- they're all having problems. Family life is hard for all of them, and they're trying to find their way." Even teen-agers from stable homes see criminal behavior glorified on television, she said, and parents don't seem to exercise the control they once did.
"Some of these parents question what we've done instead of questioning what their kid has done," Ms. Addison said. "Instead of, 'My God, my son has a gun,' it's 'How can you prove he had a gun?' It's, 'Why did you pick up my son?' instead of, 'What was my 12-year-old doing out at 1 or 2 or 3 A.M.?' Or you try to contact a parent, and you can't find them."
 
Seeking Federal Money
 Reports of gang activity in Westchester shocked local residents earlier this summer, when County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke called a news conference to discuss the presence of gangs and to announce gang prevention programs. The Reporter Dispatch in White Plains ran a front-page story that referred to "1,500 members of 70 organized youth gangs roaming the streets of Westchester and involved in assaults, robberies, burglaries and drive-by shootings."
And while some police and school officials have argued that the problem is less serious than advertised, county officials said they did not want to wait for more drive-by shootings before addressing the problems that lead to gang violence. They are forthright about their motivation in highlighting the current problems: They want Federal money for programs that could prevent the situation from growing worse.
"You think of Los Angeles, the South Bronx or Harlem, you don't think about suburbia," said Toni Collarini, executive director of Westchester County's Youth Bureau. But she said the problem had been expanding beyond the city limits over the last five years, creating a need for more youth programs.
"In L.A. for 10 years they had cut funding for community centers and you see what happened," she said. A county task force on gangs is due to release the results of a yearlong study of gang activity within the week.
 
Danger Escalating
 In a tour of Yonkers gang hangouts with Mr. Davis and another officer, Victor Mendez, gang members said the situation was getting scarier.
Sitting on a stoop outside an apartment building with broken stained-glass windows on Elliott Avenue, a group of teen-agers known as the Elliott Troopers said they were just a bunch of guys who hung out together and got into fights with "serious gangs." These fights, they said, are steadily becoming more dangerous.
"It went from punches to razors, bats and bottles and now to guns," said Renaldo Collazo, 17, who was covered in scabs and scars that he said were the result of fights with the Lawrence Street Posse. He had 13 stitches in his head removed earlier last week after the latest run-in, he said.
His friend Damien Frank, 17, walked up then and joined in. "The last time they came over here they were wearing ski masks," he said, shaking his head at the terrorist garb favored by their rivals and lamenting the passing of the old-fashioned fistfight. "Not one of them got no knuckle game," he said derisively.
"Now it ain't nothing about fighting with their hands," said Anthony Feliciano, 17, whose face bears several prominent souvenirs of gang fights.
 
Seemingly Inescapable
 All three friends said their families had moved to Westchester from Brooklyn or the Bronx to get away from such urban problems.
But while gang violence seems inescapable, Mr. Frank said: "It's no Bloods and Crips where we're shooting at each other."
"It's just if we see each other there's going to be a little confrontation," he said, turning to his buddies and smiling. ("You like that? Con-fron-ta-tion.") "Even the little kids are fighting now."
 
From Gang to College
 On the other side of town, Sam Annabi, 19, a leader of the Arabian Knights Posse, shooed his mother back into the apartment building their family owns before speaking about his gang. When he re-emerged, he was wearing a black beret.
"Take the hat off, Sam," she called out after him, and he started to laugh in spite of himself, all the while insisting that his group's run-ins with the rival Hell Kitchen Boys, a white gang with no New York City connections, are deadly serious.
"There are fights every day," he said, bragging that he could not even go for a haircut without a bodyguard. "Just as much as they want me, we want them. They try to get my boys. It's like a routine."
Mr. Annabi, who said he planned to take a college entrance exam to attend Mercy College the next day, said guns were part of that routine, but acknowledged grudgingly: "Sometimes you miss on purpose. Sometimes you just want to scare them."
He said he had never actually shot anyone.
As Officers Davis and Mendez drove away in their unmarked black Chevy, which every school kid seemed to recognize, they said they have reason to hope that Mr. Annabi will find his way out of trouble when college starts.
But sometimes it's hard to tell the difference between the tough guys and the guys who just want to look tough, they said. And when young people commit crimes to prove themselves, the distinction hardly matters.
Roberto Rodriguez, 17, who was arrested in the death of 18-year-old Ticard Miller in a drive-by shooting on June 8, was also "a kid we'd been working with for the last couple of years," Mr. Mendez said wearily.
"I did not think he was going to be the one to get involved with this kind of thing," he said. "You never know."

HEADLINE: COMPANY EARNINGS;
Exxon Posts A 33% Gain In Earnings

 BODY:
The Exxon Corporation reported a 33 percent gain in second-quarter profits yesterday, attributing the sharp increase primarily to cost-cutting, increased demand for gasoline in Europe and lower crude oil prices.
The nation's largest oil company, based in Irving, Tex., reported a net income rise to $1.24 billion, or 98 cents a share, from $930 million, or 73 cents a share, last year. Revenues rose slightly, to $27.9 billion from $27.8 billion. 
 Despite the gains, however, earnings fell short of some analysts' expectations for the quarter, said John D. Hervey, an analyst with DLJ Securities.
Mr. Hervey said that after the quarter's $210 million in tax credits and asset sales -- up from $24 million last year -- were deducted, the earnings fell to 82 cents a share, 6 cents less than some analysts had forecast.
 
Shares Gain $1
 Still, Exxon's shares gained $1 yesterday, closing at $65.125 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The company's American refining and marketing division posted a big increase, to $134 million from $70 million, partly because crude oil prices have dropped an average $1.97 a barrel from $20.36 last year. International refining and marketing increased to $610 million from $592 million.
"I think its a good quarter; compared to the historical range, the earnings are strong," Mr. Hervey said. "But they were negatively impacted by lower natural gas sales in Europe. Still, to be able to chart earnings against the backdrop of lower oil prices is impressive."
Mr. Hervey said Europe's recession appeared to be the cause for the less-than-expected demand for natural gas in Europe and that Exxon's operational and geographic breadth, usually an advantage, worked against it this quarter.
Lee R. Raymond, Exxon's chairman, said cost-cutting accounted for more than $200 million of the earnings. Mr. Hervey agreed that aggressive cost-cutting programs would continue to help earnings.
The company's exploration and production division, which underwent cutbacks during the quarter in the United States, posted a 9 percent earnings increase to $761 million from $698 million.
"They're painful but there have been head count reductions," Mr. Hervey said. "In general the company is making some nice moves cost-cutting-wise, and it is likely to do better in the next 12 to 18 months than the environment suggests."
Chemical operations posted a decline both in the United States and abroad at $86 million from $119 million.

HEADLINE: Ferry Promises Relief for Rockland's Weary Commuters

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

DATELINE: HAVERSTRAW, N.Y., July 20

 BODY:
Laura McGovern's commute from her home in Rockland County to her office in Manhattan seems like it would require the conditioning of a triathlete.
To get to her job at the Social Register on Park Avenue, Ms. McGovern must drive from her family's New City home to the train station in Nanuet, board an N.J. Transit train to Hoboken, take a PATH train from Hoboken to 23d Street and then walk six blocks. Her round-trip commuting time: about three and a half hours. 
 But relief may be on the horizon -- in the form of a high-speed ferry that would whisk Ms. McGovern and hundreds of others to Manhattan along the Hudson River.
As early as next year, according to preliminary state plans, a ferry able to carry up to 500 people may originate in Rockland County -- either in Haverstraw or nearby Nyack -- and make a stop in Yonkers before traveling to midtown and lower Manhattan. Early estimates put the travel time at about 70 minutes each way.
The project might include another ferry linking Haverstraw or Nyack, on the west bank of the Hudson, to Tarrytown, on the eastern side, where commuters could board a Metro-North train to Grand Central Terminal, officials of the New York State Thruway Authority said.
 
Serenity vs. Snarls
 The proposed ferry service would provide a much-needed mass-transit alternative for some of the estimated 17,300 people who travel from Rockland to New York City each weekday and who have fewer commuting options than residents of the neighboring counties of Westchester and Bergen. It would also help to alleviate the snarl of rush-hour traffic on the Tappan Zee Bridge, which connects Rockland to Westchester, transportation officials said.
And -- last but certainly not least -- there is the potential serenity of commuting by ferry.
"It would cut out a lot of stopping-and-going, stopping-and-going," said Ms. McGovern, 23, who said she "definitely" would use the service. "Going on a boat would be a lot nicer. And a little unique."
Although plans are tentative, the project took a major step forward this month when the State Legislature approved a measure that would allow the Thruway Authority, which operates the Tappan Zee Bridge, to develop the service and to hire a private operator to run it. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who formed a High Speed Ferry Task Force two years ago to encourage such projects, is expected to sign the bill soon.
Other private ferry services, whose routes are mostly between New Jersey and Manhattan, are already realizing steady increases in passengers. The average number of riders who took private ferries to and from Manhattan on a weekday rose to 21,170 last month, compared with 1986, when ferries carried fewer than 1,000 passengers a day, according to the New York City Department of Transportation.
State and city officials have also proposed extending ferry service elsewhere in the New York metropolitan region, with new routes planned to Manhattan from Oyster Bay, L.I.; Rye, N.Y., and Hunters Point in Queens.
Although ferries once crisscrossed the Hudson between Rockland and Westchester, the boats lost their allure after the Tappan Zee Bridge opened in 1958. There is now no ferry service in either county. But with advances in technology -- new boats can reach speeds of more than 30 miles an hour -- and a more concerted public emphasis on reducing auto emissions, the ferry has made a comeback.
Peter Tufo, the chairman and chief executive of the Thruway Authority, said that the agency had yet to decide where to base the Rockland ferry, but that Haverstraw and Nyack would be strong contenders.
Haverstraw, a hilly residential town of 35,000 people that is about 28 miles north of the George Washington Bridge, is aggressively lobbying the state to base the ferry service on its waterfront. Town officials, who recently secured a Federal grant of $1.6 million for the project, said they were ready to buy an undeveloped tract that they believe would be an ideal site for a terminal and dock.
The town supervisor, Philip J. Rotella, said the town stood to gain financially from a municipal parking lot that would be built on the site and from the increase in commuter traffic through the town.
But in Nyack -- a tiny enclave of restaurants, antique shops and boutiques that lies between Haverstraw and the Tappan Zee -- there is less enthusiasm for the ferry. While Mayor Robert Capone of Nyack said he believes the ferry would aid merchants by bringing in a steady stream of tourists on weekends, other village officials said they worried that the caravan of cars driven by weekday commuters might detract from Nyack's quaintness.
"I would be opposed to the kind of use that consumes large amounts of the waterfront and gives us minimal economic return," said Kieran Quinn, a village trustee and former mayor.
 
Risky Ventures
 Besides plotting a route for the ferry and determining the number of trips per day, the Thruway Authority must decide who will build and pay for the new docks and terminals, which private operator will run the service, how much a trip will cost passengers and whether the state will provide a subsidy. Without public subsidies, ferries have proven risky ventures, and a handful in the region have failed since 1990.
To insure the ferry's success, Mr. Tufo said, the authority is considering a stop in Yonkers for Westchester commuters. Mr. Tufo estimated that 1,000 to 2,000 passengers would ride the ferry daily if Yonkers were included, compared with 500 to 700 a day without. Robert Weber, a spokesman for Mayor Terence Zaleski of Yonkers, said the city would welcome the ferry service.
Asked the likelihood of the Rockland-Westchester ferry becoming a reality, Mr. Tufo said, "I think it's better than 50-50."

HEADLINE: COMPANY EARNINGS;
MOBIL CORP. (N)

 BODY:
The Mobil Corporation reported yesterday that its second-quarter earnings more than doubled, to $579 million, because of higher natural gas prices, strength in its Far East markets and gains in tax-related benefits.
Allen E. Murray, Mobil's chairman, said the company was able to overcome low oil prices and recessions in industrialized markets through higher natural gas prices, $41 million in companywide restructuring efforts and an increase in worldwide production, especially in Nigeria, California and the North Sea. 
 Mobil, the second-largest American oil company, reported earnings of $475 million from its exploration and production division, $154 million higher than for second quarter a year earlier. The company said it had reduced operational costs in the division by 10 percent.
Bolstered by strong performances in Australia, Singapore and Japan, international operating earnings were $183 million, $113 million higher than last year, making up for weak earnings in Europe.
Chemical earnings declined, to $13 million, from $18 million last year, thecompany reported, as a result of industry oversupply and European economies still mired in recession.

HEADLINE: Robert M. Kossick, Chief Executive, 53, At New Jersey Bank

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Robert M. Kossick, chairman and chief executive officer of the National Community Bank of New Jersey, died on Tuesday at his home in Ridgewood, N.J. He was 53 years old and also had a home in Tuxedo Park, N.Y.
The cause was a heart attack, the bank's announcement said. 
 A native of New Brunswick, N.J., Mr. Kossick was an industrial-engineering graduate of the Georgia Institute of Technology and earned a master's degree in economics at St. Mary's University in San Antonio. After two years of service in the Air Force there, he started out as a systems engineer with the E.I. DuPont Company in Parkersburg, W. Va.
His banking career began in 1968 with Citicorp in New York. In the next seven years he worked in domestic and overseas departments with increasing responsibilities. His final position was in London as senior operating officer of the Citibank UK Retail Bank.
He then became executive vice president of the Bank of the Southwest in Houston and, in 1979, chairman and chief executive of Empire National Bank in New City, N.Y. The following year he joined National Community Bank as president and chief executive at its headquarters in West Paterson. He traded the presidency for the chairmanship five years ago.
During his tenure, the bank quadrupled its assets to $4.2 billion and grew from 49 to 117 branches, with nearly 2,900 employees statewide. Most recently, he negotiated the bank's pending merger with the Bank of New York.
He was a sought-after speaker for free enterprise. James Peters, the bank's current president, said with his death the "industry lost one of its most successful and colorful leaders."
Mr. Kossick is survived by his wife, the former Sherry Lynne Stamey, of Houston; two sons, Robert and Mark; and two daughters, Kristen and Alicia.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
The Price of Lumber Soars As Inventories Disappear

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Lumber futures prices leaped yesterday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on signs that the construction industry had worked through a big supply inventory that had weighed on prices since last spring.
Spruce two-by-fours for September delivery surged the permitted daily limit of $10, to $278.90 per 1,000 board feet, the highest settlement of a near-term contract since June 15. 
 Lumber futures fell sharply in the second quarter after hitting a record high of $493.50 on March 16 amid panic buying induced by logging restrictions and hopes of an economic recovery.
The expected construction boom never arrived. Lumber stockpiled by mills and distributors became a drag on the market and sent futures prices down to $223 per 1,000 board feet by June 30.
Prices are now rebounding as the huge inventories disappear.
"I think most of them are gone," said Bud Merrill, lumber analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in Eugene, Ore.
Flooding in the Midwest, which has disrupted normal transportation patterns, is also helping to lift prices, according to Mike Young, a lumber broker at the Pacific Futures Trading Company in Seattle. He said rail detours had made it difficult for Midwestern users to obtain Northwest lumber, so prices have climbed.
Mr. Merrill said demand for lumber to repair flood-damaged buildings could push up prices in the third quarter.
On other commodity markets, most cattle futures rose on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ahead of the Agriculture Department's biannual cattle inventory report, which was released after the close of trading. The report showed a 1 percent rise in the nation's cattle herd, to 110.1 million head, from July of last year to the same date this year. The herd size was near trade expectations.
August live cattle rose 0.28 cent, to 73.75 cents a pound; August feeder cattle were unchanged at 86.25 cents a pound; July hogs fell 0.07 cent, to 47.45 cents a pound; July frozen pork bellies surged 1.95 cents, to 42.50 cents a pound.
In energy trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, light sweet crude oil for September delivery rose 12 cents, to $17.75 a barrel; August heating oil rose 0.47 cent, to 50.19 cents a gallon; August unleaded gasoline rose 0.32 cent, to 52.05 cents a gallon; August natural gas rose 2.5 cents, to $2.121 for 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: The Dicey Game of Commodities Trading

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
The floods in the Midwest have devastated many farmers and sent the prices of some agricultural products soaring.
On the commodities exchanges, where contracts for future delivery of these products are traded, business is brisk. Soybean prices alone set a four-year high on Monday. 
 Such spikes naturally attract the attention of investors. But the futures market, which extends well beyond crops and livestock into metals, currencies and oil and gas, is not for the faint of heart.
Thomas A. Russo, a managing director of Lehman Brothers and a commodities industry veteran, said, "I don't think you should be involved in the futures market unless you are willing to be a speculator."
Each week, individuals and corporations bet billions of dollars in the commodities markets on whether prices will rise or fall. Their tools are futures contracts: financial instruments that call for the future purchase or sale of a commodity at a price set when the contract is made.
Investors who buy contracts for delivery in several months know that supply and demand will likely change, causing the price to fluctuate. The investors, who have no intention of actually taking delivery of the commodity, plan to sell the contract before the delivery date. Their gain or loss will be determined by the contract's price at the time of sale.
Although small investors continue to buy futures in huge quantities, the odds against success for the Little Guy are about 10 to 1, according to the North American Securities Administrators Association and the Council of Better Business Bureaus.
"The only basis for participation is knowledge of the individual contract you wish to trade and an understanding of how the market works," said Hal T. Hansen, president of Cargill Investor Services. The market carries the potential for high returns, but also high risk, he warned.
This risk stems from volatility and a low initial margin, or the portion of a contract's price that an investor must put down as a good faith deposit. Commodity prices are volatile because they respond to many disparate factors -- inflation, politics and weather, to name a few. Crop prices for example, are affected not only by the floods, but also by the drought in the Southeast, conditions in other countries and Government policies.
Furthermore, most trades are based on a relatively small initial investment. The commodities exchanges set initial margins for their futures contracts, and brokers on these exchanges establish margins for their customers using these figures as a floor.
While investors buying stocks on margin typically must put 50 percent down, the initial margin for futures ranges from less than 5 percent to about 20 percent. Thus a small movement in a commodity's price could bring an investor a large return or wipe out his initial investment and require additional payments.
"You get more leverage with futures for the money you put down," said Morton Lane, president of Lind-Waldock & Company, a discount commodities brokerage firm. "But you have to do this with a prudent focus."
Investors are drawn to the markets for several reasons. Dr. Francis Powers, a radiation oncologist in Williamsport, Pa., recently explained why he delved into futures.
"I was looking for another way to invest profitably, as I felt that the stock market, being at the level that it is at, sooner or later is going to roll over," Dr. Powers said. "Now I trade about 13 different things, like the S.& P. stock index, the dollar index, soybeans and coffee."
The potential for huge gains certainly tugs at adventurous souls. Take an investor who bought a gold contract on May 18 for August delivery of 100 ounces at $377.90 an ounce. By holding through a monthlong downturn and waiting to sell until the price was $392.90 an ounce on July 16, he made a handsome profit.
The contract he bought for $37,790 sold for $39,290. Because the investor had to put down only 3.7 percent of the contract price, he doubled his $1,450 investment in two months.
Of course, if the price had continued to decline, his investment would have been completely wiped out -- and then some. "You can lose more than the money you put up, should the market go down greater than your earnest money," Mr. Russo of Lehman Brothers warned.
Experts advise individuals not to open accounts without substantial funds. "Some firms have minimum limits of $25,000, but I would suggest something closer to the $100,000 mark," said Leo Melamed, chairman of the Dellsher Investment Company and a former chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
For those with less money to invest, professional management is available through commodity pools or funds. Organized as limited partnerships, these pools accept investments as small as $5,000 -- and even $2,000 for retirement accounts. They offer diversification and the ability to withstand short-term downswings.
"They are usually structured so that you can get monthly redemptions," said Robert G. Easton, chairman of the Managed Futures Association. "And there is typically a loss point, around 50 percent, when the fund will be dissolved and the balance returned to investors."
However you enter the fast-paced world of futures, it is usually advisable to commit no more than 5 to 10 percent of your investible assets. Establish a trading plan -- setting out how long you will tie up funds and how much you are willing to lose -- that you follow in both good times and bad.

HEADLINE: FUNDS WATCH;
For New Entries, Europe Is Popular

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
New funds that invest in Europe are popping up everywhere. Many analysts say that the economic cycle in Europe is a few years behind the United States and that Europe is on the edge of a big bull market.
The Tweedy, Browne Company, an investment firm begun in 1920, specializes in classic value stock picking, or buying shares at a significant discount to what investors believe the companies are actually worth. Its first foray into mutual funds is a global stock fund, now totally invested outside the United States, mainly in Europe. It concentrates on companies with small and medium capitalization, and plans to hedge all currency risks. 
 The Skyline Europe Portfolio invests solely in Europe by policy, making it a purer play on the region. Skyline concentrates on shares of companies that have large capitalizations. The fund, which is managed out of London by Gordon House Securities Ltd., sometimes hedges currency risks.
Concerned about rising interest rates, some bond fund sponsors are slashing maturities. Share prices of funds with shorter terms will decline less if interest rates rise, as many expect late this year. Twentieth Century is waiving expenses on its new Tax-Exempt Short-Term Bond Fund through 1993. Afterward, annual expenses will equal 0.6 percent. The fund yields 3.03 percent, or 4.21 percent for investors in the 28 percent Federal tax bracket, 4.39 percent for those in the top bracket.

HEADLINE: Europe's Social Dumping

BYLINE: By Flora Lewis; Flora Lewis is Senior Columnist of The New York Times.

DATELINE: DUSSELDORF, Germany

 BODY:
Everybody agrees on the principle that economic growth winds up to the benefit of all, and that zero-sum games of beggar-thy-neighbor are an illusion. Eventually, all lose. But when times are hard, everybody looks to the home front and the right-now -- leave principle to the long term. What they remember about John Maynard Keynes is that he said, "In the long term, we are all dead."
The most painful new dilemma as the world feels the impact of another industrial revolution, as profound and disruptive as the 19th century's, is that growth no longer equals jobs. The demands of expansion through free trade -- productivity, competitiveness, cost-cutting -- work to reduce jobs, substituting technology or much cheaper labor somewhere else.
This is more evident in Europe than in the U.S., with unemployment in the Community at 11 percent and getting worse, although the same factors are at work in America. 
 Organized labor, with more vested interest in protecting members than in creating new jobs, is distressed by the phenomenon of "social dumping," the phrase of the day. It refers to a demand for protection not only against excess goods unloaded in a foreign market but also against genuine competition based on low wages and low or no outlays for workers' social benefits.
These were the themes of a meeting here on "America and Europe -- Old Relations, New Challenges," organized by the Hans Boeckler Foundation, which is backed by the German Federation of Trade Unions.
There was more concern about taking away too much of existing buffers than that the leaders, talking in Tokyo at the same time, would fail to cooperate in removing them. There was more concern about lack of economic stimulus than about inflation and the way it distorts and skews trade. The facts of economic interdependence weren't denied, but the questions are becoming more insistent on whether it's such a good thing or ought to be resisted.
It took Alicia Enders, representing GATT headquarters in Geneva, to put up some hard figures showing advantages to working people. U.S. consumers pay $100,000 for each $25,000 job protected against imports in the textile industry, she said. Export-related jobs provide 20 percent higher wages in services and 17 percent higher in manufacturing than for strictly domestic output.
The West European union people, trying to be supportive and hospitable to their colleagues from Eastern Europe, nonetheless worry that their welfare states will be eroded away as a consequence of concessions that desperate Eastern workers are prepared to grant management. There are quarrels in the E.C. about "dislocation" when factories move to another Community state to escape labor charges while saving market access.
The arguments are no longer about the fight between capital and labor. The leader of Poland's Solidarity union, pleading that support for infra-structure investment in the East would help Western workers, too, said, "Without capital, there is no place for labor."
But the old assumptions about labor's role in the economy have been overtaken by technology and the globalization of finance. This is the strain underneath the Tokyo disputes, the strain between the push for greater economic cooperation to promote growth by taking in each other's washing and the pull to hunker down and save what there is.
To ease it (it won't soon be resolved) requires new ideas in the industrial countries about what is a job and what should be rewarded. The economic meaning of services has to be expanded to enlarge the contributions of education, the arts, social usefulness. Unions, as they have evolved, aren't well equipped for this, but they can and should be spurred to seek ways to contribute to creation of new jobs to replace those that are migrating.
Tokyo was a reprieve in the battle between contracting political nationalisms, arising from commerce but growing more dangerously emotional in many countries, and irresistible economic aggressiveness. It won't last. If there isn't another real spurt forward in trade, on terms widely perceived as mutually beneficial, the international economic system will unravel.

HEADLINE: Philippines Acts to Protect Environment

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your July 13 Hinunangan Journal inaccurately presents images of the Philippines as a metaphor for the national situation. 
 In the last seven years poverty in the Philippines has fallen from 65 percent to 40 percent. Government programs, supported by the private sector, aim at reducing it to 30 percent toward the end of the decade.
The Government of the Philippines has moved aggressively to address environmental degradation. Reforms include the banning of logging in old-growth forests; establishment of forestry programs where communities take the lead in managing resources, and massive outlays for environmental protection, despite limited finances. Manila has worked out innovative debt-for-nature swaps with multilateral institutions to support such programs.
With a stabilized political climate, economic reforms have occurred at a dramatic pace. Structural changes have resulted in the resumption of economic growth, improved foreign debt ratios, a sixfold increase in international reserves and the reduction of inflation from 18.5 percent in 1991 to a manageable 6.7 percent this year.
These have a direct impact on the purchasing power and well-being of the man and woman in the street and contribute to an improved employment picture as well.
The World Bank declared last April that "the Philippines now faces its best prospect for sustained development in almost two decades." Citicorp in its emerging markets research echoes the sentiment. One manifestation: the Manila stock market has been named one of the best performing in the world, posting 110 percent returns.

CONTROL YOUR DESTINY OR SOMEONE ELSE WILL
How Jack Welch Is Making General Electric the World's Most Competitive Corporation.
By Noel M. Tichy and Stratford Sherman.
384 pp. New York: Currency/Doubleday. $24. 
 FOR all the ink spilled chronicling the corporate restructurings, takeovers, junk bonds, savings-and-loan woes and the other excesses that landed business stories on the nation's front pages during the past decade, the general reader knows far too little about the way business really works or about the (mostly) men who hold so much sway over the American economy. Powerful executives seem to inhabit a different world. They live in chic enclaves, travel in corporate jets, hobnob mainly with peers and spend their days and nights making big decisions.
Four new books examine four symbols of the 1980's. Two deal with esteemed corporate chieftains -- Robert L. Crandall, the head of American Airlines, and John F. Welch Jr., chairman and chief executive of the General Electric Company. And two depict men regarded as rogues -- Michael R. Milken, junk bond king of the defunct investment banking firm Drexel Burnham Lambert, and Carl C. Icahn, a raider who made a killing attacking the likes of Chesebrough Pond's, Phillips Petroleum, Texaco, USX and T.W.A.
Although the four share some traits -- smarts, drive, iconoclasm -- they differ greatly in style and substance, as does the quality of the portraits. Mr. Welch comes off best: as "Control Your Destiny or Someone Else Will" tells it, he's a complicated character who learns and grows as he tries to transform a huge bureaucratic company into a world-class competitor. In "Dangerous Dreamers," Mr. Milken seems to be a charming visionary whose financial insights did more good than harm. He is neither the villain you'd expect, considering his imprisonment for securities crimes, nor (as some have said) the most important financier of the 20th century. As for "King Icahn," its protagonist comes across as the least likable of the four -- a wily, difficult, rude man, single-minded in his pursuit of the buck. And in "The American Eagle," Mr. Crandall is quick, earthy and absolutely dedicated to propelling American to the top of the airline heap.
Of the four portraits, "The American Eagle," by Dan Reed, a reporter who covers the airline industry for The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, is the weakest. Using an aw-shucks style, Mr. Reed has written a formulaic book with too many digressions that take the reader nowhere. His one-sided, hagiographic account rarely goes beyond corporate sources. As Mr. Reed recounts how Mr. Crandall and his management team invented frequent-flyer programs, the hub-and-spoke route system, two-tier wages and various discount fare schemes and financing mechanisms, he provides far too little information on what American's rivals are doing and why the entire airline industry flew into turbulence. Mr. Crandall, a chain-smoking jogger whose salty outspokenness has plunged him into trouble more than once, deserves better. For all his faults, Mr. Crandall is considered in the business world to be a thoughtful industry leader, always trying something to gain a competitive edge. There must be stories that would make that Bob Crandall come alive.
On that score, Mark Stevens, author of "The Big Eight" and other books on business and finance, is far more successful. His "King Icahn" is chockablock with anecdotes that take his subject from humble beginnings in Queens, the son of a would-be opera singer who thought there was "something wrong about great wealth," to multimillionaire status, with homes on Park Avenue, in the Hamptons and in baronial Bedford, N.Y.
To please his mother, Mr. Icahn started out in medical school. But as Mr. Stevens relates Mr. Icahn's escapades since his first raids from 1978 through today, readers can't help being grateful that early on he recognized his unsuitability for the healing profession. Mr. Icahn is "a bull, snorting and pacing," in the description of a longtime assistant, "always looking for a way to get through that fence to strike a deal." Mr. Stevens shows how the man chooses his corporate targets, how he descends on management, how he'll do anything legal to get more. Consider his negotiating tactics. On the appointed day, we're told, Mr. Icahn sleeps late, catches a shower and a nap late in the day, then arrives hours after an evening session was scheduled to start -- all to outwit tired opponents as he drags out talks into the next morning. Yet for all his wealth, Mr. Icahn remains cheap -- refusing, according to a neighbor's account, to pay an extra $300 for power windows in his wife's Jeep.
Mr. Stevens has written a well-researched history of one man and his times. There's just one big problem. Who wants to know this much about Carl Icahn? Perhaps that's why Mr. Stevens strains to declare him the most important, the brightest, the very best 80's raider. Mr. Icahn's troubles with T.W.A., which he tried and failed to manage, say otherwise.
With "Dangerous Dreamers," Robert Sobel, a professor of business history at Hofstra University and the author of many books on business, treads richer territory. Although the book is billed as a history of financial innovators, the focus is on Mr. Milken, and others are brought in to put him in perspective. Walking readers down both the sunny and the shady sides of Wall Street, Mr. Sobel explains how changes in stock ownership patterns, tax laws, Federal regulation and deregulation, 1960's-style conglomeration, interest rate fluctuations, the death of traditional company-banker relationships and a host of other trends led to the financial shenanigans of the 80's.
Mr. Milken gets off lightly. As Mr. Sobel recites his background, his maniacal work habits, his intellectual breakthroughs, he seems fond of the junk bond maven. He notes, too, that Mr. Milken warned that companies were taking on too much debt as early as 1986.
In a few places, Mr. Sobel provides facts that should dispel popular misconceptions -- that there's something innately evil about junk bonds, for example, or that hostile lev eraged buyouts were the rule of the 80's. "Only 1 percent of all LBO's began and ended in an unfriendly fashion," he writes. And even at the height of the hostile takeover movement, only about 15 percent of junk bonds were issued to finance them.
Mr. Sobel has written an evenhanded recap of an era. But that's its weakness: "Dangerous Dreamers" is rather a bland synthesis of other people's reporting and research. Readers get context, not revelation.
NOEL M. TICHY, a professor at the University of Michigan School of Business and a consultant to General Electric since 1982, and Stratford Sherman, a reporter and member of Fortune magazine's board of editors who has written often about G.E., aspire to an entirely different goal. "Control Your Destiny or Someone Else Will" is a how-to book, designed to explain John Welch's management techniques and to inspire other big, stodgy American corporate leaders to follow his lead. Although the authors give readers the requisite biographical information, they are really more interested in telling stories that illustrate Mr. Welch's management ideas. He demands, for example, that each of G.E.'s businesses be No. 1 or No. 2 in market share. He talks about the need to create a "bounda ryless organization" that encourages every employee to be flexible, speedy and responsible -- and to get the job done without regard to antiquated organizational rules.
Still, Mr. Welch has his own rules, his own "unusual management ideas," and his maxims, such as a call for managers to be "hardheaded but soft-hearted." Add them all up and readers get a motivational text that teaches more about well-run organizations of the future than about Mr. Welch. Anyone familiar with management books knows much of this turf, as even Mr. Tichy, who is responsible for the book's research, admits.
That, in fact, is the disappointment in all four books. They don't tell much that readers of the business pages don't already know and do tell much that they don't want to. And they won't hold the attention of the general reader who might like -- and benefit from -- a guided tour of the business world.

SYSTEMS OF SURVIVAL
A Dialogue on the Moral Foundations
of Commerce and Politics.
By Jane Jacobs.
236 pp. New York:
Random House. $22. 
 JANE JACOBS wrote a first book so stupendously good that a later slide downhill was all but inevitable. It has not been a dramatic slide since "The Death and Life of Great American Cities" (1961); each of her four subsequent books is intelligent, learned and original. But none has been capable, as her initial venture was, of making the everyday world seem both magical and ordered.
Ms. Jacobs's voice, in "Death and Life," spoke in the specifics of time (the present) and place (Greenwich Village). Unlike city planners, she had no utopia to impose on ordinary people. In contrast to social scientists, she rejected jargon and high theory. All you needed, she said, were eyes, a love of humanity and a feel for the real world. With them, cities, and therefore people, came alive; without them, all was sterile.
In later years, Ms. Jacobs seemed to lose that grounding. Time and space came unhinged as she moved (physically) to Toronto and (intellectually) to universals about human behavior. Mimicking the planners she once condemned, she increasingly sought to tie everything together in a convincing system that would overpower by the beauty of its design. And aping the social scientists against whose work hers once sparkled, she would do this through theory; her insights would come from books she read, not from the lives she so assiduously watched.
The latest effort is "Systems of Survival." Cast in the form of a Platonic dialogue, the book argues that there are two ways in which people organize their material world. One is through trade, which generates a moral syndrome in which individuals avoid force, act voluntarily, compete and strive for efficiency. The other she calls the guardian syndrome, which stresses loyalty, obedience, vengeance, ostentation, honor and other ways of maintaining status and protecting tradition.
Although not especially original -- Max Weber, Joseph Schumpeter, Charles Lindblom and Albert Hirschman all made similar points about states and markets -- Ms. Jacobs, with her unorthodox intelligence, often produces new insights. We learn that the military taboo against trading may have originated as a way of preventing treachery, that ecologists often see the world as military men do and that "the history of economic development is the history of men taking up women's work." Ms. Jacobs is also particularly good at untangling how commercial and guardian values are combined in hybrids like the Mafia, the military-industrial complex, agriculture, Communism and modern Japan.
But far too much of "Systems of Survival" is devoted not to an explanation of morality but to a defense of the structure used to explain it. Ms. Jacobs argues that there are no more than two moral systems, a point that is either empirically false or true only by definition. (Ethnic solidarity, altruism and paternalism are all premised on something other than trading or guardianship; Ms. Jacobs engages in mind-boggling, and ultimately pointless, thought experiments to bring such anomalies within her dichotomy.) She is at pains to insist that the two syndromes have their own moral logic, over and above the morality of the individuals whose lives are governed by them. And, most frustrating of all, she cannot make up her mind whether practices that mix elements from each syndrome are examples of monstrous corruption or necessary flexibility.
Because "Systems of Survival" seeks to justify an intellectual construct rather than to explain the behavior of real people, the stilted dialogue lacks two essential qualities associated with "The Death and Life of Great American Cities": empathy and a democratic sensibility. For reasons never fully explained, Ms. Jacobs confines herself to material realities in this book, thereby excluding love, religion, identity, rage, sacrifice and ritual. Although her characters eat -- and although two of them almost announce their engagement -- they are as wooden as the people whose history is being recounted through their dialogue.
Moreover, Ms. Jacobs's failure to treat human beings as creatures with emotions and feelings is a considered decision. "I'm sick of cant about the family being the bedrock of society," one of her characters exclaims, gratuitously, at the end of the book. "Families are fragments of their societies. The bedrocks are the ways people get their livings, and the institutions and organizations formed to that end." You get the people you imagine. If you want people trying to make moral sense out of the intimate worlds around them, try Jane Austen, not Jane Jacobs.
"Systems of Survival" is also an undemocratic book (despite Ms. Jacobs's defense of the democratization of credit). For what is modern democracy but a system that is rooted in neither trade nor protection? Democracy relies on constitutions, political parties, pluralism, individual rights and community norms. If these are used for purposes of self-interested commerce, they cannot function properly. But if they are used without competition and participation, for purposes of guardianship, they cannot be democratic. What Ms. Jacobs calls "systemic moral corruption" makes it possible for strangers to live together under conditions approximating self-rule.
Real people do not live ethical lives by following the precepts of intellectual syndromes. Their worlds are built from experience up, not from abstractions down. The younger Jane Jacobs drove this point home. The more mature one seems to have forgotten it.

Streamlining the Ungainly

BYLINE: By Robin Toner; Robin Toner is a correspondent in the Washington bureau of The New York Times. William Safire is on vacation.

 BODY:
We political reporters saw it coming, the true magnitude of the health-care crisis, the way it could tongue-tie even skilled professionals like ourselves who were accustomed to turning complex issues into simple buzzwords.
It was clear as early as November 1991, when a puzzled Hal Bruno of ABC News was forced to ask the candidates in the middle of a televised debate: "Explain the Enthoven plan." Hearts sank, news disappeared in a great unstoppable wave of health policy, as the candidates rattled on about the Hawaiian approach, the virtues of broad-based community rating, managed care and managed competition (a.k.a. the Enthoven plan, named after Alain Enthoven, of Stanford University, who specializes in the economics of health care), the Canadian and the German system. 
 We were sure a health-care plan known as the German system was unlikely to be a big vote-getter. (The Hawaiian approach sounded infinitely better, particularly in New Hampshire.) But we never dreamed we would be forced to confront the dreaded Enthoven plan two years later and try to turn it into digestible news bites.
Nowadays, the health-care issue can no longer be avoided. Reform is on the move in Washington, and President Clinton's political advisers have spent much of the last few months trying to figure out how to talk about it. The wonks in the Clinton Administration have pushed it in the direction of one of the more complicated theories of health-care reform: managed competition. But the Administration's pragmatic pols are trying to turn this into a populist crusade: Just we farmers and workers and family folks standing shoulder to shoulder with Al Enthoven and the rest of the health-care economists.
One of the first things the Clintonites did was drop the term managed competition -- a distinct turnoff in focus groups. That left them with the task of describing the central structure of managed competition: the huge regional purchasing cooperatives that pool the bargaining power of individuals and small businesses to negotiate for the optimum health plans. Until recently, these entities were known as H.I.P.C.'s (or Hipics) -- for health insurance purchasing cooperatives -- but many Democratic strategists, including James Carville, felt that expression sounded like another exercise in Big Government. As a result, Hipic gave way to the Health Alliance.
Personally, I think this change was a mistake. Hip ic had a pleasant, down-home feel to it, like a chain of discount stores. "I'm gonna run on down to the Hipic, honey, and pick up some forms. You need anything?"
The Health Alliance, on the other hand, has a vaguely Orwellian tone. As in, "Good Morning, Mr. Jones, we're from the Alliance and we'd like to talk to you about how your therapy is going." Doctors are already warning darkly about the dangers of managed care under second-guessing, cost-conscious insurance companies, let alone Health Alliances.
In West Virginia this spring, Hillary Rodham Clinton, chairwoman of the health-care reform task force, took a stab at explaining the Hipic idea without giving it a name. "You'll be part of great big pools to buy insurance," she said, "and you'll get all the breaks and all the discounts the big guys are entitled to." Other times, however, she seems to be following the advice given to Willie Stark in "All the King's Men": "Just tell 'em you're gonna soak the fat boys and forget the rest of the tax stuff."
In fact, she has a wide array of potential fat boys from which to choose: insurance companies, drug manufacturers, hospitals, doctors and a variety of other health-care providers, all of whom are now scrambling in Washington to declare themselves the true friends of reform and the enemies of a flawed health-care delivery system.
Once the debate gets going on Capitol Hill, politicians will have to explain not only managed competition, but also all the rival philosophies of health-care reform. Chief among them is the single-payer system, which is also an unfortunate title. It refers to the fact that there is just one payer -- the Government -- for health care. (The money, of course, comes from taxes.) This is sometimes described as a Canadian-style system, which sounds much more appealing, as though it were the Molson ale of health care.
Still, single payer is part of the language in health politics, as in, "He's a single-payer guy" or, "The single-payer people like this bill," or even, as one single-payer supporter told me not long ago, in high pique, "They're using single-payer rhetoric to sell a managed competition plan." In the health-care debate, those are fighting words.
If the Administration is trying to simplify the language of health care in some areas, it is engaged in some rather artful embellishments in others, like financing. White House officials are more than willing to talk about the sin taxes that will be raised to support health-care reform. Who can argue against taxing sin? But they prefer a gentler term for the levy on employers and employees that would go to the Hipic/Alliances and that is expected to be an important part of the final plan. They are calling the levy a premium.
Why not call it a tax?
"If it doesn't go to the Government, it wouldn't meet one of the key definitions of a tax," Vice President Gore declared on "Meet the Press" this spring. (On the other hand, the element of coercion expected in this levy would meet one of the key definitions of a tax.)
For all the jargon, all sides in this debate will try to hit the basic emotional chords: peace of mind, security, insurance you can never lose. The Clinton forces say they are struggling to keep focused on the big picture, but as was the case on that chilly, ominous night back in New Hampshire when the debate turned to health care, they keep slipping into the abyss of wonkdom. The issue is so big, they say, the biggest domestic issue since Social Security.
Still, in pre-focus-group days, Franklin D. Roosevelt found a way to explain what he was doing.
"Today a hope of many years' standing is in large part fulfilled," he declared when he signed the Social Security Act on Aug. 14, 1935. "We can never insure 100 percent of the population against 100 percent of the hazards and vicissitudes of life, but we have tried to frame a law which will give some measure of protection to the average citizen and to his family against the loss of a job and against poverty-ridden old age."
I could write a lead off that.

Walter Cronkite Finds It Hard to Say No

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN

DATELINE: MARTHA'S VINEYARD, Mass.

 BODY:
Reassurance has always been Walter Cronkite's stock in trade, the ability to convince viewers that when he is on the air all will turn out well. And, it is in this sense reassuring to hear that the former CBS anchorman hates to see himself on camera. That's what he says. He likes to be in front of the camera, but he does not like looking at the on-screen results.
"I cringe when I see myself," Mr. Cronkite was saying the other day. He was sitting in shorts and a sun-bleached plaid shirt in his vacation house overlooking the bay here. "I don't feel I look that good. I get fat, sloppy. My suits don't fit that well. When I do interviews, my questions don't have the arrowlike quality of a Mike Wallace." 
 And so, Walter Cronkite remains modest, all too approachably human, which is reassuring as well. But that does not stop him from putting his familiar qualities to use from time to time. And lately he has been doing that often enough to seem to be devising a kind of anchorman's rebirth for himself. Mr. Cronkite never completely disappeared from the country's television screens since he stopped doing the "CBS Evening News" 12 years ago. What he did do, however, was a far cry from guiding the nation, live, through its periods of crisis. Every year, instead, he has done things like guide PBS's annual broadcasts of the New Year's concert of the Vienna Philharmonic. Once he even conducted the Hochund Deutchmeister Band in a rendition of "Stars and Stripes Forever."
Mr. Cronkite perhaps faces a dilemma common only to very famous people -- how to stay in the game and remain active even after the glory days are over. At the age of 76, he seems to have hit on a solution, which has been to become busier than ever. And the reason he is in such demand, according to those who are after his services, is that there is nobody else quite so reassuring as Walter Cronkite is, and quite as much of a draw.
Together with Jonathan Ward, one of his producers at CBS, Mr. Cronkite has created his own documentary film company and is producing television specials on some subjects generally deemed too complex for regular network treatment.
Two months ago, the Discovery Channel broadcast "Help Unwanted," a look at the changing face of unemployment in America. This Thursday night, it will show "Where Do We Fight?," which looks at American military policy abroad or, as Mr. Cronkite puts it, "at public opinion and public voices and how we decide where the U.S. should involve its military in the world."
To be sure, these are not the kinds of programs that will set the chattering classes on fire. Indeed, Mr. Cronkite is held in check by what he calls his "golden handcuffs," an agreement with CBS stipulating that he cannot work for a major network. He is therefore pretty much restricted to the smaller audiences of cable and public television.
Last year Mr. Cronkite's voice was heard on a segment of "Murphy Brown." Though he never appeared on the show, some newspapers reported that he was going to be a regular on the program. Mr. Cronkite said that was never anybody's intention.
So, the Walter Cronkite of the old days is not about to reappear in all of his former splendor. Still, the old anchorman has been in
demand. He anchored the Discovery Channel's special broadcast on the Holocaust in April, which coincided with the opening of the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. He narrated a four-part series on dinosaurs. He was the on-camera announcer for three documentaries shown on PBS, on aging, health insurance and poor children, respectively.
Next month, rather than sail his sloop in the Virgin Islands, he is off to Scandinavia for a documentary series called "The Vikings"; then he heads for Kenya for a British documentary, "The Search for Man," about Richard Leakey and other paleoanthropologists. "We've worked with a lot of movie stars, like James Earl Jones, Meryl Streep and others," said Roger Weisberg, the producer of Mr. Cronkite's PBS documentaries. "Frankly, when we began working with Mr. Cronkite, we not only had the benefit of his experience, but we had an unusual audience draw. Stations in the PBS system were more interested; our ratings improved. He's the best investment we could make in getting publicity for our programs."
Somewhere along the line, we became a country of celebrity rather than authority, and celebrity is by its very nature evanescent. Authority is more durable, and Mr. Cronkite is one of the few people around who has it.
Certainly in his newest productions, the old Walter Cronkite of CBS days remains entirely recognizable. He is a bit grayer now, and his voice has lost just a touch of its gravelly richness, but only a touch.
He does have just a bit of the quality of the aging tenor, still mellifluous but not quite as mellifluous as before. Watching Mr. Cronkite, in all his avuncularity, tell us the way it is on the Discovery Channel is practically Proustian; like tea and Madeleines, it summons up a rich field of associations.
It is not, of course, easy to regain a top spot in one of the slots available for national attention. Watching Mr. Cronkite these days, one also realizes how much television has changed. His new productions do not, for example, have the resonance of his famous old "You Are There" programs. The world belongs to hipper types than Mr. Cronkite, to Larry King and David Letterman, and it is unlikely that he will attract the ever younger flocks who watch television. Instead, he will be the trustworthy, reassuring commentator on the old-fashioned hard stuff, like the Great Books and adventures in science.
Mr. Cronkite's rise to ultimate trustworthiness was smooth and enjoyable and tinged with elements of disappeared worlds. In Kansas City in the early days, he used to do a five-minute program of baseball scores on a tiny 100-watt radio station, clandestinely reading the scores from the Western Union wire at a nearby tobacco shop, memorizing them and then running out to write them down. Then he did reconstructed football games, graduating eventually to live football games.
Many years later he became the anchorman for the network's affiliate in Washington. Over a long career, there has been Walter Cronkite guiding a nation through the Kennedy assassination, the Vietnam War, the moon landings, Watergate and many other events.
Today, one might wonder why Mr. Cronkite works so hard. Friends say that he is basically a veteran reporter who loves to work. He explains: "It's because I can't say 'no.' I've got no facility for negatives. People call about speeches, seminars, documentaries and everything sounds interesting. My wife stands in front of me and mouths 'no,' but it seems so easy a year in advance."
That leads to another question: What, in a country that gobbles fads and personalities of the month, accounts for his considerable staying power, his capacity, even at his age, to outdraw Meryl Streep as the on-camera announcer for serious documentaries?
The answer, in part, probably has to do with that word "serious." There are still a couple of slots available for Mr. Cronkite's kind of gravitas. He can still play that role.

HEADLINE: Q and A

BYLINE: By Paul Freireich

 BODY:

A Tuscan Garden
Q. My family would like to see the Garden of Tarot by the artist Niki de Saint Phalle near the village of Capalbio in Tuscany. When is it open? Where can one stay nearby? -- M. C. Belfiglio, New York, N.Y. 
 A. Based on the images pictured on Tarot cards, Ms. de Saint Phalle has created a fantasy world of 20 sculptures. As unpredictable as the Tarot deck used in fortune telling is the serendipitous galaxy of fanciful sculptures, some of which are building-sized. Many of the works are made of iron mesh, sprayed with cement and embellished with a mosaic of Murano glass, mirrors and ceramic tiles, and such symbols as serpents, eggs and hearts abound.
Situated in the tiny Italian village of Pescia Fiorentina, the garden is half a dozen miles from the beach resort of Capalbio. Its sculptures are a tribute to Antonio Gaudi and also recall the grotesque garden sculptures at Bomarzo, near Viterbo.
A few of the noteworthy Saint Phalle sculptures are "The Magician," crowned with a huge mirror-tiled hand; the "Empress" (or "Sphinx"), which Ms. de Saint Phalle has used as her home and studio, and "Falling Tower," which suggests the chaos at the Tower of Babel, with every window a different size and with the roof and top floor teetering.
A tour of the garden takes two hours or less, and since the garden is open in July and August, now is the time to visit. It is open 4 to 8 P.M. Monday to Saturday; admission is free. There is no phone.
Construction of the garden began in 1979 in collaboration with Miss Saint Phalle's husband, the late Swiss sculptor Jean Tinguely. Still to be completed are two sculptures.
To get to Pescia Fiorentina, which is a mile from the main road, Via Aurelia, follow a gravel road and signs for the Villa Caracciolo or those indicating "sculture." Pescia Fiorentina has but a single restaurant, Trattoria il Tortello, a mile from the garden. A meal for two, with local wine, is $34. The restaurant is open all week long during July and August. Telephone: (0564) 895133.
In nearby Capalbio, a double at the 42-room Hotel Valle del Buttero, which the Michelin Guide rates as comfortable, is $68. It is at 21 Via Silone, Capalbio 58011; telephone (0564) 896097, fax (0564) 896518. Note, though, that the hotel does not have a restaurant.
 
The Seychelles
 Q. I am interested in going to the Seychelles Islands. Where I can get travel information? I also need to know about hotels and beaches. -- Lee Kostel, Williamsburg, Va.
A. The Seychelles, a group of 100 islands in the Indian Ocean a thousand miles east of Tanzania and 700 miles northeast of Madagascar, are known for their beaches, fishing and diving as well as for their rare flora and fauna.
Discovered by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama and under French rule until 1814, the Seychelles were later ceded to Britain. In 1976 they gained their independence.
Since there is no nonstop service from the United States, your flight is likely to stop in Europe, probably at Gatwick in England, a popular jumping-off point for Mahe, the islands' political and economic center.
To save $1,249 over the cost of a British Airways ticket for New York to Mahe Island and back (which comes to $3,280), you can buy two separate round-trip tickets on British Airways: one New York-Gatwick ($559) and one Gatwick-Mahe Island ($1,472), for a total of $2,031.
Here are some possibilities for accommodations, with rates cited being for double occupancy, including breakfast. The area code is 248.
Beau Vallon Bay Hotel, Post Office Box, 550, Mahe; telephone 46141; fax 47809. The hotel, which has a casino, also offers a pool, scuba diving and tennis. Rate: $261 a day, including breakfast.
Le Meridien Barbarons, Post Office Box 626, Mahe; telephone 78253; fax 78484. Rate: $273, including breakfast.
A 15-minute flight (or two-hour boat ride) from Mahe is the island of Praslin. There, amid flourishing trees, you will find Chateau des Feuilles, a group of 12 handsome cottages some of which overlook the ocean. Telephone 33316; fax 33916. Rate, including breakfast: $200 for a room, $240 for an apartment.
As for beaches, among the more outstanding ones on Mahe are Beau Vallon, a two-mile crescent of soft, white sand; Grand'Anse, whose six-foot waves are well suited for the body surfer, and the calm Anse a la Mouche. For an especially memorable beach, you will want to try the solitude of Anse Lazio on the northern coast of Praslin.
More information: The Seychelles Tourist Office, 820 Second Avenue, Suite 900F, New York, N.Y. 10017; (212) 687-9766, fax (212) 922-9177.
 
A.T.M.'s Abroad
 Q. During a recent trip to London, I tried to use my automatic teller machine card to withdraw cash, but could not. I understand there is a special code for electronic banking transactions. -- Bette Kirschstein, Ossining, N.Y.
A. Actually, there is no special code needed for banking abroad, but there are a number of reasons a machine may not deliver the goods.
Most A.T.M.'s outside of the United States and Canada are set up for a four-digit personal identification number. While you explained that you had one, some card users may not be aware of this requirement. Anyone with a code exceeding four digits should get a new number through the card issuer and test that number before leaving. Travelers with an access code of four letters should be sure to translate those letters into numbers. It's also important to know one's daily withdrawal limit.
Remember, too, that most international A.T.M.'s do not offer a choice as to which account money should be withdrawn from. Typically, withdrawals are deducted from a checking account, even though the teller machine or receipt might not say so.
Be sure the logo on the back of your card matches the one displayed. The logos you are likely to encounter are Plus and Cirrus, which have a total of 200,000 A.T.M.'s, but some of them may be open only during regular business hours.
Even though there may be a transaction charge, A.T.M.'s still offer a favorable rate: withdrawals are debited at the rate that banks use for transactions in the $1 million range.

HEADLINE: A Philosopher's Perch on Main Street in Ridgefield

BYLINE: By BILL RYAN

 BODY:
IT is approaching noon in Ridgefield and a queue is starting to form on Main Street at a little establishment that may be the most recession-proof business of all in these economically troubled times.
In other communities, the business would be described as a hot dog vendor's cart. But in Ridgefield, in keeping with the upscale image of Fairfield County, the awning over the cart describes it as Chez Lenard, the Sidewalk Cafe de Ridgefield. 
 The fare dispensed under the awning is described in a menu as Les Delices Culinaires de la Voiture, Selected Delicacies from the Sidewalk Cafe. The true specialty of the cart is le hot dog facon Mexicain et garniture Suisse. That's a hot dog with chili con carne and fondue created on the premises with cheese, wine and cherry brandy. At $3.25, it is also the most expensive item on the menu.
The cart's proprietor, 57-year-old Michael Soetbeer, sports a whitish beard and deep tan and is attired in a sports shirt, Bermuda shorts, moccasins and occasionally the tall, floppy chef's toque.
Mr. Soetbeer also brings to the job an enthusiasm almost akin to joy. As the queue starts to lengthen at the noon hour, his hands fly in synchronized patterns, getting a hot dog, putting it into the bun, lathering on the mustard or sauerkraut or relish or chopped Bermuda onions, at the same time talking to everyone who is buying or even passing by.
 
Part of the Town's Charm
 "How's the family? I'm glad it's a nice day. I see you've come back to visit." The last is directed at a young mother who arrived at the cart with her 4-year-old daughter. They once lived in Ridgefield but now live in another town. When they come back for a doctor's appointment, the daughter insists they eat at the hot dog stand, the mother said. The stand and its proprietor are part of the charm of the town, she said.
After customers get their hot dogs, some eat while sitting on a wooden planter that the town allowed Mr. Soetbeer to build around a nearby tree. Others drift over to a municipal bench and eat there, or take the hot dogs to a park diagonally across the street. Mr. Soetbeer remains at the stand, serving up more or, when there's a break, simply watching people go by, which he dearly loves to do.
"When I was a kid in a little town on Long Island, my friend and I would sit on the curb and watch the world go by," he said. "I loved it. I still love watching people and here I can do it all the time. I love this job."
Mr. Soetbeer is a man of philosophical bent, conscious that the present economy has hurt some people he has come to know from his perch on Main Street. A declining economy is no respecter of social rank or who works for which Fortune 500 company or how many BMW's or Mercedes are parked in the driveway. When the crunch comes, it comes, and some of the people he knows are now out of jobs. In such a climate, the philosophy of Michael Soetbeer could come in handy. What newly unemployed people might do, he said, is to reflect on what they really want to do in life, what kind of work would make them "really happy and at ease and then see if they can make a buck doing it."
That might sound simplistic, particularly in a town such as Ridgefield, populated by corporate people who wear suits to work, not shorts and moccasins with no socks.
Mr. Soetbeer's opinions, however, should carry some weight. He knows from personal experience what many executives are now going through. He was once one of them. He too lost his job. It was in 1980. He was the personnel director of a large psychiatric center in White Plains, commuting each day from Ridgefield. He was 43 years old, had been involved in personnel work nearly all his adult life, had a wife and three children and suddenly had no job because the center had been sold and the new owners brought in their own management team.
 
No More Endless Details
 He knew he had to work but really didn't want to go back into personnel work. He liked the contact with people but not the endless details that tied him to a desk. One day, almost as a joke, he said, his wife pointed out a little newspaper advertisement. A man who had operated a hot dog cart known as Chez Lenard in warm weather in the center of Ridgefield wanted to sell it. For $5,000, Michael Soetbeer had found his destiny.
Thirteen years later, he can look back and say they have been the most joyful years of his business life. And proud years. "Some people might think this is not upscale work," he said, smiling. "But it is."
He and his cart have also gained a measure of fame, in town and out. Yankee Magazine once designated the cart as the "Best Hot Dog Stand in New England." A local calendar once used a pen and ink drawing of Mr. Soetbeer and his cart as the illustration for the month of June. A mural at Norwalk Hospital that shows the communities the hospital serves uses the hot dog cart to illustrate Ridgefield.
 
A Lot of Hard Work
 Although the hot dog cart represents so much fun, Mr. Soetbeer will also admit that it represents a lot of hard work. He has made it into a year-round enterprise, which takes some tenacity considering Connecticut's weather. Standing under an umbrella on a dreary New England winter day, jumping up and down to keep warm, would not be considered a life-enhancing experience by most people. And in the fast food business you have to keep regular hours, in all seasons, because customers expect it.
"I'm a creature of habit," said Mr. Soetbeer. "By 8, I'm in the center, by 9 I'm setting up, I'm open at 11 and I close at 5." That's seven days a week. In his spare time, he also caters parties, using a spare hot dog cart, mostly for children but sometimes for adults. "I did an adult party in New Canaan the other night. It's the trendy thing to do lately."
After 13 years at the cart, Mr. Soetbeer has been described as an institution in Ridgefield. First Selectwoman Sue W. Manning, who occasionally drops over from her office a block away, agrees that is an apt description.
"He's viewed as an institution," she said. "He's a very friendly sidewalk ambassador. He's always cheery, even in bad weather."
 
Civic Suggestions
 Occasionally, the ambassador will show up at her office to relate some problem that needs attention, and she takes the suggestions seriously. "He dropped in today to tell me the benches in the park are too close to the trash receptacles," she said, "and the seniors who go to the park are complaining."
The only time Mr. Soetbeer parted from his cart in recent years was in February, absolute low point of the hot dog season in Connecticut. He and his wife, Jane, an executive at Norwalk Hospital, take a short vacation, usually to visit their three children, one of whom lives on Maui.
This summer is different, though. For the first time, he is taking some time off, not to smell the roses but to smell the salt water. He now has a boat, an old 31-foot wooden sloop he has renamed With Relish, and plans to get in some sailing time. But the cart will continue in operation, run by students carefully selected by Mr. Soetbeer. He does not want anyone to think this is an indication he is retiring or even semi-retiring from the hot dog business. When the students go back to school, he goes back to work full time. "This is fun," he said. "I'll do it forever."
A legitimate question is what would have happened if Mr. Soetbeer had not lost his job 13 years ago. With no hesitation he responded, "I'd be a basket case by now."

HEADLINE: Your Home: Salability;
A Slovenly House Is A Turn-Off

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
COOKIE crumbs hang from the upholstery in the family room. The beds have been left unmade. Dirty dishes sit for days in the kitchen sink. The living room carpet is stained and frayed. And underwear is scattered all over an upstairs bedroom.
What's so surprising about all of this? The fact that the home in question may be on the market. Indeed, buyers and brokers complain that an ever-increasing number of homes currently up for sale -- even expensive homes -- are being offered in a condition that is almost an embarrassment. 
 "We were appalled by what we saw," said Ken Hall, a salesman, who recently moved with his wife, Stacey, from Milford, Conn., to Atlanta. "Three out of four houses were in such a messy condition that it felt like a distress sale, even if it wasn't."
Not only was it a turn-off, he said, but it also implied they could knock down the price because the sellers must surely be desperate or downtrodden, or both.
The decline in housekeeping standards nationwide, widely reported in the media earlier this year, is beginning to affect the salability and value of even the best of homes.
Lack of time is a prime culprit, according to Dr. Juliet Schorr, a professor of economics at Harvard University and the author of "The Overworked American," (Basic Books). Subsequent studies on the shrinking amount of hours now being spent on regular housekeeping confirm that assumption.
Another catalyst, say the experts, is a deterioration in the level of acceptable standards that make the unkempt home more acceptable than in June Cleaver's day. Back in the days of "Leave It to Beaver," slovenly housekeeping would have been viewed as a sin. Today, however, cleanliness has ceased to be so close to godliness.
Brokers report that a messy home has become so commonplace and acceptable in our society that even the sellers may not appreciate how unappealing their homes appear to others.
"It's hard to tell people they're slobs," said Jim Whittemore, a partner with Burbank/ Whittemore, a real estate agency in Larchmont, N.Y., who has been selling homes for 18 years.
Susan Spetrini, a broker with the Beazley Company of Hamden, Conn., agreed. "It's easier to say the house needs painting than the house needs cleaning," she said.
And when there's trouble in the family the situation can be grim. "You see the worst conditions when there's a divorce," said Kathy Burke, a broker with Weichert Realtors of Upper Montclair, N.J.
What the sellers overlook, said Mr. Whittemore, is that sloppy housekeeping can become a deterrent for the brokers too.
He said this was one reason why certain homes are not shown as frequently as others offering similar amenities in the same price range. Animal hair on the furniture, he said, is one of the worst offenders.
"If you only have an hour or two with a customer," he explained, "you find yourself automatically excluding the homes you know will be in a mess." Thus, he concludes, "It's the cleanest, neatest houses that tend to make a broker's short list."
Ms. Spetrini, for example, keeps a mental inventory of homes she subconsciously puts on the back burner. They include those where there is the likelihood of finding half-eaten pizza slices on a kitchen table, jelly on the chairs, dirty kitty litter, unflushed toilets, underwear left on the floor, mold in a swimming pool or bathroom.
What can be done? Even before scheduling an "open house" to acquaint brokers in the area with the listing, it might be best to call in a heavy-duty cleaning service. Such a service will have the mechanized equipment to tackle long-neglected jobs like shampooing rugs, polishing the floors and washing walls. These services are listed under "House Cleaning" in the Yellow Pages.
Expect to pay $100 to $400, depending upon the size of the home. It tends to be worthwhile having the windows washed, too, to enhance an atmosphere of light and airiness.
IF feasible, arrange for weekly maid service while the listing is active because it's not going to be easy to keep that home tidy and clean over the long haul. "It is money well spent because you will get so much more for your home and will sell faster," said Mary Ellen Pinkham, author of "Mary Ellen's Clean House" (Crown).
If not, Ms. Pinkham recommends at least creating an "illusion of cleanliness." Among her 10-minute tips: keep boxes around the house that be quickly stuffed with items left out; spray the air with a cleanser; wash, paint or polish the front door ("It's the first thing they notice").
Brighten up a bathroom with a new shower curtain if the existing one is beyond redemption, suggest Martin M. Shenkman and Warren Boroson, co-authors of the 1990 book "How to Sell Your House in a Buyer's Market," (Wiley).
The authors also recommend going through the house, room by room, compiling a checklist of all the items that need attention, even calling in a friend (or the broker) if a more critical eye is required. The exterior and landscaping need equal care, they say.
Among the authors' other suggestions: oiling a squeaky gate or door, stuffing those extra clothes in boxes under the beds and being ruthless about getting rid of excess furniture and other assorted clutter. "Most buyers are looking for space," they note. "Or at least the impression of it."
Bare floors, added Barbara Webski, manager of a Stamford office of William Pitt Real Estate, can look far better than worn or soiled carpeting. "Take up those old carpets," she said.
It may therefore be better to hold the inevitable tag sale prior to placing the home on the market -- not leaving it until a few days before moving out, which is customary.
If drapes are worn, faded or out-of-style they might also be best removed, said Ms. Septrini. Yellowed venetian blinds are also best taken down. Smokers should leave windows open.
"IF nothing else, clean up the bathroom and the kitchen every day," said Don Gurry, a sales associate with the Ridgewood, N.J., office of Coldwell Banker Schlott Realtors. "Clear off those counter tops. Be sure the laundry room is presentable. There's no reason to have things thrown all over the place even if it's in use. Make the beds. Wipe the stove after every meal."
Finally, he warned: "You'd be surprised how many buyers look inside the oven and the closets as well. All this stuff really does have an impact of price."

HEADLINE: Perspectives: Manhattan Office Assessments;
Weaker Shoulders for the Property Tax

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
DON'T talk assessments to Peter S. Duncan. It is true that the building he runs as executive vice president of George Comfort & Sons -- 200 Madison Avenue, at 35th Street -- is down in value from past years.
But what matters to him is that he is in a leasing mode again. The 550,000-square-foot office building is out from limbo after having been purchased by George Comfort and a partner, Loeb Realty and Development Corporation, of Manhattan. It was one of the properties that was forced into receivership when the Government froze the assets of the late President Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines. 
 "We could not be aggressive going after outside tenants during the period of court ownership," said Mr. Duncan, whose company has managed the building since 1976. "Our hands were tied on spending money."
Assessments enter the picture only because New York City has completed its final assessment roll for the 1994 fiscal year, which began July 1. It shows a marked drop in commercial and office property values. There are few sales in the current sluggish market that would demonstrate the slide in actual transactions. The 200 Madison Avenue sale is only a straw in the wind.
But 10 years ago the Philippine investors paid $50 million for their long-term leasehold (another party owns the land). This year the buyers paid $25 million, getting a building that is 83 percent occupied.
The sale serves to underscore the downward trend of values reflected in the assessment roll. The roll itself again calls into question the policies that have let homeowners pay far less than their fair share of property taxes, and lightened the burden on rental property by holding rents below market levels through regulation.
The final assessment for all classes of property turned out to be $79.2 billion, the third year in a row of decline. The 1991 roll (an aberration, in some minds) was a record $91.5 billion.
In the last few years Manhattan office buildings have accounted for about 28 percent of total assessed value. In the latest year the fraction is down to 26 percent. The drop in value has been 20 percent since 1991.
Every $1 billion drop in value of Class 4 property under current tax rates means a loss in revenue of $107 million.
IN the early 80's, when foreign investors were stepping up their interest in real-estate investment in New York, there was talk that office rents in Manhattan might eventually reach $100 a square foot a year. In that environment both city and state government proceeded to place a heavier share of taxes on commercial property. The expectations of rising rents also inflated the prices foreign buyers were willing to pay for office buildings. Assessments of properties that sold were promptly lifted to 45 percent of sale price.
In fact, after exceeding $40 and sometimes even $50 a square foot a year in midtown in the mid-80's, midtown office rents have settled back to the low-$30's and mid-$20's. Downtown rents on the whole are lower.
Rents have apparently stabilized in the last year and a half. Real-estate brokers usually place the low point of activity in the market at the last quarter of 1991. "Just before Labor Day that year there was a depression in real estate," said Vincent Tuminelli, senior financial consultant at Cushman & Wakefield, the brokerage firm. There were only seven midtown transactions of more than 100,000 square feet the entire year, he said.
In 1992 there were 17 midtown transactions over 100,000 square feet. And in the leasing range of 25,000 to 50,000 square feet, midtown activity rose over 100 percent, he said.
Another sign of the leasing pick-up has been the moderation in concession packages given by owners. These are made up of their contribution toward space improvements for the tenant and rent waivers for some of the early months of the lease. Brokers say that free-rent periods have shortened, and the payments for tenant work have declined. Overall, concessions such as contributions to space improvements for tenants, which make effective rents lower than nominal rents, are down about 15 percent from the "depression," Mr. Tuminelli says. On larger leases owners had been paying about $50 a square foot a year toward tenant work.
The decline in the tax base that the weakened market has set in motion is by no means restricted to New York City.
A paper called "The Impact of Declining Property Values on Local Government Finances" was published in March by the Urban Land Institute, a nonprofit education and research institute in Washington. The report found an over-all decline of 21 percent in commercial values for the three years from 1989 to 1992. The impact varies from area to area, but the institute nevertheless said it anticipated a "massive shift in the burden of paying for local government services from the commercial sector to the residential sector."
RELATIVE to commercial values, residential values have held their own. The Urban Land Institute paper predicted that nationally there will be an upward shift in the proportion of the local tax base represented by residential property -- to 72.8 percent from 65 percent.
In New York City as well residential values over all have held up better than commercial values. The final assessment of rentals, co-ops and larger condominiums (Class 2) for fiscal 1994 was $24.4 billion, down $1 billion from a year ago but almost unchanged from the $24.3 billion roll of 1990. Since 1990 commercial assessments have dropped $6.6 billion.
The fraction of market value at which the various classes are to be assessed was frozen in 1981 by state law at the unequal levels that then prevailed. The idea was to preserve the favoritism the New York City system shows to Class 1 property against legal challenge. The favoritism was locked in against a market upturn by limiting annual increases in assessments to 6 percent a year and a maximum of 20 percent over five years.
THE result was that during the period of market-value escalation in the 80's houses paid an ever-lower share of the tax burden. In 1993 they paid 11.2 percent of the total tax levy although they represented 42.7 percent of the market value of the city's taxable property.
During most of the 80's the City Council was also helping homeowners by regularly shifting a fraction of their tax burden onto Class 4 property.
By 1993 commercial property was paying 53 percent of the tax burden though it represented only 31 percent of total market value.
The latest assessment roll is driving home the point that commercial property can no longer be relied on to underpin the tax base. The assessments are based on actual income and expense statements.
SINCE there is a five-year phase-in period for taxes to be based on actual assessments, there is a lag time in which city tax payments do not fully reflect the decline in values. But the gap between billable and actual assessments has all but disappeared as the flat market has persisted. The Manhattan office sector is expected to produce $2.2 billion in tax revenue in the current fiscal year. That is down almost $300 million from 1992.
The city is relying on property taxes as a whole to contribute $7.67 billion toward the expense budget of $31.3 billion approved by the City Council this year. Local taxes of all kinds make up $18 billion of that budget.
As time passes and office leases are renewed at prevailing market rents, Class 4 assessments should continue to decline.
"We believe that as more leases come due there is still a significant decline in value that will be reflected in total assessed values," said Jonathan Adams, chief economist of the Real Estate Board of New York. Without a near-term market turnaround, the decline may be an additional 10 percent, he said.

HEADLINE: Foreclosure Evictions Disputed

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
IMAGINE living quietly in an apartment, faithfully paying your rent and obeying the landlord's rules. Now imagine that the landlord stops making his mortgage payments, and the bank that holds the mortgage forecloses. And suddenly you are evicted so the bank can sell the property unencumbered.
Tenant advocates and some state legislators say that because of a loophole in the state's anti-eviction statute, such a situation is not uncommon. In fact, they say, thousands of tenants have already been evicted while tens of thousands more may face similar fates. 
 "This is a problem of immense proportions," said Assemblyman Raul Garcia, Democrat of Union City.
The loophole, Mr. Garcia said, allows lenders who have taken back properties in foreclosure to avoid the requirements of the state's Eviction for Cause Act. The act prohibits the eviction of tenants without a showing of "good cause," like nonpayment of rent.
But a bill sponsored by Mr. Garcia and now poised for a vote by the Assembly would close the loophole. The bill would amend the Eviction for Cause Act and extend its protection to people living in buildings that lenders take back in foreclosures.
A 1986 amendment to the 1974 act was thought by tenant advocates to have accomplished the same goal, but recent court interpretations of the law have allowed lenders to evict tenants living in buildings they have foreclosed on, even if the tenants are paying their rents.
Banking officials have lobbied against the proposed amendment, saying it will make it difficult for lenders to sell foreclosed properties. And that, they say, could result in lenders' being unwilling to make mortgage loans on rental property.
"What this bill does is make landlords of the lenders, and lenders are not equipped to be landlords," said Edmond V. Lawlor, spokesman for the New Jersey Savings League, a Cranford-based trade organization of 94 savings banks.
The debate comes as lenders, facing a real-estate market weakened by the recession, struggle to sell the thousands of properties they have taken back in foreclosures over the last few years.
"Tenants should not lose their homes because the building's owner did not fulfill his mortgage obligations," Mr. Garcia said. He represents part of Hudson County, where he said banks foreclosed on 246 rental properties last year, resulting in the eviction of more than 1,000 families. "It's horrible to think that innocent people who are faithfully paying their rents are being put out on the street just to make it easier for the banks to sell their buildings," he said.
The impact extends beyond just the people who are evicted, Mr. Garcia said. "Very often, after these people lose their homes, they require public assistance and rent subsidies," he said. "And that ends up costing taxpayers money."
Mr. Garcia said that more than 20,000 foreclosure complaints were filed statewide in 1992. It takes about one year for a foreclosure action to run its course. And while many of those will be resolved without an actual foreclosure, he said, even a single foreclosure can affect scores of residents.
Mr. Lawlor of the Savings League said passage of the bill would make it difficult for lenders to sell buildings they have taken back in foreclosures. "What will happen is they'll wind up getting more and more properties that they won't be able to sell," he said, adding that it is much more difficult to interest prospective buyers in a building that has existing tenants, particularly if the rents they are paying are low.
"If the owner went belly up, the main reason he went belly up is usually because he's not getting the rent," he said. "Why else would an owner default?"
But what about tenants who are paying rent and have done nothing wrong?
"The lender hasn't done anything wrong either," Mr. Lawlor said. "The person who's done something wrong is the owner. But you're punishing the lender by saying, 'You can't sell this building.' "
 
'Catastrophic Results' Feared
Last month, at a hearing of the Assembly Housing Committee, Stu Cameron of the New Jersey Bankers Association said the bill would have "catastrophic results" for both mortgage lenders and for those seeking loans.
If lenders cannot evict tenants from the buildings they foreclose on, he said, "the supposed security of a mortgage loan in New Jersey could become an illusion." As a result, he said, banks would be less willing to make mortgage loans.
The Housing Committee voted unanimously to release the bill, which
awaits posting for a full Assembly vote.
Robert Levy, executive director of the Mortgage Bankers Association of New Jersey in Springfield, agreed with Mr. Cameron's comments. "If New Jersey becomes a state that is known to be anti-lender, you lose a tremendous amount of available mortgage financing," Mr. Levy said. "Lenders have a lot of alternatives for where they can put their money, and they will avoid those areas where they have a concern that they can't recoup their funds in the event of a default."
Mr. Levy emphasized that the banking industry is sensitive to tenants' concerns. "We are very much in favor of consumer rights, and we obviously don't like to see tenants evicted," he said. "But by the same token, if you remove mortgage financing from our state, prospective tenants won't have places to live because the housing won't be built."
 
Couple Face Eviction
 That, however, offers little solace to Seymour and Marion Josephson, a retired couple in West Orange who are fighting to remain in the house they have rented for the last 21 years.
"I'm 70 and my wife is 71, we both have health problems, and we've never missed paying rent to anybody," Mr. Josephson said.
The couple have lived in the house through a succession of owners, but the current owner declared bankruptcy. As a result, Mr. Josephson said, the bank that held the mortgage on the property became the owner.
"The next thing we knew, out of the blue we got an order to vacate within 30 days," Mr. Josephson said. "Just figure how that felt to two elderly people who thought that this was their home."
Mr. Josephson said that he tried to pay rent on the house, but that the bank would not accept any payments. "For a year we put the rent aside," he said, adding that he and his wife continue to live in the house because his lawyer has been able to hold off the eviction.
"We want to stay here," Mr. Josephson said. "This is our home. But they have no interest in that at all. They just want us out."
 
Case Being Appealed
 The Josephsons are represented by Susan Oxford, a lawyer with the State Public Advocate's office. Ms. Oxford said the case was now on appeal before the State Supreme Court.
She said the basis for the appeal is a 1986 amendment to the Eviction for Cause Act that extended the protections afforded by the act to tenants in foreclosed properties. Some courts, however, have ruled that the 1986 amendment did not extend the protection. And that, she said, is why passage of the new bill is important.
"It's really important to have clarification," she said. "And the best way to have it is to have the Legislature say it more explicitly."
Ms. Oxford said the foreclosure exception "defeats the purpose of the act if an innocent tenant who is paying their rent can be uprooted just because the property has changed hands in this manner."
She said the banking industry has offered only "bald assertions" that extending the protection would cause problems for lenders.
 
'It Enhances Their Assets'
 "In fact, it enhances their assets to have tenants producing rents," she said. And if the rents in a particular building are artificially low, she said, local rent-control ordinances all have a "hardship" provision allowing landlords -- including banks that have become landlords through foreclosure -- to raise rents if they can prove a need.
And, Ms. Oxford said, in the case of single-family rental homes like the Josephsons', the existing law allows an owner to evict a tenant if a prospective buyer intends to live in the property.
"If the banks are saying, 'We can't evict them as fast as we'd like to,' well, that's exactly what the Legislature intended," she said.
Joan Pransky, a Montclair lawyer who represents the New Jersey Tenants Organization, agreed. "Those amendments were absolutely intended to bring foreclosures under the anti-eviction statutes," Ms. Pransky said. "I know, because I sat in a room when we hammered out those amendments with the sponsors of the bill."
 
'In Their Economic Interest'
 Ms. Pransky said that increasing numbers of foreclosures and a weak real-estate market have prompted banks to push for an interpretation of the amendment that exempts them from the amended law.
"The banks decided that it was in their economic interest to get rid of the tenants," Ms. Pransky said.
In fact, she said, by being able to evict tenants after a foreclosure, a lender might be able to enhance the value of the property beyond what it was worth to the original landlords.
"If you have a building that's filled with tenants paying $300 a month and can empty out the building and bring in tenants paying $600 a month, then you have a building that's worth more," she said.
In addition, she said, allowing a lender to empty a building completely might make that building more valuable to a prospective buyer hoping to convert the apartments to condominiums. That option, she said, would not have been available to the original owner because of laws that prevent the eviction of tenants during condominium conversions.
"But this is not about the law," Ms. Pransky said. "This is about economics."

HEADLINE: A SENSE OF PLACE

BYLINE: By Glenn Collins

DATELINE: UPPER MONTCLAIR

 BODY:
WHERE there's a town, there's a hardware store, but there is only one Thompson's. Never will there be another. For six decades, Thompson's Hardware has always been "the store that has everything," as its motto boasts. Everything, yes. But now, hour by hour, it's an everything that there's less and less of.
These days, the nondescript little two-story building at Park Street near Watchung Avenue in Upper Montclair is flying red distress flags that scream "Sale." Thompson's is blacking out its windows with red, green and ultrapink signs proclaiming "Retirement Sale" and "Quitting Business." 
 Customers who enter this hushed shrine to the glory of hardware have a worried look, as they scout the inventory for 30-percent discount gems and eye an ever-increasing acreage of shelf space that was last devoid of gadgets during the Great Depression. To those who love the smell and look and swagger of an honest, how-can-we-help-you-sir American hardware store, the very spectacle is a catastrophe.
It's the Dodgers leaving Brooklyn. It's George Steinbrenner thumbing his nose at the Bronx. It's as if a public utility, open seven days a week, has announced the abrogation of its civic franchise.
"A couple of people are pretty angry at us," said William P. Rust, the store's 58-year-old proprietor. "They're really mad. They say, 'How dare you do this to me?' They take it personally."
After Aug. 21, Thompson's liquidation sale will have completed its dastardly work and the store will be no more, unless the garish disaster signs intrigue some brave white knight who has a hardware habit and a determination to carry on.
The foundering of the S.S. Thompson reflects the retail ecology of most towns in New Jersey. Thompson's has been on the market for more than a year now, and there is still no buyer. "They don't want to fight chain stores," Mr. Rust said. "They think there is no future in a quality hardware store that -- well, that has everything."
Mr. Rust is hardly the average hardware guy. A Princeton graduate and Wall Street dropout, he left Smith Barney in Manhattan in the mid-1970's, where he was a first vice president. Before that, from 1956 to 1961, he was an Army pilot -- rated for helicopters and fixed-wings -- and left as a captain when he went into the Reserves.
The store is a celebration of the owner's concept of retailing as an omnium-gatherum. Treasure-bearing stained-oak cabinets line the walls with close to 500 small drawers full of hinges, bolts, screws, nails and assorted stuff. Lurking in secret recesses are those essential replacement items that local homeowners, in their Victorians and Tudors, know have not been machined, cast or extruded in the last five decades.
There are handmade garage-door springs. There are 60-year-old boxes full of Stanley door pivot hinges, crayoned with the original pricing. Bins of nails. Rolls of screening. There are brass corners for steamer trunks, brass door pulls and suitcase catches. A nest of copper staples sits patiently in a John Ruskin cigar box, near dusty one-inch-diameter lag bolts.
Arching above the crowded aisles is the cathedral vault of the original stamped tin ceiling. Dark fan belts of every size swing from above like dangling prosciutto in Zabar's. Thompson's creaky, unvarnished oak floors are oiled once a year; they make the most routine hunt for roofing nails or Teflon tape an auditory experience.
Downstairs, in the inner sanctum of hardware, reside 12-foot-long apple-pickers, long-handled brick-oven bakers' shovels and even hogs' rings. "You know, the rings that go in the noses of hogs," Mr. Rust said. "For some reason we keep selling them, and we don't know who's buying them. Or why."
In a world of highway hardware merchandising, Thompson's is a place where you can buy five tenpenny nails or even find a replacement for a worn crutch tip. Home Depot this definitely is not. Nor a Rickel nor a Channel, nor any of the blister-package palaces.
For small retailers in every town, the agita of marketing these days is that recession-squeezed customers are hot to get the most for their dollar. And they're willing to forgo service to get it. Just try shouting up a clerk next time you head over to Megahardware-by-the-Highway.
For the big-ticket buy, customers are increasingly outta town. When Home Depot opened a few years ago in Clifton, the town next door, "the head count in our store was the same, and so was the number of transactions," said Mr. Rust, whose computerized inventory system tracks every purchase. "But the dollars per transaction were down. People thought they could get a better price on the $400 charcoal grill and the $300 rotary mower out on the highway."
Paradoxically, though, the mass merchandisers are experts on variable pricing; dozens of items are featured at prices that are actually below Mr. Rust's costs. "Yet much of our own inventory is priced lower than in the stores on the highway," he said. "But somehow people don't notice that."
He sighed. "Here's what's going to happen when the recession is over," said Mr. Rust, holding forth in his air-conditioned office. "Local folks will realize they're tired of the inconvenience and hassle of going to the highway to buy things. They'll come back to town for service. And when they do, all their favorite stores will have disappeared. Ultimately that will affect the tenor and tone of the community. And that will affect property values."
The mall stores are even invading Montclair, which now has a Gap and a Talbots. "But I don't think that's hurting the local merchants," Mr. Rust said. "It's helping them. The big names attract shoppers from out of town."
A tall, tan, solid man clothed in a plaid shirt and an aura of implacable calm, Mr. Rust studies the world with some bemusement behind his wire rims, a decidely low-key philosopher of merchandising. He has the look of a friendly banker, if only bankers were given to deliver long, thoughtful lectures on how to rewire your Tiffany lamps.
The store was built in 1930, Mr. Rust said, by one A. Thompson, a contractor who wanted to supplement his building business with retail sales. Mr. Rust kept the name.
"It wouldn't make any sense to change it in a town where everyone says, 'I'm going over to Thompson's,' " Mr. Rust said. "Also, the name Rust wouldn't be too great on a hardware store."
Originally, a dentist and a real-estate office occupied the second floor; now Mr. Rust has turned the 12,000-square-foot space into Thompson Executive Services, a suite of six rental offices with an office manager and two secretaries. They minister to tenants ranging from lawyers to the headquarters staff of the American Platform Tennis Association.
Also operating out of Thompson's is Mr. Rust's flag and customized banner business, which he began pretty much by accident in 1986 and which now brings in nearly $500,000 in revenue a year. Mr. Rust intends to keep the office business and the flag merchandising going, but he wants to sell the building and the hardware store with it.
The profitable Thompson's isn't closing its doors for lack of customers; Mr. Rust is tired of giving seven-day attention to the store. He wants to focus on building his flag business. He hopes to play more golf, more tennis. There is much more flying to do.
It is a labor-intensive endeavor, this local hardware business. "Our goal is to encounter everyone who comes into the store with a 'how can I help you?' " Mr. Rust said. "Whether it's a request for a 19-cent washer or a $190 lawnmower, we try to give the same service to all."
The three full-time clerks at Thompson's and their part-time helpers have become adept at sign language. "The hands start going as soon as people try to describe whatever it is they need," Mr. Rust said. "They'll say, 'It's the thing that goes up like this and it's shaped like that.' "
Mr. Rust has always been a hopeless hardware junkie; that's one of the reasons he bought the store in 1985, after six years as a developer and contractor converting deteriorating buildings into gleaming medical condominiums and rehabilitated apartment residences. "I was in Thompson's two or three times a day, at least," he said. "When the previous owner asked me if I'd like to buy, it wasn't exactly a surprise. I satisfied a dream, buying in."
After a year of trying to sell the store and the building in a season of lingering economic stagnation, there are no takers. "People are so concerned about the mass marketers, they're intimidated," he said. "But I'm convinced that a young couple could come in and make a lot of money if they think creatively."
He always has. Just notice where the copying machine is. And the United Parcel Service weighing station. They're at the back of the store, so customers have to navigate aisle after aisle just to get to them.
In fact, you might as well pick up some batteries and a light bulb on the way to get that 15-cent Xerox copy. And don't you need some duct tape? You have until Aug. 21 to buy it.

HEADLINE: Baby Boomer Blues

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a member of the post-baby boomer generation now struggling in the workplace and also coming to the realization that a declining living standard is to be expected, I have little empathy with the plight of the baby boomers. 
 They have nothing to complain about; they experienced an America of abundance after World War II, and expected such wealth to continue despite their malaise and snide rejection of their parents' values. Now that opportunities are harder to come by and job security is less assured, these baby boomers should look at themselves as mostly to blame. After enjoying affluent childhoods in the 1950's, they grew up to reject those values in the protest movements of the 60's and the profligacy of the 70's and 80's.
If, as Robin Toner says in reviewing Katherine S. Newman's "Declining Fortunes: The Withering of the American Dream" (June 20), baby boomers are now bemoaning their inability to compete with their parents' opportunities, then maybe they should have striven to match their parents' achievements with equally impressive ones of their own. Indeed, the baby boomer generation should be singled out more for its inherent selfishness and social irresponsibility than for its economic difficulties.
Ms. Toner is correct: Ms. Newman does give a far more sympathetic portrayal of the baby boomers than they usually get. Unfortunately, it is also a portrayal far more sympathetic than they deserve.

HEADLINE: When Robert Rubin Talks . . .

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Three days before President Clinton introduced his economic plan, his economic inner circle huddled for a debate: Should we settle for cutting the deficit by less than our goal of $140 billion in 1997 to avoid more politically unpopular spending cuts?
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and George Stephanopoulos, the White House spokesman, argued that it wouldn't be so bad to fall short. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and Leon Panetta, the Budget Director, pressed for sticking with the goal. Then Robert E. Rubin, the Administration's point man on economic policy as director of the new National Economic Council, threw his weight behind the bigger cuts. 
"What we do here will send a signal of how serious we are about fighting the deficit," Mr. Rubin said at the meeting. "We've set this goal, and it's important to stick with it to remain credible with the financial markets."
The President stuck with $140 billion.
When Bob Rubin left his position as co-chairman of Wall Street's most prestigious investment banking firm, Goldman Sachs, to coordinate economic policy for the President, it was widely thought that he would serve as the quintessential "honest broker," directing traffic while others made the recommendations. In fact, the 54-year-old Mr. Rubin is quietly playing a major role in shaping policy, and in the process putting a subtle pro-business stamp on Administration policies.
Whether he is campaigning against cutting off China's preferred trading status or pushing for health-care-reform options that would cost employers less, Mr. Rubin is reminding those around him that paying attention to business is a key to getting the American economy back on track -- Mr. Clinton's No. 1 campaign pledge.
In recent days, he has also pressed for relaxing the alternative minimum tax that squeezes heavy industry. And in the trade talks in Tokyo two weeks ago, he played the role of tough cop in pressing Japan to do more to reduce its trade surplus.
 
Business Is Skeptical
 Within weeks of coming to Washington, Mr. Rubin established himself as a major player. He briefs the President several times a week, offering his own counsel as well as funneling policy advice to the President from Secretary Bentsen, Ms. Tyson and others.
"What the President values in Bob is experience, honest, dispassionate analysis, the ability to weigh arguments and broker them in an honest way, and a deep but practical understanding of how the economy works," said Mr. Stephanopoulos, a senior adviser to the President.
Interviews with more than a dozen Administration officials suggest that Mr. Rubin gets high marks for shepherding many new economic policies from brainstorming session to concrete proposal, all the while soothing delicate egos and preventing Cabinet secretaries from rampaging.
If there has been a failure, it is that Congress and the American people have not embraced the embattled budget package and the already defeated stimulus plan, which were forged by the National Economic Council. Secretary Bentsen, Ms. Tyson and Mr. Rubin attribute these problems to poor communications and Republicans out to score political points.
Despite Mr. Rubin's pro-business bent, many business people do not see him as their champion, and criticize the policies he and the President are embracing.
Some executives ask why Mr. Rubin, long lionized as one of the shrewdest executives on Wall Street, is shilling for Bill Clinton, a man they see as hopelessly liberal and disorganized. Why, many ask, is Mr. Rubin, who earned more than $15 million in 1991 and has a net worth estimated at more than $50 million, defending an economic plan they see as long on tax increases and short on spending cuts?
If anything has surprised Mr. Rubin since joining the Administration, it is the avalanche of criticism, especially from the business community. In interviews in his modest West Wing office, a room largely devoid of decorations and mementos, he asserted that business badly misunderstands what he -- and President Clinton -- are about.
"Some business people seem to think the President hasn't made one dollar in spending cuts," said Mr. Rubin, a self-effacing man with sad eyes and a soft, often-tired voice. "When you're outside the process, it's much easier to advocate that certain things be done, like a lot more spending cuts, than when you're inside, and see the political realities. Spending cuts make up half of the President's $500 billion in deficit reduction."
 
The Day He Growled
 At one speech to the Business Roundtable, Mr. Rubin lost his cool after executives complained about energy taxes and higher corporate taxes and attacked the President for not having courage to make serious spending cuts.
"President Clinton has made a vast number of courageous decisions about spending cuts that Presidents haven't wanted to deal with in the past 12 years," he told the group. "That's a testament to political courage."
Several weeks later, in a reflective mood in his office, he said: "For years, business people have told me that the Government has to address two big problems: the budget deficit and underinvestment. The President is doing what most business executives said should be done. Many executives have attached much higher weight to the specific things they object to than to the larger good of what he's doing."
On Wall Street, Mr. Rubin was long a prominent member of a rare species: the unabashed Democrat. He said his Democratic genes come from his grandfather, who was the No. 2 man in a machine-style Brooklyn political club.
He describes himself as a centrist, although his conversation makes clear that he is moderate to conservative on economic issues, and liberal on social and urban issues.
"If I were to stick a label on Bob, I'd call him pragmatic," said Stephen Friedman, Goldman Sachs's chairman and formerly co-chairman with Mr. Rubin. "His approach is: 'What are the problems and the opportunities and how do we achieve what we want to achieve?' "
He might also be described as a pro-growth Democrat. Carefully measuring each word, he said: "I believe very strongly that the country has to have a vibrant economy, because if you have that, then you can do a lot of things, including many social programs. But if all you focus on is redistributing the pie, you end up with a smaller pie -- and tremendous social tensions. You have to find some balance between growing the pie and helping those most in need."
 
An Affinity for Clinton
 Mr. Rubin enlisted in the Clinton camp several months after he co-hosted a small dinner for Mr. Clinton in 1991. Hearing the Arkansas Governor talk about the need to cut the deficit, increase investment, make the cities bloom again and improve job training and infrastructure, Mr. Rubin said, he came away astonished at how "congruent" Mr. Clinton's thinking was with his own.
That still seems to be the case. Mr. Rubin sees eye to eye with the President on the importance of attacking two deficits at once: the budget deficit and the investment deficit. When Congress passed tough caps on spending that forced Mr. Clinton to scale back his ambitious investment plans, it was Mr. Rubin who played field marshal to preserve as many investments in training, new technologies, the Head Start program and infrastructure as possible.
"He as much as anyone helped maintain the economic plan's pro-investment orientation," said Gene Sperling, one of Mr. Rubin's two deputies and the economic-issues coordinator for the Clinton campaign.
Mr. Rubin sees no instant fixes for the nation's economy. In his view, Mr. Clinton's plan is the best long-term medicine for the economy, combining deficit reduction with incentives for private investment as well as government investment in training, infrastructure and new technologies. He is worried, however, that in a nation eager for short-term results, Americans will grow impatient if there is no payoff soon.
 
The Crossroads

 "I believe we are at a historical crossroads," he said. "Until Bill Clinton came along, I felt there was a high probability that the United States would continue on a trail in which we underperformed the rest of the industrialized world."
With the earnestness of an Eagle Scout, he added, "If we can accomplish a substantial part of the things we hope to do, I think it will have a historic impact on putting the economy back on the right track."
Increasingly in recent weeks, Mr. Rubin has flexed his muscles by saying what he thinks, often asserting that what's best for the economy is usually the best politics.
At a meeting in May, he teamed up with Ms. Tyson to challenge health-care advisers who were pushing the President to embrace a generous basic health-care plan for all Americans. Mr. Rubin favors a more modest plan because it would mean smaller tax increases and less upset for business. He also thinks a modest plan would be more conducive to economic growth.
Last spring, he campaigned against stripping away China's preferred trading status over human-rights violations. He argued that American businesses need to build their presence in China now because that country might someday have the world's largest economy.
That view largely prevailed: the President extended China's "most favored nation" trading status for a year, although he based any additional extension on human-rights improvements.
Or take the July 12 meeting of the Administration's Reconciliation Committee -- a group of senior economic, political and communications people whose goal is to get the President's package through Congress.
There Mr. Rubin went to bat for slashing the alternative minimum tax -- a levy placed on companies when their income, by standard measures, is too low to pay the normal corporate income tax. He argued that this tax, which involves stingier depreciation provisions, undermined the President's hopes of promoting investment because it punishes industries, like paper and airlines, that invest heavily in equipment.
Mr. Rubin argued that the group should support the House version, which called for bigger reductions in alternative-minimum-tax revenues than the Senate version, saying this would demonstrate that the President recognizes business's needs.
 
Noblesse Oblige
 In at least one area, Mr. Rubin and the President part. It is Mr. Clinton's "soak the rich" rhetoric. "Bob very much believes that those who are well off should pay the most in taxes," said Mr. Sperling, his deputy. "But in his view, the message should be a noble calling, rather than a populist slam."
That sense of noblesse oblige is often evident in Mr. Rubin, a thin man whose suits always seem rumpled and whose shirt is often out. This financial aristocrat has made his mint and, corny as it may sound, he now wants to help turn the nation around.
No one ever said Bob Rubin's new job would be easy. When he was asked to set up the economic council, and superimpose it on an existing bureaucracy, it was as if he were being asked to land an alien spacecraft atop the White House without shattering the fine china.
Essentially, the council's role is to put together information and policy recommendations from different departments involved in economic issues and prepare memos to help the President make a decision. He often assembles officials from half a dozen agencies to discuss policy. In some previous Administrations, there was no formal process for channeling economic ideas to the President, and in the Bush Administration, Richard Darman, the Budget Director, took charge of developing economic policy mainly through force of personality.
So far, Mr. Rubin has tiptoed through the forest of big egos without making enemies. "If a different personality, a Brzezinski or a Kissinger, had this job, it wouldn't work," said Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman. Agencies like the Office of Management and Budget and the Treasury "would block it from working," Mr. Altman said. "They'd try to take back control of recommendations to the President."
 
A Dearth of Ego
 The secret of Mr. Rubin's success, Administration officials say, is that he is a good listener, makes sure everyone is heard and has a small ego. One White House official said Mr. Rubin has the smallest ratio of ego to accomplishment of anyone he has ever met.
"He's exceedingly well equipped for this job," said Robert Strauss, the former Democratic Party chairman. "He has no ego."
This is not to say that Mr. Rubin walks on water, although the criticisms one hears tend toward the gentle. He is known for running meetings with Prussian efficiency, but one complaint is that he sometimes lets discussion drag on for too many weeks before pushing the President to make a decision.
In addition, Mr. Rubin doesn't have the decades of policy background of, say, a Henry Kissinger. He tries to compensate through judgment, hard work and asking thousands of questions. He can often be seen lugging accordion folders stuffed with files, and many nights he takes them back to his suite at the Jefferson Hotel, his Washington residence.
"I've never seen him work so hard," said Kenneth Brody, a former Goldman Sachs partner who is chairman of the Export-Import Bank. "He's never worked like this before."

 
 
THE ROOTS OF ROBERT RUBIN

AT the end of his long days, Robert E. Rubin sometimes seems to miss Goldman Sachs. Talking about his life in Washington, he said: "It's very wearing. It's very job-focused, but at least it's multidimensional because you get involved in so many issues."
Life in New York was "broader," he said, because it wasn't totally focused on work. He spends much more of his time in his office nowadays than he did at Goldman Sachs, where he often traveled.
Mr. Rubin said "the single biggest upside" of his current job is the "quality of the people and the interaction with them," adding that they are "in the same category of exceedingly capable and effective people you find at the top of any profession."
Twenty-eight years at Goldman Sachs was good preparation for his job, he said, because that firm was managed through discussion and consensus: "It was much closer to my experience here than life in a typical corporate hierarchy would be."
Mr. Rubin was born in New York City in 1938 and grew up in Miami Beach, the son of a lawyer. He was graduated from Harvard College (summa cum laude in economics), then spent three days at Harvard Law School before dropping out to see the world. He later studied at the London School of Economics and was graduated from Yale Law School. After Yale, he spent two years at the New York law firm Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton.
He joined Goldman as a trader in 1966, and became a young star in risk arbitrage -- speculating on the stocks of companies subject to takeover attempts. He later ran the firm's stock and bond trading departments, and revived its commodities subsidiary. He became co-chairman in 1990.
He and his wife, Judy, who is New York City's chief of protocol, keep an apartment on Park Avenue and a weekend home in Pound Ridge, N.Y., a suburb north of the city. They have two sons, both in their 20's.
Might he return to Goldman Sachs after his White House job? "I've said to myself it's very unlikely I'd go back into the commercial world," he said. He wouldn't elaborate.

HEADLINE: In Mississippi, Riverboat Gambling Rides Rougher Waters

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
MOST folks think of saturation on the Mississippi River these days in terms of the Midwestern floods. But for investors in gambling stocks, it is more likely to refer to the overflow of riverboat casinos in the state of Mississippi.
Companies with riverboat casinos in Mississippi, such as Grand Casinos and Casino Magic, have been among the biggest winners in the market this year, with investors speculating that the hunt by states for new tax dollars will lead many to license casinos. 
 And that is why the stock of Casino Magic, for instance, more than quadrupled this year, closing Friday at $18.25. The company opened its first casino in Mississippi last fall. The company reported first-quarter income of $13.5 million, or 45 cents a share, on revenue of $38.7 million, a profit margin that would make any investor drool.
Of course, by the market's logic, when growth starts to slow, investors should get spooked. That's why the recent monthly revenue numbers from the state and the city of Biloxi, Miss., where most of the riverboat casinos are located, are an investor's equivalent to a Stephen King novel.
The new state and local figures give the first indication that the results could be disappointing. For Biloxi, the gaming revenues climbed an anemic $154,382 in June over May, according to figures from the city's controller's office. But even that was some $850,000 less than April's take.
Even with the gross numbers headed back up, the June report is bad news for investors. Why? Because, as in any bubble market, the growth of casinos continued long after demand was met. In June, the number of slot machines in Biloxi increased by more than 50 percent, growing to 3,500 slots, from about 2,300, according to figures from industry experts and Wall Street analysts.
In other words, revenues are at best flat even as capacity has continued to boom. With more mouths around to divide up the pie, everybody will get a smaller piece. So investors could be seeing the earnings growth in the Biloxi casinos start to stabilize, or even fall.
THINGS are not much better statewide. According to numbers put together by the Mississippi state tax commission, gaming revenue grew by less than $3 million in June from May, to about $61.4 million. But over that time, casino capacity climbed significantly, with the number of slot machines in operation hitting more than 8,000 at the end of June, up from about 6,850 in May.
Air started seeping out of the casino stock bubble last month, with the relatively insignificant news that Casino Magic was shutting its Biloxi operation for two days to allow for an audit. Suddenly, investors who days before could not scoop up enough casino shares started dumping them.
All of the Mississippi riverboat stocks were hit hard. Casino Magic, which had been trading as high as $28 a share in May, dropped to as low as about $20. Grand Casinos, whose shares had traded as high as the $50 range, plummeted in a few trading sessions into the $40 range. President Riverboat Casinos, which had flirted with the $50 range, also fell.
After a couple of weeks of volatile movement, the stocks have been holding relatively stable, as investors await second-quarter results. On Friday, Casino Magic closed at $18.25, Grand Casinos closed at $31.125 and President, at $31.875.
Each of those companies has a different exposure to the vagaries of the Mississippi marketplace. While Grand Casinos has significant operations in the state, its vulnerability to a Mississippi downturn is limited by its other operations, including on Indian reservations. President and Casino Magic both have only one casino each outside the state.
WHILE those three casinos are perhaps the best known in Mississippi, many others, including a number of private operators, have or are planning to set up shop there. In Biloxi alone, one city official said, as many as 30 companies have applied for gambling licenses and at least two are in the initial phases of development. All that means, of course, is even more competition down the line.
Some investors might think the slowdown has something to do with the Mississippi floods. But the damage is not even in the state, and most casinos have announced the catastrophe had no effect on their business.
Of course, the figures do not take into account the fact that every machine was not in operation throughout the entire month. But even when that factor is figured into the equation, the results are ugly.
For example, when the number of slots available in Biloxi on each day of the month are added up for May, there were some 73,000 slot days. That would give the casinos revenue of about $267 per slot day. In June, there were 90,000 slot days available, meaning revenue per slot day dropped to only about $218.
The same holds true for the whole state, where the number of slot days was more than 225,000, compared with about 176,000 in the previous month. That means the total revenue per slot day dropped from about $332 in May, to about $272 in June.
This just foreshadows a consolidation in which some of these players fold, while others rake in more of the pot. Which companies will end up being which is anybody's bet.

HEADLINE: Profile: Anne K. Bingaman;
Rousing Antitrust Law from Its 12-Year Nap

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

 BODY:
"COULDN'T you publish in September?" says Anne K. Bingaman as she greets a reporter in her new office on the third floor of the Justice Department. "By then things are really going to be happening."
Barely a month in office as the nation's top antitrust cop, Ms. Bingaman has already begun to turn on the lights in an area of law enforcement left in the dark for much of the last 12 laissez-faire years. With her background as a plaintiff's lawyer added to the Administration's expressed commitment to more aggressive enforcement, 1993 could well mark the beginning of a new era in antitrust law -- an era that will find it in a prominent role in international trade policy and the domestic economy. 
 "She's going to bring a more activist approach, there's no question of that," said Robert Pitofsky, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center, who was considered for the antitrust position and who advised the Administration during the transition. "Closer calls are going to be decided in favor of action rather than inaction," distinguishing her era from the Reagan years.
The new assistant Attorney General in charge of the antitrust division, who is 50, brings a solid background litigating big cases on behalf of consumers who say they have been forced to pay unreasonable prices and companies victimized by cartels.
Before she came to Washington, Ms. Bingaman's main political interest had been the adoption of laws to protect women's rights, and she notes that she wrote one of the only books about the Equal Rights Amendment.
Her other political cause has been her husband, who is in his second term as a Democratic Senator from New Mexico. Jeff Bingaman is known in Washington as a taciturn and thoughtful politician, a master of detail not known for colorful oratory. While his colleagues may spend many an afternoon brokering deals and attending to the needs of constituents, Mr. Bingaman will often walk the two blocks from his office to the Supreme Court, where he will find a secluded corner of the library to sit and think.
His wife, by contrast, works a room as well as the most seasoned of pols. She has raised millions of dollars for his campaigns, played host at his parties, and is as well known as he is to lawmakers and lobbyists.
"She's sort of supercharged in a positive way; she's a walking series of anecdotes, the kind of person who would slap you on the back," says her old law partner Stuart E. Eizenstat, the former Carter aide just appointed ambassador to the European Community. "You sometimes think she's the politician and Jeff's the lawyer."
Jack H. Friedenthal, a friend of the Bingamans since he taught her at Stanford Law School more than 20 years ago, agrees.
"She's encouraging and enthusiastic and knows how to make people feel good about themselves," said Professor Friedenthal, who is now the dean at the George Washington University National Law Center. The drop in law enforcement "has accompanied a general depression in the antitrust division. She will invigorate that office."
Her political connections, though, at first made some officials skeptical. "When I first heard that the White House was pushing Anne Bingaman, I said, 'Hmmm. Now the White House is pushing a senator's wife on me,' " recalled Attorney General Janet Reno. But Ms. Reno said she called around to some mutual friends, who solidly endorsed the appointment, and in a matter of weeks Ms. Bingaman has become a trusted adviser in an area of law in which the former Florida prosecutor has had virtually no experience. "What she has done in her brief time here is exciting," Ms. Reno says.
THE resumes of Anne Kovacovich Bingaman and Hillary Rodham Clinton look remarkably similar. Both met their future husbands at law school. Both had flourishing law practices as their husbands moved up in state politics. And both have been actively involved in women's and children's causes; they met three years ago working for the Children's Defense Fund.
Ms. Bingaman was born in the mining town of Jerome, Ariz., and grew up in Phoenix, the daughter of a grocer, who, like everyone else in his family, never went to college. There were no professional sports teams within hundreds of miles, so the family passion was talking politics. She decided to become a lawyer, she recalled, because her childhood hero, Adlai Stevenson, was a lawyer.
"Honest to God, I was 9 years old when he lost and cried for three days," she said. "I didn't know what a lawyer even did, but I knew Adlai Stevenson was a lawyer so I wanted to be a lawyer."
After graduating from Stanford, she went to its law school, where she studied antitrust law with William Baxter, the intellectual father of the Reagan Administration's antitrust policy and head of the department during its first three years. After she and Jeff Bingaman graduated, they married and moved back to his home state of New Mexico. They have one son, who is now 13.
When Jeff Bingaman became state Attorney General, she got a job teaching at the University of New Mexico School of Law in Albuquerque after the dean said the school badly needed a woman professor.
SHE led a coalition that successfully pushed for the adoption of New Mexico's Equal Rights Amendment and won an effort to open the New Mexico Military Institute to female cadets. She also served as general counsel to Planned Parenthood, lobbying to ease abortion restrictions.
In 1975, she became involved in a huge and complex lawsuit that was to become well known in antitrust circles. As a lawyer in private practice, she represented a uranium processing company, the United Nuclear Corporation, that alleged the existence of an international uranium cartel. After the defendants failed to produce witnesses and documents that were hidden abroad, a Federal judge entered a judgment in favor of Ms. Bingaman's clients that was valued at the time at about $1 billion.
She has also worked to defend companies against antitrust accusations. In one case, she settled claims against the Supron Energy Company, which was one of several gas companies sued in a class action by residential consumers and the State of New Mexico for alleged price fixing.
Ms. Bingaman began her tenure at the Justice Department by drafting a law to make it easier to bring antitrust cases, particularly against cartels that involve foreign companies and their American counterparts. Officials say she will be leading an effort to sign agreements with the European Community and other countries to make it easier to challenge cross-border transactions. Similar international agreements were used successfully by securities prosecutors to crack large and complex securities-fraud and insider-trading schemes throughout the last decade.
She also vows tougher scrutiny of proposed mergers and better coordination of prosecuting efforts both among Federal agencies and with the states. To husband the division's shrinking resources, she expects to return to the states many nickel-and-dime price-fixing investigations left from the Republicans.
But while the path of antitrust enforcement is changing, it is hard to say just where it is heading. Although Ms. Bingaman has been urged to bring new life to the department, there are some calls for restraint.
There are urgent cries for antitrust exemptions from military companies, which have seen their orders dry up along with the cold war. Executives and policymakers involved in health care say they need to be free of vigorous antitrust enforcement to consolidate the industry and bring down prices. And high-technology companies say they must be allowed to collaborate in research and development to take on foreign rivals.
"She will be under enormous pressure to hold off on enforcement domestically to save jobs, and might be under pressure to enforce antitrust laws against foreigners to save jobs," said Eleanor Fox, an antitrust scholar at New York University School of Law.
Ms. Bingaman has given little hint of her views on the exemptions, other than to say the law generally frowns on exceptions.
"Any exemption to the antitrust laws is unusual," she said during her Senate confirmation hearing in a way that disclosed little of her thinking but seemed to please the panel. "The antitrust laws are very general. Exemptions are not common, and generally the proponents of exemptions bear a heavy burden in justifying their special status."
She also faces a new round of budget cuts. The Administration's proposed budget recommends that an already bare-bones operation be cut by an additional 2 percent, to 635 employees. It now has 310 lawyers in Washington, compared with 411 in 1980.
But she insists the smaller staff will not mean any cuts in the number of lawyers and will not prevent the reemergence of the antitrust division. "We're going to have to do more with less," she said.
 
 
 
A BACKLOG OF LAISSEZ FAIRE
 ANNE BINGAMAN's antitrust approach is likely to mark a sharp departure from the last 12 years. Republican Administrations, putting unquestioned faith in the marketplace, all but abandoned whole areas of antitrust law, cutting the division's resources in half to devote more Federal money and prosecutors to routine drug cases and street crime. Critics said Ronald Reagan did not have to try to repeal antitrust laws because they were simply ignored.
Huge mergers involving rivals in steel and chemicals, oil and airlines, all breezed through unchallenged. The regulators sat on the sidelines as more than $1 trillion in assets changed hands in more than 31,000 deals.
All told, the merger boom meant there were about six times as many corporate combinations each year as in the late 1970's, but the frenzied activity could barely be heard in the halls of the Justice Department. Restraint-of-trade cases fell from 225 in 1979 to 77 in 1991, monopoly investigations from 20 to 5, and merger investigations from 152 to 82. About the only thing the department did was go after price-fixing conspiracies, usually in the electrical and highway construction industries.
"Too much effort has been put on small criminal cases and not enough on larger-concentration issues," Ms. Bingaman said on the day she was appointed. She said the staff reduction and the failure to pursue mergers vigorously was "just appalling."

Virtually unnoticed in last week's preliminary report of the National Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive Airline Industry was a recommendation that "when jet fuel prices rise more than 10 percent in any 12-month period, then the U.S. Government shall release crude oil from the [Strategic Petroleum] Reserve to the extent necessary to reduce such prices to the level of a 5 percent increase, provided that such action is not inimical to the national defense or security." 
 Given the historic volatility of oil prices, such a trigger would be reached virtually every year. But that is not the point. Were no lessons learned from the experience of the 1960's, when the Government intervened to support domestic oil prices, and the 1970's, when efforts to hold down oil prices saved consumers little but enriched those who evaded the controls?
Of course, no one asked this commission to worry about the health of the nation. Just that of a bunch of overleveraged airlines, many with inflated expenses, that have reacted to a continued weak economy by cutting fares. The commission recommendations that actually may get accepted involve cutting taxes on the airlines, as if such taxes were the real problem.
In fact, as is often the case by the time the Government lumbers into action, there are indications that the airline crisis, if that is what it is, is passing. The leveraged cripples, with the exception of Northwest, have passed through bankruptcy reorganization or disappeared. Stock prices are rising, fare wars are less severe and the airline unions are discussing concessions.
Wall Street even smiled when the unions demanded majority ownership of airlines in return for allowing the carriers to pay market wages. Shareholders would "end up owning a smaller part of a better company," said Rose Ann Tortora, the airline analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
Another factor helping airline shares is that oil prices, far from threatening to rise out of control, are tumbling. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will hold an emergency meeting this week to try to cut production, but, as Bear Stearns oil watcher Fred Leuffer notes, there is scant indication they can reach agreement. Iraq is so desperate for cash that it may actually comply with United Nations requirements to be allowed to sell some oil. And weak European economies are buying less oil than anyone forecast. The futures market price for crude oil to be delivered in September has fallen below $18 a barrel.
Oil prices will rise someday, pushing air fares up and airline profits down. Does the commission really believe that should trigger automatic Government intervention? Or is this recommendation just another case of special interest pleading that, in Washington, seems so natural as to pass almost unnoticed?

Divining the Market With the Advance-Decline Line

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
THE advance-decline line is one of the most watched technical indicators of the stock market, and lately some analysts have said it is sending a positive signal. The line, which records the cumulative number of stocks advancing on the New York Stock Exchange, less the number declining, rose to a new high for the current bull market early this month, breaking out of a narrow range that had lasted several months. 
 But that rise has come about largely because many nonstocks traded on the Big Board, ranging from preferred stocks to closed-end bond funds, have risen as interest rates have declined. Paul Desmond, the president of Lowry's Reports Inc., a technical advisory service in North Palm Beach, Fla., notes that the advance-decline line calculated from the stocks of operating companies only hit its 1993 high in March. He notes that the advance-decline lines for Nasdaq and American Stock Exchange issues are also weak. "That kind of deterioration has often led to at least an intermediate market decline," he said.

HEADLINE: Health Care's 'Gang of Five'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Leonard Orland ("Health Reform Runs Antitrust Risk," Viewpoints, July 11) clearly cautions all of us about the importance of antitrust laws. The economic incentives that allowed the "Gang of Five" large national insurance companies -- Aetna, Cigna, Metropolitan Life, Prudential and Travelers -- to gain wealth and power during the last 30 years are precisely those that have placed many of our citizens at unacceptable financial risk when seeking health care today. 
 When health care costs were 3 percent of wages or less, individuals and businesses did not pay attention to the way benefits were designed or paid for by insurance companies. Health insurance traditionally consisted of two parts: the retention and the cost of claims. The retention, in insurance language, is the amount needed to administer the program and to provide profit. The claims are the amounts paid out in benefits.
The retention, for the most part, has been based on the amount of claims paid. If the retention is 10 percent of paid claims, and paid claims increase, the insurer collects more money and makes more profit. The clear incentive of the Gang of Five and others, then, was to write policies that would stimulate employers and patients to spend more.
Think back to when insurance programs insisted that the patient go to the hospital to receive benefits for simple tests like upper GI series, barium enemas and gall bladder X-rays. The hospital, insurers and doctors all benefited. The percentage of wages spent on health care increased. The insurers made more money.
The Gang of Five paid doctors so generously that it was common for physicians to accept whatever they were offered, frequently forgoing co-insurance or deductibles because the payment schedules were so rich. Physicians were not told what fees would be paid. They were told only to keep billing until the fees hit the top. Then the insurer would revise fees upward to "keep pace with inflation." The percentage of wages devoted to health care continued to grow.
Certain large employers began to balk, asking for preferential treatment. The insurers saw one more opportunity -- they would move from community rating to experience rating of premiums. This meant breaking up the large insurance pools. Bigger employers would pay less, smaller employers would pay more. Eventually, everyone would pay their own actual cost and the insurer would avoid all risk. The insurance companies became very expensive administrators and cash managers, no longer willing or able to provide insurance.
H.M.O.'s then came along, skimmed the healthier employees, and shifted the real cost of health care to the sicker patients who remained in the now-fragmented traditional "insurance" programs, making costs rise for everyone.
President Clinton and his advisers now seek to reward these thieves by turning over to them the management of our health. What a terrible proposal! It could permit the Gang of Five to seal the tragic demise of the finest health system in the world in only 30 short years.

Taxing and Spending

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Thrashing out a Congressional compromise on President Clinton's five-year, $500 billion package of tax increases and spending cuts, a job that only recently seemed impossible, now looks to be merely Herculean. After the requisite threat displays, House and Senate Democrats moved behind doors last week and made surprising progress toward resolving the $60 billion difference between their separate versions of the economic package. By week's end, about half that gap had been made up, and what once seemed the single prickliest issue on the agenda -- the size of a proposed energy tax -- seemed almost a done deal.
The biggest remaining task is making peace between party conservatives who want more spending cuts and liberals who want more spending, period. So far, House and Senate bargainers have sidestepped that dispute, making speedy progress by splitting the difference on a handful of simple, but big-money, tax items. 
 The energy tax is one. The House once envisioned a broad energy levy that would net $72 billion through 1998; the Senate backs a 4.3-cent-a-gallon, $24 billion gasoline tax. By week's end, the House had scaled back its ambitions to a 9 cent-a-gallon gas tax, and an agreement to meet halfway seemed imminent.
But on spending for Federal benefits to the poor and elderly, an area dear to Mr. Clinton and House liberals, compromise is not so easy. The Senate wants to spend $30 billion less through 1998 on key programs -- $9 billion less for Medicare, $7 billion less for food stamps, some $9 billion less for an expanded tax credit for the working poor. Additionally, Mr. Clinton and the House want to spend $5.3 billion on "empowerment zones," a stew of tax breaks and credits for businesses that move to the inner city. The Senate bill omits the idea.
House and Senate bargainers tried last week to hash out those differences, but the House side left fuming. Representative Charles Rangel, the powerful New York Democrat, complained that the empowerment zones were being gutted of any real incentives to business and suggested that Mr. Clinton would regret it when the time comes to vote on a compromise package.
Much of this is posturing -- staking out positions for the final battles. The truth is that this dispute is largely over whether the Democrats are still Hubert Humphrey's party or the new creature of more pragmatic, not to say hard-hearted, pols. The actual dollar differences are niggling in the context of the $7 trillion the Government will spend through 1998.
The President allowed, in a Tuesday speech before House and Senate negotiators, that his Republican foes have succeeded in persuading the public that the plan is a veiled middle-class tax increase, when in fact, he said, its impact on the average Joe amounts to "a buck a week." Belatedly, Mr. Clinton has set about making speeches and radio talk-show appearances and sending his top aides to schmooze with the press in nonstop briefings.
The President has about two weeks to make his case before Congress's scheduled vote, and lawmakers who heard his speech expressed relief that he is warming to the task. But it remains an uphill battle. "The easy things have been done," Mr. Clinton said last week, referring to Congressional schemes to rein in the deficit in the 1980's. But he could just as easily have been talking about the job of bolting together an economic package that can mollify both Congress and the American people.

Business Losses and Personal Anguish

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
This spring, Binh Nguyen realized his dream of opening a Vietnamese restaurant in the small town of Coralville, Iowa. But his 70-seat restaurant had been open only a couple of months when the Clear Creek overflowed behind the one-story wood building, drenching the carpet.
Mr. Nguyen closed the restaurant. He and his 17-year-old son, Hieu, cleaned the carpet, dried the building out and reopened on July 6. Later the same day, the creek overflowed again, this time rising until it reached the window sills. The water has not receded since then, and is not expected to do so for another two weeks because it flows into the swollen Iowa River. Mr. Nguyen has laid off both his waitresses and is worrying about who will lend the additional $12,000 he needs to reopen yet again. 
 Many Midwestern businesses are struggling to survive this summer's epic floods, laying off thousands of workers. When the Labor Department on Thursday announced a jump in new claims for unemployment, part of the blame was placed on the floods.
The Des Moines Chamber of Commerce last week estimated lost sales in the city at $525 million, compared with $182 million in physical damage to businesses. City water began flowing again on Thursday, 12 days after a rise in the Raccoon River disabled the water-treatment plant.

Why Politics, as Usual, Is Not Helping the Mentally Ill

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
BY Albany standards, the recent jockeying between Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the State Legislature over mental health financing has made for an exceptional game of political chess. But the debate at the heart of the maneuvering -- how to shift money away from costly psychiatric hospitals and into community mental health services -- has been played out in virtually every state capital, and rarely with resounding success.
The tragic result has been a big imbalance between supply and demand for community mental health services in most states. Because of the nexus between mental illness, homelessness, substance abuse and crime, the costs to society and government have been immense. 
 In New York, at least, the dilemma takes on the feel of a crisis every few years when the case of a disturbed homeless person like Larry Hogue captivates the public. But in reality, the quiet crisis caused by inadequate community care has persisted since the mid-1950's, when states began to empty their pscyhiatric hospitals.
What makes the predicament so exasperating is the virtual consensus among psychiatrists and policy makers that community mental health programs work, not necessarily to cure patients but to allow large numbers of them to live meaningfully outside of institutions. Their success has been frustrated not by medicine, but by the interrelated obstacles of politics and money.
Those obstacles always loom larger during bad economic times. But the situation is fast becoming more urgent because the number of American adults with mental disorders is expected to increase by 14 percent between 1990 and 2010, to nearly 32.8 million.
Mental health advocates argue that change must come quickly before the system is utterly overwhelmed. "The system is crazier than the people it's trying to serve," said Laurie Flynn, executive director of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill.
 
New Medication and Patient Rights
 Since its peak in 1955, the population of state psychiatric hospitals around the nation has declined from 559,000 to fewer than 100,000. New York's dropped from about 90,000 to about 10,500. Psychotropic medication, court decisions expanding patients' rights, and Federal programs that paid for the care of elderly patients in nursing homes led to a wave of deinstitutionalization.
But because hospitals have proved to be powerful constituents and the mentally ill are not, money has not always followed patients into the community. States now are struggling to make it do so.
Small states like New Hampshire, Vermont and Rhode Island, which carry less of a burden, have had the most success. Larger states have had more difficulty. Mental health officials in Los Angeles County, for instance, estimate that they can meet only half the need for community services. Two years ago, California tied mental health financing to its sales tax, just in time for the recession.
Wisconsin, on the other hand, is considered a model among larger states. In 1974, it decentralized its system so that counties took primary responsibility for deciding how to spend state money, which was allocated by formula. That provided incentives for counties to reduce their use of expensive hospital beds and expand community programs.
In Dane County, home of Madison, psychiatrists created a program in which caseworkers provide intensive support and monitoring for patients in the community. Only about 50 of the 1,300 patients in the county system require long-term inpatient care.
"If you don't have to keep people in places that cost $500 a day, you can do an awful lot," said Dr. Leonard I. Stein, a University of Wisconsin professor of psychiatry and a founder of the program.
Since 1988, Ohio has tried to replicate the Wisconsin model with mixed success. It has cut its hospital population from 3,800 to 2,000, said Michael F. Hogan, the state mental health director. "But the redistribution of funding has eroded the purchasing power of the mental health department within the state budget," he said. "About 39 cents of every dollar saved by hospital downsizing is being lost to the mental health system."
The situation is similar in New York, and has given rise to an unprecedented, and politically nettlesome, proposed solution.
Hours before recessing on July 8, New York's Legislature passed a bill that would require the state to take a set amount of money each time a bed is closed in a hospital and funnel it to community mental health programs.
Advocates hailed the bill as a godsend. But Mr. Cuomo has threatened to veto it, saying the bill would tie his hands in the budget-making process, would not require closing of any of the state's 22 psychiatric hospitals, and would not earmark spending for the mentally ill homeless.
From the 1988-89 fiscal year to the 1993-94 fiscal year, annual state spending on New York's psychiatric hospitals decreased by $184.4 million, according to the Office of Mental Health. But spending from the state general fund on community mental health programs increased during that period by only $86 million.
In a 1986 speech, Mr. Cuomo paid tribute to "reducing the size of our psychiatric centers to finance much of the cost of community expansion."
But the mid-1980's were fat years, and recession turned tribute into temptation. With little confidence in Albany, or Sacramento or Columbus, that the future will be better, there may be insufficient will to pay what even Mr. Cuomo admits is a growing debt to the mentally ill.

HEADLINE: A Rare Tern Sets the Blood Racing for Birders

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAPE MAY, N.J., July 22

 BODY:
The bulletin, on telephone hot lines in all 50 states and an international computer network, arrived like a thunderclap.
"It made the blood race with excitement," said Paul Kerlinger, director of the Cape May Bird Observatory, who helped spread the word. 
 Within hours, hundreds of people around the nation dropped what they were doing and raced off in cars or headed for airports, praying they could get to Cape May before it was too late.
"It was the most electrifying news in years," said Macklin Smith, a professor of medieval literature at the University of Michigan, who hopped a jet to New Jersey.
The object of all the attention was a 10-inch-long blur of gray and white feathers beneath a black cap, listed in bird directories as a whiskered tern (Chlidonias hybridus).
Flitting about in a marshy meadow near the Cape May lighthouse, it closely resembled terns familiar to the region. But the whiskered tern, common in Europe, Africa and Asia, had never been seen in North America. A birdwatcher from Britain who caught the tern in his binoculars before sundown on July 11 couldn't believe his eyes.
It was as if climbers ascending Mount Everest had come across a Central Park pigeon panhandling peanuts.
For most of the 20 million or so Americans whose interest in birds goes beyond stocking a backyard feeder, the pleasures of identifying wildfowl by sight and sound are enough of a payoff. In recent years, however, what was once seen as a lonely but serene pursuit has increasingly set competitive juices flowing.
Those who have the time and money to roam the continent to track down rarely seen species are gaining star quality. Winging It, a publication of the American Birdwatching Association, now ranks the most accomplished birders in the nation by the numbers they claim to have seen or heard.
Among birders, the yearly ratings are anticipated like the Oscars, with a mix of admiration, envy and dismissiveness.
North America has about 850 of the 8,700 bird species in the world, and spotting 700 on this continent puts a birdwatcher into a very exclusive club. Topping 800 is a feat accomplished only by the Babe Ruths and Hank Aarons of birddom.
Professor Smith, currently ranked No. 4 among the top spotters of North American birds, at present has 801 species on his lifetime list, the most recent being a spot-billed duck he spied in the Aleutian Islands of Alaska this spring.
 
Moving Up in the Rankings
 Seeing the whiskered tern in Cape May gives Professor Smith a chance to move ahead of the current No. 3 in the ranks -- also listing 801 sightings -- once the sighting is officially confirmed, which he said was almost a certainty.
Adding to his pleasure was word that Benton Basham, a Kentucky anesthesiologist who currently ranks No. 1 with 810 sightings, arrived in Cape May too late to see the whiskered tern and when last heard from was slogging after it in a Delaware coastal marsh.
Professor Smith, who took up birding as a graduate student at Princeton 20 years ago, cheerfully describes himself "as one of the ones most obsessed with birding."
He at first ignored the published rankings, uncomfortable at calling attention to himself. "It seems ostentatious, but on the other hand, why hide your accomplishment?" he rationalized.
Cheating is not unheard of, but those who comes up with repeated claims of very rare birds not seen by anyone else quickly lose credibility and are ignored, said several experts.
"What more often happens is that people are mistaken about what they've seen or heard," said Joan Walsh, a biologist at the Cape May Bird Observatory, which operates the refuge where the whiskered tern was first spotted.
 
Sometimes, a 'Goofy' Sighting
 "But strange things happen," she added. "A while back, a man with a very good reputation was fishing alone on the Manasquan Inlet jetty when he looked up and spotted an albatross in front of him.
"No one would ever suspect him of making up a goofy story of seeing an albatross on the other side of the world where it's supposed to be. He has no camera, no binoculars and has no one with him to verify a North American first. But his good reputation, plus the unmistakable size of the albatross, left no doubt in anyone's mind that he had seen it."
Competition in birding reaches its height in several states every spring when teams fan out to see who can count the most species in 24 hours. These events help raise money for conservation by getting nonparticipants to pledge donations for each kind of bird a team finds.
In New Jersey the annual event is called the World Series of Birding. The winning team this year had a score of 215 species, counted in an exhausting dash across the state that required complex logistical planning to get the team to prime viewing locations ranging from mountains to cities to seashore.
Given a bird's ability to relocate with a few wing beats, reaching the scene of a sighting quickly is crucial. Most ardent birders carry lists of friends or other bird enthusiasts they will immediately telephone with news of a special bird in their area; some even carry beepers.
 
Hot Lines and Networks
 Now there are bird hot lines in every state operated by volunteers of organizations like the Audubon Society, with tape-recorded messages reporting recent sightings updated every week. Moreover, the North American Rare Bird Alert hot line puts out bulletins over an 800 number (1-800-458-BIRD), and a computer network called BirdChat, which has subscribers as far away as Moscow, enables birders to communicate with one another and to flash important messages.
"BirdChat is closely monitored by lots of people who chase birds," said Norman Saunders, a Federal Department of Labor economist who helped set up the network two years ago. "When they get back from their conquest, the message board is filled with bragging."
Word of the whiskered tern began spreading the evening it was sighted, and by the next morning was carried by the Rare Bird Alert and state hot lines, in addition to BirdChat.
Not since a rare Arctic bird, a Ross's gull, showed up at a Baltimore sewage treatment plant a few years back had the world of birdwatching been so jolted.
Cape May is one of the hottest birdwatching sites in the nation, thanks to its location at the end of a peninsula that about this time of year begins to funnel millions of birds in a southward migration from northern nesting areas.
Just how the solitary whiskered tern managed to cross the Atlantic to reach these shores is something of a mystery. Mr. Kerlinger, speculates it may have become addled by "an aberrant compass," and presumably crossed the entire width of the ocean, pausing to rest on its surface.
Unfortunately, he said, it is as unlikely to recross the ocean as it is to find a mate here, and a lonely and uncharted future lies before it.

HEADLINE: Immigrants Forgoing Citizenship While Pursuing American Dream

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG

 BODY:
For most of his 12 years in this country, Armando Espinosa, an immigrant from Ecuador, had absolutely no intention of becoming a United States citizen. What would be the purpose? he asked himself. With a green card in his wallet, he led a comfortable life in Queens, working as an industrial mechanic while his two children flourished in public schools. He certainly did not consider himself American.
"I am Ecuadorean in my blood and my gut," he said. "I do not even like apple pie." 
 Mr. Espinosa was hardly alone in his thinking. Unlike 50 years ago, when the majority of immigrants routinely sought to naturalize, only slightly more than a third of legal permanent residents now apply to become citizens. Although advocates for immigrants believe that the tide is turning, most immigrants now exist in a state of legal limbo, many nourished by the dream, often an illusion, that they will someday return home.
 
'Not Healthy for Democracy'
 Numbering up to 10 million nationally, these immigrants form a growing population of tax-paying residents without the right to vote or to serve on juries, police forces or in many Federal jobs. At a time when ethnic and racial tensions are fracturing the harmony of many cities, the immigrants' status -- seen by some as an unfair disenfranchisement and by others as a failure to integrate -- has become a cause of concern.
"You don't want a city composed of isolated pockets of immigrants who belong to a subculture and not to the larger society," said Sean R. Benson, executive director of the nonprofit Emerald Isle Immigration Center in Queens and the Bronx. "It's not healthy for them or for democracy."
Legal immigrants are eligible for citizenship after five years in the country, or after three years if they are married to a citizen. The reasons that most do not naturalize are complex, ranging from their close ties to home in the age of jet travel and long-distance telephone calls to their fear of the citizenship interview -- in which immigration officials may challenge them to "Name the order in which the 13 colonies came into the union" or "Explain the stripes on the American flag."
"It's easier to exist in limbo between two worlds," said Margie McHugh, executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition. "Because people can come and go more easily, they are not forced to make the ultimate choice of where they want to pledge their allegiance."
With the help of officials in cities like New York, however, advocates like Ms. McHugh are aggressively selling the advantages of citizenship on the radio and in community workshops -- just as New York City textbooks used to promote Americanization in the early part of the century.
Already, owing as well to changes in the application process, more New York immigrants are applying for citizenship than at any point in the recent past. Over the last year applications to the New York office of the immigration service have increased by 70 percent. At the same time a small industry catering to, and sometimes exploiting, applicants has arisen, with nonprofit groups offering free civics classes while for-profit stores charge exorbitant rates to help immigrants fill out the forms.
Starting in November the number of applicants is expected to swell as the three million immigrants granted amnesty under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 become eligible for citizenship. In a recent, typical month, about 8,000 of them called the National Association of Latino Elected Officials to inquire about the process.
"I think we will see a very dynamic citizenship movement build in the next decade, with millions of people coming forward, spurred by the folks who received amnesty," said Frank Sharry, executive director of the National Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Forum.
 
Attitude Changes Slowly
 Mr. Espinosa's attitude toward citizenship slowly evolved. As his children -- one born in the United States -- became Americanized, he found himself increasingly interested in the laws and politics of his new country. He could no longer vote in Ecuador and he could not vote in the United States. He began to feel like a man without a nation, he said.
Slowly angered by what he saw as the political weakness of Hispanic residents, Mr. Espinosa said he felt guilty. "If people like me retain our allegiances to home and refuse to participate in electoral politics here," he said, "the lot of our race will never improve."
Just as Mr. Espinosa changed his thinking with time, so too have immigrant groups, particularly as inner-city ethnic tensions flared and anti-immigrant sentiment intensified. In the last few years it has become a priority for Hispanic and Asian groups, as well as for politicians in newly created minority districts, to convert immigrants to citizens and then register them to vote.
"Our political power will be thwarted if we don't transform into citizens the immigrants who right now, technically, don't count," said Luis Miranda, director of the Hispanic Federation of New York City.
 
National Identity
 Because immigration is at peak levels, the numbers of legal immigrants who apply for citizenship are still substantial, about 300,000 a year. But the proportions are low. About 37 percent apply for citizenship, compared with about 67 percent in 1946, according to Immigration and Naturalization Service statistics.
Immigrants who find it harder to return home for visits -- political refugees and those who come from farther away -- are likeliest to become citizens. Vietnamese refugees are eight times as likely to naturalize than economic migrants from Canada, for instance.
And while slightly more than half the immigrants from the former Soviet Union and China become citizens, only 18 percent of Dominicans and 28 percent of Jamaicans do so, according to the New York City Planning Department. (Those four places sent the most immigrants to New York City in 1992.)
"You have to understand that many immigrants feel lost and diminished when they come to this country," said Saramaria Archila, a Colombian immigrant and executive director of the Latin American Integration Center. "What they have left is their national identity, and they are loathe to give that up."
 
Photos and Fingerprints
 Only about 20 percent of the immigrants from Mr. Espinosa's homeland renounce their official ties to Ecuador and swear allegiance to the United States. And that low percentage worries him.
So after learning on Spanish-language radio about a citizenship campaign in Queens, Mr. Espinosa ventured out on a recent weekend to the storefront headquarters of the Latin American Integration Center, a nonprofit community group, in Woodside. Volunteers fingerprinted and photographed him.
They also helped him fill out the Immigration and Naturalization Service application, which asks a dizzying array of questions, some personal, some political, some arcane.
They include: "Have you ever knowingly committed a crime for which you have not been arrested? Have you ever been a habitual drunkard? Have you ever advocated or practiced polygamy? During the period March 23, 1933, to May 8, 1945, did you serve in, or were you in any way affiliated with the Nazi Government of Germany?"
 
Eight-Month Wait
 Because the New York offices in Manhattan and Brooklyn have a backlog of applicants, Mr. Espinosa will have to wait about eight months for his interview with one of the 25 examiners who each conduct up to 40 interviews a day. The examiner will ask him civics questions, evaluate his spoken English and dictate a sentence for him to write as a test of his written English.
Over the decades, the interview for citizenship has achieved notoriety based on the experiences of immigrants who have encountered hostile or arbitrary examiners. Immigrant groups say that fear of the interview -- especially the English proficiency component -- keeps many people from applying.
A survey of Hispanic immigrants by the National Association of Latino Elected Officials showed that 56 percent had started the application process, but only 33 percent completed it.
"We have eliminated voter literacy exams in the South, but we still retain the tradition of arbitrariness in testing for the citizenship exams," said Harry Pachon, executive director of the Latino officials' organization. "Examiners can make the process a living hell. They can obviously overstep their discretionary authority, as in one instance where someone was asked if they ever had sex before marriage. Or they can perversely ask the kind of civics questions that most Americans could not answer."
 
A Standardized Exam
 To counter complaints of arbitrariness, the Immigration and Naturalization Service began last year to offer immigrants the option of taking a standardized citizenship exam created by the Educational Testing Service, which administers college entrance exams. The citizenship exams are administered and graded by community groups, and immigrants who pass are only briefly interviewed by Immigration and Naturalization Service examiners.
Some problems have arisen at the community test sites, particularly those based in for-profit offices, said Rose Chapman, the chief of naturalization for the Immigration and Naturalization Service in New York. One group in the Bronx is under investigation for charging immigrants $400 for the $16 test and promising a passing grade. Another in Queens passed almost all its test takers, but the dictation responses on the exams were all written in the same handwriting.
Some 60,000 immigrants nationally have taken the exam in the last 17 months. About 15 percent of the applicants in New York City opt for the exam, accounting for a significant increase in the citizenship applications.
Another increase resulted when the immigration service required longtime legal immigrants to exchange their dated green cards for new ones at a cost of $70. Many -- about 7,000 people in New York City -- decided to pay $20 more and become a citizen as long as they had to face the Immigration and Naturalization Service once more. And about 3,500 immigrants indicated that they were moved to come forward so they could qualify to become a New York City police officer, Ms. Chapman said.
 
Feeling Torn
 Lucia Alvarez, a Guatemalan immigrant who works for the city's Human Resources Administration, said that after 13 years in this country the decision was a troubling one despite her gratitude toward the United States.
"I feel bad, torn, toward my country, as if I'm abandoning it," Ms. Alvarez said. "It's like denying something about yourself."
Still, as a citizen, Ms. Alvarez will be able to sponsor her mother to join her in this country without the difficulties she has experienced for years.
"There's no turning back now, I guess," Ms. Alvarez said, as she sealed the envelope with her photos, her fingerprints and the details of her life and character.

HEADLINE: Japan's Leadership Fight Sets Off Difficult Shifts

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 24

 BODY:
By the time Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa left a crucial meeting of the Liberal Democratic Party on Thursday, this aging strategist in Japan's postwar economic miracle had resigned and suffered a humiliating verbal assault that left him looking sadly out of touch.
He had been beaten in a vast power play, but perhaps more important to the political shifts under way here, Mr. Miyazawa's fall symbolized a deep philosophical change slowly gaining momentum, which some believe could affect Japan more than the next choice of prime minister. 
 In this chaotic encounter between the old guard and a newer generation, a number of politicians, historians and economists agree, Japan was bidding a tortured farewell to its last postwar Prime Minister -- and, just maybe, to the rigid adherence to a set of principles that have left Japan an oddly unbalanced economic superpower.
The new leaders are generally more comfortable with at least discussing the idea of Japan's accepting all of the burdens of membership in the global community, and of changing the Japanese economy's emphasis on producers at the expense of consumers.
As a young bureaucrat in the late 1950's, Mr. Miyazawa helped formulate -- and then as a longtime politician embodied -- the policies that lifted Japan spectacularly from the ashes of World War II. Japan built a military of modest proportions and agreed to follow the lead of the United States on all issues of security and international politics, focusing instead on economic development under the firm guidance of well-trained bureaucrats.
This is often referred to as the Yoshida doctrine, after the pre-eminent figure of the late 1940's and early 1950's, Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida.
Those policies eventually left Japan deeply mistrusted because of its yawning trade imbalances, and still struggling 48 years after World War II to articulate an independent security and foreign policy. The Yoshida doctrine also left Japan increasingly at odds with the United States, particularly under the more aggressive economic policies of President Clinton.
"Miyazawa is the last of the generation that came up under the direct influence of Yoshida," said John W. Dower, a professor of Japanese history at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and author of a definitive study of the Yoshida era. "It was a policy of economic nationalism under the eagle's wing. It worked. But psychologically it has been hard to break from the subordinate independence that policy created."
 
Unchallenged Orthodoxy
 While it was clear even before the end of the cold war that the ambiguous Yoshida legacy was starting to work against Japanese interests -- with growing trade frictions and Japan's halting response to international crises like the Persian Gulf war -- the doctrine became a kind of orthodoxy that, many politicians and other experts say, few politicians could question openly.
It was just a few years ago, for instance, that a leading political scientist, Yonosuke Nagai, wrote, "The Yoshida doctrine will be permanent."
For the most part, the leaders vying to replace Mr. Miyazawa, many of whom are defectors from the Liberal Democratic Party, endorse only incremental changes in the policies. Because of public distrust of the military, there is a powerful strain of pacifism that still runs through the new generation, and an unwillingness to bend to every American demand on trade. Of course, the current battle to choose a new prime minister is being waged not in terms of philosophies, but power alignments and personalities.
Some of the new leaders have been willing to discuss directly issues that were all but taboo during the four decades of Liberal Democratic rule.
Morihiro Hosokawa, head of the Japan New Party and a strong candidate to become prime minister in a coalition government, has said he would consider opening Japan's rice market. Tsutomu Hata, head of the Japan Renewal Party, has promised that he would extend full apologies to Japan's Asian neighbors for World War II, something the postwar leaders refused to do. The Harbinger Party has said it would review the constitutional limits on Japan's taking part in collective security arrangements.
 
Some Want Deregulation
 There are even some younger members of the Liberal Democratic Party who have said they are committed to pushing for full economic deregulation.
"Our position is that there is no need for the bureaucracy to play this paternalistic role over business," said Seiichi Ota, 47, a Liberal Democrat who delivered some of the most fiery lines against Mr. Miyazawa at the meeting on Thursday. "They should just watch out to make sure there is fair competition."
Because Mr. Yoshida has cast such a long shadow over policy making here, some of the new leaders have sought to reinterpret his philosophy rather than discard it.
"Some have the opinion that we should not change the doctrine because Prime Minister Yoshida established the policies of giving priority to the economy, and they were successful," wrote Ichiro Ozawa, co-founder of Mr. Hata's party and the most aggressive of those wanting to alter the security and economic agendas. "But this is wrong. Prime Minister Yoshida was only making a political choice of giving priority to the economy as a cold war strategy. It is not based on his political philosophy, nor is it an unchanging political principle."
Even some of those who helped make the Yoshida doctrine a success are starting to argue that the legacy may be doing more harm than good.
 
'At a Loss What to Do'
 "The successors to the Yoshida era are at a loss about what to do and where to go," said Naohiro Amaya, a former top official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry who was instrumental in designing Japan's successful industrial policies. "I think we are in for a long period of trial and error. But I do know that sticking to the status quo means suicide."
He added: "The Yoshida doctrine was a response to a particular situation. But the situation has changed."
Another source of pressure for change is big business. Many industrialists who are active internationally now say the Japanese economy discriminates against foreigners and should be strengthened by introducing more competition and lifting the heavy hand of the bureaucracy. Akio Morita, the chairman of Sony, argued recently that the Japanese markets were a sort of fortress, and that the walls had to be torn down.
The Liberal Democratic Party has been depicted for so long as little more than a corrupt money machine that many have forgotten that it was built in 1955 with a firm intellectual anchor in the principles set out under the conservative Mr. Yoshida.
Under his tenure, which came to an end in 1954, Japan regained its sovereignty from the United States under the San Francisco peace treaty and ended the American occupation. But its independence was still limited by a series of compromises and bargains that Mr. Yoshida drove with the Washington.
 
Forced to Rearm
 After the outbreak of the cold war, and then the Korean War, the United States forced Japan to abandon its pacifism and rearm. Japan reluctantly agreed, but on condition that its military would have no offensive ability and that military spending would remain modest. The United States maintained huge bases on Japanese soil, and Japan agreed to follow the American lead on security and political issues.
In return, Mr. Yoshida sought to rebuild the economy swiftly by tilting toward producers, not consumers. This one-sided pursuit of economic gain led to the adoption by many economists and historians of the phrase "neo-mercantilism" to describe Japan's efforts to increase its wealth through exports.
"Yoshida himself was denying at the time that this was a long-term strategy," said Kenneth B. Pyle, an historian at the University of Washington and the author of a book published last year evaluating the Yoshida legacy. "He was just responding to the circumstances and wanted to help with economic recovery."
He added: "As long as the cold war was on, it worked beautifully. They had this sort of cocoon the United States built for them. But it led to a loss of self-respect."
To be sure, there have been some important steps away from the most extreme interpretations of the Yoshida doctrine in recent years. Japan has sought and received an assurance that the United States will back its bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, for instance. The Government has taken a variety of steps to loosen protection of the domestic market, opening up to products ranging from computer chips to oranges.
Parliament also passed the emotionally charged bill permitting Japan to send troops abroad for the first time since World War II and take part in United Nations peacekeeping operations.
But the real drive for this bill was said to have come from Mr. Ozawa, who has since left the party, not Mr. Miyazawa. Against the resistance of the old guard, Mr. Ozawa began a discussion group several years ago to debate the merits of Japan's so-called Peace Constitution and the country's stunted security and military policies.
"Until recently, we couldn't even discuss this issue," Mr. Ota said.
Finally, with the last of those who personally remember Mr. Yoshida now stepping off the political stage, one-party rule ending for the first time in 38 years, corporate Japan pressing for a more open economy and the Clinton Administration serving notice that it will be unrelenting in attacking what it sees as unfair trade practices, the debate over a new set of policy principles has begun in earnest.

HEADLINE: Pathologist Says Police Blows Didn't Cause Death

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 24

 BODY:
Blows to the head could not have been the sole cause of a motorist's death, despite an autopsy that says the man was fatally beaten by police officers, a pathologist has testified.
The chief medical examiner for Oakland County, Dr. Ljubisa Dragovic, testified Thursday at the officers' trial that his review of the autopsy materials showed that there was no swelling of the motorist's brain, a finding that he said would be essential to show that the man, Malice Green, had died of trauma from being struck by blunt objects. 
 "If there is no such thing, then that mechanism of death is out," Dr. Dragovic testified. He added that Mr. Green's death was caused by a combination of cocaine and alcohol use and bruising of the brain. Dr. Dragovic, testifying for the defense, was to return to the stand on Monday for cross-examination.
 
Autopsy Report Is Faulted
 Mr. Green, 35, died on Nov. 5 after a confrontation with Officers Larry Nevers and Walter Budzyn, both of whom have since been dismissed.
The autopsy, prepared by the Wayne County assistant medical examiner, Kalil Jiraki, showed that Mr. Green had died of at least 14 blows to the head in a beating that tore off part of his scalp.
Photographs and tissue showed that Mr. Green's brain was bruised, Dr. Dragovic said, but he concluded that Dr. Jiraki's autopsy was incomplete and his conclusion wrong.
The death, Dr. Dragovic said, was caused by the combined effects of cocaine, alcohol and the bruising, which together brought on a fatal seizure.
Dr. Dragovic, who works in suburban Detroit, said the beating alone would not have been enough to cause death. A toxicology report showed that Mr. Green had both alcohol and cocaine in his blood.
Mr. Budzyn, 47, and Mr. Nevers, 52, are charged with second-degree murder. A third former officer, Robert Lessnau, 33, is accused of assault.
The three defendants, who were dismissed from the department after Mr. Green's death, are white. Mr. Green, an unemployed steelworker, was black. His death raised racial tensions in Detroit, but there has been no testimony that race was a motive in the beating.
 
Evidence Is Examined
 The three defendants are being tried together. But Mr. Budzyn and Mr. Nevers have separate juries, and Mr. Lessnau's case will be decided by Judge George Crockett 3d of Detroit Recorder's Court.
Dr. Dragovic said he first became aware that there were problems with the autopsy after a reporter faxed him parts of the reports. In April, Dr. Dragovic and a defense lawyer, Fred Walker, went to the Wayne County Medical Examiner's office in Detroit to look at photographs and samples of brain tissue, the doctor said.
Those reports, Dr. Dragovic testified, showed that there was no fracture of Mr. Green's skull and no fluid in his lungs. He said those findings would also be needed to show that Mr. Green died of blunt-force trauma.
"There is a simple gap between what was seen in the photographs, what was described in the reports and the conclusion that was reached," he said.
"I found, there and then, upon reviewing the photos of the brain itself and the tissue that blunt-force trauma could not and cannot be taken as the sole cause of death in the case," Dr. Dragovic said.

HEADLINE: FILIBUSTER DELAYS SERVICE MEASURE

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

 BODY:
Senate Republicans have mounted their fourth major filibuster of the year, refusing to agree to schedule a vote on the $394 million-a-year national service bill, which they attack as a case of tax and spend.
By warring against the bill, whose concept of offering educational grants in exchange for public service is generally popular in the country, the Republicans stepped up their general delaying and harassment campaign against Democratic legislation. The tactic risks being labeled obstructionism but offers the hope of rendering the new Democratic Administration legislatively impotent. 
 The national service measure would authorize educational grants of up to $5,000 a year to as many as 150,000 Americans in exchange for their agreement to tutor grade school students, help senior citizens or perform other public services. The concept was emphasized in President Clinton's campaign last fall and, although it has been significantly scaled back since then, it is a priority for Congressional Democrats.
Eli Segal, a White House aide who is heading the effort for the program, said yesterday, "This is about something other than national service." He said that many Republican senators favored the measure and that small changes could be made to meet their objections but he would not speculate further as to why Republicans were actually filibustering.
 
With Increasing Vigor
 The bill has been debated since Tuesday, and Republicans have fought with increasing vigor. Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, said the amendments they demanded as a price for allowing the final vote would gut the bill.
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, said Friday in an interview that his party was filibustering this bill because it clearly fit within their attack on Democrats as a tax-and-spend party.
He called the national service bill an example of "willy-nilly mortgaging our future" and of "increasing spending over here while raising taxes over there" in a House-Senate budget conference. But Senator Mitchell said in an interview in Portland, Me., yesterday, "It's another example of Republican obstructionism, of trying to prevent action even though a majority of Americans, a majority of Congress and a majority of the Senate want action."
It takes 60 votes to shut off debate in the Senate, and a vote on a motion to do that is scheduled for Tuesday morning. But Mr. Dole said he had the 41 votes he needed to block that action from among the 44 Republicans in the Senate. Mr. Mitchell said he did not know how the vote would come out.
 
3 Other Targets
 There have been three other major filibusters earlier this year. Republicans killed the $19.3 billion economic-stimulus bill in April. They forced major changes in the campaign-finance bill and in the measure easing voter registration rules before allowing those measures to come to a vote. But they made a strategic decision not to filibuster the highly popular family-leave bill in February.
Senator Mitchell said that by filibustering now the Republicans were trying to take advantage of the Senate's need to spend some time on appropriations bills before the August recess. He said this bill should have "nothing to do with partisan politics."
Full-fledged filibusters are not the only Republican delaying tactics on Capital Hill. Senate Republicans threatened a filibuster and refused to let amendments to the Hatch Act allowing greater political activity by Federal workers go to a House Senate conference.
Senator Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma, invoked rarely used Senate rules on Friday to delay a hearing on the nomination of Joycelyn Elders to be Surgeon General, although the hearing was later concluded.
 
Flood-Relief Bill Blocked
 And House Republicans on Friday blocked action on a flood-relief bill, complaining that treating the measure as an emergency bill, thus exempting it from Federal budget limits, would lead to higher Federal deficits.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, floor manager of the national-service bill, insisted Friday that "a fair compromise is certainly possible. It would produce additional support needed to pass the bill in spite of the threat of a filibuster." Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas, the senior Republican on Mr. Kennedy's Labor and Human Resources Committee, said she did not favor a filibuster. But it is not clear whether she will vote against it, and if she abstains, the effect will be the same as a vote backing the filibuster.
The bill's $394 million price tag is for the program's first year, and Mr. Segal said that is expected to pay for 20,000 to 25,000 participants. The bill puts no limits on future spending, but Mr. Clinton has spoken of a goal of 150,000 volunteers by 1997, which might cost about $3 billion.
The bill is greatly scaled down, for budget reasons, from the measure Mr. Clinton described in the fall campaign. He hoped to involve millions of participants and to provide larger grants than the $5,000 in this bill and in a companion bill the House is debating.
Under the Senate bill, participants would also get living allowances pegged to the minimum wage, health care and child care, if necessary. The $5,000 grants would be available for up to two years. Many programs would be financed through grants to state agencies.

HEADLINE: Town Rallies Behind Boys Who Killed Father

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RUSH SPRINGS, Okla., July 22

 BODY:
Rush Springs is the kind of place, as people say about countless small towns across America, where people know about it when you're born and care about it when you die.
Except when Lonnie Dutton died last week. People here seem to care a lot more about gaining freedom for his accused killers -- his son Herman, who just finished the eighth grade here, and his son Druie, who finished the fifth. 
 There are blue ribbons tied to every lamp post on Main Street and to countless mailboxes in this farm town of 1,400 people in southwestern Oklahoma, all stitched by a group of mothers who want the authorites to drop murder charges against the boys.
Just after dawn today, dozens of cars and pickup trucks sporting blue bumper stickers reading "Friends of Herman and Druie Dutton -- We Support You!" formed a caravan and drove 18 miles to Chickasha, where the occupants rallied outside a closed court hearing for the boys.
The two slight, blond-haired youths shot their father with a deer rifle on July 12, when he was four days short of his 40th birthday, as he lay dozing on a sofa in the family trailer at the edge of town. After calling for an ambulance and reporting that someone had shot their father, the boys quickly broke down and told neighbors that they had done it because they were tired of his beatings and of watching him sexually molest their 10-year-old sister, Alicia.
 
Authorities Are Faulted
 While there have been a growing number of cases of children killing parents who they say abused them, what makes the Dutton case so unusual is the town's extraordinary show of support for the boys.
Many residents say the boys were simply too frightened to tell the authorities what was happening. At the same time, family counselors and the school principal say the boys' action points up a failure of the authorities to provide them with a way to free themselves from abuse.
Mr. Dutton, who had been known as a bully since his high school days here, had long been suspected of beating the children.
"One of the things that needs to be brought out is that a lot of people were very afraid of my brother, including me," said Linda Munn, Mr. Dutton's sister, to thunderous applause at a town meeting several days ago at which 200 people turned out to vent their feelings about the incident.
She said that nobody should blame the boys for all the times they had denied that their father was hurting them, even when teachers asked about their bruises or agents of the State Department of Human Services came to investigate.
"They learned, 'If I cry, I get hurt,' " Mrs. Munn said. "They dared not tell. They knew better than to say anything to anybody."
 
6 Official Visits to Home
 On at least six occasions, officials said, investigators with the county sheriff's office or the human services agency went to the Dutton trailer but did not find sufficient evidence of abuse to remove any of the children.
"How could the boys expect a fair shake from D.H.S. if they kept getting thrown back," one man shouted at the recent town meeting.
But a Grady County deputy sheriff responded: "It all comes down to the child has to be willing to talk. We have gone out and investigated calls, but when we get out there and they won't tell us anything, there's nothing we can do. Many times when you talk to children, they're afraid you'll separate them from their family, people won't believe them, or when they get back they'll get smacked around even harder for telling."
An official with the human services agency in Oklahoma City, Winston Barton, said townspeople were trying to make a scapegoat of the agency. He said the agency's records showed there had been no formal report of abuse at the Dutton home since 1990, when a report was investigated and dismissed because the children gave no indication that they were being abused.
The temperament of Herman, 15, and Druie, 12, whom nobody calls by his given name of James, was totally different from their father's. "These were good kids," said Karen Goodwin, the editor and publisher of the weekly newspaper, The Rush Springs Gazette. "If these were thugs or troublemakers, the whole town wouldn't be supporting them like this."
They lived a confined existence, with their father and their sister and a younger brother Jake, 8, in a trailer without electricity, running water or a telephone. The father, an unemployed roofer, would not let them go anywhere but school. Their schoolmates could never come to the trailer, which is still surrounded by a pungent and cacophonous collection of chickens, turkeys, quail, pigeons and a goat.
As the police officers drove the two boys to Lawton, where they are confined in a juvenile detention center, they stopped at a McDonald's for a meal. The boys asked them how to order. They had never eaten at a McDonald's.
 
Mother Departed Scene
 Their mother, who lives in Texas, has not lived with the children since she and Mr. Dutton divorced several years ago. Several people here said that Mr. Dutton got custody of the children after telling the authorities that his wife had abused them.
For years, residents have noticed that Herman and Druie were extraordinarily protective of their sister and their younger brother, both of whom have been sent to live with a relative.
"Every day when those kids got on the school bus, they all got in the same seat," said Mary Smith, who lives down the gravel road from the Duttons. "First Sissy, right up against the window, then Jake, then the two other boys would squeeze right in and all four would sit together just like that."
Mr. Dutton, who received public assistance and food stamps, rarely went into town. When he did, he was often in a foul mood, the neighbors said, and he sometimes got into arguments in which he threatened to hurt people or even to kill them. In a dispute with a neighbor, he repeatedly drove his pickup truck through the neighbor's picket fence, destroying it. The neighbor, fearful of him becoming even more violent, declined to press charges with the police, residents said.
"He was basically always a bully," said Becky Fitzgerald, a first-grade teacher here, who had known Mr. Dutton since he was 4 years old.
 
Making a Baby Cry
 Mrs. Smith, whose 21-month old granddaughter was Mr. Dutton's great niece, told of the aggressive way he played with the baby. Saying he was playing a game called plinky, Mr. Dutton would flick his index figure against the baby's skull until it cried, Mrs. Smith said. She said that when she rescued the child, Mr. Dutton would laugh and protest he was not seriously hurting her.
Yet Mr. Dutton was never convicted of hurting anybody, and since he was shot while he was asleep, the notion of self-defense on his boys' part is arguable.
But about the only comment in a score of interviews here that could possibly be interpreted as a show of support for Mr. Dutton was an observation by Melvin Brumley, the owner of Melvin's Barber Shop. "I don't think most people here really know for sure what went on," he said. "We don't have all that facts and figures yet."
The principal at the boys' school, Bill Chambers, said they were "scared silent" by their father. He said he intends to press for changes in the law to make it easier for the authorities to act on allegations of child abuse.
 
A Yearning for Normal
 For now, some people here are hoping things will return to normal. Indeed, in some ways they already are. The Main Street remains a partly beautiful, partly haunting tableau out of the "Last Picture Show," complete with a large sign in the middle of town: "Help the economy of Rush Springs -- Buy Something -- Anything! Local merchants will love ya!!"
Next month is the annual Watermelon Festival. Rush Springs likes to call itself the watermelon capital of the world, a mantle for which it competes with President Clinton's hometown of Hope, Ark. And townspeople note proudly that Winston Churchill once ate a slice of watermelon from Rush Springs.
"That's what we need to focus our attention on now, is watermelons," said Justin Jones, a watermelon farmer. "It's time to move on."
But most people here say they will not move on until Herman and Druie come home and are reunited with their younger sister and brother. "They all really do love each other," said Haylee Golden, a 14-year-old who was a classmate of Herman's. "That's one thing I know for sure."

HEADLINE: Private School, Public Need

BYLINE: By CHARLES STRUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HIGHTSTOWN, N.J.

 BODY:
The stunning news last month that Peddie, a small private secondary school here, had just received a $100 million gift provoked two responses from this tiny, tax-weary borough of 5,000 people: First, congratulations. Second, can you help us out?
"When they received the money, I called them up the following day to congratulate them," said Mayor Ernest Turp, a Peddie graduate. "Then a couple of weeks later, I said I'd like to sit down with the headmaster and review their relationship with the borough. The people are very concerned. They would like to see Peddie make a good-sized contribution." 
 Because Peddie is a nonprofit educational institution, its lush 245-acre campus goes untaxed. That deprives the borough -- which collects about $2 million a year in property taxes -- of an estimated $1.1 million annually.
Instead, like many similar schools, Peddie voluntarily contributes a sum in lieu of taxes -- in Peddie's case, $25,000 -- to help pay for the municipal services it uses. But with roughly 30 percent of Hightstown's property off the tax rolls -- including Peddie, six churches and three public schools -- borough officials say the property tax burden has fallen unevenly on the private homeowner.
So far, relations between the town and the school have been upbeat. The borough wants more money, but has broached negotiations without appearing like a ragged mendicant, cup in hand, at the gate. Peddie wants to appear understanding. It has said it would like to contribute more than it already does -- and that it has an obligation to do so -- but that there are limits, because an enriched endowment does not necessarily translate into mad money.
Peddie's windfall, which came in June from Walter H. Annenberg (class of 1927), the billionaire publishing executive, places the school in a unique position with obvious public relations implications: it feels obliged to act graciously toward the town it has inhabited since 1866, but its primary interest and its fiduciary responsibility are to the students and the institution.
In the world of town and gown, the Peddie-Hightstown relationship reflects an increasingly common clash over how much schools -- sometimes richly endowed but revenue-poor -- can contribute to communities that are struggling with greater costs, reduced state aid and large amounts of property they cannot tax. Some schools contribute little or nothing, while others, like Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, pay a great deal. Phillips Exeter said it pays $500,000 a year in taxes on holdings deemed unrelated to education.
 
More From Hotchkiss
 Like Peddie, the Hotchkiss School in Salisbury, Conn., makes contributions to the town in lieu of taxes. But recently, Salisbury officials have been asking for more.
"We're trying to be fair, not trying to gouge anybody," said Bud Trotta, the First Selectman there. "We've gotten them to increase it over the years, but it's still not enough."
Mr. Trotta said that nearly 30 children of faculty members at Hotchkiss and two other private schools in the area attend Salisbury's public schools. But because faculty residences owned by the schools are tax exempt, the town absorbs the educational costs, about $250,000 a year.
John Virden, the provost at Hotchkiss, said the school believed in paying its fair share. Its contribution last year to fire and ambulance service and several other projects was $50,000. In addition, he said, the school made its athletic facilities available for little or no cost.
Such arrangements are typical. Peddie has increasingly made its campus available to the town for athletics -- its golf course is open to the public, for example -- and it maintains a busy schedule of concerts and art exhibits, many of them free or at reduced rates.
Deerfield Academy in Deerfield, Mass., pays $60,000 to the town. But the headmaster, Robert Kaufman, said: "It's important to remember, schools cannot be in the position to be the financial saviors, to ride into the town budget meetings on a white horse. It is a mutually dependent relationship."
 
Commercial Gains
 All the schools make the point that their communities gain direct advantages from the buying power of the students, faculty members and visiting parents who patronize local motels and restaurants.
In Hightstown, Peddie has paid an annual sum in lieu of taxes since 1989, when Mayor Turp negotiated the school's first contribution. Its current donation is $15,000 to the general fund and $5,000 each to the fire department and ambulance corps.
But in a town with only one major tax-paying industry, a Minute Maid orange juice plant owned by Coca-Cola, homeowners provide most of the $6.9 million in property taxes that goes for municipal and county services and the public schools.
What more Peddie might now contribute, and how much the borough wants, are subjects still under discussion. But from the start, the school has recognized that its sudden wealth -- the endowment rose from $17 million to $117 million overnight -- made it more of a target.
"We feel a real responsibility to Hightstown," said Anne L. Seltzer, the director of development.
 
'A Citizen of the Town'
 Morton Goldfein, a laywer who graduated from Peddie in 1959 and is on its board, said he believed that the school had a "natural responsibility to enhance" its relationship with the town. "The school is a citizen of the town, and has been for a long time, and the school recognizes the importance of citizenship," he said.
Mr. Goldfein said he had floated proposals that would involve Peddie in some unspecified economic development in or around the downtown area, which amounts to perhaps two dozen shops on heavily trafficked Route 33, also known as Main Street.
Once a prime 19th-century rail hub for the shipment of potatoes and grain, Hightstown saw its prominence gradually erode, becoming a small town of small homes, a declining tax base and a retail and commercial afterthought to Princeton, about 10 miles away, and the many stores that line Route 130.
The board chairman at Peddie, Finn M. W. Caspersen, the chairman of the Beneficial Corporation and a classmate of Mr. Goldfein, cited urban decay in New Haven, home of Yale University, and said: "The town has not proved to be an asset to the university. That's not what we want in Hightstown."
 
Revenue Is Spoken For
 But he also pointed out that the endowment leaves little room for maneuvering. Annual interest on the endowment, in the current market, is expected to produce relatively little beyond the $5 million that Peddie hopes to use for scholarships and teacher salaries under the terms of the gift. The rest would be rolled back into the fund to keep up with inflation.
Charles Galbraith, the school's business adminstrator, said the school's annual operating expenses usually exceed revenue, and the difference must be made up by donations, a situation typical at many small schools and colleges.
But practically speaking, it is hard for some in town to look at the perfectly groomed Peddie campus and the Victorian houses on its periphery that were bought for faculty members without feeling that Hightstown is unfairly divided by privilege.
"I love Peddie," said Kathryn S. Dennis, who publishes the Hightstown Gazette, a 144-year-old weekly newspaper that her family has owned since 1912. "But with the exemption, it's hard for young families and for some of the older people who feel that they have to move out."
Setting a tone for the town's reaction four days after the gift was announced, Ms. Dennis wrote a front-page editorial on June 24, saying, "We are very happy for the Peddie School. but concluded:
"We mean you no harm, but the town has been carrying Peddie and other tax-exempt properties for years. Now it is time for the Peddie School to help the taxpayers."

HEADLINE: After 8 Years, Coliseum May Be More Than Issue

BYLINE: By JEANNE B. PINDER

 BODY:
It has been eight years since Mortimer B. Zuckerman won the right to demolish the New York Coliseum and build something else on its site. But finally, the next few days or weeks may reveal the shape of the building that will be built -- if anything is to be built there at all.
The coming week is likely to see a flurry of negotiations over the fate of the Coliseum site, at 59th Street and Columbus Circle, a prime location that makes it probably the best development site left in the city. 
 The fresh impetus to the negotiations came about a week ago when Mayor David N. Dinkins, in response to a request from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which owns the Coliseum, indicated his willingness to force a mid-August deadline on Mr. Zuckerman to negotiate a deal.
Previously, Mr. Dinkins avoided taking a stand on the M.T.A.'s dealings with Mr. Zuckerman, who wants to cut the negotiated price of the land and reduce the scale of the planned development.
 
Best Thing, Worst Thing
 The talks over the Coliseum, one of the longest-running public policy soap operas in New York, feature the tug and pull of elected and appointed officials from the city and the M.T.A., as well as Mr. Zuckerman and an array of civic groups. All say they are doing the best thing for New York, but the deadlock resulting from their actions has done exactly what all agree is the wrong thing: left the Coliseum exhibition hall and office building under-used and deteriorating.
"This is one of the premiere sites in the city of New York," said Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan. "It is an embarrassment to all of us that Columbus Circle, the gateway entrance to the park, the Theater District and a major residential neighborhood, has been allowed to lie fallow and become a center for drug-dealing, street-sleeping and shoddiness."
Mr. Zuckerman's original 1985 plan to build a 2.1-million-square-foot project on the 3.4-acre site was scaled back twice after widespread criticism, court challenges and the pullout of the main tenant, Salomon Brothers.
Now, with court challenges over project's size and other issues exhausted and the city's office-space market suffering from the biggest glut in memory, Mr. Zuckerman has sought to cut his offering price from its market-peak 1985 level to something more like what the land would bring in today's depressed market. He also wants to reduce his building plans again, to a project that would be built in stages, people close to the talks say.
 
'Major Law Firm' Lined Up
 Mr. Zuckerman said in a telephone interview that he planned to make a formal proposal to the M.T.A. and to the city soon. The proposal would probably involve building 150,000 square feet of retail space and 700,000 square feet of office space, he said. He added that most of it would be occupied by a "major New York law firm" that he declined to name but is said by people close to the talks to be Weil, Gotshal & Manges.
"You can't build these things on spec any more," Mr. Zuckerman said. "We have great confidence that we can put together a tenancy if given the time for complex legal and financing arrangements."
That would create new jobs in the construction industry, Mr. Zuckerman said, and leave room for more development on the Coliseum site.
The current price tag on the site is $338.6 million. People familiar with the talks said Mr. Zuckerman now hoped to buy an unspecified amount of land for the first building for $62 million, and leave the price of the rest of the land to be negotiated later.
The perennially cash-strapped transportation authority, which owns the Coliseum and other buildings on the site through a subsidiary, has been trying to close the Zuckerman sale or get money from the property through other, interim uses since the last lawsuit over Mr. Zuckerman's development plan was settled last autumn. The M.T.A. has been reluctant to cut the price of the land or to sign on to a staged development plan.
 
'Doesn't Sound Like a Sale'
 Robert Bergen, general counsel for the M.T.A., declined to comment on the current negotiations but said: "We have said we're not interested in phased developments, where we have to continue to hold the property for him at our expense while he's getting ready to develop it. That doesn't sound like a sale to me."
City officials including Barry F. Sullivan, Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, and Carl Weisbrod, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, are also known to be taking an active role in the talks with Mr. Zuckerman. Mr. Dinkins, in his response to the M.T.A., called for Mr. Zuckerman to negotiate an acceptable deal for the sale by Aug. 16 and to close the sale by Nov. 15.
Because of the complicated sales agreement for the site, the city and the M.T.A. -- which is not a city agency -- both must sign on to any plan, and their interests do not necessarily coincide.
While city officials declined to comment publicly on the talks, a senior city official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the city believed that it and the M.T.A. should look hard at Mr. Zuckerman's new offer when it is made formal. Further, the official said, the city wants to make sure that issues other than immediate cash rewards are considered in any decision.

 
Looking at Larger Impact
 The official said: "The city has an interest in the larger economic impact of the project. There might be a use that brings in more direct revenue to the city but has a very limited secondary economic impact, or there might be one that would bring in a limited amount of direct revenue but have a much more significant economic impact."
A retail user, for example, might bring a high rent, but another proposal -- like studio or exhibition space -- could pack a punch with secondary income from hotel and restaurant traffic. In any case, the official said, "We would be wary of encouraging speculative office space."
Meanwhile, people close to the talks said tempers were wearing thin. These people said that Mr. Zuckerman thought that the M.T.A. was trying to force his hand in a weak market and get a 1985 price for the land, and that it seems clear he could benefit from continuing delay that would grant time for talks with Weil, Gotshal or for a stronger market.
These people also said that city officials were miffed that the M.T.A. gave no warning this month when it sent Mayor Dinkins its letter calling for the city to join the agency in setting a closing date and that M.T.A. officials suspect that Mr. Zuckerman is negotiating in the hopes of a delay.
Finally, despite the apparent deadline Mr. Dinkins set in his letter to Peter E. Stangl, the authority's chairman, careful readers noted that further delay was not impossible. Mr. Dinkins wrote that "should the parties, acting reasonably and responsibly, be unable to reach an agreement by Aug. 16, 1993, I would be prepared on that date to concur" if the M.T.A. issued a closing notice -- suggesting that this deadline, too, is an elastic one.

HEADLINE: THE MIDWEST FLOODING;
DAMAGE ESTIMATES OF MIDWEST FLOOD CLIMBING SHARPLY

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
As the rain keeps falling and the water keeps rising, it is becoming clear that the terrible flooding of 1993 will have a considerably bigger effect on the nation's economy than seemed likely just a short time ago.
"Seems like we get bombarded with heavy rain and heavy rain; in between, we get light rain," said Roy R. Arends, a farmer in Alexander, Iowa. "It's been hard to get the crops in, it's hard on equipment, it's hard on nerves. The financial impact is yet to be seen, but right now it really looks bleak." 
 As they survey bankers, farmers, businesses and state officials, analysts at four Federal Reserve banks in the Midwest have been raising their damage estimates, in some cases doubling and tripling recent numbers.
 
'Hurricane Andrew Range'
 "Two weeks ago I said you weren't going to see discernible impacts" on the gross domestic product, said Edward Lotterman, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. "That was before Iowa, Missouri and Illinois. Now I think we're getting into the Hurricane Andrew range in terms of losses."
The dollar figure that economists are putting on crop losses, property damage and lost production and sales -- for now at least -- is $10 billion to $12 billion, roughly two-thirds of the losses from Hurricane Andrew last year. As the figures climb, they include losses not only from areas under water, but also from adjacent areas where people and businesses are suffering.
Heavy rain fell yesterday along the Missouri River in Nebraska, expanding the flooded area north and west and raising the specter of more trouble ahead. [Article, page 16.]
 
A Parched Southeast
 And while the Midwest is reeling from the flood, parts of the southeastern United States -- without a major rainfall since June 1 -- are feeling the bite of a drought. In South Carolina, the worst-hit state, the state Agriculture Commissioner said 95 percent of the corn crop had been lost, 70 percent of soybeans, 50 percent of wheat and 25 percent of tobacco. Parts of North Carolina and Georgia are also suffering.
"There's going to be crop loss and poultry suffocation," said Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting center at Georgia State University. The damage is likely to be measured in hundreds of millions of dollars.
Eventually, consumers around the nation are likely to see higher prices for some foods as a result of the current damage, but the changes are likely to be moderate, far less than the sharp increases produced by the devastating drought of 1988.
Laura d'Andrea Tyson, head of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said Friday that she thought the flooding and drought would add no more than three-tenths of 1 percent to the inflation rate this year. She said she expected "a serious effect on spending" this summer and suggested that a lack of resources for rebuilding could limit the economic stimulus after the flood waters recede.
For all the tremendous losses to property and people's well-being, most natural disasters eventually provide a shot in the arm for the national economy, because the tremendous sums of money invested in repairs show up in gross domestic product.
"A guy whose home was wiped away and a community whose major road was destroyed doesn't show up as G.D.P. loss," said one Administration economist who would speak only on anonymity. "In fact, that diminution of assets shows up as a G.D.P. gain, because we'll send a road crew out to repair the road. But that gain is a measure of what was lost."
 
Stalled Midwest Growth
 Economists expect the negative impact of the Midwest floods to be measured in tenths of 1 percent of the nation's $6 trillion gross domestic output -- the amount of goods and services Americans turn out a year. But the blow is still enough, said Sara Johnson, an economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill, to temporarily stall the economic expansion of the Midwest, a region that has been doing better than the rest of the nation for several years.
And statistics about the nation's economy are scant comfort to people watching their homes being swept away, or to those on dry land who have also suffered.
Dwayne Crook is the sales manager at Buford Ward Chevrolet in Quincy, Ill., a dealership that sits on a bluff hundreds of feet above the swollen Mississippi River. "A lot of our business comes from Missouri," he said. "They just can't get here. The bridges are down. There's water over the roads." The dealership's sales, which were very strong earlier in the year, have been down 30 percent since the flooding started.
Such disruption of everyday economic life is continuing throughout the flood area, where water now covers millions of acres in eight states.
"This thing has been going on and on and on," said Wesley Ooms, an assistant vice president at State Farm Insurance, in Bloomington, Ill. "You really can't do anything until water's receded."
Crop losses from the flood could reach $5 billion. Iowa's farmers, for example, may end up losing a third of their corn crop, taking a $1.1 billion loss, said Evan Stadlman, executive director of the Iowa Corn Growers Association.
"There's the crop that should have been harvested in the fall that never got planted," he said. "There's the crop that was lost due to flooding. We're also talking about the crop continuing to be reduced if don't get more favorable weather. Plus we may see the crop that can get harvested can't get to market."
 
Impact on Business
 The rains and flooding have kept buyers out of stores, and some factories have been shut. The loss of business in Des Moines, where flooding of the waterworks disrupted the city's water supply, has been estimated at $200 million by the Des Moines Chamber of Commerce and at $500 million by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.
The flooding has halted home building in some areas, and the rain has delayed it in others. Housing starts in the Midwest, which had already dipped in June, are likely to remain at below-normal levels all summer.
"The water has to go down," said Betty Hardle, chief executive of Good Value Homes in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. "The ground has to dry somewhat. The approach to the property has to be suitable for heavy trucks. The constant rains added time, cost and aggravation."
While rebuilding after the flood will provide some economic stimulus later this year, it is likely to fall short of what occurred after Hurricane Andrew in South Florida and Louisiana. While the hurricane demolished homes and businesses which were often rebuilt, the biggest damages from the flooding have been to crops. And lost crops are simply never made up.
There is another major difference: even with aid from Washington, the proportion of losses that will be compensated from the flood and drought will be much lower than from Hurricane Andrew.
 
A Lack of Insurance
 After the hurricane, insurers paid more than $16.5 billion in claims within a few months. Among the many homes flooded in the Midwest, relatively few are insured against flood damage. State Farm, for example, said it had received fewer than 400 claims for flooded homes and fewer than 400 for autos damaged by the water.
Few private homeowner policies provide flood protection, and Donald Collins, assistant administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said only about 15 percent of the 30,000 to 40,000 homes damaged by flooding have Federal flood insurance. "Not enough people bought the insurance," he said. "That's just tragic."
And many farmers do not buy Federal crop insurance which, as a rule, does not pay for the first third of the loss. "People with damaged homes or crops aren't going to have an Allstate man drive up to door and write a check," said Mr. Lotterman of the Federal Reserve Bank in Minneapolis. "So you don't get an immediate infusion of cash that you got after Andrew."
For now, all the numbers attached to flood damage are rough estimates at best. The numbers cannot be confirmed or contradicted until people can inspect all the damage and the fall harvest is completed.

HEADLINE: Long Hearings on Ireland's Beef Scandal End

BYLINE: By JAMES F. CLARITY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DUBLIN, July 24

 BODY:
As only the 25th richest country in the world, Ireland can hardly be expected to produce corruption scandals on the scale of those in the United States, Japan or Italy.
But accusations of fraud involving more than $300 million in the beef industry -- one of the country's most important -- have portrayed Ireland as the bad butcher of Europe in the longest, costliest public investigation in the country's 71 years of independence. 
 The Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry, sitting in Dublin Castle, produced charges of audacious short-weighting, deliberate mislabeling to fake quality and the sending of rotten beef hearts to Russia and of tons of meat to Iraq from cattle that was supposed to have been slaughtered according to Islamic law but was not.
The Tribunal, which ended its hearings last week, was also told that ranking Government officials gave favored treatment to companies run by an entrepreneur, Larry Goodman, who had friends in high places, made hefty contributions to political parties and won preferential treatment in getting government credit and insurance. His companies were also accused of evading millions of dollars in taxes.
The accusers included politicians and Government agriculture inspectors, who generally charged that fraud was carried out by workers with the connivance of company officials.
The hearings alternately shocked and bored the Irish for a year and half as people learned that the lawyers involved were earning $2,500 a day, that the cost to the state would probably be about $5 million and that the final report of the single judge presiding over the inquiry, High Court Justice Liam Hamilton, will not come until the end of the year. He may recommend that the Government press criminal charges against industry and Government officials. If the beef charges are serious enough, they could provoke a general election for the second time.
In November, a dispute growing out of the inquiry forced an election that resulted in the coalition Government between the Fianna Fail party of Prime Minister Albert Reynolds and the Labor Party. Labor replaced the Progressive Democrats, whose leader, Desmond O'Malley, had a bitter dispute with Mr. Reynolds over the beef accusations.
But whatever Justice Hamilton recommends, the tribunal has underscored how important beef is to Ireland, a country already suffering heavily from recession, with an unemployment rate of about 20 percent, twice the European rate, and factories closing almost daily.
The place of cattle, in Irish mythology as well as contemporary economic life, is clear here. On the national television crime-stoppers program, pictures of stolen tractors and mowers are regularly shown and cattle medicines are advertised in prime-time slots along with beer and detergents.
The beef scandal grew out of the shipment in the late 1980's of several hundred millions of dollars worth of beef to Iraq, which failed to pay its bill, and the Goodman companies then demanded that the Government pay the insurance of about $250 million. A British television company, Granada, produced a program alleging dishonesty and payoffs. Government ministers denounced the program, but refused to answer important questions in Parliament, appointing the tribunal instead.
"The whole point was not to rock the boat," said Douglas McLernon, a lecturer in economics at Trinity College. "No matter what, we have to sell our meat. We're worried about jobs, about the image of the Irish farming community, not about the morality of it."
He said that sending improperly slaughtered beef to a Muslim country was "like putting chocolate chips in the Communion wafers." He added, "But here in Holy Ireland there was not a word about the morality."
Statistics show why beef is so important. Cattle account for 73 percent of Ireland's agricultural exports, which in turn make up 13.7 of all exports. About 15 percent of Irish employment is in agriculture, far above the European average. Ireland has about 8 million head of cattle, with a human population of 3.5 million. Britain, with a population of 58 million, has 12 million head of cattle.

HEADLINE: Loggers Listen to What Michigan Forests Say

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMASA, Mich.

 BODY:
Midway between Lake Michigan and Lake Superior, the Fence River cuts a silvery path across a lush landscape of maple, poplar and pine. The woods on both sides of the river are owned by the Mead Corporation, and no one knows the landscape here better than Dr. Dean Premo, a 38-year-old zoologist hired by the paper and lumber company to conduct some of the most important wildlife studies in the timber industry.
For more than 50 years, the nation's timber industry has focused most of its scientific work on one challenge: how to grow more trees in less time. But mindful of the public's new interest in forests as well as Federal and state laws protecting endangered species, the industry is rapidly expanding its biological research to understand more thoroughly how plants and animals are affected by logging. 
 The desire of timber executives is twofold. First they hope to develop timber- cutting practices that meet the demand for trees while providing greater environmental safeguards. Second, they hope to avoid the kind of political and legal stalemate that has paralyzed the industry in the Pacific Northwest. As a result, they are compiling more complete scientific data with which to argue their case.
 
Information Needed
 "The public needs accurate information and we need accurate information," said John R. Johnson, the technical services manager of Mead. "The ability to pre-empt legislation is secondary. What we want is policy and regulations that make good biological sense. What we're having a problem with in the natural resources area is that we need better quality information."
That is where Dr. Premo fits in.
For three winters, Dr. Premo, who was reared in this logging town, has strapped on snowshoes and hiked to a stretch of river to count the tracks of wolves, red foxes, otters, minks, coyotes and a dozen more kinds of mammals. In the same area during the spring and summer, Dr. Premo and his staff have studied the density of 90 species of breeding songbirds by listening to their calls and spotting nests.
Their research has shown that mammals use the river to migrate and that wide corridors of standing timber are necessary to their survival. Dr. Premo has also found that logging to within 50 feet of streams, which is the standard in Michigan and other states, causes breeding songbird populations to plummet by 90 percent. He recommends buffers of 250 to 400 feet.
 
Environmentalists Split
 The timber industry's new research has attracted the attention of environmentalists and left them divided over it. Some view the research as a legitimate effort to sustain compatible economic and ecological goals.
"What's going on up there may be a leading edge of what could turn out to be a more constructive, mature relationship between the environmental community and the timber industry," said Michael McCloskey, the chairman of the Sierra Club in Washington. "You are operating in a part of the country where environmental sensitivities are somewhat greater. There is still a fair amount of native flora that has survived into second- and third-growth forests."
But the local environmental groups in the upper Middle West, which are more strident, view the research as a public relations ploy. "These companies are not worried about biodiversity," said Dr. Bill Willers, a professor of biology at the University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh, who is executive director of the Superior Wilderness Action Network. "What they are interested in is getting the right image. It's a cover. They are afraid of an impending citizen backlash."
Mr. Johnson and other timber industry executives readily acknowledge that such a backlash is a concern. They said there is ample evidence in the Pacific Northwest of how a political clash over the value of trees, endangered animals and logging jobs can sharply reduce cutting. On July 1, President Clinton tried to settle that fight by proposing to reduce sharply the amount of timber in the Northwest that can be cut over the next decade, to provide economic aid to displaced timber workers and to turn about seven million acres of virgin forest into reserves that are open only to limited logging.
 
No Virgin Forest Left
 Here in the upper Midwest, the debate is not nearly as ferocious, and there are differences in the two regions that are likely to keep it that way. No great stands of virgin forests remain as they do in the Northwest. The forests of Michigan's Upper Peninsula have been cut for more a century.
In addition, much of the timber land on this thinly populated peninsula bounded by three Great Lakes is privately owned. Timber company executives and scientists like Dr. Premo have been successful in arguing that sustaining commercial logging in the region, which is larger than Massachusetts and New Hampshire combined, gives the forests enough economic value to fend off housing subdivisions, shopping centers and four-lane highways that they contend are considerably more damaging to the environment. The paper and lumber industry in the state last year had total revenues of about $6 billion and employed 63,000 people.
"It's in all our interests -- the timber companies, the foresters, the state, the environmentalists and the tourism industry -- to keep this a healthy forested landscape," said Dr. Premo, who was educated at Michigan State University and moved back here with his wife, Bette, a specialist in aquatic biology and chemistry, in 1985 to open an environmental consulting company.
 
70 Million Acres of Forest
 The nation's $200-billion-a-year timber industry owns 70 million acres of forest land in the United States, an area roughly the size of Arizona. Almost every important forest-products company has started broad ecological research programs.
In the South, the Georgia Pacific Company is conducting a joint project with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to protect the endangered red cockaded woodpecker. Earlier this year, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt approved a plan for preserving the species that called for Georgia Pacific to limit logging on 500 acres surrounding each of about 100 colonies of woodpeckers found on the company's four million acres of woodlands in the region.
In Maine, Bowater Inc., the Scott Paper Company and the Champion International Corporation are studying how timber cutting affects populations of tropical songbirds that migrate from Central and South America to breed in the Maine woods. More than 250 species of tropical songbirds migrate to the United States and Canada and their numbers are said by some scientists to be declining rapidly because logging is fragmenting forests.
Forest scientists in Michigan and elsewhere say few projects are more advanced than the one Dean and Bette Premo designed for Mead, which is based in Dayton, Ohio, and had sales last year of $4.7 billion.
 
Bigger Migration Corridors
 By tracking animals as they moved among logged areas, the Premos persuaded the company to leave much broader patches of timber standing for migration corridors. They have showed Mead foresters where the corridors should be.
Their research on wetlands and on the ecological importance of the temporary vernal ponds that form in the forest after the spring melt also led to new management practices. Mead's foresters, unaware of the importance the ponds played as resting and feeding areas for wildlife, used to cut up to the edge of the ponds and then fill them with the brush and slash from logging. Now the ponds are ringed by uncut forest.
And their research on the value to wildlife, especially to birds, of leaving unlogged corridors along the Fence River has led the company to establish much wider buffers along streams.
"I argued that by doing this they can maintain populations of birds to keep insects in check that are devouring their young trees," Dean Premo said. "I make a legitimate economic and ecological argument to them. I tell them you wipe out the birds, then you have to use pesticides to control the bugs."

HEADLINE: Tallying Crown Heights Toll, in Votes

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD

 BODY:
Savoring the respite from the hammering sun, Sal Margolis plopped into a swivel chair inside the Margolis Stationery Store in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, where he meditated with some melancholy on his possible political defection.
"I'm a lifetime Democrat, but I may change my voting habits for the first time," he said. "For 40 years I voted Democratic, but the string may be ending." 
 The 68-year-old Mr. Margolis was discussing the prospects of his not voting for Mayor David N. Dinkins in the upcoming election after hearing about the Crown Heights report that harshly criticized his handling of the racial disturbances. "After the report, my opinion of him went down considerably," he said. "Before that, I thought he was doing fair and I was thinking I would vote for him again. I didn't think the report would be that negative. It was all negative. The report told me he might be inept."
In recent days, people throughout the city have fumbled to fit the disquieting conclusions of the Crown Heights report into their thinking about who should be the next Mayor. Some 50 conversations in a scattering of neighborhoods whose voters are considered critical to the outcome of the election suggest that the report has jarred or even fully eroded the faith of many Dinkins backers. For many others, it has fortified already established voting convictions.
 
Months Remain
 Of course, it is important to note that the election is still more than three months away. As many voters themselves emphasized, their allegiances are far from settled, and the efforts of the candidates or the shifting tide of news events could eclipse the Crown Heights issue before the ballots are cast on Nov. 2.
But at least in the immediate wake of the report, a substantial number of people once inclined to vote for Mr. Dinkins said that they have slid into the murky realm of the undecided. A few said that they have marched all the way into the camp of his opponent, the Republican-Liberal candidate Rudolph W. Giuliani.
On the other hand, many other voters said that they had already squarely settled on their candidate before the release of the report and have not wavered. Indeed, the staunchest Dinkins backers, especially black voters, expressed deep indignation over the report and said that they were more resolved than ever to rally support for the Mayor. Unsurprisingly, none of the 50 people interviewed said that they have migrated from Mr. Giuliani to Mr. Dinkins since the report's release on Tuesday.
The report was also highly critical of police officials and prosecutors. But the Mayor was the most visible and significant target, and news accounts focused heavily on the report's conclusion that Mr. Dinkins was slow to recognize and respond to the violence that erupted in August 1991 after a black child was struck and killed by a car driven by a Hasidic Jew. A Hasidic scholar was killed in the ensuing unrest.
Indeed, many people seem to have seized on the report as a summation of the Dinkins years rather than solely a commentary on the four days of violence.
 
'It Disturbs Me'
 Three women who had just completed some avid shopping at rackety Zabar's on the Upper West Side illustrated the perplexed emotions that have transfigured some voters.
"I was for Dinkins, and I think what he did there was terrible," said Evelyn Kalish, 71. "Now I doubt I'll vote for Dinkins. It disturbs me."
Pam Edel, a 42-year-old part-time teacher, chipped in: "I can't make up my mind. I don't like either of them. Last time, I voted for Dinkins, though I wasn't happy with him."
She said that the report did not surprise her and that she had been undecided for a while.
What will she do?
"I think there's a chance Giuliani can convince me to vote for him," she said. "His image as the D.A. is too strict for me. To be honest, I want Lindsay back."
The third woman, Nancy Beha, a 42-year-old special education teacher, was of a different mind. She felt the report was unduly harsh. "I think this is an almost ungovernable city," she said. "You need a superhuman person. I think Dinkins has been O.K."
Ms. Kalish had a final word: "Actually, I'd love Koch back."
 
Weakened Support
 Among more than 15 interviews with people on the Upper West Side, home to many white liberals who went strongly for Mr. Dinkins last time, there was little unadulterated support for the Mayor.
Quite a few Jewish voters said they had already aligned themselves with Mr. Giuliani, and the report has more firmly rooted them there. "I was 90 percent for Giuliani, and now I'm 100 percent," said Akiva Goldfarb, a 21-year-old student lugging some dry cleaning down Broadway. "The report made me feel more secure in my vote."
He underscored that he and his friends did not feel Mr. Dinkins was unresponsive to Jews. "It's not a Jewish thing," he said. "I think he generally wavers and is indecisive. I feel in general he doesn't want to take strong action."
Around the corner on Amsterdam Avenue, Scott Bodie, 41, was standing outside Avventura, a glassware shop he manages. "I usually vote a straight Democratic ticket," he said. "I always felt a black Mayor was good for the city, but his laissez-faire attitude is not what we're used to. Up to the Crown Heights report, I was going to vote for Dinkins. The report made me totally undecided. When the report said he didn't do anything, to some extent it makes it hard for me to imagine voting for Dinkins."
 
Hispanic Voters Waver
 Four years ago Hispanic voters constituted an important swing constituency that helped put Mr. Dinkins in office. In Sunset Park, Brooklyn, home to a sizable Hispanic population, the Crown Heights report intensified an already palpable disenchantment.
Frank Castillo, a 45-year-old freight elevator worker, who was walking his dog, Tita, through the park, said: "I was for Dinkins but when I heard about that report on TV -- well! The report has changed my mind. He doesn't make me feel too good anymore. Now I don't know. I have to play it by ear."
Marlene Vazquez, a 24-year-old mother of three, was cheerily strolling through the park with her children and her father, Miguel Vazquez, a butcher. "I thought the report was true," she said. "It's given me a lot to think about. I was going to vote for Dinkins, but now I'm undecided. I've been up and down with him. Like a relationship."
She said other issues were also important. "More has to be done for the kids. They see their parents at home, and they wonder, Why aren't they going to work? Why are they eating the same stuff?"
Her father had already resolved his vote. "I like Giuliani," he said. "He talks from the heart. Dinkins always has mixed-up opinions. He contradicts himself too much."
 
Catalyst for Defenders
 Conversations with a diverse group of black voters offered a different perspective, one infused with anger at the report and suggesting a freshly energized desire to defend the Mayor.
John A. Coleman, the president of Blackstone Enterprise, a construction company in Queens Village, felt the report was very unfair to Mr. Dinkins. "There were some mistakes, but I don't think they should tar and feather him," said Mr. Coleman, who is black. He said that the sizable middle-class black community of southeastern Queens felt extremely protective of the Mayor and would continue to rally around him. "If anything," he said, the report "will make me support him stronger."
In Hollis, Queens, Andre Whitfield, a black 26-year-old janitor for the Transit Authority, was washing his Jeep in front of a friend's house. "I really think the Mayor didn't have anything to do with it," he said. "He did what he could do. The tension in Crown Heights is in that neighborhood, not outside it. There's nothing you can do if the people there don't want to live together."
As he routed a stream of water over his Jeep, he said that exploitation of the report would inflame racial tensions. "A lot of people just want to see him out of power. They should just leave it alone. This is going to start another riot."
Several black voters and steadfast Dinkins backers in Cambria Heights, Queens, echoed these thoughts. "People make mistakes," said John Bryant, 40, a control room operator for Consolidated Edison. "Even Koch, Abe Beame and Lindsay. They all made mistakes. But this is the first black mayor, so he's under the microscope. They all made mistakes but were they penalized this bad?"
 
Anxiety Among Koreans
 Along Union Street in Flushing, Queens, a cultural and commercial hub for Koreans, reaction was far more mixed. Several Koreans said they felt the Mayor had been excessively attacked, though they singled out racial tension as an uppermost concern of theirs.
"Right now, we're anxious," said Bruce Lee, 39, a fruit and vegetable wholesaler in the Bronx who was doing business at the Korean Commercial Bank. "The Mayor I wish would pay more attention to our community."
A number of voters felt that Crown Heights was just a blip in the Dinkins years, and too much was being made of it. "I'm undecided," said Lois Karakis, who owns KB Dry Cleaners in Sunset Park and voted for Mr. Dinkins in 1989. "The Crown Heights episode won't affect my vote. It's the drug problem, the unemployment, taxes, breaks for the small business person. Take the sidewalk. I'm here alone most of the time. I have to watch the sidewalk for litter or get a $50 fine. I sweep twice a day and I'm trying to run a business. These are the things that affect my vote."
Quite a number of past Dinkins supporters said they had turned away even before the report's release. Vincent Marciari, a 69-year-old Italian who owns Blenderman's Meat Market in Kew Gardens, Queens, said the report didn't surprise him but merely affirmed his fraying opinion of the Mayor. "I always voted Democratic before," he said. "Now I'm voting for Giuliani. My wife, my son and my daughter, too."
Many of his customers, he said, feel likewise. "I've had four or five customers come in today and tell me they're not going to vote for Dinkins now," he said.
Mitchell Borstein, a 41-year-old butcher who had stopped by the store, said he voted for Mr. Giuliani last time and was going to again. "The man came into office on a platform of bringing the races together," he said of Mr. Dinkins. "It's gotten worse."

Old-Time Yank Advice And Opinion

BYLINE: By DAVE ANDERSON

 BODY:
THEY remembered Bucky Dent's playoff homer off Mike Torrez and they remembered Graig Nettles's glove at third base in the World Series, but they also remembered what Sparky Lyle fondly called "the rip sessions" on the team bus after a game.
At their Old-Timers Day reunion yesterday, many of the 1978 Yankees, the last Yankee team to win a World Series, were surveyed informally for an uncle's advice to the current Yankee players, many of whom are suddenly in a divisional pennant race for the first time. 
 "Be patient," Reggie Jackson replied. "Trust your ability. Don't force it. Let it happen."
"You got to get your unity together," Mickey Rivers said. "You got to help each other."
One way the 1978 Yankees accomplished that was to pounce verbally on a teammate who had made a costly error or who had struck out in the clutch. From the back of the team bus Catfish Hunter, Lou Piniella, Dick Tidrow and Sparky Lyle, among others, would ambush their victims.
"Nobody was immune," Lyle recalled. "Chris Chambliss once made an error that cost us a ball game in Texas and he told me later, 'The one thing I dreaded the most was getting on the bus.' But by the time we got back to the hotel, we were all laughing about whatever happened."

 
 Maybe that's the best advice of all for this Yankee team, but it takes characters to do that and it takes character to accept it.
"The closer you get in the race, people tend to put more emphasis on a particular game," Lyle said. "You just got to play solid baseball."
Jim Spencer, the backup first baseman and d.h., remembered losing the first two games of that World Series in Los Angeles.
"On the plane coming back," Spencer said, "I remember Nettles saying, 'Don't worry, the Dodgers are a different team in New York.' "
Those Yankees swept the next four games, completing a surge that began in July after they fell 14 1/2 games behind the Red Sox.
"Going into our four-game series in September in Boston, we were just hoping to close the gap, but we swept 'em to tie for first place," Nettles said. "In a pennant race, the idea is to believe in yourself. Don't let people tell you that you don't belong in the race."
That divisional race ended with the Yankees defeating the Red Sox, 5-4, in a one-game playoff at Fenway Park on homers by Bucky Dent and Jackson.
"In a pennant race," said Roy White, the Yankee left fielder that year, "you try to win every series: two out of three or three out of four."
But the 1978 Yankees were brimming with the confidence of having won the 1977 World Series after also winning the 1976 American League pennant.
"We had the feeling we were the best," Willie Randolph said. "You rely on each other. You rally around each other. You're going to have ups and downs. It's how you handle it. If you're in a slump, push another guy to pick you up. And when he's in a slump, you pick him up."

 
 This year's Yankees can't lean on the confidence that permeated the 1978 Yankees or the Yankees of Joe DiMaggio's era.
"I'd tell 'em, just keep playing as they're playing," said DiMaggio, the ultimate Yankee, "and hope they get good pitching."
But these Yankees hope to win while George Steinbrenner shills for a new stadium, another topic of conversation.
"He can do anything he wants, that man," DiMaggio said when asked about the stadium situation. "I can't help him one way or another."
Reggie Jackson, now a Yankee special adviser, acknowledged "not being caught up in the tradition" of the Bronx ball park because "the game has changed economically" since the free-agent era began.
In mentioning the need for as many as three million customers annually, Mr. October added that "the only way to do that" is with a new ball park.
Another Yankee employee, Willie Randolph, now the assistant general manager, and Nettles disagreed.
"I can't imagine a new Yankee Stadium," Randolph said. "To me, Yankee Stadium is in the Bronx."
"I think they belong here," Nettles said. "But if they go, I hope they rebuild Yankee Stadium somewhere else. I'd hate to see the Yankees playing in another type ball park."
But no matter where other Yankees play eventually, these Yankees must try to win the pennant in this Yankee Stadium.

HEADLINE: Demythologizing the Trade Pact

 BODY:
Debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement has been overheated. Critics proclaim the pact -- which would eliminate most tariffs and trade barriers with Mexico and Canada over the next 15 years -- a national catastrophe, threatening jobs, wages and the environment. Proponents claim Nafta will boost employment and that its environmental provisions are a lovely shade of green.
The truth is more mundane. Nafta would have a modest economic impact in Mexico but a trivial impact on the U.S. economy. Mexico is too small to threaten U.S. firms, and U.S. tariffs are already so low that elimination couldn't possibly lead to a flood of Mexican imports. Nafta spells neither economic salvation nor ruin. 
 Will jobs disappear? Ross Perot warns that Nafta will take jobs away from up to six million Americans -- based on the absurd calculation that the agreement threatens every worker in industries that use a lot of labor. The Administration says that Nafta will boost employment. Neither is correct.
Trade pacts affect where people work, not how many people work. Under Nafta, more Americans would find work in service industries (like insurance) and high-tech manufacturing (computers) for export to Mexico; fewer Americans would work in glass-blowing and apparel industries that would lose out to Mexican imports. But overall employment would not change. With or without Nafta, the U.S. employment rate will again hover around 6 percent once the economy recovers.
Unfortunately, the workers displaced by Mexican imports won't be the ones who find the extra work in export industries. Fortunately, the number of displaced workers would be small. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that, over 10 years, Nafta would add fewer than 500,000 to the 20 million workers who'll be displaced for other reasons.
Will wages shrink? Mr. Perot warns that U.S. firms will flee to Mexico to hire low-paid workers; employers who stay will drive down wages to Mexican levels. Some employers will relocate, but Mr. Perot's numbers are cockamamie. Most studies predict foreign investment in Mexico, an economy only one-twentieth the size of the U.S., would rise by no more than about $15 billion a year -- a tiny fraction of the $500 billion investment in plant and equipment that takes place every year in the U.S.
Besides, low wages primarily reflect low productivity, giving companies little reason to relocate -- otherwise Haiti would rule the corporate world. And because Nafta is expected to increase U.S. exports, it is as likely to raise U.S. wages as lower them -- though in neither case by very much.
Will the environment suffer? Critics charge that Nafta will encourage U.S. firms to relocate to take advantage of Mexico's notoriously lax enforcement of environmental laws. The threat is real but small. Few firms face compliance costs larger than 1 percent of total costs, which is too small to warrant the journey.
There are legitimate questions about Nafta's environmental impact: Does Nafta adequately protect U.S. health and safety standards; will it protect the environment along the border? And critics have rightly pointed to the agreement's weak environmental dispute resolution and enforcement mechanisms. But there's still time to make Nafta better when the Clinton Administration negotiates a supplemental accord on the environment.
Regional trade accords like Nafta raise troubling questions because they break with the honorable U.S. tradition of treating all trade partners alike. But Canada and Mexico are special cases because they are neighbors. And Nafta would help Mexico lock in recent market reforms that the U.S. supports. Nafta isn't an economic magic bullet, but it does some good and no great harm.

City Opera Turns 50, But Who's Counting?

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

 BODY:
Who can blame the New York City Opera for keeping its 50th-anniversary celebration low-key? The company opens its season on Wednesday evening not with an attention-grabbing gala or a trendy premiere but with plain old "Carmen," followed by a few weeks of standard repertory and operettas. There will be no exhibitions, picture books, film compilations, collaborations with other New York institutions or glittery evenings of self-congratulation.
 "No, we aren't doing that," said Christopher Keene, the company's general director. "After the 150th anniversary of the Philharmonic, the 100th of Carnegie Hall and the 100th of the Met, 50 doesn't really have that much resonance. And for me, at the tender age of 46, 50 seems younger every day." 
But the current mood of sobriety runs deeper. Mr. Keene, having in his four seasons as director raised the company's performance standards to their highest level since the mid-70's, is fighting to hold his ground in the face of a recession that has eaten into ticket sales and contributions. Attendance dropped last season from about 80 percent of capacity to 72 percent, with each point representing about $100,000 in potential revenue. Anniversary or not, the last thing Mr. Keene wants is to appear to be fiddling while Rome burns.
 True, City Opera is in good company. At the Metropolitan Opera, attendance declined 5 percent last season, to 89 percent, for a loss of almost $3 million in potential revenue. But the Met's economy is better cushioned than City Opera's, with interest from a $100 million endowment helping to cover expenses.
 City Opera has always been too busy keeping its head above water to start an endowment. It does have a small cash reserve fund, which Mr. Keene used to cover a $1 million deficit for the fiscal year just ended and a $2.9 million shortfall for the previous one. The fund now stands at $4.5 million, and Mr. Keene does not expect to have to draw on it this season, thanks largely to a $1 million challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. But he sees no similar grants on the horizon.
 To cope with these financial stresses, he has tightened administrative belts and chiseled away at the production budget. And having weathered an orchestra strike during his first season, in 1989, he found himself futilely begging the union to accept a wage freeze just as negotiations on the next contract were about to begin.
At the same time, Mr. Keene has been trying to keep an uneasy peace between his administration and the company's board, which is understandably concerned about the deficits. The board's main frustration has been the difficulty of finding new donors willing to fork over significant sums. At least one board member has suggested that the changing demographics of the city and the increased demands on both private and public funds augur poorly for the notion of "opera for the masses," the original dream of the company's founders.
 For all of that, Mr. Keene projects an air of confidence and control. The desk in his office at the New York State Theater is bare but for a few neatly stacked scores and a telephone, and his bookshelves are equally free of the trappings of administrative chaos. Although he concedes that the problems never seem to let up, nothing in his manner suggests desperation. To the contrary.
 "We are far from being in dire straits," he insisted. "We are in a tight spot. But this company always has been in a tight spot. I have a chart of famous shipwreck years in City Opera's history. In the worst of them, the deficit accounted for about 20 percent of the total budget. Our 1992 deficit was closer to 10 percent." During the tenure of his predecessor, Beverly Sills, Mr. Keene added, the deficit approached $6 million. If she could cope with that, he reasons, he can handle his current problems.
 His optimism obscures a few details. For one, Miss Sills, a famously persuasive fund-raiser, is a resource the company no longer has. She served briefly on the board after resigning as director but came to feel that Mr. Keene would not have autonomy until she left the company completely. Last year, to the chagrin of former City Opera colleagues, she joined the board of the Met. She insists that she is not raising money there and argues that her reputation for effortlessly attracting vast sums is overstated.
 "Look," she said, "it's true that I had connections. There were people who were fishing buddies of my husband's, who only gave money to the company because he called and said: 'Beverly is coming to see you. Be nice.' And when I was singing, just about every C.E.O. in the country knew that I was good for a free performance if they put on a concert to benefit handicapped children. So there was a lot that was owed to me, and when I ran City Opera, I called in the chits."
 Miss Sills had other help in clearing the $6 million debt that may not be available to Mr. Keene. "Beverly was able to wipe out that deficit," said Robert Wilson, who resigned as chairman of the board in April after a 12-year term, "because at the time, Lloyd Rigler loaned the company $3 million and then forgave part of the loan, and I gave the company $1 million. But there were special circumstances then. We felt that before Beverly the company had not been well managed. Julius Rudel was conducting rather than minding the store, and the finances were a mess. We thought that Beverly's arrival was the start of a new era, that she would manage the company well, and therefore it should be saved. Beverly did manage it well, and so did Christopher. And now my feeling is that if it can't hack it under good management, why pour more money into it?"
 Mr. Rigler could not be reached to discuss future contributions, but he was just elected co-chairman of the board with Irwin Schneiderman, who said that accepting the position implied a commitment to keeping the company alive.
 Mr. Wilson, who remains on the board, pledged in 1989 to give the company $2.5 million in installments through 1995. When asked whether he expected to contribute after 1995, he said, "I hope to continue to be generous." Mr. Wilson has lately become a voice in the wilderness at board meetings, arguing that if the company does not change its ways, it will run out of money before the end of next season.
 "In the early 1980's," he said, "the critics were excoriating our performances, and not without reason. Artistically, they were appalling. So we decided to do what we could to improve the quality. Doing that has been expensive. But I think in recent years it has been universally conceded that the quality is up. Unfortunately, our box office is exactly what it was when we were a second-rate company, and our contributor base has not grown either. So the question I raised was, 'If the audience doesn't appreciate the difference, why should we keep spending money to make this a first-rate company?' "
 Mr. Wilson's argument has found little support at City Opera or elsewhere. "I disagree with him," said Joseph Volpe, general manager of the Met. "It could be that if they had not improved the quality, the audience would have dropped another 20 percent."
 Mr. Schneiderman also dismisses Mr. Wilson's theory, while agreeing that expenses must be trimmed. "Our budget is around $22 million," he said, "but based on our public support, maybe we really should be a $20 million company. We're trying hard to get ourselves working within our means. But if you look at what we're doing, you'll see the difficulty. Christopher is not spending a lot of money on productions."
 Indeed not. Mr. Keene says he will not approve a budget of more than $250,000 for a production that will stay in the repertory. (Met productions can top $1 million.) For specialist productions his ceiling is $120,000. Often, the costs are well under those limits. Bernd Alois Zimmermann's notoriously difficult "Die Soldaten" cost $65,000 two seasons ago, and Schoenberg's "Moses und Aron" was bought from the Cologne Opera for only $35,000 in 1990.
 Not much money is wasted on performers, either. The top fee for singers and conductors is $1,750 a night -- "with no exceptions," Mr. Keene said --compared with a $12,000 limit at the Met and even higher fees in Europe. The fee structure makes for a transient roster and for even more artistic and commercial frustration.
 Great singers have passed through City Opera: Placido Domingo, Jennie Tourel, Mignon Dunn, Tatiana Troyanos, Jose Carreras, Norman Triegle. A few, like Miss Sills and Samuel Ramey, formed an attachment to the company and continued to sing with it long after their earning power outpaced City Opera's pay scale. But with the best singers being snapped up by other companies, long-term casting is impossible, and the company cannot rely on stars to lure its audience.
 THIS PROBLEM CAN BE TRACED back to City Opera's earliest days, as in fact can most of its current problems. Debates over repertory have been almost continuous. The company's founding music director, Laszlo Halasz, clashed with the board over his desire to conduct contemporary works. He won the battle, establishing contemporary music as part of the company's mandate. During Mr. Rudel's tenure as general director, from 1957 to 1979, the company stepped up its commitment to new music, a commitment Mr. Keene has fought to uphold. Significantly, 20th-century music makes up the heart of the anniversary season, with a new production of Sir Michael Tippett's "Midsummer Marriage" in September, and a weeklong premiere festival of works by Ezra Laderman, Lukas Foss and Hugo Weisgall in October.
 In the face of mounting costs and dangerous deficits, Mr. Wilson wonders whether it makes sense for the company to be adventurous, even though he finds its contemporary productions the most appealing. "Very few people are interested in adventure," he observed. "When we present something unusual, or when I go to the Brooklyn Academy of Music, I see the same old crowd. They can fill the hall for three or four performances, but that's it. And we can't afford that."
 Yet it is mainly when City Opera presents unusual repertory that Mr. Wilson's dream of luring the Met's audience comes true. Mr. Volpe of the Met said: "How many Met patrons went to hear 'Moses und Aron'? I know that when I went, I saw a lot of people I normally see at the Met."
 Of the 226 works City Opera will have presented by the end of this season, 76 are by 20th-century American composers. The list includes musicals and theater pieces, which multiplied during Miss Sills's tenure. Miss Sills accepted a $5 million grant from Lawrence Wien to produce musicals every year for five seasons and saw them as a way to provide the extra performance weeks required by the orchestra players' contracts. But since those who control the rights to the best musicals tend to hold out for Broadway revivals, City Opera is left with second-rate properties like "110 in the Shade" and "The Pajama Game." Many operagoers -- and not only critics -- have questioned the appropriateness of these works as opera house fare.
 "Some of our board members feel that doing these musicals is a mistake," Mr. Schneiderman volunteered. "We don't do them all that well. They don't fit the company's image. The only reason we're doing them is to provide work for the orchestra, and we can't keep doing that."
 Budgets and ticket sales have always been headaches, too. In the 1950's, attendance sometimes fluctuated between 55 and 65 percent. (In those years, the company played at City Center, about the same size as the New York State Theater, which seats 3,000.) And insolvency has always lurked in the wings. Newspaper articles have repeatedly warned of the company's demise.
 But Mr. Keene and the board recognize that survival takes more than faith, and in their more realistic moments, they admit that they are facing problems peculiar to the 90's. Corporate sponsors think twice about contributing to the arts when social welfare programs are also demanding their support. And as a New York culture shaped by European immigrants gives way to one with strong third-world strains, the company will have to work harder to renew its audience.
 Some changes are afoot. The board is trying to start an endowment campaign. And Mr. Keene has decided to revert to a spring-fall season, abandoning the summer weeks in 1995. Miss Sills moved the spring weeks to summer in 1984, thinking that without competition from the Met, City Opera would have the opera audience, including tourists, to itself. The summer season worked for a season or two but has since been a liability.
 The shift to the spring, of course, will put City Opera back into direct competition with the Met, but neither company seems worried. Mr. Keene cited some business-world folk wisdom: "The best place to put a gas station is on a street that already has one." At the Met, which in the early 1960's objected vehemently to Lincoln Center's plan to put City Opera on its doorstep, disdain for the smaller company has apparently evaporated.
 "My view of the City Opera is very positive," said Mr. Volpe. "If you look at opera companies in the United States, you see that the more companies there are, the better aware the public is, and that helps all companies. We know that many of our patrons go to the City Opera, and some of theirs come here. We don't see it as a problem."
 Miss Sills takes Mr. Volpe's observation a step further, offering the cheerful view that the half-empty glass is actually half full. "Let me point out," she said, "that if the City Opera is playing to a 72 percent capacity, that means that there are more than 2,000 people there, night after night. That's more than can be accommodated in a normal-size opera house in Europe, where the capacities are more like 1,500. And it's in addition to another 3,500 at the Met, 25 yards away. That's an enormous number of people coming to hear opera.
 "So here's City Opera, a repertory company fighting a rival that's one of the world's great houses, and still drawing a crowd that would sell out a European house. It's ridiculous, if you think about it. And that's why I think that whatever its problems, the company will survive."
FIVE DECADES ON AN OPERATIC ROLLER COASTER
 1943 -- Newbold Morris, president of the City Council, and Morton Baum, a lawyer, outline a plan for City Center, a venue for reasonably priced theater, opera, ballet and concerts at the Mecca Temple on West 55th Street. 1944 -- Mayor Fiorello La Guardia sells the first ticket for New York City Opera's first production, "Tosca," led by Laszlo Halasz, the music director. Reviews are enthusiastic.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 25, 1993, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article in the Arts and Leisure section on July 25 about the New York City Opera misstated the percentage of decline in ticket sales last season at the Metropolitan Opera. It was 3 percent, not 5. The Met reported the error shortly after the article appeared; this correction was delayed by an editing lapse.

Sea Grass, Tidal Creeks and New Homes

BYLINE: By LYN RIDDLE

DATELINE: ST. SIMONS ISLAND, GA.

 BODY:
Not too many years ago, the grassy wetlands between this picturesque island and the mainland was considered wasteland, good only for filling in so it could be built upon.
Some islanders, like the novelist Eugenia Price, have lived on large tracts beside the marshes here for decades. 
 But now dozens of housing developments have been built on the mainland sides of the long string of barrier islands on the nation's Southern shore.
Four housing developments are under way beside the marshes here, testifying to what brokers say is the steadily increasing interest in the quiet landscape of sea grass and tidal creeks.
Georgia has only 100 miles of oceanfront, and most of the land that is not permanently protected -- 7 of its 14 barrier islands are owned by either the state or Federal government -- has already been developed.
That scarcity has increased the cost of oceanfront property to $6,000 a foot, and consequently, marshfront land has increased in value, too, said Vernon Mims, a broker with Island Realty here. He estimates the value has grown by at least 35 percent in the past few years.
On St. Simons, an island of 12,000 residents about 290 miles southeast of Atlanta and just 45 miles north of Florida, marshfront lots of 0.75 acre cost about $100,000, Mr. Mims said. Marshfront homes now on the market range in price from $180,000 to $675,000.
St. Simons and the neighboring Jekyll and Sea Islands -- collectively called the Golden Isles -- have long been popular vacation and second-home resorts.
Jekyll, now owned by the state, once was an exclusive retreat for the Rockefeller, Vanderbilt and Morgan families, and later served as a vacation retreat for Jimmy Carter while he was President.
Just east of St. Simons, Sea Island is the location of The Cloister, a well-known resort popular for honeymoons. George and Barbara Bush spent theirs there.
St. Simons, home to Spanish monks in the 1500's, looks like what it is: a town first, resort area second. It has numerous neighborhoods, a few condominiums, and a small downtown with a drugstore, shops and restaurants. After the English drove out the Spanish in the 1700's, St. Simons fostered a thriving timber industry.
In fact, timbers from the island's live oaks were used in building the Brooklyn Bridge in 1874. The Atlantic lies to the east, and the Marshes of Glynn, dramatized in the poem by that name by Sidney Lanier, to the west.
Duane Harris, the director of the coastal resources division of the state's Department of Natural Resources, said Georgia was one of the first states to protect marshland. in 1970, the Legislature outlawed altering its 450,000 acres of wetlands for any purpose other than a water-related activity.
The law was passed after a University of Georgia professor conducting research on nearby Sapalo Island found that as the smooth cord grass in the marshes died, the decaying plants provided food for fish for 30 to 40 miles off shore. He set the value of the marshes themselves at $80,000 an acre, Mr. Harris said.
But the land beside the marshes has some restrictions. Houses must be built at least 13 feet above ground, 25 feet away from the marsh and cannot be taller than 25 feet above the platform. If the property owner owns the marshland adjacent to his house, he can build a walkway across it without a permit from the state.
The attraction to the marshes is simple, brokers and people who live there say: No one can build behind you.
"It's a natural buffer," said Lee Davenport, the executive director of the St. Simons Chamber of Commerce, who is building a house in West Point Lake subdivision, one of the new marshfront developments. "You won't ever have any neighbors on that side."
Also, the marshes offer an array of wildlife, from otters and alligators in the creeks to deer and 200-pound wild black pigs.
Miss Price, the writer, has lived on a four-acre tract beside the marshes since 1967. In "St. Simons Memoir," a book recalling how she came to live on St. Simons, she wrote: "I am so captivated by the dear, dark woods that I now find the ocean almost dull."
Doris Green, who moved from Pennsylvania to a marshfront home when her late husband, Wilson, retired a decade ago, said, "It is very peaceful. Beautiful sunsets, colors change. It's very golden at times." The drawbacks, though, are pesky, persistent deer flies and deer, which ate nearly all her husband's prize rose bushes before he built an electric fence around them.
Mrs. Green's neighbor, Joe Adams, a Delta Airlines captain, said deer had eaten $600 worth of shrubbery at his 3,800-square-foot house, which is on the market for $675,000. Mr. Adams owns about an acre of highland and two acres of marsh up to the Frederica River, which is accessible via a 1,000-foot walkway across the marsh. He said he was selling because his children were grown and the house is too big for just him and his wife.
Most of the people building in the West Point Lake subdivision are professionals, like Dr. James Grooms, a local dermatologist, who is building a large home beside the marsh. A few are buying lots to build retirement homes in the future. About a third of the 36 lots in the subdivision have marsh views; the rest border on a small lake.
The other subdivisions are Hampton Plantation, Hampton Point and Oglethorpe Landing. The 290-acre Hampton Plantation has 75 of its 290 lots on the marsh. Marshfront lots range in price from $69,000 to $175,000, said Nick Joseph, the vice president of sales and marketing.
The development's 18-hole golf course has four holes built on hummocks in the marsh and connected by 800 feet of bridges,
The smaller Oglethorpe Plantation, comprising 18 acres, has 5 marshfront lots ranging in price from $63,000 to $139,000, said Linda Morton, a broker with Parker-Kaufman Realty in St. Simons.
Hampton Plantation's riverfront lots sold within 20 minutes for $75,000 apiece when the project was begun in the 80's, Mr. Harris said. The marshfront lots were not as popular, but interest has increased in recent years.
All of the developments are on the northern, largely undeveloped, end of the island.
At the center of the island is Sea Palms, 800 acres where development began about 20 years ago. Larry Singleton bought the three nine-hole golf courses, convention center, hotel and tennis center in December from the Chase Manhattan Bank, which had foreclosed on the previous owners. He said the purchase price was $10 million.
Mr. Singleton said that about 100 acres of undeveloped land included in the sale would be used for single-family homes.
The development has some riverfront property, but most of the "waterfront" is actually marshfront. The 180-room Sea Palms Golf & Tennis Resort hotel is beside the marsh.
"People probably thought the original developers were crazy," Mr. Singleton said. "People didn't want anything to do with it, worrying that they're going to go underwater every time the tide comes in."
But Mr. Singleton said he and his staff, all local residents, had managed to turn the development around in the last six months. He pared the staff by 100, including 20 managers, and now has about 140 employees.
"This place is making money," he said, "because every single person grew up here and the support is unbelievable from the community."
Last year, he said, the average occupancy rate was 45 percent. Now he said, it is 65 percent.
Mr. Singleton said the stigma of the marshes just doesn't exist any longer.
"You look out our hotel windows and that's what you see," he said. "Down here, marsh is second only to the ocean."

HEADLINE: Thousands of Missing-Persons Cases

BYLINE: By LISA BETH PULITZER

 BODY:
WHEN Florence Orvieto of Stony Brook learned the fate of her daughter Lorraine, whose death was linked to Joel Rifkin, the reported serial killer, this month, she was shocked by more than the circumstances surrounding the case. The body of her daughter, she learned, was found, but not identified, exactly one year ago and had been lying in a morgue in New York City despite a missing person's report filed in Suffolk County in January 1992.
Lorraine Orvieto, 29, was one of nearly 5,000 people reported missing last year on Long Island. But the police said her case was extremely uncommon. 
 "We handle between 2,500 to 3,000 missing persons cases a year," said Officer John Gmelch of the Suffolk County missing persons unit and a member of the team that investigated the Orvieto case. "The totals seem to stay roughly the same. I think only one-10th of 1 percent are murdered or meet with foul play."
That statistic offered little solace to the Orvieto family, who spent more than 18 months searching for their daughter.
An investigator for the state police office in Farmingdale, Edward Lloyd, said that at least five of the victims identified in the Rifkin case were the subjects of missing persons reports,but that just Anna Lopez of the Bronx had been identified through a missing person's report.
 
'Part of Tracking Problem'
 "I think it is part of the tracking problem," said Craig McCrary of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Behavioral Science Center in Quantico, Va. The center, which studies serial killers, was portrayed in "Silence of the Lambs," the movie released in 1991, the year that Mr. Rifkin reportedly began his spree.
"Right now in the United States," Mr. McCrary added, "there is no one place to report homicides. We have over 17,000 different police agencies. That means missing persons and homicides get reported and are spread out over 17,000 different agencies."
He said his agency had set up the Violent Criminal Apprehension Program. "The idea is to get as many homicides in this computer system and then look for matches and similarities to begin to identify patterns early on where we may be having a serial killer," he said.
 
Arrested on Parkway
 In the case of Mr. Rifkin, a self-described unemployed landscaper, who lived with his mother and sister in a quiet middle-class neighborhood in East Meadow, the police did not learn of his activities until he was apprehended in a traffic case. He was arrested on June 28, after two state troopers had tried to stop him on the Southern State Parkway because his pickup had no license plates and found the decomposing body of Tiffany Bresciani, 22, wrapped in a blue tarpaulin in the back of his truck.
They said Mr. Rifkin later told them that he was on his way to Republic Airport, where he intended to dispose of the body, but no shovel was found in his truck, just some tools.
In 12 hours of questioning by investigators at the state police office in Farmingdale, Mr. Rifkin admitted to killing 17 women, all of whom he said where prostitutes from New York City, according to the police.
"One reason prostitutes are favored victims of serial killers is they lead a very transient life style," Mr. McCrary said. "They come and they go. This is a common problem, especially in a large metropolitan area like New York. After all, who if anybody tracks missing prostitutes?"
The police can accept a missing person's report on people over the age of 18 only if there is evidence of foul play or the subject has a history of mental illness or requires medication.
In the report filed by the family of Lorraine Orvieto, whose body was found on July 11, 1992, by a fisherman in a drum in Coney Island Creek in Brooklyn, relatives described her as manic depressive, a cocaine abuser and a former psychiatric patient.
Although the Suffolk police did conduct a search, her body was not identified until her driver's license was found in Mr. Rifkin's bedroom.
"Why there wasn't a match I couldn't tell you," Officer Gmelch said. "The condition of the body possibly. But in most cases where a person has been dead for a long time the only way to identify the body is through dental records. But you have to have something to match the dental records up with."
 
Juveniles Among Missing
 Of the cases filed in Suffolk last year almost two-thirds were juveniles. For the group 15 and younger, most were runaways. In Nassau the number of juveniles among those reported missing was a little more than half.
"Youngsters get into a fight with their parents and they take off," said Lieut. Robert Reed, commander of the juvenile and missing persons unit in Nassau.
Fifty-seven percent of the juvenile cases reported involve females under 17, but for those younger than 12 most reports involve boys.
"They generally don't like the rules at home," the head of the missing persons unit in Suffolk, Sgt. Paul Schiefke, said. "They feel the parents are too strict."
The police said although most youngsters returned home on their own, sometimes the police obtain a lead or other clues about the youngsters' whereabouts from friends. The police may also learn that the youngsters' friends are "hiding them out."
"It is very rare that they don't turn up," Sergeant Schiefke said. "I don't think we have any active cases where a child under the age of 16 has been abducted or not returned."
Nationwide nearly 31,000 children were reported missing from 1984 to 1992, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Of those 20,594 were located alive, 304 were found dead and 9,000 remain missing.
According to police statistics 65 percent of missing people voluntarily return home or are found in 48 hours, 82 percent in seven days, 87 percent in 14 days, 94 percent in 30 days and 99.9 percent in six months to a year.
There are about 10 classifications for missing people, including endangered, runaway, mentally or physically affected, suicidal and possible drowning victim.
For missing adults, the police said, 99 percent leave voluntarily, usually because of domestic or employment problems. "Adults who are missing usually do not want to be found," Sergeant Schiefke said. "They are always a mystery. There's always something else involved."
 
In Another Life
 One man in Suffolk whose wife reported him missing was found by the police almost eight years later in Massachusetts selling aluminum siding and living with a different family.
In another case, a man from Long Island reportedly drove his car onto the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, parked it, and disappeared. No one witnessed his jumping, but his body was never recovered.
The police follow certain guidelines when filing a missing person's report. "We follow any leads the person reporting the person tells us," Sergeant Schiefke said.
After 30 days a more detailed report that includes dental records is registered with the State Division of Criminal Justice computer system. The information -- body descriptions, including tattoos, dental work and other characteristics -- is matched to people missing statewide and nationwide.
"Let's say someone finds a body, a skeleton in the woods of Ohio," Officer Gmelch said. "They would take it to the Medical Examiner's office. He may estimate that it is a female, age 20-40, about 5 feet 5 inches. The computer will then match every female that is around 5 feet 5 inches."
"These are done on all cases," Sergeant Schiefke said. "If there is any hit any place in the country, any kind of match, two or three descriptive characters that might pop up, we follow that lead. The information stays in an active file for years and years. We have some cases from 1937."
The police said that in his confession Mr. Rifkin had described how he had bought sex from his victims, all petite, strangled or suffocated them, and disposed of their bodies throughout the region. He took one break, said Lieut. Eugene Corcoran of the state police in Farmingdale, to telephone his mother. Lieutenant Corcoran said that was the only time that Mr. Rifkin became emotional in the interrogation.
As investigators were questioning her son, Mrs. Rifkin was meeting with the police, who spent at least four hours in her house.
Mr. Rifkin's lawyer, Robert Sale, said the police had told her that her son was being detained because of traffic violations. "I'm the one who told her of what we later learned to be the allegations," he said.
In an interview at his office in Hempstead, Mr. Sale, an associate of Eric W. Naiburg, Amy Fisher's lawyer, indicated that he was displeased with how the police conducted their investigation.
The other day the Westchester County police identified an 18th victim and linked the body to Mr. Rifkin, who was in the Nassau County jail.
"I can say that if Amelia Erhardt's body washed up on shore, it would not surprise me if they tried to link Joel Rifkin to her disappearance," said Mr. Sale, former bureau chief of county and district court for the Nassau County Legal Aid Society, where he worked from 1968 to 1976.
"I would guess that first of all, most of these bodies were not found until the perpetrator literally took the police to them," said Jim Omohundro of the uniform crime-reporting program of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. "So if they don't have a body they don't know a murder has been committed. Without a body, it's just a missing person's report, and a missing person is simply not a criminal matter.
"In terms of linking them to a single guy the question is even if they uncover isolated bodies in different jurisdictions, how are they going to know they are dealing with a serial killer unless there is some sort of a database linking homicide victims."
When a person is missing, or murdered, but no missing person's report has been filed, it is nearly impossible to identify the body. "Who knows who they are if nobody reports them missing?" Sergeant Schiefke said.
 
Timne-Consuming Process
 Looking for a missing person is not as glamorous as it appears on television. Officer Gmelch said in many cases identifications were made through hundreds of telephone calls in a time-consuming process.
One problem is that all information must be obtained through official channels, he said, adding, "Everything has to be done on official letterhead," to check mental institutions, drug-rehabilitation centers and hospitals. "Once a letter is sent the check may not come back right away. It could take months."

HEADLINE: Toward Broader Ambulance Coverage

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
SHOULD you be stricken suddenly with a heart attack or a stroke, geography can determine whether you live or die, contends Lenore A. Minerva, owner of Empress Ambulance Service in Yonkers.
"If you're stricken in New Rochelle, Mount Vernon or Yonkers, you will have a good chance of surviving, but if you happen to be in Hastings or Dobbs Ferry, for example, you are going to have a real problem," Ms. Minerva said, explaining that those communities, unlike New Rochelle, Mount Vernon and Yonkers, don't have advance-life-support emergency medical-service systems with paramedics on call 24 hours a day. 
 What Ms. Minerva would like to see is an around-the-clock uniform system of emergency care in Westchester to make sure that everyone in the county has access to emergency medical services.
"Right now, emergency service is patchwork," she said. "Some communities have good systems; others have spotty, infrequent service. My goal is to convince everyone that medical emergency service is so important that it should be put on a par with fire and police departments."
 
Started in 1976
 She continued, "Service could be integrated into the volunteer emergency medical ambulance corps that now exist in many Westchester communities simply by adding 24-hour advance-life-support paramedic systems."
Ms. Minerva added, "In all five boroughs of New York City, they have advance-life-support systems in operation around the clock, and they are saving lives every day."
Ms. Minerva's company, Empress Ambulance Service, is the largest provider of medical services in the Hudson Valley region, responding to approximately 165 calls for immediate medical help a day, 60,000 calls a year with a fleet of 45 ambulances backed by 200 employees.
"The company has come a long way since my husband, Daniel, started in business in 1976," Ms. Minerva said. "All we had was an idea, a bank loan and one van."
 
Mobility for the Handicapped
 The company started by the Minervas was American Ambulette, a medical-transportation business that Ms. Minerva still owns, and the van was used to take physically impaired people back and forth to their appointments or for medical treatment or to their jobs.
"That type of service, which made it possible for physically challenged people to go on normal errands, didn't exist at the time," Ms. Minerva said. "We found a niche in the market.".
By 1983, American Ambulette, in conjunction with the county, developed a pilot program to provide transportation to physically handicapped residents.
In two years' time, the Paratransit program was operating countywide, and it now provides transportation for 350 people a day in a fleet of 100 ambulettes.
"The county, namely County Executive Andrew O'Rourke, were really farsighted when they initiated this program," Ms. Minerva said. "It gives people who never had it before mobility."
She continued, "Now they will be able to get to work, go to school and, in joining the mainstream, they are also able to pay taxes and return something to society."
She added that the Americans with Disabilities Act will only increase the need for transportation for many more people in the near future.
Empress Ambulance Service -- which was a three-ambulance concern in Yonkers when the Minervas acquired it in 1985 to "protect our position in the industry and give us a base to enter the emergency-services segment of it" -- has now grown to a fleet of 45 ambulances.
"Later in the year after we bought Empress," Ms. Minerva added, "we got approval to become the sole provider of emergency medical services for the city of Yonkers, and the next year we became the advance-life-support-system emergency medical service provider for New Rochelle and Mount Vernon."
In 1988, Empress introduced what is called a paramedic fly-car system, which is integrated into the ambulance service to shorten response time.
"With fly car, we are on the scene in 4 to 10 minutes," Ms. Minerva said. "A fly car, which has one or two paramedics and is fitted out with all the necessary advance-support equipment, is always the first vehicle on the scene."
The paramedics assess the patient's condition and begin treatment. "Our paramedics are certified by the New York State Department of Health, which requires 1,800 hours of both clinical and classroom work," Ms. Minerva said.
 
A Life-and-Death Business
 She added, "Paramedics represent the highest level of pre-hospital technicians, trained to carry out a variety of lifesaving procedures on patients."
Two-way radio equipment enables the paramedics to follow the orders of a doctor who is on call at St. Joseph's Medical Center in Yonkers to advise them on standard operating procedures, Ms. Minerva said.
"I only wish my husband had had such prompt lifesaving treatment when he had what turned out to be a fatal heart attack in 1988," she said. "The ambulance that we called didn't arrive for 20 minutes. I gave him CPR, but it was not enough. I never forget for one day that we are in a life-and-death business."
Since her husband died, Ms. Minerva, who is 50, has been the company's chief executive officer and chairwoman. Robert H. Pontbriand is president, and the three Minerva sons, Michael, Daniel and Matthew, are an integral part of the company.
 
A Separate Company Established
 "They love the business and have been involved in it ever since they were old enough to work in the company during the summers," Ms. Minerva said. "The boys have a lot of energy, and we are planning expansions. For instance, two years ago we started providing high-risk transport for the Westchester County Medical Center and a year later contracted with the medical center to supply them with A.L.S.-staffed ambulances at the center."
More recently, she added, the company has expanded into other municipalities in the county, signing contracts to handle emergency medical services in a joint effort with the volunteer corps of Harrison and Yorktown.
Despite the sluggish economy, Empress grossed $11 million in sales last year, and American Ambulette grossed $5 million.
Those figures, Ms. Minerva said, are a result of "watching spending and costs like a hawk."
She added: "This is a business that requires a large capital outlay -- a fully equipped ambulance costs $65,000, and our payroll is large. Although there are always sick people who need our services, our cash flow is slow and profit margins thin.
"We deal with so many hundreds of claims that some years ago I developed a computer program to handle the billing and the administration. It grew into a free-standing company that we run called Medical Billing Systems, which markets electronic billing systems for all phases of the medical transportation industry."
Small wonder, then, that last month Ms. Minerva was selected as one of 11 business owners in southern New England and suburban New York to be named Entrepreneur of the Year in a program started by the accounting firm of Ernst & Young to recognize and honor outstanding business owners and founders. Ms. Minerva is now entered in the national competition for the Entrepreneur of the Year Award to be announced later this year.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Q & A: Ruth Pierson Churchill;
Years of Elegance, a Life of Good Works

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY HORNER

DATELINE: CHATHAM TOWNSHIP

 BODY:
"I REMEMBER every detail," Ruth Pierson Churchill said. She was recalling the time -- almost a century ago -- when the communities of Chatham, Madison and Florham Park were known for their manor houses, landed estates and world-famous rose nurseries. And well she might, for Mrs. Churchill is the granddaughter of Louis Mulford Noe, whose rose greenhouses and dairy farms once ranged over several hundred acres of this area.
Mrs. Churchill will celebrate her 97th birthday on Aug. 22, but her age seems to have barely reduced her schedule. 
 In recent months, she received an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters at the Drew University commencement, in recognition of the 30 years of research she devoted to placing the university's Mead Hall on the National Register of Historic Places. (The award spoke of her long connection with Drew and of the fact that she had "dated one of our most noted seminarians.")
She was honorary chairwoman of Centenary College Alumni Association Day. And her book of personal essays, "Memories Entwined With Roses," first published in 1984, went into its third printing.
In some ways, for a well-to-do woman of that day, Mrs. Churchill was a pioneer. She attended a local private school, Centenary Collegiate Institute (which became Centenary College) and then a finishing school in Washington before going on to Smith College and a Phi Beta Kappa key. But then she joined the Overseas Relief Service in Chateau-Thierry, France, where she assisted war-torn families. And in 1921 she was living in Greenwich Village and working on an atlas for the Rockefeller Foundation.
And yet, in other ways, she resembled her contemporaries. "I am very domestic," she said, describing her pride in Arthur Burdett Churchill, an advertising executive, whom she married in 1923, and the achievements of her three children, Emily, Martha and John, and their offspring.
Q. What is the question you're most often asked?
A. How do you have so much energy at this time of your life? I do what I have to do and take it as it comes. But I can boil it up. Recently -- one after the other -- there was the Centenary College event; next, I autographed 100 of my books in a reception given me by the Historical Society of Chatham Township. The week before, there was the Drew award, followed by a family reunion with 30 kids here.
When I was 88, I was quoted as saying that I take no vitamins, but now I take six pills -- some for I don't know what. I've always been athletic, love gardening and eat a great deal of fruits and vegetables, but nowhere near the red meat I once did.
Q. You had a special way of life -- being driven to church in a coach, enjoying shopping excursions to New York City to the Ladies' Mile and then lunch at the Waldorf. Did you ever have contact with the economically deprived?
A. When we were children, often tramps would stop by our home. Mother couldn't say no, and they were always fed on the back porch -- -- probably knowing that ours was a hospitable home because of marks they put on the telephone poles. She'd also invite poor children to come up from Newark for picnics.
There was no welfare then, but we had those wonderful gardens, and Mother would have big baskets of fruits and vegetables sent to sick and poor people.
Q. For 25 years you served on the board of the Morris County Welfare Board. To what do you attribute your concern?
A. Again, to my mother, who taught us that we were privileged children who had to do things for others.
We were Protestants, but there was a Catholic nun who visited. We'd get culls -- that what they called greenhouse roses without straight stems -- and give them to her for the altar.
The club I belonged to as a child -- we called ourselves the Busy Bees -- held fairs to give a little black girl an artifical limb. Mother regularly gave dinners in Madison for some black boys; they were only about 10 years old and weren't permitted to use the Y.M.C.A.
Q. The rose industry then employed hundreds of newly arrived immigrants.
A. In a way, Grandfather's estate was like a Southern plantation. Grandfather was always called "the Big Boss" and Grandmother, "Mother Noe." Several of the hired men lived in small rooms in the potting sheds and had their meals at the Boarding House located at the top of the hill on Noe Avenue. There was no place for families to gather until the 1920's, when the Neighborhood House was built; it had running water and cooking facilities, but the outhouse was nearby.
All those people working -- Irish, Italians, German -- were poor people. The Italians had to walk all the way from Madison; there was a big Italian colony there. They came in by the day to plow the field, and their social life also depended on the Neighborhood House. But those were happy times, and Noe Farm was considered a big family working together -- before suburbia took over the area.
Q. Have you kept in touch with any of those workers?
A. Yes, because at one time many people in Madison could say that some member of their family worked on the Noe farm.
Q. What problems did you observe in the early years of the 20th century?
A. Alcoholism was a problem. There was a lot more drunkenness on the streets. When I was a youngster, the famous Battle Hill Tavern on the corner of Waverly Place and Main Street was really a saloon, and often drunks would stagger out through its swinging doors into the arms of Captain Johnson, Madison's only police officer. "Walk on the other side of the street," Mother would warn.
We had pollution and didn't know it. The soft coal that caused it was essential to the greenhouses, and Grandfather Noe purchased property near the Chatham railroad station, where he had his own private siding to receive it. A large farm wagon pulled by horses delivered coal to our house, and the careful driver would sprinkle it with cold water to control the dust.
Q. Much of your time has been on behalf of historical preservation of landmarks. Do you think the newer immigrants entering Morris County -- and the rest of New Jersey -- have the potential for such devotion?
A. I listened the other night to a debate on television about whether America can become a melting pot or whether the way will be diversity, and I think diversity will win out. This is going to be a whole different world, and historic preservation may not be a major concern.
But I'm not worried; the world has changed so much in my lifetime. It's better to think of what immigration brings. There are brilliant people who are going to come out of this, to lead us on to something else.
When I look back, my grandmother was so prejudiced against Catholics. My son married a Catholic; I have three grandchildren baptized in the Catholic church and a granddaughter married to a wonderful Jewish man. My family was Methodist, and I'm Unitarian. And I just don't think of race. I would rather my child be married to a fine man of another race rather than to someone who didn't love her. I've changed; I've really changed a lot.
Q. You mention having been a widow for more than 26 years. What has helped sustain you?
A. I could never go into a group to be helped. I'm a person who is strong in my individuality because I realize that everything has to die -- even trees die. The night my husband died, I was in the room with him and he was suffering so, I couldn't stand it. I stood out in the corridor, and a nurse said, "Hello, dearie, how do you feel?" and I said, "Awful, I'm just praying that my husband will die."
When the doctor called and said he had died, my son was there. He cried, and I cried.
I don't mourn. I just think of the wonderful life I had with him. Of course, it's different when you're a widow and you don't have a fine husband to go with, but I made it on my own. I've traveled worldwide. I've had beaus. Two wonderful men wanted to marry me, but I didn't want to get married.
Q. You say you were a maverick growing up, and yet there were social rules you obeyed. What do you mean?
A. When I was in finishing school, a young man had to buy tickets for the chaperone when he took me out. It's so much better now that things are out in the open. Living together shocked me at first, but then I went off to Hawaii with a man who wanted to marry me.
Q. You make it sound as if you've made a very successful transition from the formal world that you knew so well.
A. I enjoy being free, dressing in jeans and a sweater, still being able to drive, to shop and cook for myself. I don't miss the fussiness, and yet sometimes I yearn for the elegance of the old days -- the coachman in high hat and gloves, the flowers, the beautiful serving, finger bowls and butter balls, the planned things versus helter-skelter and our managing to eat meals together. It was lovely, and sometimes I still make butter balls.

HEADLINE: Yonkers Fighting To Save Rail-Car Jobs

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: YONKERS

 BODY:
THE last three subway cars bound for Taiwan stood on test tracks awaiting a final run at the once-busy Union Rail Car plant here. Alan Suarez, an assembly-line technician, removed his baseball cap to mop his brow and wondered where he would turn next for work.
Union Rail Car, which over the last year manufactured 132 subway cars for Taipei's rapidly growing transit system, recently lost a bid to build 216 more cars for the capital of Taiwan. The contract was instead awarded in early May to a German company whose bid was lower because, according to United States officials, it subcontracted part of the deal to a company subsidized by the South African Government. Officials in Washington are investigating the matter and hope to convince Taipei's Department of Rapid Transit Systems to reverse its decision on the ground that South Africa violated United States and international trade laws. The South African manufacturer, however, denied that any Government subsidy was involved, and Taiwan claimed that the Yonkers company was a front for a Japanese conglomerate. 
 While all sides quarrel about international trade practices, Mr. Suarez and other employees at Union Rail Car are worried about more immediate concerns -- like how they will pay their bills and provide for their families if their company no longer has a job for them.
"I'm bracing myself," said Mr. Suarez, who is 32 years old and has been at Union Rail Car for seven years. "For now, everything in my life is on hold -- even my plans to get married."
At its peak two years ago, there were 220 workers at this company, which is in a sprawling industrial park, originally the home of the Otis Elevator Company, along the Hudson River. Fifty employees remain today, as work on the Taipei contract winds down and only a small order of eight cars from New York City's Transit Authority waits to be filled.
As it is for many blue-collar workers in the country who depend on a dwindling supply of manufacturing jobs for their living, Union Rail Car's workers face not only layoffs but also few prospects for future employment.
Highly paid production workers are fading fast in America as domestic companies lose contracts to global competitors and fight to keep up with advances in technology, said Frank M. Surdey, a regional economist with the State Department of Labor.
The hard facts are that the state had only 981,800 manufacturing jobs in May, the lowest number since 1958, when figures were first recorded. There were 1.8 million manufacturing jobs then.
Westchester has also been hard hit. In May, the county recorded only 46,600 manufacturing jobs, its lowest count ever for the month. And more job losses in the manufacturing sector are expected in coming years -- especially two years from now when General Motors lays off more than 2,000 workers at its North Tarrytown plant.
Typically, production workers earn about $12 an hour, and those like Mr. Suarez in the transportation industry who build autos, buses and subways, earn up to $20 an hour, Mr. Surdey said. "Maybe I'll have to move to find work," said Mr. Suarez, who was born in Ecuador and became a United States citizen when he was 7. "Maybe I'll have to retrain. But it's not like I'm a waiter and can go anywhere to get a job." He said that there were only a few major rolling- stock manufacturers in the United States. Officials -- including Mayor Terence M. Zaleski of Yonkers, Representative Nita M. Lowey, a Democrat from Harrison, and negotiators from the United States Trade Representative's Office -- are concerned that workers in this city may find themselves on the unemployment line because of South Africa's engaging in what they call unfair trade practices.
"Yonkers wasn't given a level playing field," Ms. Lowey said. "South Africa and Taiwan should abide by the rules if they want to play in the international arena."
The new contract, which would have meant $345.6 million for the Yonkers company, was awarded instead to Siemens, a major electronics and electrical manufacturer based in Erlangen, Germany, with subsidiaries in 131 countries. Part of the deal was subcontracted to the Union Carriage and Wagon Company, a large rolling-stock producer outside of Johannesburg.
Ms. Lowey said that the 4 percent difference between the two bids was made up by the South African Government, a situation the Representative called "actionable under Section 301 of the United States Trade Act of 1974."
Some government subsidies to private industries that bid internationally also violate the principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Ms. Lowey, who is on the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations of the House of Representatives Appropriations Committee, has written to Mickey Kantor, the United States Trade Representative, asking his office "to take action to protect hundreds of jobs in Yonkers."
That office confirmed that trade officials were aware of the problem and had had discussions with authorities in Taiwan about alleged subsidies.
Meanwhile, Maria H. Kibby, a spokeswoman for Siemens in Manhattan, said her company had no knowledge of any Government subsidy, but she did say that Siemens was negotiating with representatives of Kawasaki Heavy Industries in Japan (one of the parent companies of Union Rail Car) to give part of this new contract to Union Rail Car.
Alf Lyle, a marketing executive for Union Carriage and Wagon of South Africa, said that the Yonkers company "got beaten fairly and squarely in competition on the open market." He said there was no Government subsidy involved.
Robert Bingham, chief executive officer of the South African company, said subsidies have existed in his country in the past "as they have in most other countries but they have begun to fall away as South Africa is integrated into the international market."
 
A Three-Company Partnership
 Albert Lin, a spokesman for Taiwan's Coordinating Council for North American Affairs in Washington, said Taiwan's Department of Rapid Transit Systems was concerned that Union Rail Car may be just a front for a Japanese company.
If that is true, then the argument that American jobs were being lost because of unfair trade practices does not hold water, Mr. Lin said.
The Yonkers company is a partnership of Yonkers-based Kawasaki Rail Car (a subsidiary of Kawasaki Heavy Industries of Japan) and two other companies -- Nissho Iwai American Corporation (a subsidiary of Nissho Iwai of Japan) and North American Transit Corporation, a subsidiary of Nissho Iwai American. Nissho Iwai American and North American Transit are Manhattan based, said David W. Rose, manager of administration and human resources for Kawasaki Rail Car.
Mayor Zaleski, who called Mr. Lin's comments "nonsense," said: "No way is Union Rail Car a showcase for a Japanese company. These are American jobs we're talking about."
Yonkers had a 7.5 percent unemployment rate in May and cannot afford to see more of its workers on the unemployment rolls, Mr. Zaleski said.
 
A Six-Year Program
 The Mayor, who went to Taiwan last year on behalf of Union Rail Car, said, "It looks like we've become a victim of a misinformation campaign."
He said that other vendors who had been vying for the contract planted doubts in the minds of officials in Taipei about whether Union Rail Car was an American company.
Also, Ms. Lowey, calling the argument that Union Rail Car was a front for a Japanese company "irrelevant," said, "All lines of company ownership are blurred in today's global market."
Union Rail Car has installed the brakes, propulsion and air-conditioning systems, along with the seats, vertical poles and other interior equipment for Taiwan, which is in the third year of a six-year program to expand public transportation. They also assemble the wheel-and-axle carriage.
Taiwan is a 14,000-square-mile island off China's mainland with a population of 20 million. Its cities and roads are "very crowded, just like New York," Mr. Lin said.
 
A 90-Day Interim
 The subway-car shells for the Taipei order were shipped from a Kawasaki Heavy Industries plant in Kobe, Japan, and arrived in Port Elizabeth, N.J. They were then taken by truck to Yonkers. A representative of Taiwan's Department of Rapid Transit Systems inspects the work there.
Union Rail Car, established in 1986, has supplied cars for the A and D Lines of the New York City subway, the PATH system of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and for Philadelphia, among other cities.
Because the new contract does not take effect until 90 days after it is signed, United States officials say they have until the end of month, and perhaps beyond, to convince Taipei officials to reverse their decision.

HEADLINE: BACKTALK;
Baseball Comes to a Resounding Sigh

BYLINE: By THAD MUMFORD; Thad Mumford is a writer and co-executive producer for the television series "Roc" and is a former Yankee batboy.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
While driving to work the morning after the All-Star Game, I was listening to the local all-sports call-in show. The host announced that the topics of concern to him were whether or not Cito Gaston was guilty of pouting in the first degree by not bringing in Mike Mussina; fears that a strike could jeopardize the playoffs and the World Series, and whether fans were pleased with the selection process of the All-Star squad.
After a string of testosterone-intensive commercials, the first caller, Dan from Mar Vista, chose to talk not about baseball but about whether the Lakers were making a serious effort to re-sign A. C. Green. The next caller, John from Northridge, was deeply distressed that the Clippers were no closer to naming a head coach than they had been a month ago. And so on, and so on, and so on. When Paul from Long Beach called to discuss the trade of Eric Dickerson to the Falcons, the exasperated host asked him why he seemed so disinterested in baseball. "It's a dead game, man," came the reply. 
 Whether or not baseball has become a dead game is not really the issue. The unfortunate yet inescapable truth is that baseball, once the game that best articulated the nobilities of American culture, is being soundly defeated in a bloody battle of reality versus perception, especially in the hearts and minds of America's young.
In many ways, baseball's trouble has less to do with the game itself than with the turbulence of a society trying to make sense of its own redefinition. Fathers, once the primary passers of the torch of the game and its idiosyncratic language, today are either nonexistent or unable to find the discretionary time or income to nourish the passion in the next generation of fans. So how did this happen? Here are some possible reasons:

 
 
Television

 
 The great trivializer. In so many areas of modern life there is a causal linkage between television and cultural erosion, and baseball is hardly exempt. Before the television era, the only way to see the game was to see it live. If you were fortunate enough to live in proximity to professional baseball of any level, you were able to see up close and personal the carefully honed artistry of its participants. In those days, you left the park firmly convinced that a player was someone supremely bestowed with magic.
In today's world, where the vast majority of people have the enormous complexities of life explained to them in a half-hour newscast with pictures, baseball as interpreted by television and its tremendous reduction capacity, has become a game that looks easy to play. A game that in person is a sensory, participatory experience on television becomes just so much white noise. Victims of overexposure, great stars who in other times appeared larger than life are now reduced to a kind of cozy familiarity. They fit as comfortably in our living rooms as our local weather people. Can you imagine feeling that way about Ruth, Gehrig or DiMaggio?

 
 
Pop Culture and Video Games
 A generation of young men and women weaned on the helter skelter of music videos and remote control are hardly in sync with a sport that celebrates the amiable meanderings of timeless grace. Our bottom-line pop culture exalts product but has lost patience with process. Feelings of youthful alienation that in previous times expressed themselves in turgid, melodramatic ballads are now nurtured by the often myopic hopelessness and cyncism of today's music and language.
This translates into a kind of generational restlessness that lends itself more to the primordial violence of football or the in-your-face machismo of basketball. The vernacular of the pop culture, once peppered with baseball terminology, is now liberally sprinkled with words like "slam dunk" and "blitz."
Aiding and abetting the cultural estrangement from baseball is the video game. Instead of taking their boundless energy outdoors, playing sports and developing athletic skills, kids now plant themselves in front of computer screens, becoming passively seduced in the process. Can you imagine Mantle, Mays or Snider saying, "I can't come out right now, I'm playing Mindsweeper?"

 
 
The Media
 The sports section, once the playground of myth, fantasy and romance, now regularly features stories of run-amok greed and the failure of the human spirit. Sportswriters, imbued with the self-righteousness of Woodward and Bernstein, have redefined the role of the Fourth Estate. Once a public relations arm for professional athletes, writers seem to have appointed themselves the custodians of morality and candor and with a Geraldo-like scrutiny have put the game and its participants on a par with lawyers and Woody Allen.
While it is important for people to know that an athlete's imported loafers are sometimes filled with clay, it need not be the driving inspiration for reportage. Meanwhile, the hype and exaggeration in our culture have soared to such dizzying heights that Hornsby, Ott and Hubbell would have difficulty satisfying today's expectations. The end result is a population of fans that primarily views athletes as a socially stunted, malcontented, underachieving, princely rewarded aggregate. In the current economic climate, who wants to take anybody out to the old ball game to watch that?

 
 
Nostalgia
 Comparisons to bygone eras and players are usually negative and uninformed (sports journalists play a huge role in this.) Arguments about the superiority of players in other generations rarely take into account the advent of larger gloves, the rampant use of the bullpen by committee, the burgeoning arsenal of two-story pitches, the increased size and athleticism in the modern athlete or the effect of fatigue created by cross-continental flights. Could any of the great players of the golden age produce the same numbers in the company of Dibble, Charlton or Gossage in his prime?
Certainly expansion and the increased popularity of other sports have drained the game's talent pool, but those who insist that the best baseball exists only in black-and-white footage don't know what they are missing.
Baseball can survive its current spate of distractions and continue to thrive if it meets its problems head on. The same television that minimizes is also the world's most powerful marketing tool. Taking its lead from other sports, principally football and basketball, baseball can make better use of its players in giving lie to the notion that life has passed the game by.
As the medium moves into its own brave new world of unlimited channels and program selections, the presentation of the game will evolve to satisfy a new global audience. The music video, the method du jour of gaining entry to a child's imagination, should be used to sell the sport to the modern generation. Instead of running "Catch the fever" commercials that are more or less pop Muzak and play to those already converted, baseball videos directed and produced by the same people that have turned Madonna and Sting into four-dimensional pop icons should saturate MTV and VH1. Wouldn't it be nice to hear baseball referred to as "Cool like dat."
The reverence for tradition that comes with nostalgia should be used not to denigrate the current condition of the game but to provide a historical perspective for fans and players alike. Once again the music videos could be an effective teaching tool.
Above all, baseball must have enough faith in itself to resist the current scurrying to put out its fires with quick-fix solutions. It should believe in the inexorable cyclical nature of life and trust that this, too, shall pass.

HEADLINE: THE MIDWEST FLOODING;
Railroads Threading Freight Around the Midwest's Floods

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 24

 BODY:
Widespread Midwestern flooding is costing the country's railroads tens of millions of dollars, punishing train crews and maintenance workers and taxing the ingenuity and patience of railroad operations employees and their customers. But the freight is getting through.
The railroads account for more than a third of all freight moving through American commerce -- more than any other form of transport -- and their success in getting into and out of the heartland has prevented an economic headache from escalating into a stroke.
 
'War Rooms' and Bufferin
 Total intercity rail freight traffic is down 1.5 percent nationwide from a year ago, according to the most recent weekly tabulations of the Association of American Railroads, which represents the country's 70 largest railroads. But the strikes hobbling Eastern coal production appear to be a more important factor than the flooding, the group said. 
 Auto companies and other leading manufacturers that rely on railroads say factories that are not under water are getting the supplies they need to operate normally.
The tensions of recent days are evident in temporary "war rooms" like that of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway in Schaumburg, Ill., a suburb just west of here, where operations managers spend hours on the telephone, coordinating detours of their trains onto the tracks of other railroads and of other lines' trains onto Santa Fe tracks. Squeezed in among the maps plastered to the walls is a Bufferin dispenser.
More than a quarter of the country's rail freight traffic normally runs through the flood zone. Some critical shipments, like perishable food or products needed immediately to keep individual customers' manufacturing plants running, have been shifted to trucks. But the majority appears to be wiggling through by rail with tolerable delays of up to several days on an ever-changing crazy quilt of detours.
"We have had six railroads use our lines and we've diverted on to four ourselves," said Bob Auman, a spokesman for the Norfolk Southern Railway Company, which is based in Norfolk, Va., and has a network of track that stretches into flood-stricken areas of Illinois, Iowa and Missouri.
 
Truckers Hurt As Well
 The trucking industry, which accounts for less freight than the railroads by weight but more when measured by value, has also run into delays and detours and, like the railroads, has been forced to absorb most of the costs. Although the most heavily traveled routes have remained open, including interstate highway crossings of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, some transcontinental trips have been lengthened by as much as 500 miles, said Ferdinand P. Serpe, the executive director of the Illinois Transportation Association, an industry trade group.
Recent improvements have helped the rail system to cope. "The railroad network going into this was in the best shape it had been in modern history, thanks to billions of dollars in investment since deregulation in 1980," Edwin Harper, the president of the railroad association, said. "There's been stress on the system, but the system has been able to handle it."
A big part of that investment has been large, centralized dispatch centers, like the one in Schaumburg. Operations managers can see the exact status of every train on any stretch of the line from a glance at a computer screen. Marketing specialists can use the same computers to tell customers the location of a shipment.
These electronic hubs have made it far easier for railroads to coordinate their activities. And the closer relationships that many railroads have forged with the trucking industry in recent years have also helped.
For the railroads, the challenges of the flood are greater than any that executives can recall. "There have been hurricanes where there was more damage in a particular area, but no one can recall a situation where so much railroad property has been under water for so long," said Mr. Auman of Norfolk Southern.
 
A Detour to Montana
 The Santa Fe sticks as close to its main Chicago-Kansas City-Los Angeles artery as possible. At one point, with track flooded on the Illinois side of its Mississippi River crossing at Niota, Ill., and problems in Missouri as well, the detours sometimes entailed what was called a "North Pole" route, using Burlington Northern tracks to Minneapolis, then to Billings, Mont., and on to Denver.
Now, with the Mississippi crossing restored, a preferred detour involves switching to Burlington Northern lines at Bucklin, Mo., a detour of less than 100 miles, before returning to Santa Fe tracks in Kansas City, Mo.
The Bucklin line, a single track weakened by the weather, cannot handle much traffic, so other routes are used. One alternative follows CSX track to Memphis, then Southern Pacific track to Fort Worth, where the Santa Fe is rejoined.
Each detour adds to fuel costs and running time. In addition, crew arrangements become vastly more complicated. On many detours, railroads must hire crews from the company whose line they are using or, at the least, a pilot to accompany their crew over the unfamiliar track. Even then, complications pop up.
On Thursday, for example, Santa Fe had to send an engine to help a Burlington Northern train stranded on the Santa Fe line through Missouri. The Burlington locomotive turned out to be under-powered to deal with the grade of the unfamiliar track.
Detours also wreak havoc on the precisely scheduled distribution of engines and freight cars to points where they can immediately be put back into service. The Chicago, Central and Pacific Railroad has been sending grain cars that normally shuttle between Iowa and Illinois to Dubuque, Iowa, where they are unloaded onto barges on rail trips as far as New Orleans.
"That results in far fewer loadings, which will have a major impact on our profits," said Paul Anderson, a superintendent of transportation for the line, which is based in Waterloo, Iowa.
While streamlining increased railroad profitability during the 1980's, the railroads are now finding it has impeded their options in dealing with the floods. Over the years, the Santa Fe had become so much more efficient in distributing crews that it closed a personnel center in central Missouri. Now the railroad needs to have crews there to replace those who must leave the trains, under Federal rules that limit consecutive hours of duty.
"We found that the few hotel rooms in the area were already filled with our maintenance people, who have been working round the clock to repair a bridge and track washed out east of the Grand River," Russell Hagberg, the vice president in charge of transportation for Santa Fe, said. The solution, for now, has been to send restored Pullman dining and sleeping cars that the railroad normally uses to entertain its most important clients.
 
One Carrier's Nightmare
 Although some short lines in the region have been severely hurt by the flooding, the only intercity carrier facing potential disaster so far is the Gateway Western Railway, which carries freight from Chicago to Springfield, Ill., on Southern Pacific track, then to Kansas City on its own line. The three-year-old company was hurt when it was forced to abandon a stretch of its route near Louisiana, Mo., after local officials feared that its efforts to raise its flooded track were weakening a levee. Then the rampaging Missouri River blew out and buried a broad stretch of raised track west of Glasgow, Mo.
"It's flowing at 10 knots through there," said Reilly McCarren, the president of the privately owned railroad, which is based in the St. Louis suburb of Fairview Heights, Ill. "There's a danger it will become an alternate course for the river."
Gateway is still operating its normal two trains a day each way between Chicago and Kansas City, but its heavy reliance on Union Pacific and Burlington Northern tracks means that it is losing money every day just when it needs resources for repairs that could cost $7 million or more.
R. L. Banks & Associates, a Washington consulting firm, estimates that the flooding to date is likely to cost the railroad industry $235 million to $275 million.
Most of the big railroads say it is too soon to project their losses. The Burlington Northern, one of the harder-hit lines, said flooding had added up to $10 million to operating costs by June 30.
Some lines have benefited. The Illinois Central, with tracks running from Chicago to New Orleans east of the Mississippi River, has enjoyed a 4 percent jump in its business as grain owners and millers transfer products normally sent by barge.
Railroad executives say the flood experience may lead to maintenance adjustments and new cooperative arrangements among railroads and with truckers, but few foresee any lasting impact. Mr. Auman said Norfolk Southern was unlikely to change plans to tear up part of its track between Moberly, Mo., and Des Moines, even though the availability of that line is now saving it money.
"We've only been running 60 cars of freight a year on that 41-mile stretch," he said. "It's too expensive to maintain as a contingency against a 500-year flood."

 THE PREFERRED DETOUR -- Trains switch to Burlinton Northern track at Bucklin, Mo., and return to Santa Fe track in Kansas City, Mo.
 SECOND CHOICE -- Trains use CSX track to Memphis, then Southern Pacific, returning to Santa Fe track in Forth Worth.
 "NORTH POLE" ROUTE -- This detour uses Burlington Northern track to Minneapolis, then to Billings, Mont., and finally to Denver, where Santa Fe track is rejoined. (pg. A10)

HEADLINE: STRONG COMPANIES ARE JOINING TREND TO ELIMINATE JOBS

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
It is no longer news that troubled companies are eliminating jobs by the tens of thousands. But the recent announcement by Procter & Gamble that it, too, will shrink its work force called attention to a surprising aspect of America's jobs crisis: profitable companies with booming sales are also shedding jobs, insisting that to survive the 1990's, they must prepare for the worst.
Successful companies once felt free to raise prices to fatten profits. Now, unable to raise prices in a weak economy, the mind-set is to focus on cutting labor costs to maintain profit margins. 
 Explaining Procter & Gamble's decision to eliminate 13,000 jobs during a year of record earnings, Edwin L. Artzt, the company's chairman, told a story with themes that are now standard in American business. He said customer surveys had increasingly found that while shoppers considered the company's soaps, detergents, diapers, shampoos and other brand-name products good quality, they also considered them overpriced. To maintain sales, discounts would be needed, but if profits were to be maintained, costs would have to be cut.
 
'Hitting the Wall' a Concern
 "Our costs had gotten too high because the work process was too complex," Mr. Artzt said in an interview. "I became convinced that if we did not reverse this situation, we would end up two or three years from now hitting the wall, as other companies have."
Thus, Procter & Gamble embraced a practice that has quietly become the daily regimen at such profitable companies as General Electric, A.T.& T. Johnson & Johnson, the Chubb Group of insurance companies, Raytheon and many others. Even a hugely successful and rapidly expanding discounter like Wal-Mart Stores embraces job cutbacks as a basic strategy.
As it opened stores and added more than 100,000 employees in the last year, Wal-Mart simultaneously eliminated some existing jobs. Most stores, for example, had an employee assigned to insure that the electronic scanners at check-out counters were up-to-date with the numerous price changes pasted on products. Now this chore has been added to the duties of store clerks.
"You have to go along regularly cutting a few jobs, or you will get layers of fat and bureaucracy," said Donald Shinkel, a vice president of Wal-Mart. "And when that builds up, you get the sort of crisis that is happening at I.B.M."
Several trends that have gathered steam over the last decade have made job cutbacks almost as popular in corporate America today as takeovers and mergers were in the 1980's. The jobs lost at hundreds of companies feed the country's economic weakness, making a strong economic recovery harder to achieve, some economists say.
"If you can let someone go without affecting your sales, you reduce your wages and increase your profits," said Albert Sommers, a senior economist at the Conference Board, a research organization supported by corporations. "That's O.K. at a few companies, but a lot of this is going on and if it continues then there might eventually not be enough wages for people to buy things, and the economy gets hurt."
The Clinton Administration prefers to focus on the jobs created since Mr. Clinton took office -- like those at Wal-Mart or at a new Johnson & Johnson factory in Cincinnati that makes instruments for camera-guided surgery -- rather than those that are being constantly eliminated.
"On net, the economy has generated in the range of 800,000 jobs in the private sector since January, so there is more job growth than job elimination," Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said, citing a level of job growth that many economists have considered inadequate to bring down the nation's 7 percent unemployment rate.
"But that still leaves us with two questions," he added. "Are they good jobs? The evidence so far is that they are mostly part time. And secondly, even though jobs are being created, does the conspicuous loss of jobs at many companies create the sort of anxieties among workers that may deter them from spending as much as they otherwise would?"
 
Weak Growth Prompts Cutbacks
 Yet if job cutbacks are hard on the economy, many corporate executives say the weak economic growth since 1989 is a major reason the cutbacks are needed. The weak economy has helped turn millions of Americans into discount shoppers, forcing companies to cut prices, and then labor costs.
Expensive health insurance is advanced as another major reason for holding down payrolls, as is global competition. In nearly a dozen interviews with corporate executives, they frequently held up the International Business Machines Corporation as a frightening example of a company that had ignored competition for too long and must now engage in emergency job shedding. Finally, many executives have depicted the job reductions as a belated correction to the overhiring that took place in a more prosperous America in the 1960's and 1970's -- particularly the hiring of middle-level managers and other white-collar workers.
"Our work force simply grew over time," Mr. Artzt said. "There were too many layers of people, and so we went back and said, 'If we were recreating Procter & Gamble today, how would it look?' "
Adopting a procedure already practiced by many companies in one form or another, Procter & Gamble late last year set up 11 teams, each with 100 managers. They fanned out to the company's 147 factories in the United States and abroad, examining practices and soliciting suggestions from workers who might eventually find their own jobs phased out.
 
Conflicting Views
 "The suggestions bubbled out of the organization," Mr. Artzt said. That view is somewhat at odds with a Conference Board survey, released this month, of 55 companies, each with 10,000 employees or more: 64 percent reported that job-cutting at their companies had "lowered morale among employees who have survived," even when the job-cutting was through attrition or buyouts rather than layoffs.
If you do it once, "you can get back on track," said Helen Axel, the Conference Board researcher who conducted the survey. "But if you keep on downsizing, as many companies are doing, then you keep people on tenterhooks and perhaps in the long run reduce their efficiency. No one knows yet."
The Procter & Gamble teams concluded that 65 computer systems around the world could be consolidated into 3, reducing the need for programmers and other support personnel. The shampoos sold in Europe will now have the same packaging in every country, simplifying production. And there were nearly 150 other proposals.
The bottom line was Mr. Artzt's announcement that 12 percent of the work force, a third in the United States, would be eliminated over three years, mostly through attrition. Thirty factories are to be closed. The cuts will reduce overhead costs to 12 cents of every sales dollar from 14.5 cents, leaving more room to cut prices without shrinking profits.
 
Wages Fall, Profits Rise
 The growing impact of job-cutting is increasingly evident in national statistics. Wages are falling as a percentage of national income, while profits are rising. Among the country's unemployed, the percentage reporting permanent job losses, rather than temporary layoffs, resignations and the like, has risen to more than 40 percent today from less than 30 percent in the mid-1970's, the Labor Department reported. Analyzing an index of help-wanted ads, James Medoff, a Harvard labor economist, found that the number of job openings available to an unemployed worker has declined by 37 percent since 1984.
Finally, white-collar workers without jobs constitute a much bigger percentage of total unemployment than they did in the mid-1970's, recent studies have found. That might reflect the elimination of middle managers and administrators, people often described by corporate executives as secondary to the production process.
"White-collar employment growth stopped during the last recession and remains halted," said Erica L. Groshen, a labor economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, who conducted one of the studies. The recession ended in March 1991.
No issue is more troublesome to managers and workers than the impact of job-cutting on the employees who survive. A.T.& T. and many others offer transfers and retraining to dislocated workers. Wal-Mart offers promotions to workers who find ways to eliminate their own jobs, Mr. Shinkel, the Wal-Mart vice president, said. But that is easy at a company that is expanding.
General Electric, which has reduced worldwide employment to 230,000 people from 400,000 in 1981 -- while nearly tripling sales -- takes a different approach: a rapid and wholesale cutback with handsome severance packages, followed by slower and more methodical job shrinkage thereafter, mostly through attrition.
"It was mostly the fat middle management that lost jobs during that initial cutback in the mid-1980's," said Prof. Noel Tichy of the University of Michigan's Business School and a G.E. consultant in those years. "G.E. had the money to do it right, paying a lot of money to the people who left. I.B.M., General Motors and other troubled companies shedding people now don't have the money to be so generous, and that hurts corporate morale."

HEADLINE: EXPANSION OF AID FOR WORKING POOR IS TIED TO BUDGET

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, July 25

 BODY:
Overshadowed by the fight over raising taxes and cutting the Federal deficit are plans by both houses of Congress to add billions of dollars to a Government antipoverty program, a move that the Clinton Administration casts as a "pay raise for the working poor."
The House has already passed Mr. Clinton's proposal for an expansion of the program, known as the earned-income tax credit. The House bill provides for a $28.3-billion rise over the next five years in what is now an $11 billion-a-year program. That would represent the largest antipoverty measure taken by the Federal Govern ment since the mid-1970's. It would both increase current benefits and expand the number of workers eligible, to 20 million from 14 million now. 
 The Senate bill, though smaller -- an $18.2 billion increase over five years -- would still raise spending on the program by more than a third.
 
From Right and Left
 The 18-year-old tax credit is a program favored not just by liberals but by many moderates and conservatives, largely because it is the primary antipoverty measure that specifically rewards poor people for working. Under the Clinton plan, minimum-wage workers with two or more children would receive nearly $4 in Government payments for every $10 of the first $8,500 they earn working, up from a maximum of $2.50 now.
The question now is not so much whether the House and Senate versions can be reconciled -- Congressional negotiators agree they can and should be -- but whether the compromise expansion being thrashed out in the Capitol will be held hostage to an overall budget agreement. Without the larger plan, the expansion of the tax credit would be in jeopardy.
 
'A Big Difference'
 Veronica Martinez, a 23-year-old Houston mother of three, is one of 14 million people who claimed the credit on her tax form this year. Ms. Martinez earns $4.50 an hour as a checkout clerk in a Fiesta Grocery Mart. Her pay (25 cents over minimum wage) makes her eligible now for a $2.15 credit for every $10 she earns. Under the Clinton plan, she would become eligible for $3.60 for every $10.
"Yes, it made a big difference to me and to them," Ms. Martinez said of the credit she got this year, which she used to buy clothes for her children and a new washer-dryer for her apartment. "And if somebody in Washington's going to come up with some more money, if they're trying to say, 'Keep working, don't give up and go on welfare,' well that's great."
Like the vast majority of people who claim the credit, now available only to people with children, Ms. Martinez receives the benefit in the form of a once-a-year check from the Government, which she received after attaching a one-page form,a Schedule EIC, to her 1040 tax form.
Devised about 20 years ago by former Senator Russell B. Long, Democrat of Louisiana, the tax credit has thrived and been expanded over the years in the service of a remarkably diverse set of goals, though all of them still aim at helping the poor.
It has been portrayed as a means to offset an increase in Social Security payroll taxes and to help poor families with child-care costs. It has been expanded twice to make up for Congress's inability to agree on an increase in the minimum wage. Now President Clinton specifically wants to use it, in his words, to "make work pay."
As broad as Mr. Clinton's proposal is, it would stop short of the campaign pledge he made that all families with a full-time worker be guaranteed enough money to live above the poverty line, now defined as a yearly income of $11,500 for a family of three, $14,750 for a family of four. About five million Americans work 40-hour-a-week jobs but remain below the line, the Census Bureau reports.
And many advocates of the program, even as they urge its expansion, argue that the health-care overhaul Mr. Clinton is to unveil may be at least as important as the tax credit in encouraging people to work. Right now, many people who qualify for the federally financed Medicaid program lose their benefits as soon as they start working -- typically in jobs that have no health insurance.
"If today you are a family on welfare, you can simply wind up being worse off working," said Robert Greenstein, executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research group. "You lose your health-care coverage when you get a job. It undermines the work ethic. But if you can go to work and get your low wages supplemented, and if you do not lose your coverage, the incentives to work become sharply stronger."
 
Not Without Faults
 The tax-credit program has faults. For one thing, it is so complex that hundreds of thousands of people who are eligible for it now do not apply, while many others who are not supposed to receive the credit do claim it, often without prompting an audit.
Nonetheless, there appears to be a consensus among the President and the houses of Congress that the credit is inherently a good idea and should be expanded, which is certainly not the case with other measures designed to help the poor. (The House has backed the President's proposal for a five-year, $7 billion increase in the Federal food-stamp program, for instance, while the Senate's budget bill provides for no increase.)
"The earned-income tax credit is a bad name for a great policy," said David T. Ellwood, an Assistant Secretary for Health and Human Services who is co-chairman of the Administration's task force on overhauling the welfare system. "What it is, basically, is a pay raise for the working poor."
What is still to be worked out, however, is not just the size of the increase, but the degree to which it can be devised to move tax law toward the President's vow in his State of the Union Message: "If you work 40 hours a week and you've got a child in the house, you will no longer be in poverty."
 
Would Help the Childless
 White House aides concede that even the Clinton proposal, let alone the Senate version, will not accomplish this for workers supporting several children.
Mr. Clinton's proposal, approved virtually intact in the House, would expand the maximum credit to $3,371 and would, for the first time, include a much smaller credit, up to $306 yearly, for about 7.5 million childless workers.
The Senate version would include a maximum credit of $3,315 and would not be extended to childless workers, partly because proponents in the Senate argued that lower energy taxes than in the House budget plan would make up for the extra tax credits those workers would enjoy in the House version.
The maximum tax credit now is $1,513, applying to families with two or more children and incomes from about $8,000 to $12,000. There are supplemental credits, amounting to up to about $800, for people who have infants and who pay health-insurance premiums. These would be simplified and folded into the basic grant under the Clinton plan.
At $11 billion annually, the credit is the second-largest Government program for contributing money or food to the poor, just behind Aid to Families with Dependent Children, and would become the largest if the President's plan becomes law.
 
A Bizarre Side Effect
 As popular as the program is, some features have come under heavy criticism. Some economists are even warning that current proposals could actually aggravate a bizarre side effect of the code that can encourage people to overstate their income on their tax forms, since the value of the additional credit they would receive would exceed the amount of extra tax they would pay.
Moreover, current law and Mr. Clinton's proposal can both work as a disincentive for a second person in a poor family to get a job, since some of the extra income would be canceled out by a decrease in the credit the family would receive. It can also amount to a disincentive for marriage, for much the same reason.
Some conservative scholars also argue that Mr. Clinton may be pushing the tax credit away from its purely antipoverty roots. Under the Clinton proposal, families with two or more children and incomes up to $28,000 would be eligible for a credit, up from the current maximum of $23,760. (The benefit at such levels is small, since it decreases from a peak at around the $12,000 income level.)

Graph: "Rethinking the Income Tax Credit"
 The earned-income tax credit is available to low-income workers with children and is distrubuted by the I.R.S. Those who qualify can deduct that credit each year from their Federal income tax. If the credit exceeds taxes paid, the worker will receive the difference from the I.R.S.

HEADLINE: MOVE BY MOSCOW DEPLORED IN WEST

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25

 BODY:
Western officials and economists today criticized the decision by Russia's Central Bank to withdraw old bank notes from circulation, saying it could unfairly confiscate currency from many Russians and severely hurt small businesses, a group that the West is eager to help.
The move to reduce the number of rubles in circulation is officially aimed at controlling the money supply and reducing inflation, but some officials and economists interviewed said the move might ultimately help drive up prices by undermining faith in Russia's currency and Central Bank. 
 "It seems like a pretty ham-handed way of trying to reduce inflation and of trying to increase confidence in the currency," said Stanley Fischer, a former chief economist for the World Bank who is a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "The most likely thing it will do is encourage Russians to use the dollar more, and that's the last thing you want to do if you want to discourage inflation."
Under the plan, Russians will have 14 days to exchange up to 35,000 rubles -- equal to $34 -- for new bank notes. Any other older currency that Russians hold may be deposited in saving banks, where it must be held for six months before it can be exchanged for new ruble notes. Those holdings are expected to be significantly eroded because the interest rate those deposits receive will be far lower than the inflation rate.
 
Some Praise for Plan
 Since big Russian companies often work in dollars while small businesses work in rubles, several officials and economists said the move would particularly hurt the most dynamic part of Russia's economy: small business.
Lawrence H. Summers, Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, declined to comment on the move, saying he was trying to obtain further details about the decision. Officials of the International Monetary Fund, which is working closely with Russia on its reform program, also said they were studying the plan.
In interviews, Western officials and economists praised one aspect of the plan, saying it would make it easier for Russia to run its monetary policy independent of other former Soviet republics that still use rubles.
Russian officials have long complained that it is hard to bring down inflation when other republics are dumping rubles into the Russian market. By withdrawing all rubles printed before 1993, the Central Bank's plan would greatly reduce the amount of rubles that other republics control.
 
Came as a Surprise
 But the move could also increase tensions between Russia and the other republics.
"The Central Bank's decision will certainly have an effect on people and businesses in republics other than Russia, but it should help Russia get control of its money supply," said Herbert S. Levine, an economics professor at the University of Pennsylvania.
Western officials said the plan was a surprise, and that it was not even discussed with an International Monetary Fund delegation that left Moscow last Thursday.
Several economists said the move could reduce confidence in the Central Bank because it had promised not to make any drastic moves regarding bank notes until the end of the year.

Faith's Anchor in a Western Diaspora

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUTTE, Mont.

 BODY:
This brick and clapboard city in southwestern Montana dusty, stark and eroding now in its perch alongside the Continental Divide -- was built by a rough and bawdy sort, miners who carved out this state's once-largest city in a rush for copper, silver and gold.
A hard-living city with bars in almost every block, Butte was as close to urban as the Wild West got, luring fortune-seekers from every corner of Asia and Europe a century ago. Among them came Montana's largest population of Jews. 
 This year, Butte's Congregation B'nai Israel, the last of three synagogues remaining in this city, celebrates its 90th anniversary, though its congregation is down to 30 families from a high of 500 in the 1940's.
"What's remarkable is the tenacity with which it has hung in there," said 72-year-old Stan Gronfein, a Butte native and member of the congregation whose family ran a men's clothing store for many years. "I've always wondered how we managed that."
Mr. Gronfein's grandparents, who arrived from Germany in the 1890's, were among B'nai Israel's founders. Mr. Gronfein remembers the city's glory days when there was a kosher market and so many businessmen were Jews that half the city closed down on Jewish holidays.
Butte's first Mayor was Jewish, Henry Jacobs, elected in 1879, and his house has been restored as part of the national landmark district of Butte, which gained that status for its mining history.
Elders remember when B'nai Israel had a full-time rabbi (the last moved on in the 1960's), as well as the years when they had none, when laymen conducted services and passed on their traditions to the children.
For four years now, the congregation has participated in a student rabbi program with Hebrew Union College in Los Angeles. The student flies in monthly for services and to teach the children. It is all the community can afford, and for its size, members said it is all they need.
"It's difficult to be Jewish there," said Scott Meltzer, one of the student rabbis. "It's a small segment of a multicultural town and there's little Jewish culture left."
The city of Butte declined as demand for copper, its main source of income, plummeted in the 1960's and 70's. The last big production was a decade ago, but residents had long since begun their exodus.
The population now is about a third of what it was at its peak of 100,000 in the 1940's, when the Anaconda Company wielded huge power in the state and processed more copper than any other company in the nation. Its smelter in Anaconda, 35 miles west of here, belched toxic-laden smoke that killed foliage for miles around and polluted the ground and water. The area around Anaconda now makes up the largest Federal Superfund cleanup site in the country, and the mines in the hillsides here are inactive.
Through it all, B'nai Israel has survived as the only continually functioning synagogue in Montana. Congregations have formed in more cosmopolitan Billings and Missoula, but their meeting places are informal. In a sense, B'nai Israel has been benefited from hard times. With three synagogues merged into one, it has an enviable five torahs on its altar, affluent by even Eastern standards.
And when a special occasion is observed, the entire city takes notice. Bar mitzvahs, which take place about every five years, are almost as big as the St. Patrick's Day Parade. In 1988, Leo Rosenthal's bar mitzvah received a two-page spread in the local daily newspaper.
For Leo's family, which moved here from New York, the attraction of Butte was a thriving Jewish community in a Western state. His mother, Barbara, grew up in Far Rockaway in Queens, and his father, Paul, in Brooklyn. A visit West nearly 20 years ago changed their lives.
"We wanted to leave New York," Ms. Rosenthal said. "I knew I wanted children, and that I wanted religion in my family. So I got out the Yellow Pages and started looking for a congregation. It had to be a place with a synagogue that needed a dentist, so we picked Butte."
The future is less certain than when the Rosenthals arrived in the 1970's; Butte has not shared in Montana's population boom.
"You just wouldn't come here to try to establish yourself," said Rand Rafish, a third-generation congregant. "We don't have that kind of economic environment. People are leaving because there are no jobs."
But those who remain believe that far from drifting, their fate has been strengthened because their congregation is small.
"As long as there is one family, there will always be a temple in Butte," said Mel Rafish. "It will never bite the dust."

HEADLINE: Ukraine May Ask Special Status in Atom Pact

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine, July 24

 BODY:
As sentiment in Ukraine strengthens for keeping nuclear weapons on its territory and delaying ratification of disarmament treaties, the Defense Minister has suggested that the country may try to join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty with the special status of a "transition country" with nuclear weapons.
The Defense Minister, Col. Gen. Konstantin Morozov, spoke in an interview Friday on the eve of a five-day trip to Washington, where he is to meet with Defense Secretary Les Aspin. General Morozov appeared to be searching for middle ground between the position of hard-liners in the Ukrainian Parliament, who have threatened to reject the 1970 nonproliferation treaty, and appeals from Washington that Ukraine keep its pledge to join the treaty as a country without nuclear arms. 
 When the Soviet Union broke up in late 1991, Ukraine officially became the world's third largest nuclear power. Today a total of 176 former Soviet long-range missiles and 30 bombers carrying 1,656 nuclear warheads remain on its territory.
"We can join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and support all the provisions, but as a state that has temporary status of a country with nuclear armaments on its territory that are being destroyed," General Morozov said. "We are now in a transition period. And I think theoretically it is possible for Ukraine to get the status of a transition country."
 
1992 Pledge to Sign
 President Leonid M. Kravchuk and his Government had pledged last year that Ukraine would unequivocally ratify both the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, a 1991 agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union on reducing nuclear warheads, and the 1970 treaty to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.
Western experts here say that for Ukraine to sign the nonproliferation treaty it must do so as a non-nuclear nation, like other new signers. But General Morozov seemed to suggest that Ukraine would not threaten the legitimacy of the treaty if it was viewed as a nuclear heir in transition instead of a proliferator.
In offering a new position, which Western experts here said had not previously been described by senior Ukrainian officials, General Morozov seemed to be heeding nationalist sentiment in the Ukrainian Parliament, where euphoria over the independence gained in December 1991 has given way to mistrust of Russia's intentions.
Apart from the dispute on stewardship over nuclear arms, the two countries have sparred over control of the strategic Black Sea fleet and the port of Sevastopol, a navy base on Ukrainian territory.
 
Up to Parliament
 General Morozov repeatedly emphasized in the interview that the decision on whether Ukraine would declare itself a nuclear power or not was up to the Ukrainian Parliament. "It is very difficult for me to predict what the Parliament will decide," he said.
Ukraine's stance on the nuclear weapons is important because its failure to ratify the nonproliferation treaty and the 1991 strategic arms treaty, called Start I, would result in the scuttling of the follow-up Start II treaty and could increase regional tensions.
Two weeks ago the Parliament's influential Foreign Affairs Committee released a document declaring for the first time that the nuclear weapons inherited from the Soviet Union and stationed on Ukrainian soil were the sole property of Ukraine.
Ukraine's top leaders have meanwhile wavered on the commitments they made last year. Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma, who headed Ukraine's biggest missile factory until he entered politics last year, said in a private meeting with lawmakers in May that Ukraine should declare itself a nuclear nation and temporarily keep part of the former Soviet arsenal.
In a separate interview on Friday, Environment Minister Yuri Kostenko, a lawmaker who leads a parliamentary group analyzing the nuclear treaties, said the United States should understand that Russia's policies of "political and economic pressure" were "without any doubt whatsoever a threat against Ukraine's territorial integrity."
Mr. Kostenko -- who is also visiting the United States in the coming week, on a mission to inspect safety at nuclear power plants -- said Ukraine was being singled out for unfair treatment. "Instead of helping us decide these complex issues, we are accused of being a nuclear power because we're not giving these weapons to Russia tomorrow," he said.
General Morozov's trip comes a month after a visit to Kiev by Mr. Aspin, who suggested a compromise under which warheads on Ukraine's missiles would be removed and placed under international supervision on Ukrainian soil.
Mr. Aspin's proposal was well received here at the time because it seemed to signal respect for Ukraine's sovereignty and because he suggested regular high-level meetings between American and Ukrainian military officials. It has since been criticized in Parliament as a "facade" for lack of follow-up.
Control over any use of the weapons remains in Russia's hands, and the Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly told Washington that they are not trying to seize operational control over the weapons. But there has been speculation in the West, based on reports from Moscow, that Ukraine is already trying to develop the ability to operate the weapons. American intelligence agencies have estimated that Ukraine could acquire technological ability to fire the missiles in 12 to 18 months.
 
Operational Efforts Denied
 In the interview, General Morozov repeated Ukraine's assurances that his country was making no such efforts. Asked if Ukraine had started to work on circumventing the locks placed on the air-delivered weapons by Moscow, he said, "No."
Asked how long it would take for Ukraine to acquire independent control if they decided to take this step, General Morozov said: "It's not really important how long it would take. You have my 'no.' "
The Defense Minister prefaced his "no" by saying that Ukraine had the scientific expertise to take control if it wanted to do so.
"Despite the economic crisis we now live in, this is a very technologically developed country," he said. "We have a very developed industrial military complex. We have high technological industries for the production of missiles and in the field of radio electronics. So this question is not the most complex question for Ukraine."

HEADLINE: DEMOCRATS EXPECT TIGHT BUDGET VOTE

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25

 BODY:
After weeks of labeling the Clinton Administration's $500 billion package of tax increases and spending cuts too miserly or too spendthrift, Democratic liberals and conservatives alike took to television today to concede the increasingly obvious: like it or not, they will probably pass a compromise version of the plan next month.
"I think the President will be able to get the votes when the time comes," said Senator Sam Nunn, a conservative Georgian who was one of six Democrats to vote against the Senate version of the package last month. "He's very persuasive." 
 A prominent liberal Democrat, Representative Kweisi Mfume of Maryland, predicted, "It's going to pass by the tightest of margins."
He added, "Many people in this particular party that I'm a member of realize that we really don't have a choice."
 
Pressure From 2 Extremes
 Mr. Mfume is the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, whose 38 members have grudgingly supported the House version of President Clinton's economic plan despite their conviction that it does not spend enough on social needs. By contrast, Mr. Nunn voted against the far more frugal Senate version of the plan, arguing that it needed to cut spending even more.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen also predicted that the economic package would pass Congress, but not without difficulty.
Mr. Bentsen and Mr. Mfume were interviewed on the NBC News program "Meet the Press." Mr. Nunn appeared on the CBS News counterpart, "Face the Nation."
They spoke as scores of House and Senate lawmakers prepared for a second and probably final week of negotiations to meld the House and Senate models of the economic package into a single measure that could pass both houses of Congress.
The crucial talks over taxes and spending on Federal benefits, involving negotiators from the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee, will not resume until Tuesday. Democratic leaders have committed themselves to passing some form of compromise by the time Congress leaves on Aug. 9 for its monthlong summer recess.
 
Reining In Defectors
 Today, Mr. Bentsen suggested that the most difficult task remaining was to hold on to conservative Democrats who supported either the House or Senate version of the package earlier this year. It is feared that they might vote against any compromise package if it does not sufficiently cut both the growth of the deficit and spending.
Mr. Clinton's plan includes about $250 billion in new taxes and another $250 billion in spending and interest reductions through 1998. That would cut the growth of the Federal deficit by $500 billion over five years, to about $200 billion in the last year of Mr. Clinton's term in office, according to the Administration.
Even so, the total Federal debt would still rise by $1 trillion during the period, a figure conservatives like Mr. Nunn say is too high. On the other hand, Mr. Clinton is under pressure from liberals like Mr. Mfume and moderates to spend more, something Mr. Bentsen said today would be resisted.
"The biggest problem at the present time, it seems to me, is being sure that we get the $500 billion" in deficit reduction, Mr. Bentsen said, "and, in addition, that we keep more spending cuts than we do revenue increases. And we're committed to that."
 
Little to Tempt Conservatives
 Mr. Bentsen and Mr. Clinton cannot afford to lose any more conservatives in the Senate, where Vice President Al Gore had to cast a tie-breaking vote last month to keep the economic proposal from failing. The House passed the measure by a six-vote margin.
Virtually all the six Senate Democrats who opposed the package then are conservatives, and there is little indication they will support the more liberal package now being drafted.
Mr. Nunn said he had seen little so far in the compromise talks that would tempt him to switch his vote.
"I'm keeping an open mind until I see the conference results," he said today. "But I felt and still feel that we needed to bear down more on spending cuts."
He also said the White House should have prepared a 10-year economic recovery plan instead of a five-year plan.
"You can't come to grips with this long-term problem in a five-year plan," he said.

HEADLINE: Move to Withdraw Rubles Splits Russian Government

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 25

 BODY:
A serious split emerged in the Russian Government today over the sudden decision by the Russian Central Bank to declare all pre-1993 ruble bank notes invalid as of midnight tonight, with senior Finance Ministry officials making a personal protest to President Boris N. Yeltsin at a Kremlin meeting.
The decision, which has thrown Russians into panic as they scurry to unload old bank notes, was made on Saturday without consultation with the Finance Ministry, which was only notified at the last minute, a senior economic adviser to the Government said. 
 "The Ministry of Finance has lodged its protest and regards this as a completely inappropriate policy," said the adviser, Jeffrey D. Sachs, a professor of economics at Harvard, who said he had spoken with senior Finance Ministry officials today and had cleared his comments with them. "The ministry is in ongoing discussions with the Government, the President and the Central Bank about these actions," Mr. Sachs said.
Although Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin issued a statement on Saturday expressing Government support for the Central Bank's decision, the Finance Ministry's protest showed that a bitter dispute continues over monetary and fiscal policy within the Russian leadership. The dispute also underlined the fragility of Western-style economic reform in Russia.
 
Slowing Inflation Unlikely
 While the officially stated goals of the Central Bank's action -- to slow inflation and insure tighter control over Russia's money supply -- are also goals of the reformers, Western diplomats and economists said the invalidation of older bank notes would not effectively accomplish those goals.
By causing more economic pain to individual Russians, they said, the move could erode what support exists for the Government, for Mr. Yeltsin and for the very idea of reform, which many Russians already associate with chaos and difficulty.
Other officials and Western diplomats said it was believed that Mr. Yeltsin, who returned to Moscow today after breaking off his vacation, had made no immediate decision at the meeting with Finance Ministry officials on whether to seek a reversal of the Central Bank's decision.
Mr. Yeltsin's spokesman had said that the President was returning to deal with the threat to the economic reforms posed by the Russian Parliament, which before recessing on Friday passed a series of laws and resolutions that would swell the budget deficit, hobble privatization of state enterprises and cancel the licenses of foreign banks.
The Minister of Finance, Boris G. Fyodorov, who is the main architect and spokesman for Russia's market reforms, is believed to be on vacation in the United States, and could not be reached for comment.
 
Timed for a Long Weekend
 Diplomats suggested that the Central Bank's move, which is deeply unpopular and will discredit the Government, may have been coordinated with the lawmakers involved in the parliamentary session and was timed for a long summer weekend when few officials would be at their desks.
Protests also came today from other former Soviet republics that still use the ruble or maintain large ruble reserves, like Armenia, Moldova and Georgia.
Under the order issued Saturday, Russians may exchange up to 35,000 rubles each of older notes -- only $34 -- at banks before Aug. 7, a deadline that is likely to create long lines. Any further amounts must be put on deposit and frozen for six months at an interest rate significantly below the current inflation rate.
Foreigners may change only 15,000 rubles and may do so only on Monday, with no possibility of banking the rest.
Mr. Sachs said he saw "a real possibility" that the Central Bank acted "in coordination with the Supreme Soviet in an overt attempt to destroy the economic reform by stopping privatization and stabilization."
 
'Soviet-Style Thinking'
 He called the Central Bank's actions clumsy and "cruel" and said they showed "Soviet-style thinking." He said he hoped that Mr. Yeltsin would come down firmly on the side of reformers planning genuine free-market strategies and that the acting director of the Central Bank, Viktor V. Gerashchenko, who has been feuding with Mr. Fyodorov and other reformers, would be dismissed.
Under Russia's much-criticized Soviet-era Constitution, the Central Bank reports directly to the Parliament.
Mr. Fyodorov has recounted severe battles within the Government of Prime Minister Chernomyrdin between those who favor Western-style reforms, including tighter credits to try to control Russia's high inflation, and the Soviet holdovers who control most of the bureaucracy.
Even in his own Finance Ministry, Mr. Fyodorov has said, there are many officials who do not understand the principles or benefits of a market economy. Mr. Chernomyrdin himself is a former manager of state industry who was imposed on Mr. Yeltsin by the Parliament after the acting Prime Minister, Yegor T. Gaidar, was forced to resign late last year.
Supported by Western Governments, international institutions and advisers like Mr. Sachs, Mr. Fyodorov and the young reformers in the Government have had good access to Mr. Yeltsin and have won many of the arguments over economic and financial policy.
But diplomats suggest that the bureaucrats and conservative-minded industrialists concentrated in the Parliament and in the Central Bank have been working to undermine any transition to a real market by seeking to control and limit privatization and maintain a large state sector.
Mr. Yeltsin is trying to get rid of the Parliament, which was elected in March 1990 and nearly succeeded in ousting him from his post last spring. He has been trying to get a new, democratic constitution approved that would reorganize the legislature and require new elections. But the current parliamentary leadership insists that it alone may adopt a new constitution.
On Saturday, the Central Bank shocked Russians and other countries of the former Soviet Union by announcing that all bank notes printed before 1993 would be withdrawn from circulation by Monday.
Today, a number of newly independent countries of the former Soviet Union criticized the Central Bank's decision. The Finance Minister of Armenia, Levon Barkhudarian, called it an "unexpected and a gross violation of multilateral and intergovernmental agreements linking the former union republics." He said Armenia would ignore Russia's decision and continue to accept older bank notes.
Officials of Moldova said the measure was a "complete surprise" and would cause hardship; Georgian officials said they would introduce their own currency by Aug. 2; officials of Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan said they would have to go along with the Russian decision.
 
Last-Minute Spending Sprees
 But ordinary Russians, who are paid in cash and use it for nearly all purchases, are the most likely to be hurt. Though Central Bank officials said that on average, Russians would have less than 35,000 rubles of old notes on hand, anyone planning to make a major purchase soon would have stockpiled many more. One Russian, who had saved 400,000 rubles to buy air tickets for a holiday in Bulgaria, discovered today that 150,000 of those rubles -- or about $150 -- were outdated.
Other Russians struggled today to spend old rubles at a few open state stores, buying televisions and other goods, while others tried to fill up on gasoline, causing long lines at gas stations. Private gas stations doubled their prices and refused to take older notes, as did nearly all private kiosks checked in central Moscow and in Istra, a small town some 25 miles away. The traders in Moscow's private central market also refused to take old notes, though some were happy to exchange dollars for new notes.
Almost all official money exchanges were closed today, but one private company near the Central Bank offered to sell dollars at a rate of 1,250 new rubles to the dollar and 1,750 old rubles to the dollar. Street traders sold dollars for up to 1,900 old rubles. On Friday, before the announcement, the official exchange rate was 1,004 rubles to the dollar.
The announcement has created speculators in old rubles, who obviously will find a way to exchange them. Long lines are expected on Monday at savings banks as Russians try to exchange and deposit old rubles.
The Central Bank action was criticized by many Russians. An old woman at the central market said her pension was now worthless; a factory manager called the Government actions "deceitful and cruel." He said bitterly, "They act like Communists."
Western diplomats said the Central Bank would probably not achieve its stated goal of rapid control over the money supply. Businessmen will find ways around the restrictions, these officials said.
Some officials also said that corruption among bank officials could not be ruled out after an audit of the bank by Coopers & Lybrand. In an audit partially released to Parliament on July 9, the American accounting firm said the bank's books were impossible to reconcile because of error, possible fraud and incomplete records.
Mr. Sachs said that the audit and the decision on Saturday, when viewed together, showed "gross mismanagement or worse, and the incapacity of the Central Bank to support reform measures."

It's part of a campaign that has been going on for almost 10 years since Jenifer and Jerry Joyce became parents for the first time on Aug. 18, 1983. They emerged from the hospital into a flurry of publicity about the armsful of babies they would be raising. 
 Five babies, to be exact -- a rarity even in a world where fertility drugs have made multiple births more common. (In 1990, the National Center for Health Statistics counted 13 sets of quintuplets born in this country.)
Inevitably, of course, the headlines tapered off and the television cameras went away, leaving the Joyces with being chauffeurs, cooks, referees, counselors and parents to the quintuplets, their only children.
They do not say it has been easy. But they do say it has been worthwhile. And for all seven Joyces, it is, of course, the only family life they have known.
Like all children, the Joyce quintuplets ask a lot of questions. For instance, they wanted to know how a boy and a girl who do not have the same birthday could be brother and sister.
Then there was the time when Lauren told her mother that she had decided to have quadruplets. Mrs. Joyce told her that people cannot choose the number of children they have at one time.
For Mrs. Joyce, 37 years old, and Mr. Joyce, 40, clearing up their children's misinterpretations of life has been relatively easy.
"Trying not to compare is probably the hard part," Mr. Joyce said. "From report cards to baseball games to their tennis ability to whatever, you're constantly comparing. Some are going to excel in some areas and some aren't going to excel in some areas. You always have that instant barometer of comparison."
Mrs. Joyce said: "When they were younger, we used to dress them alike to keep track of them. In a populated place, it was easy to identify them if they all had on orange sweat shirts."
Mr. Joyce added, "It was cute then, but they got sick of the cute stuff." His wife said: "You have to treat them as individuals. It takes a lot more work. When one of them has a real special interest, we try to develop that interest. That's very important."
 
Rules of Their Own
 From oldest to youngest, Christopher likes baseball, Ryan hockey, Lauren soccer and basketball, Kevin basketball, and Megan softball.
None of the quintuplets look confusingly alike, except for maybe Kevin and Ryan, who, like Lauren and Mrs. Joyce, have red hair and freckles. Christopher has blond hair and Megan has brown, with a few freckles sprinkled on her nose.
Each has a different best friend, hobby and career goal. "Everyone likes to do their own thing," Kevin said.
And there are the sibling rules that the quintuplets determined themselves: The boys don't let the girls play Nintendo. The girls don't let the boys in their room. The girls take a different route than the boys when they walk to school, even though the school is about a block from their house.
And the most important credo: "We never play with the girls," Christopher said.
Asked why, he answered: "Because they're girls."
While the quintuplets denied having any common denominator beyond sharing the same parents and birth date, Mr. and Mrs. Joyce know the advantages of having five children the same age.
"They're never bored, and it's nice to know they're never alone," said Mrs. Joyce, a computer analyst at Continental Insurance Corporation in Neptune.
The quintuplets were in the same third-grade class at Sea Girt Elementary School in this town of 2,500. Being in the same class sometimes worked to their advantage. The teacher did not punish the quintuplets if they fought among themselves. "She would say 'Go tell your mother,' " Lauren said.
And if a schoolmate picked a fight with one quintuplet, the others quickly interceded.
Having quintuplets is also efficient, noted Mr. Joyce, an economics teacher and tennis coach at St. Rose High School in Belmar.
"One good thing is that they are involved in the same activities," he said. "If they go to tennis, they all go at the same time."
The quintuplets play on the same soccer, tennis and swim teams. But they constantly compete with one another: the first bowl of cereal, the last piece of bread. Sometimes there are only four beach towels or three rafts. The girls share a bedroom, the boys another, and they all share one bathroom. They never get separate birthday parties, although they seem to have set a neighborhood trend of joint birthday parties.
But they do get two birthday parties. One is a small party with their godparents. Each quintuplet has his or her own pair of godparents, one of the few things they do not have to share. The other party is a big one for classmates, friends and family.
 
Minute-to-Minute Schedule
 The financial costs of having quintuplets is hard for most parents to fathom. In 1992, the United States Department of Agriculture estimated that the cost of raising one child from birth until age 17 was $92,000 to $180,000.
How will the Joyces pay for college? Who is going to teach the quintuplets how to drive? "I just try to handle each day as it comes," Mrs. Joyce said. What about their grocery bill? "I don't keep track of that," she said, but added that the children can eat two boxes of cereal and a bag of bagels each day. "And that's just a snack."
In the Joyce household, time is considered a far more precious resource than money. A schedule is kept on the kitchen counter next to the phone.
Mrs. Joyce gets up at 5 A.M. to do the laundry, exercise and get ready for work. She leaves for work by 7:15, and Mr. Joyce gives the children breakfast and sees them off to school or summer day camp.
By 3:30 P.M., the quintuplets are back at home and Mr. Joyce, too, is usually home by then. About 4 P.M., Mrs. Joyce gets in from work and finishes the laundry, makes dinner, lunches and snacks for the next day.
Evening activities vary from bicycle riding to Rollerblading, but 30 minutes is devoted to reading a book, and the parents require the quintuplets to prepare weekly book reports. By 10 or 11 P.M., everyone is ready for bed.
Every minute of each day is accounted for three weeks in advance, Mr. Joyce said, but their schedule is lighter now than it was nine years ago. He recounted the quintuplets' round-the-clock feedings, and the dozens of volunteers who helped change diapers. Even though Mr. and Mrs. Joyce get more sleep at night now, they still do not have much time to spend alone. But that's not a priority.
"Every minute I have is for them," Mrs. Joyce said. "I just enjoy talking to them. When I'm at work, I miss them. They're my best friends now."

HEADLINE: Tool Orders Dropped 2.3% Last Month

BYLINE: ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
In a sign that plant managers are more wary about the future than they were just a few months ago, machine-tool orders dipped 2.3 percent in June, after a 9.4 percent decline the previous month, the Association for Manufacturing Technology reported yesterday.
New orders fell to $308.65 million in June from $315.75 million in May and $348.30 million in April. The association, based in Washington, represents 340 makers of machine tools. 
 But orders in June still topped June 1992's $208.6 million by 48 percent. And orders for the year are up 39.2 percent, largely because of an unusually strong February, March and April. Analysts traced much of the year-to-date surge to American auto makers, which have accelerated the pace at which they are introducing models. Their appetite for new tools has been strong enough to offset a large decline from the aerospace industry.
 
Increase Termed 'Impressive'
 The increase is "fairly impressive," said William Potter, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder. "Clearly, it is slowing, however."
He said the aerospace industry's caution was a result of the poor health of the airline business. "There's just not the money there to spend on new planes, and there was a lot of buying last year," he said.
This year is also shaping up as a notable one, analysts say, because the bulk of new orders is coming from, of all places, American manufacturers. Of the $1.76 billion in new orders recorded in the first half of 1993, only $165.3 million, or 9.4 percent, were placed by foreign companies.
"About two years ago, the export orders were the only ones causing any growth, and our economy was in the doldrums," said Robert W. Gardner, an association spokesman. However, partly because of the sluggishness of certain European economies, particularly Germany's, he explained, "that's no longer true."
Machine tools are the myriad items found on factory floors that create many of the manufactured products that Americans buy, from refrigerators to car chassis.
 
Viewed as Leading Indicator
 Because machine tools can take as long as 18 months to customize so they can perform their specialized tasks, the monthly statistic is viewed by some analysts as a leading indicator of economic activity. By that logic, the year-to-date surge means that the domestic manufacturing sector is in a slow recovery.

Public Assistance

 BODY:
Recession-related layoffs and homelessness in the region helped drive up the number of people receiving public assistance 22.5 percent since 1988, to more than 2 million last year. Of the two principal aid programs, General Assistance and Aid to Families with Dependent Children, A.F.D.C. has remained the larger, accounting for 79 percent of all recipients and 70 percent of spending. A family of three generally receives $577 a month in New York, $581 in Connecticut and $424 in New Jersey. A.F.D.C. benefits have risen 6.6 percent in New York in the last five years, and less in New Jersey and Connecticut. General Assistance, which normally goes to individuals, has expanded sharply - total recipients increased 66 percent and spending 96 percent. New Jersey pays a montly average of $504 per person; New York pays $352; and Connecticut pays $306.

HEADLINE: A Budget Worthy of Mr. Bush

 BODY:
If the conferees who will meet this week to finish a budget stick to their present path, they'll likely hand President Clinton a package much like the one George Bush signed three years ago. Is that what America voted for?
The conferees are about to recommend chopping deficits by about $500 billion over five years, primarily by cutting defense, trimming Medicare, raising income taxes and imposing a gasoline tax. But that's exactly what Congress did under President Bush three years ago. 
 Mr. Clinton promised voters more than a rehash. He pledged to end the consumption frenzy of the 1980's by turning the Federal budget toward investments in infrastructure, children and training. But Congress is veering in a different direction. Unless it turns around, and fast, Mr. Clinton's victory in getting a deficit-reduction package through Congress will be hollow.
There's nothing wrong with the overall target. The conferees appear headed for a package that would reduce the deficit by the fifth year to about $200 billion -- a prudent target because at that level the nation's debt would grow no faster than the economy. And the mix of taxes is about right. Following Mr. Clinton's lead, Congress would raise taxes on the rich by about $100 billion and impose a gas tax that would likely cost a middle-class family less than $50 a year.
But what about investment? Congress knocked tens of billions from discretionary spending that Mr. Clinton proposed. And it seems unprepared to prune old programs to make way for Mr. Clinton's initiatives. That probably means that most of his plans to hike spending on worker training, education, mass transit and technological research will be slashed. He'll be lucky to save a third of his investment program.
This week the budget conferees will turn to energy taxes and entitlements. The disagreements are narrowing, but still important. The Senate would impose a $20 billion gas tax; the House would raise $70 billion from an energy tax. The House would use the extra revenue to subsidize low-paid workers, create enterprise zones in depressed areas and spur investment in small businesses.
The small-business subsidies are ill-designed and not worth preserving. But the enterprise zones, though modest, are an important symbolic gesture to ailing cities -- the only aid they'll see in the budget package -- and are important to winning support among the Congressional Black Caucus and House liberals.
Tax credits to the working poor and higher food stamp allowances for beleaguered families are more than symbolic. These programs lie at the heart of Mr. Clinton's pledge to lift families with at least one full-time worker above poverty. The House delivered on this pledge by providing large tax credits to low-wage workers, enhanced food stamp allotments and money for innovative programs to help distressed families.
However, the Senate had to reduce or eliminate each of these programs once it cut the House's energy tax by $50 billion. Under the Senate plan, many poor families, for example workers without children, would suffer because they would get no offset to the higher gas tax.
The conferees must decide first the size of the gas tax. If they settle on less than around 8 cents a gallon -- which would raise about $20 billion more than the Senate bill -- then there will not be enough money to elevate the working poor above poverty and fund urban enterprise zones.
Some Western senators oppose gas taxes above the Senate level of 4 cents because, they claim, it hits hard at their rural constituents. They exaggerate. Regional disparities in the gas tax are small and, besides, the income tax hikes hit hard at East Coast cities. Overall, a package with an 8 cent gas tax would be fair.
Congress is moving to hand Mr. Clinton a budget. But if it shortchanges the gas tax or the President's spending initiatives, it won't be a budget that invests in the future and it won't be a victory for those who voted for an economic turnabout.

HEADLINE: At Home Abroad;
Looking To the Pacific

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: SINGAPORE

 BODY:
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, interviewed while here for meetings with Asian foreign ministers, spoke of "the primacy of Asia" in American foreign policy: a primacy of opportunity.
Did that phrase, I asked, represent a change in America's view of the world? 
 "Yes," he said, "it's a change in American outlook. As a trading partner Asia is one and one-half times as large as Europe. That's not to denigrate in any way our European relationships. There's a primacy -- I wouldn't say in intrinsic importance but in the opportunity for development of new economic and security relationships."
The meetings here reflect the gradual growth of an Asia-Pacific network of relationships and institutions. They center on Asean, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, made up of Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei.
Asean, founded in 1967, for a time seemed a rather lifeless acronym. But its annual meetings have become highly significant, with foreign ministers from many other countries coming to talk after the formal Asean sessions. This year the ministers of China, Russia and Vietnam have come, and Cambodia's is a special guest.
A larger grouping, the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, was formed in 1989. It meets in Seattle this November, and President Clinton has invited all its heads of government there for an informal summit meeting: a symbol of his emphasis on the importance of Asia.
Most of the governments in the region want the U.S. to maintain a strong security role in the Pacific. But touring the area, one hears complaints that America can be too rushed, too demanding on issues like human rights. Asians say they see life as more complicated, more gradual.
Cambodia is a case in point. Asian friends of the United States were unhappy when the U.S. seemingly threatened to withhold aid from the new government there if it let the Khmer Rouge play any role. Mr. Christopher said that was a misunderstanding; we accept that Cambodia must make its own decisions, though in our view the Khmer Rouge should not take part unless it really gives up violence. That clarification could be a response to Asian views.
If the Cambodian peace process continues to work, there will be just one major immediate security problem in the East Asian region. That is the question of North Korea's nuclear weapons development. But Mr. Christopher's meetings here have touched on some tense political problems, notably in relations between the United States and China.
The Chinese Government is unhappy with the Clinton Administration's decision to extend its most-favored-nation trade status on condition that, within a year, it shows significant progress on human rights. But Mr. Christopher said the reality was that Congress would be watching closely to see that the condition was met. Speaking not about China but generally, he said:
"I'm a great believer in raising the human rights issue when we talk with other leaders. They may bat it back. But somewhere in their government someone will read the memorandum of the conversation and find encouragement in the fact that the issue was important to the United States."
The other tense matter that Mr. Christopher is trying, with difficulty, to work out with China is Beijing's reported sale of M-11 missiles to Pakistan: a report that, if true, would call for U.S. sanctions.
"I would emphasize how important our nonproliferation policy is," Mr. Christopher said. "It is the arms-control issue of the post-cold war world."
(That leads to an apology. In a recent column I listed the Secretary of State as among those who recommended against President Clinton's decision to extend the moratorium on nuclear tests. I have since learned -- not from him -- that I was misinformed. He not only supported that course; he urged it on the President.)
Warren Christopher does not give up easily when he tackles an issue. In 1980, as Deputy Secretary, he negotiated with Iran for months to end the hostage crisis.
This trip will take him on to Australia. Then he will go to the Middle East to try to get peace negotiations back on track. Was there a chance of success? I asked. "The planets may get in the right order," he said. "That's what I told myself during the hostage negotiations."

HEADLINE: Another U.S. Jet on Patrol Fires at Iraqi Antiaircraft Battery

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25

 BODY:
In the second such incident in a month, a United States warplane fired a missile Saturday at an antiaircraft battery in southern Iraq that was preparing to shoot down the plane, the Pentagon said today.
An Air Force F-4G jet was patrolling the no-flight zone, declared by the United Nations after the Persian Gulf war, when radar at an Iraqi antiaircraft site began tracking it, the Pentagon said. 
 Moments later, about 10:50 P.M. Iraqi time, the pilot replied by firing a missile designed to follow radar beams to their source, the Pentagon statement said. There was no information on whether the antiaircraft site had been hit or destroyed.
 
Missile Launching Reported
 Other United States planes flying over the area immediately afterward reported seeing the launching of a single antiaircraft missile, which did not strike a plane. Pentagon officials said the reported Iraqi missile firing had not been independently confirmed.
Iraq denied that its forces had fired a missile at United States aircraft or that its radar had "locked on" to a plane, Reuters reported from Baghdad. A Government spokesman also denied that the battery had been hit by a United States missile, Reuters said.
On Thursday, Iraq settled its latest impasse with the United Nations over weapons inspections by agreeing to allow surveillance cameras at two missile testing sites. Baghdad's intransigence on this issue had briefly raised the possibility of renewed allied military strikes.
Today, a team of United Nations inspectors arrived in Baghdad to install the cameras at Al Jawn al Azim and at Al Rafa, about 40 miles south of the capital, Reuters reported. The job is expected to take four to seven days.
The incident on Saturday was the latest cat-and-mouse encounter between the allied pilots who patrol the no-flight zone and the Iraqi antiaircraft crews. The Pentagon has said repeatedly that any attempt by radar operators to "lock on" to planes, the first step toward shooting at them, will be considered a hostile act, but Iraq does not accept the no-flight restrictions.
Allied aircraft patrol two zones, in southern Iraq to protect the Shiite Muslim minority, and in northern Iraq to bar attacks on the Kurds.
There were similar incidents in the southern zone on June 29 and in the northern zone on two occasions in April. In late May the Pentagon reported three incidents in which United States planes were fired at by Iraqi antiaircraft in the southern zone but did not respond.
"This is the personality of Hussein," one Administration expert said. "He's going to tweak the giant every chance he gets."
Occasional missile firings, the official said, are intended to shore up domestic public opinion while also testing the resolve of the Administration to keep pressure on Iraq. Previous incidents have been portrayed in the Iraqi press as defense against aggressors.
A United States officer said it was not clear whether the missile firings stemmed from orders drawn up by President Saddam Hussein.
"We think there may be a lot of people who operate independent of his wishes," the officer said. "It's tough to decide whether Saddam is trying to do something or whether someone has acted independently."
Whatever its origins, the antiaircraft activity appears to undermine one of Iraq's chief objectives: obtaining permission to resume oil sales.
The United Nations is weighing whether to allow limited exports, which would ease the effects of the continuing economic embargo and help Iraq earn some badly needed foreign currency.
There was no indication in Washington that the Administration planned any further retaliation for the missile firing. After the last incident, which took place just three days after a cruise missile strike on Baghdad, President Clinton told reporters that he "wouldn't read too much into it."
The cruise missile raid came after the Clinton Administration concluded that Iraq had played a direct role in a reported plot earlier this year to kill George Bush. An Administration official said the antiaircraft missile firings were not of the same magnitude.
"It's like a fly biting an elephant," the official said. "But remember, eventually the elephant's tail kills the fly, sometimes by accident and sometimes by design."

HEADLINE: Clinton Assails G.O.P. Delays In Bitter Tones

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 26

 BODY:
President Clinton accused Congress today of returning to old habits of gridlock and said obstructionism by Republicans there was hurting ordinary Americans, including victims of the Midwestern floods.
The sharp criticism was an unexpected turn to confrontation by a President who has maintained a largely cordial relationship with Capitol Hill. 
 In a speech at a jobs conference here, Mr. Clinton took an angry tone as he complained that Congress now stood in the way of not only flood relief but also a national service plan, and that Republicans had maneuvered in the last two weeks to try to forestall confirmation of his nominee for Surgeon General.
 
'Let's Make Decisions'
 "I don't have to win them all," Mr. Clinton said. "But let's make decisions. This institutionalized delay and gridlock is bad for America."
Mr. Clinton said he did not mean for his criticism to be partisan. But his complaints about filibusters and other parliamentary maneuvers by Republicans were virtually a mirror image of those made last year by President George Bush, who repeatedly attacked the majority Democrats on the same ground during a campaign in which "gridlock" became an epithet.
Mr. Clinton's attack appeared intended in part to pre-empt any effort to delay passage of his economic package, whose final form is being debated by a Congressional conference committee. The President declared that the Government "needs to pass this budget and get on with the rest of its business."
 
Feeling Frustration
 But he was also clearly frustrated by his recent lack of success at winning approval of programs that cause far less dispute. "I mean, you know, this gridlock thing is amazing," he said.
Mr. Clinton said he found particularly inexplicable the filibuster begun by Senate Republicans last Friday to block a vote on his plan to provide grants and loans to students who enlist in a program for national service. The program would cost $394 million in its first year and perhaps $3 billion a year by 1997, and Republican leaders have condemned it as an unnecessary proposal of a tax-and-spend President.
But Mr. Clinton suggested today that the Republicans were engaged in little more than obstruction. "They just want to delay it," he said of the national service plan. "Why? Why shouldn't we send a signal to America's young people that we want you to work in your community to make it a better place?"
Mr. Clinton made his complaints in an address to business and labor leaders attending a conference on the future of the American workplace, a gathering that was sponsored in part by the Departments of Labor and Commerce. He told the group he believed that Washington had changed and that party politics was no longer necessarily an obstacle to action.
But he bitterly cited recent events to suggest that lawmakers remained too slow to shed obstructionist habits.
He complained that the House of Representatives had delayed action on a $3 billion package of flood relief because of a debate about how to pay for it. He also criticized his opponents on a Senate committee who tried last week, although unsuccessfully, to postpone for a second time the confirmation hearings of Surgeon General-designate Joycelyn Elders.
The dispute about flood aid has to do with whether its cost should be covered through cuts in the budget or tax increases, as many Republicans and some Democrats contend, or whether it should be financed by deficit spending.
Mr. Clinton, who favors the latter option, suggested today that he was struck by his opponents' intransigence. "We do not need to raise a tax to pay for flood relief," he said, arguing that the magnitude of the floods, with damage estimates exceeding $10 billion, justified an increase in the deficit.
Although Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy said on Sunday that the Administration might seek as much as $5 billion in flood relief, Mr. Clinton gave no hint today that he intended to add to the current request. But White House officials said they would probably seek additional disaster assistance in a second package by the end of the month.
In citing the experience of Dr. Elders, whose confirmation hearing before the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee was postponed for a week and then nearly delayed again last Friday, Mr. Clinton complained that her treatment showed "how bad it gets sometimes with Congress."
Efforts to win a second postponement, sought by lawmakers who criticize Dr. Elders's advocacy of condom distribution in high schools and early sex education, was blocked only after Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, the committee's chairman, threatened to have the committee meet over the weekend if the hearing did not proceed. The committee is now expected to approve Dr. Elders's nomination when it votes this Friday.
"Maybe there were people who don't agree with her and didn't want to vote for her," Mr. Clinton said of Dr. Elders. Nonetheless, he added, "The country needs a Surgeon General."
Mr. Clinton did not explicitly single out Republicans for criticism today. But it is the Republicans who have blocked the national service plan, it is primarily the Republicans who have delayed a vote on flood relief, and it is the Republicans who have attacked Dr. Elders's nomination. So the examples cited by the President made clear that his complaints had a partisan cast.
The President traveled to Chicago to attend the jobs conference and a political fund-raising event. But the city is also the hometown of Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, who is under investigation in the House post office scandal, and Mr. Clinton could not escape questions about him.
Asked whether an indictment of Mr. Rostenkowski, a central figure in the conference committee, would imperil the economic package, Mr. Clinton said he could not comment on something that had not happened. But he added, "I have no reason to believe that the conference won't proceed and produce a report and the Congress won't vote on it, no matter what."

FOR NEW YORK INMATES, CLEMENCY IS RARE
Last December, after almost 11 years in prison on drug charges, Lawrence Snider was one of only two New York State inmates to receive clemency from Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. The other was Jean Harris, whose conviction for killing her former lover became a cause celebre. Inmate advocates say that while cases like Mrs. Harris's attract attention, prisoners like Mr. Snider -- who developed drug and AIDS awareness programs and organized charity drives in prison -- are more representative of those who deserve to be considered for clemency. But in 11 years, Mr. Cuomo has granted the extraordinary relief only 31 times. A1.

Bids by Owners Sought for Control of Gucci

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: MILAN, Italy, July 26

 BODY:
Maurizio Gucci, who owns 50 percent of the Gucci luxury-goods businesses, said today that he wanted the Investcorp Group, owner of the other half, to bid against him for full control of the company.
The long-simmering dissension between the two partners burst into public recriminations last week, when Investcorp filed a lawsuit and an arbitration claim against Mr. Gucci to prevent him from selling his stake or pledging it as collateral without first allowing the investment company to bid for it. 
 At a news conference here, Mr. Gucci defended his management of the company, which was founded by his grandfather in 1922. He also said the "group's problems will remain as long as ownership remains 50-50."
 
 
Closed Bids Sought
 He said Investcorp had offered him $50 million for his stake, but that he had rejected that as far too low. He said he had offered to buy Investcorp's stake but had been asked to pay $250 million, despite the stakes having equal size and voting rights.
"What I want are closed bids in envelopes," he said.
Investcorp has contended that Mr. Gucci failed to stem the losses at the group and did not put a strategic plan into effect.
An Investcorp spokesman in New York said that Gucci required additional capital and that Investcorp was prepared to inject that capital, "but only if it sees a change of management." He said that the group had not yet identified who it would like to see manage the Italian company, and that it was not necessarily seeking to take over Mr. Gucci's stake.
The current shareholding structure dates from 1991, when Investcorp completed the purchase of the 50 percent of the company held by cousins of Mr. Gucci.
Gucci lost 24.7 billion lire ($15.4 million) in the year ended Jan. 31, down from 37.8 billion lire the year before. Sales were about steady at 225.4 billion lire.
Mr. Gucci said today that the losses were due primarily to the recession. He also said part of the group's problems stemmed from the independence of Gucci's United States operations, which, he contends, owe 104 billion lire to the manufacturing operations in Italy.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
INVESTCORP'S REACTION
 In New York yesterday, a spokesman for Investcorp refused to comment on remarks made earlier in Milan by Maurizio Gucci, Gucci's 50-percent owner.
"We believe this is not the correct time or forum to respond to Mr. Gucci's inaccurate statements," the spokesman said. "The facts will speak for themselves and the case will be decided on its merits."
Also in New York yesterday, Gucci America Inc. filed a countersuit and contended that as chairman of both the United States and the Italian units, Mr. Gucci had "exercised his power to the detriment of Gucci America."
Guccio Gucci, the Florence-based Gucci unit that designs and sells Gucci products to the other units, has sued Gucci America for $63.9 million, or $58.8 million worth of merchandise plus interest.
While conceding that Gucci America has received merchandise from Guccio Gucci that it has not yet paid for, the suit seeks reimbursement for what it calls inflated prices and says such reimbursement will exceed the amount Gucci America owes the Italian unit. In the court papers, Gucci America contended that Guccio Gucci owed it more than $80 million for inflated prices, extra customs duties paid as a result of the price inflation and the loss of sales the American company suffered because of price inflation.
Gucci America also seeks more than $3 million for items it contends were expenses of Guccio Gucci.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Health Plan Sits in the Waiting Room

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 26

 BODY:
Remember health care reform? The Clinton Administration's self-imposed 100-day deadline for producing a plan has long since passed, and some experts in the field worry that a rare moment of political opportunity has been lost.
But officials in the White House and the Democratic leadership on Capitol Hill say they hope to return quickly to health care once the President's economic plan is passed. They plan to send members of Congress home on their August recess with briefing books on the issue, and the President himself will begin to campaign on health care in mid-August, probably at the National Governors Association meeting, aides say. 
 White House officials say they still expect to have the health plan completed and announced by mid-September. They have already organized a "boiler room" operation to manage lobbying and public relations tactics on the issue, comparable to the one now under way on the economic plan. And on Capitol Hill, Democratic leaders in the House and Senate have been meeting weekly to plot strategy.
 
'The Need to Be Coordinated'
 "We really do want to lay the groundwork, to be ready to go when this thing comes down in final form," said Representative Vic Fazio of California, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and one of the Democrats meeting regularly on health. Democratic leaders, he said, learned from the struggle to pass Mr. Clinton's economic plan "the need to be coordinated before day one."
Mr. Fazio and other Democratic leaders defend the Administration's decision earlier this summer to suspend action on health care until the economic plan is finally approved. Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, said: "I think it was a wise decision. Rightly or wrongly, Congress is not capable of digesting and dealing with two such large issues at the same time, so it would have been counterproductive to try to do both at the same time."
Mr. Gephardt also contends that while the issue might have slipped off the front pages in recent months, it remains a priority for the public and Congress. "I'm not saying it's easy, but I'm saying there's still a great desire to do it," he said.
 
Months of Wasted Time
 For all of that, the long lull in what had seemed an escalating drive for change has caused some anxiety among experts in the field. Some argue that in retrospect the task force process established by Mr. Clinton's domestic policy adviser, Ira C. Magaziner -- an effort that stretched throughout the spring and ultimately involved more than 500 experts -- was less than efficient.
"As I look back on it now, it seems to me that the process was needlessly complex and drawn out," said Dr. Arnold Relman, editor emeritus of the New England Journal of Medicine and one of the experts called in to review the task force's work.
"I think a smaller number of carefully selected people could have come up with a viable plan much sooner, and it could have been presented to the Congress much earlier," he added. "And if it had, it would have been out in the public arena where it belongs, without this long period of offstage sniping and maneuvering and politicking by the vested interests."
Robert Blendon, an expert on public opinion and health at Harvard, also saw faults in the process. "Usually you use these commissions to bring the public along," he said. "This had the disadvantages of a public commission, which is that it drags on forever, without the advantage of bringing people along -- because it was secret."
And Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University, said that after all the working group sessions and briefing papers, "What Clinton faces now is the question he faced in December: How do you pay for the damn thing?"
Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Magaziner declined to be interviewed.
 
Clinton Decisions Await
 Indeed, the financing of the health care plan, which is intended to guarantee health coverage to all, still awaits Presidential decisions, White House officials say. An increase in the tax on cigarettes is still expected to be part of the plan, as is some form of tax on employers, officials say.
The President has been holding informal discussions with advisers on these and other health issues, aides say. "I suspect it comes up at the dinner table every now and then," said Jeff Eller, a White House spokesman on health, alluding to Hillary Rodham Clinton's work as chairwoman of the health task force. But Mr. Clinton has yet to resume the more formal meetings aimed at signing off on the plan, officials said.
On Capitol Hill, few underestimate the political task of overhauling one-seventh of the economy; the leadership meetings now under way reflect a recognition of all the structural hurdles, which include not only a gathering army of lobbyists, but also the competing agendas and personalities of several of the most powerful committees in Congress.
Adding to that complicated mix are the difficulties of Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which plays a critical role in health legislation. Mr. Rostenkowski is under investigation in House post office scandal; he denies any wrongdoing.
Moreover, the President's preferred approach to health care has its Congressional critics, including Representative Pete Stark, the California Democrat who heads the House Ways and Means subcommittee on health. In a clear dig at the President and his embracing of "managed competition" in the health care industry, Mr. Stark proposed today that every member of Congress be required to enroll in the lowest-bidding health plan in the member's district.
Mr. Stark supports a single-payer approach, in which the Government pays all health bills. He contends that managed competition, which seeks to control costs through a mixture of market forces and regulation, would lead to diminished quality of care.
For all that, Democratic leaders assert that the pressure to produce a major new health plan is strong.
"Everybody in Congress feels the need to address it because of the strength of the feeling back home," said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, one of the Democratic leaders meeting on health. "I had a couple of experiences this weekend where people who were inundated by the flood said, 'First, we want to talk to you about health care.' "

HEADLINE: Congress Is Feeling Pressure To Preserve Meal Deduction

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 26

 BODY:
In the last days of politically agonizing negotiations over $500 billion in tax increases and cuts in programs like Medicare, Congress is suddenly having second thoughts this week about a long-settled decision to reduce the huge tax break businesses get for meals and entertainment expenses.
Both the House and Senate voted months ago to reduce the deduction for meals and entertainment from 80 percent of expenses to 50 percent, a move that would raise $15 billion in new tax revenues during the next five years. That roughly equals the amount that would be raised by a proposed increase, to 35 percent from 34 percent, in the corporate income tax. 
 But lobbyists and Congressional aides said today that members of Congress were considering restoring a chunk of the deduction, at a cost of perhaps $7 billion in lost tax revenues, even as they haggle over the size of tax increases and cuts in social programs.
 
Lobbying From Restaurants
 Two factors drive the lawmakers, the aides said. One is that the restaurant industry has mounted a lobbying campaign, centered on television commercials in key states, that is pelting House and Senate negotiators with objections from voters back home.
The second may be the most significant as bargaining over the final version of Mr. Clinton's plan reaches a climax this week. Simply put, Congressional support for Mr. Clinton's package is so thin that negotiators are virtually required to reconsider any part of the bill that draws fire from even a small bloc of legislators.
In this case, 19 representatives sent a letter to the House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley of Washington State, nine days ago saying they "cannot guarantee a positive vote on final passage" of Mr. Clinton's package unless part of the tax break is restored. The package passed the House in May by only six votes.
"If the bill had passed by 80 votes they would be telling people to go suck wind," said Robert E. Juliano, the chief lobbyist for the Hotel and Restaurant Workers International Union. "Our issue is one that could tilt it over the other the way."
In the Senate, where the economic plan carried last month by a single vote, negotiators are hoping a restored tax break would win over Senator Richard H. Bryan, Democrat of Nevada, who voted against the plan. Mr. Bryan's state depends heavily on the convention and business-travel trade for jobs and state tax money.
That negotiators are considering multibillion-dollar concessions for the sake of a handful of votes underscores the Wild West character of this budget debate. In effect, every one of the 269 Democrats who voted for some version of the package earlier this year now holds the power to defeat it.
Perhaps coincidentally, it also reflects the political interests of the Congressional powers behind the bargaining. The two chief negotiators, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Chicago, hail from cities where the convention and restaurant businesses are multibillion-dollar industries.
Negotiators said they were optimistic that they could produce a politically palatable compromise by week's end, and that both Houses would pass it before Congress rushes out on its monthlong summer vacation a week from Friday. But they clearly have scant room for mistakes.
For their part, House and Senate aides said, restaurant owners and workers have exploited the negotiators' weakness with a skillful lobbying campaign. When Congress last shaved the meal-and-entertainment deduction to 80 percent from 100 percent in 1986, the tax break was assailed as a write-off for rich businessmen who dined at overpriced restaurants.
 
Lobbying Focuses on Jobs
 This time, the restaurant industry has cast the debate in terms of jobs, not tax breaks. The campaign began in June with a television commercial featuring a small-town waitress who frets that a reduction in the write-off for meals will depress business and cost her her job.
That advertisement was followed two weeks ago by a spot featuring a long-haul trucker, supplied by the American Trucking Associations, who talks about the proposal's impact on drivers who eat almost all their meals on the road.
A spokeswoman for the National Restaurant Association said today that the two commercials had been broadcast in 17 states, most of them rural, and in four large cities, including Mr. Moynihan's and Mr. Rostenkowski's hometowns. Most of the states are represented in Congress by lawmakers who are major players in the economic bargaining.
One Democratic Congressman whose district is targeted, Representative Neil Abercrombie of Hawaii, is the tax expert for an unofficial group of legislators who represent states with large travel and tourism industries. He led the group of 19 representatives who sent Mr. Foley a letter demanding concessions on the issue.
 
Favoring Write-Off of 70%
 His spokesman, Michael Slackman, said today that Mr. Abercrombie was especially worried that a scaled-back deduction for business meals would mean fewer business travelers for Hawaii.
The restaurant industry estimates that the deduction would reduce expenses for meals by $3.8 billion a year and cost 165,000 jobs. But that would be true only if companies and independent business owners cut their own spending on meals enough to recapture every dollar that a reduced write-off would cost them.
The restaurant industry has not said publicly how much of the meals deduction it is seeking to recoup. But Mr. Juliano suggested today that reducing the write-off to 70 percent of expenses, rather than 50 percent, would still generate between $7 billion and $8 billion in new money for the Government in the next five years.
One Congressional aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said legislators considered a write-off of 60 percent or 65 percent to be more realistic. But even that would force the budget negotiators to find $3 billion to $5 billion in offsetting tax increases or new spending cuts.

HEADLINE: Senate Democrats See Re-election Perils in '94

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 23

 BODY:
When Senators Charles S. Robb of Virginia and Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan appeared on the Senate floor recently to deliver enthusiastic pitches for President Clinton's economic program, they were thinking not just of the President's political fortunes but also of their own.
Both men are atop the list of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents facing re-election next year. And both, following deliberate strategies, have decided to stick by their President when they comfortably can, but not to hesitate to offer sometime biting public criticism. 
 Defining their relationships with the President is a delicate matter for several Democratic senators who are gearing up their re-election drives. Of the Democratic senators facing re-election in 1994, only Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts have ever had to campaign when their party was in the White House. Thus, the quandary: Do they run against a President who has thus far proved widely unpopular, or do they remain loyal to Mr. Clinton, hoping that a year from now he will have rebounded?
 
Tied to Clinton
 For all the ambivalence in their speeches about Mr. Clinton's budget, most Democratic senators have grudgingly tied their fortunes to his. That is not simply because they want to do Mr. Clinton a favor but because his success, particularly with his economic program, could translate into their own. Now that the Democrats control the White House, there is pressure for these senators to return to their states with a record of accomplishment.
"Their calculation is, 'the best way for me to get re-elected may be to help the President succeed,' " said Samuel Kernell, a professor of political science at the University of California at San Diego. "In the end, that's Clinton's big trump card. They're all tied together because they happen to be called Democrats."
While the economy may improve before the 1994 elections, and Mr. Clinton may have more to show for himself legislatively, history shows that being from the party in the White House often hurts contenders in mid-term elections. The President's party has gained Senate seats only three times since World War II, in 1962, 1970 and 1982.
 
Republican Advantages
 There are other reasons that some Democrats fear that the 1994 elections could be damaging. From the outset, Republicans have the advantage because they have only 13 seats to defend, while the Democrats have 21. (Some Republican incumbents, of course, also face difficult campaigns next year.) While many Democratic officials said that they doubted that the Republicans could pick up the seven seats needed to take over the Senate, they also expected the Democrats to sustain losses.
Understating the challenge ahead, Don Foley, executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said, "There's no question that it has the potential for being a very difficult year."
There are practical reasons for incumbents to cozy up to Mr. Clinton: Even if he is in a political slump, a President is always a big draw at fund-raising events. And many senators fear falling into what Stanley Greenberg, the President's pollster, described as "the Krueger model."
Former Senator Bob Krueger of Texas, a Democrat who was overwhelmingly defeated in a special election last month, based his campaign on emphasizing his disagreements with Mr. Clinton. Brian Lunde, a Democratic political consultant, said the Krueger debacle left Democratic incumbents scrambling in fear for next year. "The Texas results actually set off the 1994 campaign," he said.
 
Inoculating Themselves
 Senators who are linking themselves closely to Mr. Clinton and his economic plan acknowledge that they are putting their hopes in the chance that Mr. Clinton will recover.
"Krueger ran so far away from Bill Clinton that he lost his political base," said Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, a loud critic of the President's budget before he ultimately voted for it. "Democrats are jittery because Clinton's asking us to do some things that are controversial and difficult. The only thing that I know how to do is to make sure that where Bill Clinton and I have a shared interest we fight together."
Such was the aim of Senators Robb and Riegle in defending the President on the Senate floor. "Robb is doing something that Bob Krueger did not do," Mr. Foley said. "He will support Clinton when he can. That way, he's kind of inoculating himself from charges that he is in lock step with the President."
But even if Senators Robb and Riegle seek to balance their support by voting against Mr. Clinton on other high-profile issues, like the North American Free Trade Agreement in Mr. Riegle's case, the Republicans are already armed with plenty of material for attacks.
After Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota voted for the deficit-reduction package, his state's Republican Party lashed out at him in a statement. The first sentence was hardly restrained: "Senator Kent Conrad today turned his back on the people of North Dakota and voted with Bill Clinton for the largest tax increase in the history of the world."
 
Trouble in Arizona
 Perhaps fearing such attacks in their own states, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey and Richard H. Bryan of Nevada voted against the President's package, not wanting to be tarred with unpopular elements like its proposed increase in gasoline taxes.
"There is certainly a risk for DeConcini in opposing the President because primary opposition may develop," said Steve Owens, chairman of the Arizona Democratic Party. "A lot of people in the Democratic Party think elected officials ought to be out there toeing the line on all votes."
But given that Arizona went for President George Bush last year and that Ross Perot drew a large share of the vote, Mr. Owens said Mr. DeConcini's vote may have been the right move. "There's a real sense of change in this state," he said. "People are not quite sure the Democratic Party has all the answers."
Along with Senators Riegle and Robb, Mr. DeConcini is viewed by officials from both parties as probably the most vulnerable Democrats next year. An indication of that is they are the only three Democrats thus far with clear opposition in the primaries.
Mr. DeConcini and Mr. Riegle are dogged by rebukes from the Senate Ethics Committee for their involvement in the influence-peddling scandal involving Charles H. Keating, the owner of a failed savings and loan. And though Mr. Robb avoided a grand jury indictment in a case involving the illegal taping of his longtime rival, Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, the controversy and Mr. Wilder's decision to oppose him in the primary, leave his prospects far from assured.
 
Glee From the G.O.P.
 A bit lower down on the list of endangered Democrats, officials in both parties say, are Senators Lautenberg and Harris Wofford of Pennsylvania. Mr. Lautenberg has not been particularly popular in his state and could suffer from the anti-Democrat sentiment prompted by Gov. Jim Florio's pushing through higher taxes in 1990. Republicans also hold distant hopes of unseating Mr. Kennedy and Senator Herb Kohl of Wisconsin.
While Mr. Wofford's victory in a special election in 1991 was widely viewed as a referendum on the Bush Administration, he is so closely linked to Mr. Clinton -- and to enacting a new health-care system -- that his prospects may hinge on the success of the President's health program.
Republicans react with glee to the Democrats' nervousness over 1994. Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said his side would make little distinction next year between Democrats like Mr. Lautenberg, who opposed Mr. Clinton's deficit-reduction package, and those who sided with the President.
"You've got some people like Lautenberg who are trying to distance themselves from Clinton, and you have others like Riegle who are not," Mr. Gramm said. "But the point is that Lautenberg has cast plenty of votes to define who he is and what his position is. There's no way they can run away from Clinton."
Senator Harlan Mathews of Tennessee, who was appointed to the seat vacated by Vice President Al Gore and is reconsidering his vow not to run for a full six-year term, said he was sticking by Mr. Clinton.
"To be honest with you, if I were running tomorrow, I'd have some concerns," Mr. Mathews said. "But I've got to believe that in the long run he's going to be a positive influence on this country, and on the '94 elections."

HEADLINE: Yeltsin Softens a Plan to Withdraw Old Ruble Notes

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 26

 BODY:
In the face of growing popular dissatisfaction and loud criticism from the Westernized market-oriented wing of his Government, President Boris N. Yeltsin issued a decree today sharply watering down a drastic currency revision that the Central Bank announced on Saturday.
As Russians stood complaining in long lines from St. Petersburg to Khabarovsk to exchange their suddenly invalid pre-1993 ruble banknotes at state savings banks that had inadequate supplies of new notes, even Mr. Yeltsin's political rival, Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, usually an ally of the bank, opposed the change, calling it confiscatory and threatening to reconvene Parliament to overturn it. 
 So Mr. Yeltsin, who was on vacation when the bank made its decision, moved first. In the process he delivered a stinging defeat to the bank and its acting director, Viktor V. Gerashchenko. Mr. Yeltsin generally sided with free-marketers like Finance Minister Boris G. Fyodorov and embarrassed his industrialist Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, who approved the bank plans in a quick meeting on Friday to which the Finance Ministry was not invited.
In a decree this evening Mr. Yeltsin ruled that Russians could exchange up to 100,000 old rubles, about $100, for new ones until the end of next month, instead of 35,000 old rubles by Aug. 7. He also decreed that 10,000 ruble banknotes marked 1992 could be exchanged for new ones above and beyond those limits and that banknotes of 10 rubles or less could be used until the end of next month, no matter when issued. Many kiosks and vendors could not function because of the lack of valid small change, with new ruble coins in short supply.
The expanded limits and period for exchange should allow for many times the amount of old notes that were in circulation, economists said today, and remove the sense of panic that many Russians have felt. Originally, the people were obliged to put all old notes above 35,000 rubles into state bank accounts, frozen for six months at a low rate of interest. But given the higher limit and Russians' ability to move money among family members and friends, few people should have difficulty finding ways to exchange their old notes.
Countries of the former Soviet Union that still use the ruble or have large stocks of old rubles for necessary trade with Russia will also find it much easier to cope, Western diplomats and economists said.
Mr. Yeltsin's decision all but kills the Central Bank initiative and is a severe embarrassment for Mr. Gerashchenko, who has been feuding with Mr. Fyodorov. Mr. Fyodorov was on vacation in America when the decision was made, and according to Finance Ministry officials and a senior Government economic adviser, Anders Aslund, neither Mr. Yeltsin nor Mr. Fyodorov was informed of the decision, which was made on Thursday.
Mr. Aslund said Mr. Chernomyrdin did not seem to understand the implications of the decision and called the meeting on Friday to which the Finance Ministry was not invited. There was some dissent, especially from Privatization Minister Anatoly B. Chubais, but participants were unprepared and had seen no documents.
Mr. Chernomyrdin "seemed to have been co-opted into supporting the Central Bank move," Mr. Aslund said.
Mr. Fyodorov was informed on Saturday and lodged an internal protest. But Mr. Chernomyrdin's support complicated the matter for Mr. Yeltsin, officials said. Mr. Fyodorov went public on late Saturday night and today, using a statement to dissociate his ministry from the decision and calling it "a deliberate political provocation aimed at irritating the population and discrediting the President, his Government and their course."
 
Failed Effort at Revision in '91
 In an interview today with a Russian radio station, Mr. Fyodorov said: "Once again, we are making fools of ourselves in the eyes of the world. We are using Bolshevik methods of a Stalinist nature to try to resolve economic problems in the context of a market economy." He plans to return here on Tuesday.
Western diplomats suggested that Mr. Fyodorov would move to seize the fruits of his victory and try once more to remove Mr. Gerashchenko from the bank. Mr. Gerashchenko was also in charge of the bank at the time of the last failed revision, in January 1991, when the Government announced that 50- and 100-ruble notes were invalid.
Mr. Gerashchenko, in brief comments today, was unapologetic. But he said he had coordinated them with Mr. Khasbulatov, contradicting the speaker's statement.
In another sign of Mr. Yeltsin's support for his market-oriented wing, he signed a decree accelerating the turning over of state-owned businesses to private interests. The decree reasserts that 80 percent of enterprise shares have to be bought with vouchers issued free to each citizen last year, that at least 29 percent of the shares have to be sold for vouchers to outsiders who do not work for the company and that at least 3,000 large state-owned enterprises have to be turned over this year.
There was anger across the country as Russians once again found themselves wasting their day in lines. Some formed as early as 6 A.M. At a bank at Karyetny Ryad, 70 people waited outside, mostly older women complaining as one person was allowed in at a time. Anna, on vacation from Tallinn, Estonia, had 50,000 rubles. She had registered as No. 45, arriving at 7 A.M., and ran a few blocks to another bank and took No. 307 on that list.
On Chekhov Street there was pushing among Russians and Azerbaijanis and Armenians as some tried to jump ahead of the line. An old woman leaving the bank was pushed and slipped down the stairs. On the periphery, Regina Alexandrovskaya, 38, a teacher, waited with a book. She had split her money with her son and his friend. "These limits are nothing," she said. "You can't even buy a train ticket and a sausage."
In Khabarovsk in the Far East there was a common and acute shortage of notes. Banks offered to deposit old notes and not exchange them. "The situation caused open discontent among the local population," the Interfax news agency commented.
The original decision of the Central Bank had the stated goals of slowing inflation, seizing counterfeit currency and imposing improved control over the money supply.

HEADLINE: EAST ASIAN PACT IS BACKED BY U.S.

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, July 26

 BODY:
Secretary of State Warren Christopher affirmed United States support today for a new security pact that would allow the countries of East Asia to head off conflicts as the region becomes increasingly important in the world economy.
Mr. Christopher and United States officials traveling with him say they envision an Asian equivalent of the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which was established to provide a forum for European countries to work out disputes peacefully. 
 "A new Pacific community must create a new regional balance that promotes stability, regional arms control and the peaceful resolution of disputes," Mr. Christopher said in a speech here today.
The idea of a new East Asian security structure has been promoted by several countries concerned that the end of the Soviet threat and budget problems in the United States may force Washington to reduce its military presence in the area.
While Administration officials say no such withdrawal is contemplated, some countries worry that regional powers like China and Japan would step into any power vacuum.
 
Asia Is Not Europe
 The precise functions of the new body are vague, but would probably evolve into having the members share information about their defenses and discuss territorial disputes that could lead to conflict.
"The purpose is completely different than the purpose you had in Europe during the cold war," said an official traveling with Mr. Christopher. "Here we're not forming blocs against a common enemy. We're having potential enemies, potential antagonists, sitting around the same table talking to each other directly."
As they ended a two-day meeting on Saturday, the foreign ministers of the six countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, endorsed what they termed a Regional Security Forum on political and security issues. The six countries are Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Brunei.
Mr. Christopher is attending an Asean Post-Ministerial Conference, a three-day session that meets every year after the Asean conference and included 11 nations.

HEADLINE: Norwalk Police Find Focus Turns to Them After a Death

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NORWALK, Conn., July 22

 BODY:
A few blocks from brick sidewalks lined with antiques stores and bistros and an extensive array of "shoppes," a dozen of Keith Sumpter's friends were lingering on the chipped pavement near the Carlton Court housing project. It was another restless summer day.
Like many young black men in small cities across the New York region, they said they could not find jobs. So they stood bare-chested in the sun, raging against the local police, who, they insisted, had killed Mr. Sumpter earlier this month for no apparent reason and who routinely harass them. 
 "It's like we're guilty just for being out here," said a 20-year-old who would give only his nickname, "Breeze." "We don't get a chance. We just get laid to the ground with a pistol in our back. That's what brings this anger."
 
Tensions in Smaller Cities
 Tensions between police officers and minority residents are often thought to be confined to volatile neighborhoods in big cities like New York. But law-enforcement experts and community groups say these strains appear to be spreading to the region's increasingly diverse smaller cities, many of which have long prided themselves on their racial calm.
Here in Connecticut, the State Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities now sees as its top priority improving relations between local police forces and black and Hispanic residents. The Community Relations Service, an arm of the Federal Justice Department that mediates conflicts in small cities, says it must focus more on police relations in places like Norwalk, Stamford, New Haven and Bridgeport.
Similar troubles are cropping up around the region, from New Rochelle, N.Y., to the New Jersey communities of New Brunswick, Montclair and Teaneck, a Bergen County suburb that was jolted in 1990 when a white police officer shot a black teen-ager to death. The killing touched off violence and months of protest marches. A jury later acquitted the officer of manslaughter.
 
More Incendiary Conflicts
 "This is one of the biggest issues we're facing in policing," said Jack McDevitt, a criminologist at Northeastern University who specializes in teaching small police departments how to improve ties with black and Hispanic residents. "In these smaller cities, these kinds of tensions are becoming more and more significant."
To be sure, such tensions have long existed in some small cities. But law-enforcement experts say they are now more likely to flare into violence or protest.
Norwalk is an example of how recent wrinkles in the social fabric of the region's smaller cities -- from uneven economic development to the growth in drug dealing to the fallout from the Rodney G. King case in Los Angeles -- have frayed relations.
Law-enforcement experts say the most important change is the evolving populations in cities like Norwalk. Seeking to escape urban ills like crime, drugs and unemployment that plague large metropolitan areas, more members of minority groups are moving to small cities. But many white officers in these areas are unfamiliar with the cultures of the new arrivals, these experts say. And many small police forces remain overwhelmingly white, failing to match the ethnic and racial mix of the cities they serve.
In Norwalk, simmering resentment toward the police erupted into violence in the hours after the July 1 death of Mr. Sumpter, 21, who was black. Even though a curfew was imposed in the South Norwalk section, where many blacks live, young men fired guns and threw bottles at officers.
No injuries or arrests were reported, but the self-confidence of this city of 80,000 on Long Island Sound was bruised.
Mr. Sumpter was apparently unemployed and had no police record. He was described as easygoing and witty by friends, who say he was a mainstay of the street life around Carlton Court, cracking jokes and drinking malt liquor to the throbbing beat of rap music.
The police maintain that Mr. Sumpter committed suicide by shooting himself in the head in an alley as he was being taken into custody on charges of stealing two gold chains from a teen-ager. State officials said that a preliminary forensics investigation appeared to confirm the accounts of the arresting officers, who were mostly white.
 
Mindful of Previous Deaths
 But Mr. Sumpter's family and friends, mindful of other questions about police conduct in Norwalk in recent years, contend that the officers killed him and are hiding the truth. They spoke of Ralph Fuller, 27, a black man who was shot to death in 1986 by Norwalk officers responding to a report that he was threatening a relative with a rifle, which, it turned out, was not loaded. The officers were cleared of wrongdoing.
They also recalled the case of a 14-year-old black teen-ager who was used as a human shield by an officer searching a Norwalk home in 1991. The officer was later punished with restricted duty and had to perform community service, but he remains on the force.
"We know it's a cover-up," said Jeanine Van Lierop, 29, a resident of the Carlton Court housing project, referring to Mr. Sumpter's death. "We know he didn't kill himself over some gold chains."
Another youth from the project remarked: "The cops always kill people. That's why it's us versus them."
Despite the disturbances, Norwalk's Police Chief, Carl LaBianca, said relations with black and Hispanic residents were good and he emphasized that in the last decade, he had increased the number of minority officers on the force to 23 percent, from 9 percent. He declined to let his officers be interviewed.
 
City Defends Actions
 "I think there is a silent majority in the minority community that is afraid to voice their dissatisfaction with what is going on in their neighborhoods," said the Chief, who is white and has been with the Norwalk police for almost 40 years.
"Some of the young people you spoke to are going to say things that will make them safe with the drug dealers," he said. "You are not going to get anyone to come out with the contrary -- about how great the police are doing."
The city's Mayor, Frank Esposito, said he had moved quickly to quell the violence by meeting with Mr. Sumpter's family and seeking local and state investigations. "That shows we are trying to do right and to treat everyone fairly," said Mr. Esposito, 65, who is white.
But some members of the minority community, which comprises about 25 percent of the city's population, maintain that local officials have failed to recognize the deep roots of the hostility.
 
Glaring Disparities
 Some complain that they were bypassed by the wealth that surged through Fairfield County in the 1980's, giving rise to sprawling office parks and roadways crowded with luxury cars. For tenants of Carlton Court, a privately owned project that is almost entirely black and Hispanic, a telling sign of that disparity is the waterfront district a short walk away.
Though the city has rejuvenated the district over the last 20 years by wooing art galleries, expensive restaurants and upscale stores, the streets around the project remain rundown. Tenants say they have seen few economic benefits from the gentrification of what is now known as "Historic SoNo," even as the recession has further limited their chances.
"When you live in a place like Carlton Court, there is a lot of wealth and opportunity around you, but you can't partake of it," said Robert Burgess, executive director of Norwalk Economic Opportunity Now, a nonprofit development agency that provides job training and business grants to the city's poor neighborhoods.
As a result, police officers, who are among the most visible symbols of government, are often targets of residents' frustration. "Young people see the police as guardians of the coffers," said Al Robinson, president of Norwalk's N.A.A.C.P. chapter.
The unrest here has also shown that even in a small city 3,000 miles from Los Angeles, the police beating case there still reverberates.
 
Growing Minority Population
 "The King incident had a devastating effect on everyone," said Archie L. Hodge, 30, an AIDS educator at the Norwalk Health Department who is black and has lived in the city all his life. "You feel that you can't trust the law. And if you can't trust it there -- in L.A. -- then you can't trust it here in Norwalk."
And the Sumpter case has thrown a spotlight on how small police forces are adapting to the growing numbers of black and Hispanic people, as well as immigrants, who are settling in the region's smaller cities. The 1990 census, for example, showed that the Hispanic population of Norwalk had nearly doubled in the last decade, to almost 7,400 people.
Leaders of some community groups in the area say that even if small police departments are trying to diversify, many white officers have failed to adjust.
"The police are not getting proper training," said Domingo Isasi, 54, an engineer and member of United Hispanic Action of Norwalk. "The police officer on the beat sees something happening and has to make a snap decision, but he can only judge by his own heritage. That's when the problems start."
 
More Drug Arrests
 Law-enforcement experts say these misunderstandings often ignite conflicts when officers crack down on drug dealing. Many small police forces, they say, rely on strong measures against drugs -- like flooding a block with heavily armed officers -- that have often been discarded by big-city departments as inefficient and too repressive.
Chief LaBianca spoke proudly of the tough actions he had taken against drug dealing, noting that the number of drug arrests in Norwalk had jumped nearly 40 percent in the last decade, to about 400 a year. But some black residents said that while they were eager to rid their streets of drugs, many officers were too harsh.
"In trying to crack down on the drug trade, they have alienated a lot of people," said the Rev. Carl L. Washington Jr., 38, of the Grace Baptist Church, a predominantly black congregation in Norwalk.
For the last few weeks, Mr. Washington has immersed himself in the tensions of this city, speaking about the Sumpter case with hundreds of people -- black and white -- as well as local officials. He is not optimistic.
"When a lot of us were growing up and moving along, we had opportunities that are not there for them," he said, referring the young black residents he meets on street corners. "Small towns, large towns, there's a lot of anger. And honestly and truthfully, if something is not done to help these young people, you are going to have it more and more."

HEADLINE: Keeping It to a Low Roar;
New York City Tries Electronic Muzzles to Zap Bus Noise

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Watch out, Klingons, a new cloaking technology is in the field. It helps hide a city bus.
The technology is an "anti-noise generator," a computer-driven, 220-watt speaker in the tailpipe of a bus that emits sound waves to partially cancel exhaust noise. The New York City Transit Authority is testing the device, also called an electronic muffler, in four buses. 
 It will not turn a 41-seat city bus into a match for the Klingon warships that make themselves invisible on "Star Trek," but it does help eliminate sound, especially the low-frequency sound that travels farthest and rattles windows along the street as buses pass.
With an electronic muffler, a bus "doesn't sound as heavy as the normal bus," said Charles E. Boston, driving a test bus up the East Side of Manhattan yesterday.
 
The Muffler as Mimic
 The Transit Authority's goal for the muffler goes beyond cutting noise. By replacing the conventional muffler, which is a maze of sound-absorbing baffles, the electronic muffler makes it easier for the bus to emit exhaust, thus raising horsepower or increasing fuel economy.
The muffler works by analyzing the sound waves and mimicking them, sending out waves of the same frequency and amplitude, but out of step. The technique is a little like that of a parent who quiets the splashing of a child at one end of a bathtub by making waves at the other end.
The devices being tested in New York were invented by Noise Cancellation Technologies Inc. of Stamford, Conn. They were installed by Walker Noise Cancellation Technologies, a joint venture of the Stamford company and Walker Manufacturing, a division of Tenneco that says it is the world's largest manufacturer of conventional mufflers.
Walker Noise Cancellation says its muffler will cut fuel consumption by 3.5 percent. This may not sound like much, but New York City buses average 2.9 miles per gallon in stop-and-go traffic and travel 30,000 miles a year, meaning a savings of nearly 350 gallons annually. The Transit Authority has 3,700 buses that run on a form of diesel fuel that lately has cost the city 65 to 75 cents a gallon.
 
Wooing Transit Companies
 Walker sold the first four mufflers to the city for $1,100 each, which a company representative said was a generous price to induce New York to get involved. The company's goal is to get enough operating experience to prove that the mufflers work, then persuade bus manufacturers to build them into their designs.
Houston and two transit systems in Southern California have placed small orders for the mufflers, a Walker representative said, and others are negotiating.
The transit systems are generally most interested in the mufflers as a means to save fuel. In New York, Charles Seaton, a spokesman for the Transit Authority, said that "it would be hard to tell with the naked ear" whether the mufflers make buses quieter, and that their main advantage is efficiency.
Scott H. Buehrer, a spokesman for Walker, said the electronic muffler is especially helpful at low frequencies below 500 hertz, a tone roughly equivalent to the B below middle C on the piano. In other words, it lessens the rumble, not the whine.
 The technology is already used in factories to reduce the drone from vacuum or blower fans. Walker says it is also working on a version to use in an airplane to blank out engine noise.
But buses are a harder task, because their speed, and hence the pitch of their engines, keeps changing. "We love fixed r.p.m.," said Ross B. Gordon, the national account manager at Walker.
The first electronic muffler was installed on a New York bus about four months ago, yielding an immediate increase in horsepower of about 4.5 percent, Mr. Buehrer said. But the buses have about 255 horsepower and do not need more, according to the Transit Authority, which would rather take the efficiency gain as fuel savings. So the authority recently installed smaller fuel injectors in the buses with electronic mufflers, restoring the horsepower to the original level and increasing fuel economy.
Measuring the mufflers' effect will take several months, said Andrew S. J. Skabowski, an engineer at the Transit Authority, because fuel economy varies with traffic, temperature, the habits of the bus driver and how many people are aboard.
But Mr. Skabowski said he had high hopes. "If it works without a lot of repairs, we're looking at savings," he said.
With the muffling technology in hand, engineers say they may eventually look at other places to reduce bus noise, including the transmission, drivetrain and fans or air-conditioning compressor.
But then there is that special clunk, rattle and jingle of the bus hitting potholes. The solution for that, experts say, does not lie with the bus.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "NOISE: Lowering Exhaust Rumble"
To reduce noise pollution and save fuel, the New York City Transit Authority is trying out a new noise-cancellation technology in some of its bus mufflers.
 
1. Engine noise is analyzed by an engine sensor and a tailpipe microphone.
 
2. A speaker in the muffler generates sound waves that are the opposite of the engine noise.
 
3. The resulting sound from the vehicle is relatively low in volume.

HEADLINE: Study Sees Pain Ahead in States' Budgets

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS

 BODY:
After three years of painful and protracted budget battles, most states approved spending plans this spring and summer with relative ease, if not resignation.
But the pain has just begun for many states, according to a study made public yesterday by the National Conference of State Legislatures at its annual meeting in San Diego. 
 The study, which provides the first look at how the states completed the last fiscal year and are beginning the new one, noted that with few exceptions elected officials enacted spending plans that did not address the fastest-growing budget areas: corrections and health care.
Moreover, these two programs will consume nearly 20 percent of all state spending this fiscal year, up from about 14 percent five years ago. And by some dire projections, Medicaid alone could consume a third of state spending by the year 2000.
 
Growing Programs
 "In California, they call a hot, quiet, humid day earthquake weather," said Ronald K. Snell, director of the conference's fiscal program who was the main architect of the study. "That's where the states are: it's quiet, but there is an earthquake building."
Mr. Snell said there were two major opposing forces on the fault line running through state budgets. On one side is the inexorable growth in the cost of punishing criminals and of providing health care for the poor and elderly under the federally subsidized Medicaid program, of which most states pay about 50 percent. On the other side, he said, there is the reluctance of voters to increase taxes for programs like prisons that do not seem to work or have any bearing on their lives.
Fiscal experts say most states have done little to control health care costs because they have been waiting for a national plan. President Clinton postponed making his health care proposal until this fall, saying that Congress was preoccupied with the budget and deficit reduction plan.
"People should have laughed hysterically at that," said Brian M. Roherty, executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers in Washington. "It is totally and completely absurd to have a Federal budget that does not address health care, which is the most profound structural problem in Federal and state budgets."
The delay in dealing with health care policy has its most apparent effect on higher education. Since 1990, states have shifted $7.7 billion in costs to public colleges and universities, which have responded by raising tuition and laying off faculty and staff members in most states, according to the American Association of State Colleges and Universities.
"We are entering a situation where there are not enough classes and programs for people to finish degree programs, and the neediest students can't get enough financial aid to go to college," said Dr. James B. Appleberry, president of the association.
State budgets for the 1994 fiscal year, which began on July 1 in most states, were driven more by political pressures than by fiscal ones, which could, at least temporarily, be ignored. Budgets in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Connecticut, for example, were passed on time, with no broad tax increases, no significant initiatives and very little debate.
In fact, all states but California and Vermont ended the 1993 fiscal year with balanced budgets, thanks to conservative revenue projections and low inflation.
The conference's fiscal study was based on complete budget information from 38 states and tax information from 46 states. It paints a statistical picture that averages out the stark differences among states, much in the way that a person who has one foot in a fire and one foot on ice is, on average, comfortable.
The study provided this picture of the financial health of the states:
*For the first time, state financing for Medicaid exceeded spending for state colleges and universities in the last last fiscal year. In the 1992 fiscal year, states spent $28.5 billion on higher education and $26.5 billion on Medicaid. In the 1993 fiscal year, spending on higher education declined to $27.5 billion and spending on Medicaid increased to $32 billion. This fiscal year, states plan to spend 24 percent more on Medicaid than on higher education, which used to be states' highest priority after financing primary and secondary education.
*Tennessee, going beyond the reforms adopted in a half-dozen states, boldly scrapped Medicaid and replaced it with a managed care program to try to provide better coverage to nearly twice as many residents at no additional public cost. The Federal Government is expected to approve the program, which would start in January.
*In the Northeast, where most economies are sluggish, budgets for the current fiscal year were balanced with many accounting gimmicks like delaying the payment of bills. In the Midwest, states that are inundated by the Mississippi River reported that it was too soon to calculate the disaster's impact on their budgets. California, which had to cope with a $9 billion shortage in its $52 billion overall budget this fiscal year, is in the worst fiscal shape.
*States expected that their revenues would rise by 2.8 percent on average this year, or less than the estimated 3.3 percent rate of inflation. State forecasts for revenue collections range from a 6.1 percent growth in Idaho, which is thriving with the growth of high-technology industries, to a 7.5 percent decline in Montana, where the economy has stalled.
Sensing the anger of the electorate and the shallowness of their pockets, most states did not enact new taxes. Some states also did raise taxes, most paid by smokers and tobacco companies. New York alone increased taxes on cigarettes by 17 cents a pack to 56 cents. The total new tax revenue expected amounts to $3.8 billion, or just a fraction of the $16.2 billion in taxes enacted in 1991.
 
California Takes Lead
 The budgetary pressures are most intense in California, and state experts look to California for clues on how other states would, sooner or later, deal with similar problems.
California's problems with the rising cost of health care and corrections have been aggravated by years of limits on taxing and waves of immigration and job losses. The state avoided a replay of last year's budget crisis in part by sharing more of the crisis with local governments.
For instance, California reduced its spending on primary and secondary education by $2.6 billion and forced cities and counties to absorb the cost by using local property taxes. The state softened the blow by extending a half-cent sales tax surcharge, which benefits cities and counties. The surcharge, however, will expire in November unless two-thirds of the voters decide to extend it.
In effect, the state is shifting costs to the local level and forcing taxpayers to decide whether they want to pay for the programs.
"This may be startling in 1993," Mr. Snell said, "but in a few years we may look back and see that California was the first of many states to do this."

HEADLINE: Rise Granted On Insurance For Doctors

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 26

 BODY:
With efforts to tame the rapid rise in health-care costs delayed in both Washington and Albany, the State Insurance Superintendent today approved an average 14 percent rise in medical malpractice insurance rates paid by doctors.
The increase, which takes effect on July 30, will be the first rise in malpractice premiums after four years of stable or declining rates. The Insurance Superintendent, Salvatore R. Curiale, said in a statement that the change was justified because of an increase in the number of malpractice lawsuits being filed, a rise in the dollar amount of malpractice awards and a decline in interest rates, which has limited insurers' investment income. 
 But officials with groups representing physicians and patients said the increase would only accelerate the rising of health-care costs in a state where medical care is already highly expensive. And they said it would continue the defection of specialists with high insurance premiums, like obstetricians, from fields that already are suffering from dangerously low numbers.
 
Most Expensive Region
 With the latest rise, neurosurgeons practicing on Long Island, the most expensive specialty and region in the state, will pay premiums of $130,532 a year, up from $114,532. In Manhattan and Westchester County, they will pay $101,002, up from $88,599. Obstetricians in Manhattan and Westchester will pay $86,609, while on Long Island they will pay $111,930. General practitioners will pay $11,311 in Manhattan and Westchester and $14,618 on Long Island.
The increase comes as Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the Legislature have taken a break from negotiations on revamping the state's hospital payment system. Whatever compromise is reached will almost certainly mean at least a modest rise in payments to hospitals and thus in health insurance premiums for most New Yorkers.
This fall, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, the state's largest and most troubled health insurer, is expected to petition Mr. Curiale for another rate increase. Some legislators and health-care lobbyists have projected that its rate increase request will be at least 20 percent.
In Washington, the President's Task Force on National Health Care Reform does not expect to produce a proposal until this fall at the earliest, months later than originally planned. Policy makers in both capitals believe any meaningful change in the health-care system must be accompanied by changes in the medical-malpractice system.
President Clinton's task force has discussed a proposal to relieve individual doctors of legal responsibility for negligence, leaving patients to sue insurance companies and health maintenance organizations instead.
For the last three years, Mr. Cuomo has proposed creating a fund that would compensate the families of newborns injured during birth, regardless of whether malpractice is proved. It would be financed through a $300 fee paid by doctors and hospitals in the birth of each newborn.
In 1985, after malpractice premiums rose more than 50 percent, Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature enacted a series of significant changes aimed at keeping rates down. The law reduced the amount of contingency fees that lawyers could earn in malpractice cases, allowed large malpractice awards to be paid over long periods of time and imposed penalties for frivolous lawsuits, among other measures.
Over the next five years, the number of malpractice cases filed in New York dropped precipitously, from 14,224 in 1986 to 3,410 in 1991, according to figures compiled by the Alliance for Consumer Rights. But last year the number rose to 3,753.
John Calagna, a spokesman for Mr. Curiale, said five insurance companies write policies for virtually all of the 25,000 individually insured physicians in New York. Those companies, he said, submitted actuarial reports showing the need for a rate increase. The largest company, the Medical Liability Mutual Insurance Company, which insures 51 percent of the state's doctors, said it deserved a 20 percent increase, he said.
Insurance Department actuaries studied the company reports and recommended an average 14 percent increase to Mr. Curiale. The amount of the increase can vary by specialty, by region and by company.
 
'Just Intolerable'
 Gerard L. Conway, director of government affairs for the New York State Medical Society, said the increase was "just intolerable," particularly since Congress is considering deep cuts in Medicare reimbursement rates for doctors and hospitals. "There's no question that this is going to reduce access for the people who always end up getting the short end of the stick," he said.
A 1990 survey by the New York chapter of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists found that 17 percent of obstetricians and 70 percent of family practitioners who once delivered babies in New York no longer did so. High premium costs for liability insurance were cited as the major reason. Eleven counties had three or fewer obstetricians, and three had none.
Mr. Conway did not question Mr. Curiale's methodology for awarding the increase. But he said the increase highlighted the need for malpractice insurance reform.
Consumer groups, however, criticized Mr. Curiale for awarding the increase without fully auditing the insurance companies to examine whether profits truly were shrinking and, if so, whether the cause might be poor management instead of the growth in malpractice awards.
"You would have thought with this whole Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield thing that we would have learned about going through the paces and granting these requests, but apparently we haven't," said Laura Wittkin, executive director of the New York City-based Center for Patients' Rights.
Blair Horner, the legislative director of the New York Public Interest Research Group, joined Ms. Wittkin in predicting costs would be passed along to patients. "That's where the $10 aspirin comes from," he said.

HEADLINE: Senate Confirms Former Amex Head as S.E.C. Chairman

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 26

 BODY:
The Senate today confirmed the nomination of Arthur Levitt Jr., President Clinton's selection as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Mr. Levitt, the former chairman of the American Stock Exchange, will succeed Richard C. Breeden, who said in February that he would step down as chairman. 
 President Clinton announced the nomination of Mr. Levitt on April 28 after it had been held up by the required review of his finances and a politically sensitive decision to select Mr. Levitt instead of an aide to Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan.
The Administration has been trying to appoint members of minority groups and women to more key financial posts, and for some time the front-runner for the S.E.C. post was thought to have been Consuela Washington, a black woman who works for Mr. Dingell on a House committee overseeing the commission's work.
But President Clinton finally turned to Mr. Levitt, who had worked on Wall Street for many years and had substantial backing. He also helped raise millions of dollars for the Clinton campaign.
His predecessor, Mr. Breeden, a Republican who was appointed S.E.C. chairman by President Bush in 1989, had closely allied himself with the Bush Administration.
Though President Clinton had announced his selection of Mr. Levitt as S.E.C. chairman, the Senate technically was considering only his nomination as a commission member. Under the law, the President selects one of the commissioners as chairman.
It is difficult to say what effect Mr. Levitt's selection would have on the agency, which regulates trading in stocks and bonds, but he has had a longtime interest in entrepreneurial companies like some of those traded on the American exchange.
As chairman of the American exchange, Mr. Levitt increased spending on surveillance and regulation of market participants.
Mr. Levitt is chairman of the Levitt Media Company of New York, which publishes Roll Call, a twice-weekly newspaper covering Capitol Hill. He served as Amex chairman from 1978 to 1989. Before that, he ran a securities firm that became part of what is now the Shearson Lehman Brothers unit of American Express.
The Senate also confirmed today the nominations of Alan S. Blinder and Joseph Stiglitz to join President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. All the Senate's confirmations today were unrecorded voice votes.

HEADLINE: In West, Dinkins Promotes Candidacy and Filming

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 26

 BODY:
Battered last week by criticism of his handling of the Crown Heights violence, Mayor David N. Dinkins managed to create some positive moments here, spending the last three days raising money for his re-election campaign and drumming up support for filming in New York City.
Mr. Dinkins met with movie studio executives today, brandishing statistics that he said showed that filming had become less costly and hectic in New York, before he boarded a plane to return home. During the weekend, Mr. Dinkins held a fund-raiser, played tennis and met Barbra Streisand and friends for dinner and movies. They watched "Poetic Justice" and "Cliffhanger."
 
The Political Wars
 But New York's political wars did intrude a bit. Responding to criticism by Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate for mayor, that Mr. Dinkins was masking fund-raising in Los Angeles as an official trip, the Mayor said: "Put this with a long list of things he doesn't understand. Instead of just raising funds I'm spending time doing good government, which is useful to the city." 
 The Mayor said that his trip here underscores the importance of the film industry to New York, where film and television production accounted for $3 billion in economic activity in the late 1980's. That figure has declined considerably in recent years, mainly as a result of a seven-month labor dispute between studios and several unions that ended in 1991 but continued to discourage producers from filming there.
Many producers said they have abandoned filming in New York because of high costs, regulatory restrictions and the logistical problems of working in a city with severe traffic congestion.
Richard Brick, head of New York City's Office of Film, who accompanied the Mayor, said that in the last year the city had seen an increase in filming, citing an increase in the number of film permits to 62 in the first five months of the year, compared with 40 in the same period last year.
Mr. Brick attributed the increase in filming to recent contract agreements with unions that, for the first time, have put the cost of film labor in New York on a par with that of other major cities throughout the country and to agreements with hotels that now offer discounts to production companies. In addition, Mr. Brick said the city's film office had received a small increase in financing that would allow it to expedite requests by production companies for filming and building permits.
Some studio executives said they were impressed with Mr. Dinkins's efforts to make movie-making more convenient and affordable and said they hoped to do more shooting in New York.
"These trips do make a difference because they show a commitment from the top officer of the city to try and alleviate any red tape issues that might exist," said Robert Friedman, a spokesman for Warner Brothers. "Clearly it fosters better relations when you know that you have the ear of the boss and he is making this sort of pilgrimage."
Tom Pollock, chairman of MCA Motion Picture Group, who met with Mr. Dinkins today, said that although logistics and overuse of the city are still drawbacks to filming in New York, production has become easier because the city has given the film office the authority to persuade city agencies to assist producers.
For example, Mr. Pollock said that MCA's current filming of "The Paper," a movie about newspaper wars in New York, was being jeopardized by the need to remove a wall to create a newsroom. "We would have had to wait forever to get the proper permit," Mr. Pollock said. "It helps to have a film office that has been endowed with some power."

	--------------------	 	
 
A PENALTY FOR CUOMO
 In New York, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said he would not be surprised if he pays a political price for ordering the investigation that produced the criticism of Mr. Dinkins's handling of the Crown Heights incident. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who supports Mr. Dinkins, may run for a fourth four-year term next year and some political analysts and Dinkins allies believe the Governor will be held accountable by black voters if the report contributes to a Giuliani victory.
Mr. Cuomo said he had no choice but to request the investigation. "If you run away from difficult truths and controversial matters because you're afraid somebody's going to misunderstand and vote against you, then you can't govern," he told reporters after delivering a speech in Saratoga Springs. "So it may be that we pay a political price."

HEADLINE: U.S. Seeks to Ease Friction in Companies

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 26

 BODY:
With corporate executives and labor leaders gathered here today to give supporting testimony, the Clinton Administration insisted that more jobs would exist in the United States if only management and workers ran their companies together.
The daylong conference, sponsored jointly by the Labor and Commerce Departments, served as a billboard to advertise a keystone of President Clinton's jobs program -- that the friction inherent in traditional labor-management relations undermines efficiency and the competitiveness of American companies in a world market. 
 "The most interesting thing that you said is that what turned out to be good for the company turned out to be good for the employees," said President Clinton, who led one of the sessions after giving the luncheon speech. He had just heard an executive of U S West, the phone company, a U S West employee and a representative of the Communications Workers of America describe cooperative efforts, including the redesigning of some jobs.
The Conference on the Future of the American Workplace was billed as a historic attempt by labor, management and Government to reach agreement on common work practices. "We have spotlighted the best practices," Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said. "There are a lot of people out there who don't know they are embracing a new movement."
But the nearly 500 people who were invited to the conference skirted or failed to reach agreement on several major issues, including whether an efficient company, one that enjoys ideal labor-management cooperation, can create many jobs in a weak American economy that fails to generate much demand for many companies' products. "When we proposed this conference after the election, we thought it would be in the context of a much more growth-oriented package of public and private investment," said Derek Shearer, a Clinton economic adviser, referring to the President's public spending stimulus proposals, rejected by Congress.
Whatever the economy's strength, the Clinton Administration considers companies would be more competitive, and thus more likely to create more jobs, if hourly workers were "empowered," to help run their companies, as Mr. Reich put it. This means they must engage in endless skills training, work closely with management in setting production and pay levels and they must take on such tasks as hiring fellow workers, passing on product quality, reorganizaing assembly lines and carrying out other efficiencies even if that lengthens their hours on the job.
The role of unions in achieving this transformation remained unclear at the conference. Unions represented labor in developing partnership arrangements at many of the dozen or so companies represented at the conference. That raised the possibility that the Clinton Administration might encourage union organizing as part of the new cooperation -- perhaps reversing the steady decline in union membership over the last 20 years.
Thomas R. Donahue, secretary-treasurer of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., called for changes in Federal law to make union organizing easier. But Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said in an interview that they "were not necessary" to the cooperative process, "although they can be an important part of the equation."
 
Issue of Job Cuts
 Several themes came out repeatedly in the sessions. One was job-cutting through layoffs and attrition, a phenomenon at thousands of American companies. Although no one promised this would end, many speakers depicted the cooperative workplace as a method of slowing or halting job shrinkage, or at least making the process more just.
Inland Steel Industries, for example, has a new 10-year labor agreement with the United Steelworkers under which its Indiana Harbor Works, engaged in the new work practices, will nevertheless pare the 9,000 production workers to 7,000. The union has agreed to help the company achieve efficiencies that will cut labor costs and make Inland competitive with other steel companies.
The company has agreed to trim the staff not through layoffs, but through "accelerated attrition" of older workers near retirement, said Robert J. Darnall, chairman of Inland. The rest of the workers, in effect, will have job security.
Then there was pay. Rather than raising hourly wages, the companies at the conference favored profit-sharing or gain-sharing to give workers a share of the improved performance. Gain-sharing is a form of bonus payment based on workers achieving new production goals or some other efficiency. Pay increases based on skills was another favorite, to encourage workers to participate in training.
 
Opportunity for Input
 Asked by Mr. Reich what he considered the most important component of "the high performance work organization," Thomas J. Zidek, a line worker and union leader at the L-S Electro-Galvanizing Company in Cleveland, said: "The opportunity to have input into determining our own pay system, and to set gain-sharing goals."
The conferees recognized that a relatively small number of American companies have attempted to make their workers partners in running the companies. They noted that the process requires costly outlays for reorganizing assembly lines and for training workers, and that many companies preferred instead to take "the low-wage alternative."
There were several proposals to discourage companies from forcing down wages to cut costs, rather than cutting costs through worker-management cooperation. Ray Marshall, secretary of labor in the Carter Administration, called for tax penalties for companies that relocate to low-wage countries. And John T. Joyce, president of the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen, said the Clinton Administration should tighten labor laws to limit "the option that companies have to escape collective bargaining."
But neither Mr. Brown nor Mr. Reich responded to these proposals, many of which are now before an Administration-appointed blue ribbon commission on labor law reform that is to issue its first report next May.

HEADLINE: Jurisdiction Being Sorted Out in Serial Killings

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., July 26

 BODY:
Prosecutors from nine New York counties met here today to discuss jurisdiction in the case of Joel Rifkin, the unemployed landscaper who has admitted to killing 17 women.
The Nassau County District Attorney, Denis E. Dillon, said the closed-door talks were about "the problems that arise when various jurisdictions are involved" in a complex murder case like that of Mr. Rifkin's. 
 He said Nassau will continue with plans to prosecute Mr. Rifkin here for the one case in which the victim's body was found in the county.
He declined to comment about whether any of the prosecutors sought to transfer Mr. Rifkin to their jurisdictions to face charges in other murder cases. He said Mr. Rifkin remained at the Nassau County Jail in East Meadow.
The prosecutors were given statements Mr. Rifkin made to the state police after his arrest. Mr. Dillon said it was the first time they had seen the information. Ed Grilli, a spokesman for Mr. Dillon, said the information included locations where Mr. Rifkin told authorities he had committed murders or had disposed of bodies.
"The information turned over to them as part of this meeting will help them to gain insights into the case and to see how his statements to troopers fit into their various jurisdictions," Mr. Grilli said.
The prosecutors discussed a proposal by Robert Sale, Mr. Rifkin's lawyer, to consolidate all the cases in Nassau County, Mr. Grilli said.
But Mr. Dillon said some of the prosecutors questioned such an approach for fear a legal error could result in trial reversals.
"Even before the meeting, some of the district attorneys raised questions whether or not that could be legally done," Mr. Dillon said. "Nobody wants to prosecute a case where there are some serious legal problems. So I don't think that's in the cards."
Mr. Rifkin, of East Meadow, was arrested last month after the New York State police discovered a woman's body in the back of his truck. Authorities said he has confessed to killing 17 women and dumping their bodies throughout the region, from Putnam County to the eastern tip of Long Island. As the investigation into the confessions of Mr. Rifkin deepened, law-enforcement agencies from across the region contacted the state police to see whether there might be a link between Mr. Rifkin and other unsolved murders.
Decisions on jurisdiction were complicated, Mr. Dillon said, because cases could be prosecuted either where a body was found or where the murder was committed.
"The discussion involved where it would be best to prosecute," he said.
The nine counties involved in the talks are Nassau, Suffolk, Manhattan, Queens, the Bronx, Westchester, Orange and Putnam.
A public announcement will be made when officials decide the jurisdiction questions, Mr. Dillon said. But he could not say when that would occur.
A state police spokeswoman, Kelly Shonholz, said there were "no further developments" today in the case.

HEADLINE: Science Park Plan Offers Vision of Newark's Center

BYLINE: By CHARLES STRUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, July 26

 BODY:
An elaborate vision of high-tech offices, homes, parks and shops was put forth today for a desolate 50-acre tract in this city's Central Ward, with Federal, state and community leaders praising the plans as a formula for hope and economic growth during the next 20 years.
Although the proposal, called University Heights Science Park, is little more than a concept at this point, officials at the announcement ceremony in City Hall spoke encouragingly of the collaboration of educational institutions and civic leaders that would lead, they said, to 3,000 permanent jobs and $4 million in property-tax revenue on land that now generates next to nothing.
 
Educated Guesses
 They also acknowledged that the detailed architectural renderings arrayed behind Gov. Jim Florio, Senator Frank R. Lautenberg and Representative Donald M. Payne were merely educated guesses as to what might eventually be built. They insisted, however, that their goal of a $250 million development amid the scars left by the 1967 riots was realistic. 
 To underscore faith in the proposal, Everett Shaw, Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, pointed to two highly speculative ideas that have recently moved closer to completion and that, with the science park, are considered complementary to the effort to revitalize Newark. The first is the $60 million performing arts center, for which site preparation is under way. The second is the proposed $850 million rail line that would link Newark and Elizabeth to Newark International Airport.
Mr. Shaw, who also serves as president of Renaissance Newark, a business-supported group to encourage commerce and development, acted as host and cheerleader for the event, saying the proposal was on "the cutting edge of how planning will occur in urban centers."
"There's no room for critics," he said. "There's only room for participants to join."
University Heights is a term coined about 15 years ago when four of Newark's major educational institutions -- Rutgers University, Essex County College, New Jersey Institute of Technology and the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey -- came together to act as a catalyst for new housing and other civic needs.
Under the plan, students, faculty members and researchers from each institution will work to develop new biomedical products that would attract manufacturing to the park, which has antecedents in Philadelphia and other cities. The state has committed $8.5 million in seed money, and the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development provided $1.5 million to buy remaining land and buildings. About half the land is government-owned and off the tax rolls. Most is vacant except for about 110 units of housing and a hodgepodge of vacant or little-used buildings.
 
Olympic-Style Ceremony
 The planners, whose committee includes the presidents of the four institutions, envision one million square feet of commercial space, 150 to 200 homes for low- to moderate-income families, park and recreation space and day care. After the start-up, which includes renovation of an existing building next to New Jersey Institute of Technology for laboratory and office use, officials hope that venture capitalists will underwrite most of the development.
Projections by the Institute of Technology forecast 7,600 construction jobs and 3,000 permanent jobs, with 450 for Newark residents, if the project is completed. The plan also calls for a science high school to attract students from Newark and surrounding communities, as well as job training.
The 90-minute announcement ceremony in the City Hall rotunda concluded with a symbolic torch lighting that featured six flashlights camouflaged as Olympic-style lamps. As Newark's business administrator, Glenn Grant, sounded themes of community, hope and cooperation, Governor Florio and other officials solemnly placed each torch into a frame that resembled an oversize test-tube holder.
Conspicuous by his absence was Newark's Mayor, Sharpe James, whose reputation as a civic booster is unrivaled here. A sheaf of news releases included a congratulatory letter from the Mayor dated July 23 but made no mention of missing the ceremony. Some officials cited the mayor's achievements, but none noted his absence.
Later, a city spokeswoman, Andrea Martin, said Mr. James was on a long-planned annual trip with the Sharpe James Civic Association, a group of the Mayor's political supporters. She said he would return to the city next week.

HEADLINE: Dow Climbs by 20.96, to a Record 3,567.70

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average surged to another closing record yesterday, as all leading stock market indicators climbed.
The Dow gained 20.96 points, ending the day at 3,567.70, surpassing its previous closing high of 3,555.40 set last Wednesday. 
 The Dow Jones utilities average also reached a new closing high, riding continued strength in the bond market to finish at 248.88, 1.78 points above its April 16 record of 232.75.
"Today's very encouraging, particularly since the Dow did it for real this time, rather than by a few cents as it did a few days ago," said Gene J. Seagle, director of technical research for Gruntal & Company. He attributed the day's results to some strong second-quarter reports and waning fears of inflation and taxes.
"I think the Street is feeling more reassured that we're not going to get the amount of high taxes relative to cutbacks in spending and so forth -- that Clinton is not going to get the extremes of his program through," he said.
The rally came despite a rise in the price of gold, which investors generally turn to as a hedge against inflation. Gold for August delivery rose $3.10, to $93.10 an ounce. Mr. Seagle attributed that gain in part to speculators trying to manipulate the price of gold by creating fears about inflation.
With many municipal bonds coming due this month, Mr. Seagle noted, there should be plenty of cash to urge the rally along. "If you add all these things together, the factors that created this move in the first place are still there," he said.
 
Other Leading Indicators
 Among other leading indicators, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.99 points, to 449.09, while the Nasdaq composite gained 4.30 points, to 704.54. The American Stock Exchange composite rose 1.71 points, to 433.76.
Trading on the New York Stock Exchange was moderate at 224.2 million shares, compared with 222.2 million on Friday.
Continuing the trend of recent weeks, stocks rose and fell on reported earnings yesterday, rather than in obedience to some general trend. The Williams Companies gained 2 7/8 yesterday to close at 56 3/8. After Friday's close, the company reported that its second-quarter net income doubled, thanks to improved results from its telecommunications unit. It reported earnings per share of 66 cents, compared with 27 cents last year and expectations of only 39 cents.
At the other end of the spectrum, Cummins Engine led the decliners on the New York Stock Exchange, plunging 6 1/2, to 82 1/2, after issuing a disappointing projection for third-quarter earnings of less than $2 a share.
David M. Garrity, first vice president for research at Mcdonald & Company Securities, said that much of the drop-off in earnings resulted from a slowdown in production of diesel engines for the new Chrysler T-300 pickup. "What happens when you have a product change-over is that production is quite low," he said. "The T-300 promises to be a very successful truck, but you can see investors right now are quite impatient with any company that does not meet expectations."
While he has a hold position on Cummins, Mr. Garrity said, "clearly the selloff represents an opportunity for the long-term investor."
Novell, the software maker, was the most active over-the-counter issue, with almost 11 million shares trading hands after a Goldman, Sachs analyst lowered his earnings projections and investment rating for the company. After hitting a 52-week low of 21, Novell finished down 3 1/2 at 21 1/4.
McDonnell Douglas continued its recent strong performance yesterday, rising 2 1/2 points to close at 87. A week ago, the company reported higher-than-expected second-quarter earnings, thanks to its restructuring. "They've been able to have strong margins in each of their divisions despite lower volume," said David Pizzimenti, an analyst with Nomura Research.
Promus, the casino company, rose 3 points yesterday to close at 56 3/8, possibly on rumors that the company would be selected to run a new casino in Windsor, Ontario.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds End Their String of Losses

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose for the first time in five sessions yesterday as investors adjusted their positions ahead of two important Treasury auctions.
The gains partly reflected a sense that the market may have overreacted to last week's testimony on interest rates by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, some economists said. 
 The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond rose 11/32 point, while its yield fell to 6.67 percent, from 6.70 percent late Friday.
Short-term Treasury issues were unchanged to 1/16 point higher and intermediate maturities were 3/32 to 7/32 higher.
 
Early Gains Overseas
 The gains came in light, choppy trading. Prices opened higher after advancing overseas, where investors sought bargains after last week's four-session tumble during which bond prices fell by more than 2 points.
But the market retreated as concerns crept in about whether there would be enough demand to absorb new Government notes this week, said Steven R. Ricchiuto, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Government Securities Inc.
The Treasury is scheduled to auction $16 billion in two-year notes today and $11 billion of five-year notes tomorrow.
The market is sensitive about its ability to absorb the new supply after Mr. Greenspan told members of Congress, in no uncertain terms, that the central bank was ready to raise interest rates to control possible future inflation.
Higher rates on new securities would diminish the value of already-sold investments, like bonds and notes, that pay a fixed rate of return.
 
Supply and Demand
 But the market began rising again after results of the Government's sale of new three- and six-month bills showed good demand for supply, Mr. Ricchuito said.
In its regular weekly auction, the Treasury sold $12.3 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 3.10 percent, for a yield of 3.17 percent. Another $12.3 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 3.24 percent, for a yield of 3.34 percent.
Some market participants have tempered their initial fear that the Fed would move quickly to push interest rates higher, said Kevin Logan, chief American economist at the Swiss Bank Corporation.
Mr. Logan said that yields in the when-issued, or pre-auction, market for two-year notes were reflecting anticipation of a Fed move to push interest rates higher in about six months. Initially, many investors had interpreted Mr. Greenspan's comments to mean that the Fed would raise rates even if there were no obvious signs of inflation.
"It looks like people will be well rewarded for holding these securities, given the chances of a Fed tightening over the next six months," Mr. Logan said.
 
Housing Report Is Ignored
 The market largely ignored a National Association of Realtors report that sales of previously owned homes rose 1.9 percent in June. The increase was stronger than market expectations but did not have a major effect on prices, said Dan Seto, economist for Nikko Securities Company International.
The Federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 3 1/16 percent, up from 3 percent late Friday.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 10 18/32, down 3/32 from late Friday. The average yield to maturity was unchanged at 5.81 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
As America grows older and grayer, are companies becoming any wiser about their marketing?

BYLINE: By Michael Janofsky

 BODY:
IF recent advances in medicine and health care are not evidence enough that the passage from middle age to maturity has moved farther along the lifeline, please consider this: Mick Jagger turned 50 yesterday.
That is just one fact that Ken Dychtwald -- gerontologist, psychologist, author and marketing consultant -- uses to demonstrate how corporate America may be misreading the demographics of the country for their advertising and marketing strategies. 
 Here is another fact he is likely to mention during his two-day seminar, which starts today in Manhattan: By the end of the decade, according to the United States Census Bureau, the American population of 50 and older will have increased by more than 12.3 million in 10 years, to 76.1 million, overtaking what will then be 63.5 million adults aged 18 to 34, a decrease of about 6.1 million from 1990.
If youth is wasted on the young, Dr. Dychtwald will be among the loudest to point out that so is marketing. Only in recent years have American businesses begun to recognize the change. And companies are seeking to know more.
A year ago in San Francisco, Dr. Dychtwald's seminar attracted 250 people. The enrollment for this week's event, sponsored by his Emeryville, Calif., consulting firm, Age Wave, nearly totals 650. Many major corporations are expected to attend, including Pepsico, RJR Nabisco Holdings, Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, Eastman Kodak and Kellogg, as well as representatives from financial service companies, insurance companies, hotels, drug manufacturers and advertising agencies.
His message is a simple one: Marketing efforts in the United States are skewed so heavily toward younger groups that companies are missing the greater and growing buying power of older generations, people living and working longer than ever before.
The older generations have been largely ignored amid a continuing corporate fascination with youth. But a recent study for the Social Security Administration found that the 50-to-54 and 55-to-59 age groups in 1990 had the second- and third-highest median incomes in the country (adjusted to family size), respectively, with $25,983 and $24,884. The leading age group was 45 to 49, at $26,305. The 20-to-24 group was $11,241 and the 25-29 was $17,588.
"Advertising agencies have always targeted the 18- to 49-year-old group, whether it's radio, television or print," said Treesa Drury, the advertising standards director for the American Association of Retired Persons. "That's what they have always looked for," she said. "It's been the largest group, and we have been a youth-oriented country. An older person was somebody you didn't want to be. But all that's beginning to change."
But why has it taken so long?
"Old habits die hard," Dr. Dychtwald said. "Companies still have an extraordinary ability to market to the young because they feel younger people 'look like us,' they're are all over the media and only until the last several years, the image of people over 50 has been that they are frugal and just winding down their lives. But this is the first time there has been a mass population of this age that is comfortable, vigorous and economically powerful."
For the most part, the stereotype is understandable. Many elderly Americans grew out of the Depression era of the 1930's or as children of parents from the era and bore the psychological fears of their generation. They were taught not to spend frivolously and to save always for a rainy day -- an unshakable foundation from which their spending power has grown. Materialism broke through only as a philosophy with the post-World War II baby boomers, whose spending patterns began setting the marketing agendas by the 1970's. Yuppies followed.
Despite the increasing numbers of those 60 years old and all those boomer-buying habits turning 50 in several years, only a small number of companies are mining the older market.
"Four years ago, there were maybe five or six commercials on television aimed at people 50 years and older," Dr. Dychtwald said. "They were for products for dentures, constipation, headaches and hair dye. If older people were in commercials, they were portrayed as buffoons, like Clara Peller asking, 'Where's the beef?' "
A rare exception occurred in 1987, he said, when the Quaker Oats Company began using Wilford Brimley, an actor who looks like everybody's uncle, to sell cereal on television. More recently, Procter & Gamble has used older people in commercials for Scope mouthwash to show they can be as reluctant to offer a good morning kiss before rinsing as yuppie couples.
"And other companies will catch on," said Kenneth G. Manton, a professor of demographic studies at Duke University. "They'll have to."
Dr. Dychtwald has at least been heartened by the apparent demographics of his seminar. The large number of senior company executives expected suggests an older crowd.
"Maybe," he said, "they're starting to get the message."

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Boeing Net Lower, but Stock Rises

 BODY:
The Boeing Company posted lower second-quarter earnings yesterday, but the results exceeded analysts' expectations and buoyed the company's stock.
Still, the company warned that sales would soften and that results would be weaker in the third and fourth quarters than analysts expected. 
 The Seattle-based aerospace giant, the world's largest aircraft manufacturer, earned $426 million, or $1.25 a share, in the quarter, compared with $432 million, or $1.27 a share, a year earlier. Revenues increased slightly, to $7.99 billion from $7.82 billion.
Boeing stock rose 87.5 cents to close at $38.625 in trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts had expected earnings of about $1.05 a share.
Boeing said it had a 14 percent loss in military and aerospace sales in the quarter from a year earlier and delivered fewer airplanes -- 109, compared with 121 in the quarter last year.
"You simply had early shipments," said Peter L. Aseritus, a First Boston analyst who had expected 95 deliveries. "You rob Peter to pay Paul a little bit."
But Mr. Aseritus added that the company's 7.3 percent operating profit margin, coming during a severe recession in the airline industry and glutted commercial aircraft market, buoyed appraisals that Boeing's long-term cost cutting measures -- including thousands of layoffs -- have softened the downturn's blows.
Boeing's sales projections for all of 1993 are for about $26 billion, compared with 1992 sales of $30.2 billion.
"The question is: Can Boeing maintain its operating profit even though it is making less deliveries?" said Peter M. Musser, an analyst with Ragen McKenzie in Seattle.
Some analysts expect Boeing's planned production cuts from 40 aircraft a month last year to 21 a month by mid-1994, along with increased customer financings and soft pricing, to erode margins significantly.
But in a statement, Frank Shrontz, Boeing's chairman and chief executive, emphasized that the company expected to maintain its profit margin as production continued to decrease, excluding research and development costs for new aircraft models.
With an upgraded version of its 737 commercial airliner expected in 1997 and a new 350-seat 777 twin-jet model due in 1995, Boeing is not expected to cut deeply into its research and development budget, which was $1.8 billion last year and is estimated to be $1.7 billion this year, said Russell D. Young, a company spokesman.
Boeing's new-order tally for the first six months of 1993 was $9.3 billion, compared with $9.4 billion for the first half of 1992.
But Steven Binder, an analyst with Bear, Stearns & Company, said that customers continued to request rescheduling of existing orders, pushing deliveries out farther into the futures.
"Which means the downturn has not troughed yet," Mr. Binder said.
Meanwhile, Boeing and the Rockwell International Corporation announced yesterday that they had joined forces to pursue an Air Force and Navy contract for guidance kits for bombs.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Continues Its Gains As German Move Is Awaited

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar continued to march higher yesterday as investors fled from European currencies in advance of a German central bank meeting that could decide the future of the continent's exchange-rate system.
The dollar rose half a pfenning against the German mark, trading late in New York at 1.7250 marks. The dollar also edged upward against weaker European currencies that are under attack by speculators. Some investors are betting on a realignment or even collapse of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, which sets narrow bands in which the European currencies trade against each other. 
 "People are fearing the whole system looks so unstable that they'd better stay out of E.R.M. currencies altogether," said Nigel Rendell, an international economist with the James Capel & Company investment house.
Speculators picked the Belgian franc as a target yesterday after betting heavily against the French franc, Spanish peseta, Portuguese escudo and Danish krone last week. The pressure became so intense that Belgium and Portugal raised short-term interest rates yesterday to discourage speculators from borrowing money to bet against their currencies.
 
U.S. Trading Is Light
 In the United States, trading was reported light yesterday as investors waited to see if Germany's central bank would cut interest rates at its meeting Thursday.
If it does not, other European countries will either have to match Germany's relatively high rates or see their currencies -- and in turn the European system -- battered. Lower interest rates in a given country prompt investors to sell that nation's currency, since investments there earn less.
"If they don't cut rates Thursday, the market will definitely try to test the central banks," through dumping weaker currencies and forcing central banks to buy them up to defend their value, said Tom Benfer, a senior market representative at the Bank of Montreal.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 5.8875 French francs, up from 5.8785 francs on Friday. The British pound slipped to $1.5015, from $1.5045 on Friday. And the dollar slipped to 106.65 Japanese yen, from 106.85 yen on Friday.

HEADLINE: Japan Wins U.S. Embassy Work

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 26

 BODY:
The State Department has selected a Japanese construction company to renovate the residence of the United States Ambassador in Tokyo, even though the American trade representative has found that Japan discriminated against American companies in awarding Government construction contracts.
An American company that wanted the job, Fischbach & Moore International, filed a formal protest Friday contending that the State Department award violated Federal law. 
 The State Department selected the Obayashi Corporation last week to do the renovation because it was the low bidder, according to Susan Edmondson, a department spokeswoman. Obayashi bid $7.1 million, compared with $10.2 million by Fischbach & Moore of Dallas and $10.7 million by the J. A. Jones Corporation of Charlotte, N.C.
The difference in the bids was so great that the American companies could not benefit from a provision that awards contracts to American companies that are within 10 percent of a low bid by a foreign company. In addition, Ms. Edmondson said, Obayashi built the original residence, "an absolutely magnificent historic structure."
President Clinton stayed in the residence during his recent visit to Tokyo to meet with leaders of the seven biggest industrial powers, and it will be the official home of the new Ambassador to Japan, former Vice President Walter F. Mondale.
In its protest with the General Accounting Office, Fischbach & Moore noted that the Foreign Service Buildings Act limits foreign bidders to those from countries that give equal access to American bidders for comparable diplomatic and consular building projects. The only exceptions are those required by international agreements, and when the Secretary of State determines such bids are in the interest of bilateral relations or are needed to carry out a construction project.
In a report to Congress on April 30, the Office of the United States Trade Representative identified Japan as discriminating against American companies in the procurement of construction, architectural and engineering services.
On June 30, Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, formally identified Japan "as a country that maintains, in Government procurement of construction, architectural and engineering services, a significant and persistent pattern or practice of discrimination against United States products or services that results in identifiable harm to United States businesses."
Mr. Kantor made the finding in accordance with Title VII of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, which authorizes trade sanctions against countries that discriminate against American companies in their government purchasing policies. Mr. Kantor barred European Community companies this spring from bidding for some Federal contracts in retaliation for the community's new purchasing rules for telecommunications equipment. However, Mr. Kantor postponed putting the sanctions against Japan into effect.
The Office of the Trade Representative had no comment on the Tokyo contract, according to Dianne Wildman, a spokeswoman.
Ms. Edmondson, the State Department spokeswoman, said that Fischbach & Moore should have raised the disqualification issue during the prequalification period last January. "These are guys who know the State Department, who do work for the department in other parts of the world," she said. "If that really was a problem, it should have been raised during the prequalification phase."
But Fischbach & Moore considers her objection a technicality, and notes that the findings of discrimination by Japan were made in April and June, after the prequalification period.
Robert R. Kiley, president of the Fischbach Corporation, parent company of Fischbach & Moore, said that the State Department action was "inconceivable to us." The Fischbach Corporation is in turn a unit of American International Group.
Mr. Kiley, a former chairman of New York State's Metropolitan Transportation Authority, suggested that Obayashi could not do the job for the $7.1 million it bid, and that the motive for the low bid was to keep American construction companies out of Japan. "We don't think they could possibly have done it at a better price than we bid and still made any money," Mr. Kiley said."
Similarly, Carl Nagel, estimating manager of J. A. Jones's international division, said, "There's no way we could have gotten down to the price of Obayashi." His company, which had the Mitsui Construction Company of Japan as a silent partner, had no plan to protest the award, Mr. Nagel said.
Ms. Edmondson said that the State Department estimate for the job was $7.5 million.
Clyde Prestowitz -- president of the Economic Strategy Institute, a private trade-research group, and a former trade negotiator -- viewed the action by the State Department as part of its continuing indifference to trade issues.
"These things are read by the Japanese as evidence that the United States is not serious," Mr. Prestowitz said. "When Mickey Kantor goes over there and hammers them to open up their construction markets, and the State Department gives a contract to a Japanese company, it just destroys the trade representative's position. We do this time and time again."

Gold for August delivery jumped $3.10, to $393.10 an ounce, while July silver climbed 12.1 cents, to $5.082 an ounce. 
 The gains more than offset the losses posted last week in both markets. The metals stayed within their recent trading ranges but some analysts were surprised by the strength of the rally in light of the absence of inflationary signals.
"It was a really decisive move," said Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst with Paine Webber Inc. in Weehawken, N.J.
He credited the gains to "safe harbor" buying as investors and institutions switched assets from foreign currencies to gold and the dollar.
The Belgian franc yesterday became the latest victim of the speculative exchange-rate turmoil sweeping Europe, intensifying skepticism about plans for a single European currency by the end of the decade.
A Russian Central Bank decree eventually making all rubles printed before 1993 invalid for purchases also lifted gold futures, said Peter Cardillo, research director for Westphalia Investments Inc. in New York.
"The thought behind the move was that with the Russian currency in deep trouble here, the people of Russia would turn out and buy more gold," he said.
Mr. Cardillo said the move could prove negative for gold prices in the long run because Russia, a major gold producer, is likely to produce and export even more gold to gain hard currency.
Mr. Savaiko said expectations for a German interest rate cut also buoyed the gold market.
"Every time they cut their rates, it seems to be good for gold," he said. "It fuels fears about future inflation, even though we haven't seen any inflation yet."
On other commodity markets, energy prices rose. Light crude oil for September delivery rose 32 cents, to $18.07 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. August heating oil rose 0.18 cent, to 50.37 cents a gallon; August unleaded gasoline rose 0.01 cent, to 52.06 cents a gallon, and September natural gas jumped 5.6 cents, to $2.124 for 1,000 cubic feet.

Micro-Minis Make It Big
The clothes were barely off the haute-couture runways when Barbara Moss, the sales and public relations director for A. B. S. Clothing Collection Inc. of New York, was on the phone touting the news that the company's micro-mini was already heading for Bloomingdale's windows. 
 The biggest winner in the hemline game won't be haute couture, but bridge lines like A. B. S. and Tapemeasure that are made in the United States. A. B. S., which has turn-on-a-dime production capabilities, said it will run an advertisement with Bloomingdale's in August for a micro-mini look.
"For the past two months, we haven't been selling long," said Lloyd Singer, president of A. B. S. "Women, in most cases, didn't accept the long straight skirt. Whether it's a micro or just above the knee, women know they can wear the short skirt."
Mr. Singer said the turnaround time was five days for A. B. S. last year when bell-bottoms became hot. "Nov. 8, we sat down with Kal Ruttenstein of Bloomingdale's," Mr. Singer said. Mr. Ruttenstein, senior vice president of fashion direction at the store, wanted to be the first to have the pants in an ad. "Five days later he had 300 on the floor."
Mr. Singer said his salespeople have been letting stores know that A. B. S. has short skirts. "That's what being first is all about," he said.
Tapemeasure's designer, Marsha Drogan, said: "If you went anywhere in the past year, you saw short skirts, whether it was suits or black tie. I think women picked long skirts up as items.
"In seeing short come back, they won't feel manipulated; they'll believe they won their point."
The best label for the micro-mini, however, may be caveat emptor. Long skirts can be hacked off to fit the mood swings of designers. But there's no place the micro can go. Except in the dustbin.
 
Banned on the Job
 Critics doing their jobs occasionally find themselves banned from the very events they cover. And The International Herald Tribune's Suzy Menkes is doing her job, con brio, as far as two Italian designers are concerned.
She was banned this season from the haute-couture shows of Gianni Versace and Christian Dior, designed by Gianfranco Ferre, because of reviews she's written about the designers' work in the past. While that still left 10 other couture collections for her to cover, the work of Mr. Versace and Mr. Ferre has great impact.
There's no equivalent in other fields of criticism to fashion, where a commercial enterprise offers invitations to a selected few for a one-time showing. The Herald Tribune has a worldwide circulation of 200,000.
"I'm sorry for the readers of The Herald Tribune," said Ms. Menkes, who also writes a monthly column for the Styles of The Times section of The New York Times. "They expect, and they have a right to expect, coverage that takes in all the shows. And I'm sorry for myself. I'm interested in shows, and I like to see the development of designers. If all a fashion critic says is 'bravo, bravo,' what is such empty praise worth?"
 
A Fashionable Trade Show
 Admit it. Someone says trade show and you think of toothy conventioneers with name tags. Blenheim Holdings is on its way to changing all that.
Blenheim is organizing two shows for people in the fashion industry: the International Jeanswear Show, Sept. 11-13 in Miami Beach, and the New York Premier Collections, Sept. 19-21.
For the New York show, Blenheim's chief executive, Marshall Lester, traveled to Paris to sign up Lamine Kouyate, the designer of Xuly-Bet. "He represents the cutting edge of French fashion today," Mr. Lester said. Besides Mr. Kouyate, who will be showing in New York for the first time, the first-ever New York event will feature 200 exhibitors including Anvers, Corine Cobson, Dorothee Bis and Max Mara. "I don't know why no one's ever done this before," Mr. Lester said. "But in the current tough economy, buyers are looking for one-stop shopping."
The jeans show is set in what Mr. Lester deems "America's St.-Tropez." One of the highlights will be a celebrity jeans auction to benefit the People With AIDS Coalition.

HEADLINE: Spain Launches Invasion Of Latin America, to Push For Cultural Preservation

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JESUS, Paraguay

 BODY:
Against a landscape of rolling fields and grazing cows, church columns of pink stone rise unfinished. Work stopped in 1768 when a decree arrived here from King Carlos III of Spain, ordering the expulsion of all Jesuit missionaries from this distant corner of empire.
Now, a new fence protects the ruins from art thieves. Sturdy beams shore up sagging walls. Near a new guard cottage, a billboard heralds the mission's new benefactor: Spain. 
 After two centuries, Spain is returning to Latin America as a regional force for historic preservation.
 
$12 Million a Year
 The reasons for the return have more to do with imperial memory than with imperial conquest. As modern Spain has developed economically, it has become a member of the European Community and acquired a foreign aid program.
"Our motivation for this is to return cultural identity, to retrieve what would be lost," Inocencio Arias, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation and Latin America, asserted recently in Madrid.
Starting small in 1984, Spain's historic restoration aid to Latin America has gradually grown to become a $12 million-a-year program. Working in 17 Latin American nations, Spanish aid has restored about 60 major structures, from forts to theaters to cathedrals. To nurture local interest in historic preservation, Spain has started a school in each of the 17 countries, to teach local apprentices skills needed for restoring colonial-era buildings.
"This is a very powerful force for raising people's awareness about the value of historical houses," said Carlos Colombino, director in Asuncion of Manzana de la Rivera Cultural Center. Facing the presidential palace in Paraguay's capital, this block of 19th-century and colonial-era houses was to be razed for a park. With Spain paying about 60 percent of the $1 million budget, the city was able to buy the houses, refurbish them and turn the complex into a cultural center, complete with library, museum and theater.
"This project is only possible because of the Spanish money," Mr. Colombino said. "It is forcing government people to take a second look at the value of old buildings."
Indeed, with three-quarters of Latin America's population now living in cities, Spain is seeking a wide impact for its limited resources.
Up and down Latin America, projects vary, from restoring 19th- century buildings in the historic center of Ponce, P.R., to restoring a 17th-century Spanish customs building in Portobelo, Panama, to restoring Inca forts in northern Chile and Mayan pyramids in Tikal, Guatemala.
Despite a token project in Portuguese-speaking Brazil -- the restoration of the art nouveau downtown of Joao Pessoa -- all the projects are in Spanish-speaking America. About 80 percent of the projects involve restoring buildings from the Spanish colonial period, an era that ended for most of the region by 1825.
 
Church as Cultural Heritage
 Reflecting the ancient nature of Spanish colonization in Latin America, several projects involve restoring churches built in the 16th century, decades before English settlements began in North America. About half of the projects involve restoring Roman Catholic buildings: cathedrals, churches, monasteries, convents and episcopal palaces.
"Unlike the United States, we have no limitations regarding state money that is used for the restoration of religious buildings and monuments," Mr. Arias said. "We consider these buildings as much a part of a country's cultural heritage as ancient ruins and colonial mansions. Why should we discriminate?"
Here in Jesus, the thick walls and massive columns of the unfinished church were to "compete with the finest churches of America," said one mid-18th century chronicler. While Italians designed most Jesuit missions in South America, three Spanish architects designed the one in Jesus. They drew heavily on Spain's mudejar style, a fusion of Moorish and Christian motifs. The Spanish project, budgeted at $480,000, is to start with archeological escavation, cleaning and a study of structural damage caused by two centuries of abandonment.
In addition to repairing a Jesuit mission virtually covered by forest in Argentina, Spanish restorations of religious buildings include a 16th-century Franciscan church in Popayan, Colombia, damaged by a 1983 earthquake, and an 18th-century Franciscan church in Havana that has suffered from hurricanes, the explosion of a boat in Havana harbor and religious restrictions by the Communist government.
Work restoring secular buildings is often aimed at planting seeds for neighborhood renewal and economic growth. All projects require that the host country contribute to restorations, usually about 40 percent of total costs.
 
No 'Museum Pieces'
 "These projects, when finished, are not going to be museum pieces," said Oscar Centurion, who served as Paraguay's director of cultural properties until May. "They are going to raise the standard of living and provide development."
In Venezuela, Spain is providing financial and technical aid to refurbish parks and balconied buildings of the historic center of Ciudad Bolivar. This interior city is a major departure point for tourists for Angel Falls, the world's highest waterfall.
In Quito, Ecuador, another city with a strong tourism trade, the Spanish aid is helping to refurbish the historic downtown. In Cartagena, a Caribbean city that is Colombia's largest tourist destination, Spanish aid is restoring the Naval Museum, a colonial and neo-classical melange dating back to 1604. In Lima, Peru, Spanish aid is restoring a rococo-style, 18th-century country house that is now engulfed by one of Latin America's largest cities.
Backed by the new money and the old prestige of Spain, Latin America's preservationists hope local politicians and business leaders will see the need to preserve and restore old buildings.
 
'Historic Patrimony'
 Creating a corps of Latin American technicians, the 17 national workshops expect to train 1,200 artisans by 1995: blacksmiths, carpenters, masons, roofers and painters.
"We want to promote among Paraguayans -- and other Latin Americans -- the idea that historic patrimony is important," said Raimundo Espiau, an architect who coordinates Spanish aid in Paraguay. Moving beyond the colonial era, Spain hopes to restore Asuncion's mid-19th-century train station and its late 19th-century city theater.
In a visit steeped in symbolism, King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia of Spain stopped at the ruins of Trinidad near here in October 1990. Once one of the grandest of the 30 Jesuit missions, this baroque masterpiece fell to pieces after the expulsion order signed by the current monarch's predecessor, King Carlos III.

First Olympic Event: Going for the Green

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir

 BODY:
Olympic and TV executives will square off today over the sale of network rights to the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. The networks will try to show how cost-conscious they can be. The International Olympic Committee will push the value of the centennial Olympiad happening live on the East Coast. The Atlanta organizing committee will simply scream for the most money it can get.
The closed-door meetings scheduled for today and tomorrow will need plenty of intrigue to match past Olympic TV negotiations, which have comprised a rather enthralling Olympic event on their own. Most of the fascination grew out of the great competitiveness among the three networks and ABC's position through 1988 as the pre-eminent network of Olympic television. Roone Arledge, the former president of ABC Sports, once said: "Olympic negotiation with the networks is a case of putting scorpions in a bottle." 
 That three-way rivalry has abated as the freewheeling, freespending days of the 1970's and 1980's have given way to today's economics of parsimony.
Bidding used to occur in exotic locales, like Hollywood producer David Wolper's house or Switzerland's Lausanne Palace Hotel. By the time talks for the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona rolled around, they were held in the same East Side law firm that will be the site for today's negotiations.
For the rights to the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, CBS aligned itself with a German impresario named Lothar Bock, who was close to Soviet authorities. ABC was the reigning TV home of the Games, but, according to a source, Bock locked up an agreement for CBS even before talks began. But the deal unraveled, as Soviet authorities started changing the rules of the negotiations. All parties went home. Bock returned to Moscow and secured a contract from the Soviets, but John Backe, the CBS president, refused to sign it. From a phone at P.J. Clarke's in Manhattan, Bock called Carl Lindemann, the president of NBC Sports. "If you want the Olympic Games," Bock said, "fly to Moscow tomorrow." Lindemann flew, and agreed to pay $81 million for the Games that the U.S.A. boycotted.
The night before bidding began on the 1984 Winter Olympics, executives from each network sat in a hotel resturant. A call came for Arthur Watson, the president of NBC Sports. Watson left the table, returned, whispered in his colleagues' ears, and they all left. ABC and CBS were left with a bunch of empty chairs. The next morning, the I.O.C. unsealed the bids in front of both networks, an unusual step, and ABC's $91.5 million won.
ABC won a sour victory in acquiring the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. Jim Spence, then a senior vice president of ABC Sports, recalled that he was told by Barry Frank, part of the International Olympic Committee's negotiating team then -- and now -- that $275 million would be the winning bid. Sealed bids started with CBS's $182 million, and by the third round, ABC's bid had climbed to $280 million, with NBC $12.5 million behind. CBS was out.
"It went on to round four, and we bid $300 million, $19.5 million ahead of NBC," Spence said. "I later learned that the I.O.C. wanted to stop and finalize with us, but Barry said, 'Let's keep going.' " On Round 5, both networks bid $300 million.
ABC's team, camped in Arledge's suite in Lausanne, thought they had won the bid. But the I.O.C. told them the winning bid would now be decided by an auction. Said Spence: "They told us to come back with another bid later, but Roone refused to go, he was so livid" about the bidding exceeding $275 million. NBC opened with $304 million. ABC's $309 million won.
The networks returned to Lausanne in September 1985, to negotiate for the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. ABC was still stung by the Calgary negotiations. The South Korean organizers wanted $700 million, but would settle for $500 million. ABC would commit to only $225 million.
NBC offered $325 million, but the South Koreans demanded $350 million. NBC refused. Talks broke off. Meanwhile, the South Korean Government authorized its negotiators to take $325 million -- but the Korean organizers in Lausanne wouldn't back down. The talks adjourned for New York, where NBC cut its bid to $300 million. In the end, the Koreans' embarrassment at falling so short of their inflated goal was leavened by NBC's promise to share revenues once ad sales topped $500 million. But no revenues were ever shared.
In advance of the bidding for the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona, NBC's Watson tried some gamesmanship. He roundly criticized Neal Pilson, the president of CBS Sports, for outbidding NBC by $68 million to win the rights to the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville, France. Watson called Pilson reckless, then vastly outbid CBS with its $401 million bid for Barcelona. "Not a bad strategy, eh, coach?" Watson said at the time. By 1992, Watson had died, and because of NBC's own overbidding, it lost $100 million on Barcelona.
The memory of such losses -- and losses on football, baseball and other properties -- may make the Atlanta talks very slow, with bids bunched tightly. It is expected to be a three-way struggle involving the networks' stinginess, the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games' desire for bigger bucks than the networks wish to pay and the I.O.C. chief negotiator Dick Pound's attempts to squeeze top dollar without risking his long-term ties with the networks.

HEADLINE: It's Our Own Genes We Should Worry About

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It seems (despite your own caution against it) you fell for the hype of "Jurassic Park," dwelling on the silliest issues in two editorials. There is no danger that dinosaurs will be brought back, now or ever. It can't be done for the very reasons your first piece carefully spelled out ("Should We Revive the Dinosaurs?," editorial, June 13). But then you turned against your own argument, entertaining the fantasy long enough to conclude that scientists should leave well enough alone.
Worse, when Karl E. Meyer revisited scientific issues in the movie ("The Instant T. Rex," Editorial Notebook, July 18), he examined a "plot hole," whether these creatures could have grown so fast. This is equivalent to publishing a discussion about a cartoon, "The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show," explaining that flying squirrels merely glide, but then quibbling that Rocky actually seems to fly. Remember, this is Steven Spielberg, this is science fiction. 
 The real concerns about manipulating DNA mentioned in your first editorial are not to be found with dinosaur DNA, but with human DNA. Information about human genetics is potentially dangerous. As we acquire more information about the contribution of genetics to behavior, traits and diseases, we simultaneously gain the power to manipulate them.
Perhaps we should leave well enough alone, but instead, everything with a "genetic component" seems fair game for investigation, including things like homosexuality, race and intelligence, alcoholism. A July 18 news article on sexual orientation alludes to the kind of mess we will increasingly find ourselves in. Empowered with genetic information, parents could find justification to abort fetuses carrying a "genetic marker" for homosexuality. Why stop there? As a countermeasure, would-be homosexual parents could abort "normal" fetuses.
Along with social ramifications of genetic information, there are logical economic consequences. For example, it may be cheaper to move or lay off workers with an identifiable "risk factor" than to clean up the workplace. With our current health insurance system, it is in the interests of companies to screen for "healthy" people and discard the rest.
This is not science fiction. In the 1970's, when genetic tests for sickle cell anemia became available, some insurance companies began requiring African-American customers to be tested, and denied coverage to those testing positive or who refused the test. In the absence of an ethical consensus, scientists zeroing in on discrete pieces of DNA just make it easier for others to abuse the data.
However, some actions taken for the most benevolent and humane reasons may also come back to bite us. For example, just months ago, gene replacement therapy was used to treat a child born with severe immunodeficiency ("bubble-boy disease"). When such a person grows up, his children may require gene replacement therapy too -- and their children, and their children. Add to this all other people treated for genetic diseases and their progeny.
By our own hand, we are totally uncoupling ourselves from natural selection, which formerly kept these diseases in low frequency. What are the personal, medical and social costs of maintaining expanding generations of humans like this in a future with finite resources and runaway global population growth?
In our desire to study and manipulate the human genome, we are paving the way for a resurgence of eugenics, which will be more insidious this time because the evidence is better grounded and more sophisticated. We should examine this science fact, not science fiction.

HEADLINE: U.S. Overturns Tariffs on Many Steel Imports

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 27

 BODY:
Opening huge holes in the protectionist wall that has surrounded the American steel industry for most of three decades, a Federal agency eliminated dozens of steel-import tariffs today, ruling that they were unnecessary.
The six-member International Trade Commission, a bureaucratic oddity that is independent of both the Administration and Congress, wiped out most tariffs on steel used in construction and machinery. But it also made permanent some stiff temporary tariffs on corrosion-resistant steel used for household appliances and for car and truck body panels. 
 The decision is likely to force the domestic industry to further specialize in high-value, corrosion-resistant steel, which is already among its few money makers, industry experts said. At the same time, it could force big American makers to accelerate their long retreat from the markets for lower-price construction and machinery steel.
The unfavorable decision sent the stocks of major producers reeling. Worsening this financial-market pressure, there were signs that the country's largest steelmaker, USX, had had a turbulent quarter.
 
Forced Specialization
 Foreign producers, as well as small American manufacturers that recycle steel from scrap, have already been prospering in the market for lower-price steel. They have done so at the expense of leading domestic companies like LTV, USX and Bethlehem Steel, which make a variety of products from raw iron and coal.
The effect of today's decision on consumers will depend on whether foreign companies begin selling more low-priced products here. Such a move would mean lower costs for the steel used in construction and auto parts, lowering some costs in those industries.
But David H. Hoag, the chairman of the LTV Corporation, warned that American producers would file new unfair-trade cases seeking tariffs on any country that steps up shipments now. "I for one would be very surprised if we see a surge" of imports, he said.
The rulings today were a potential boon for negotiators seeking a global free-trade agreement. Prime Minister Edouard Balladur of France had threatened to scuttle the negotiations if the United States did not cancel the tariffs. Today, the duties were canceled on four of five types of steel that France exports to this country.
Asked tonight to comment on the rulings, the French Embassy here declined, but Agence France-Presse reported that an unidentified aide to Mr. Balladur had welcomed the outcome as averting a commercial war.
Sir Leon Brittan, the European Community's trade chief, also praised the rulings. "It is already clear," he said, "that the I.T.C. determinations will help to defuse substantially what had become a very grave trade dispute."
But Japanese steel officials were angry because corrosion-resistant steel accounts for three-quarters of their shipments to the United States.
The six commission members provided several reasons for their votes today on 72 possible tariffs on steel from 20 countries. A common theme was that importers did not serve a large enough part of the American steel market to be responsible for the financial woes of the big American companies, which suffered a combined pretax loss of $1.3 billion last year.
 
A Washington Scorecard
 The American manufacturers lost a total of 40 decisions today, affecting 49 percent of the $4 billion a year in steel imports, and won 32 decisions.
Officials of the American companies said they would appeal the adverse decisions to the Court of International Trade in New York. The appeals process in such disputes typically takes at least a year.
Curtis H. Barnette, the chairman and chief executive of Bethlehem Steel, said the industry would also consider seeking legislation from Congress.
Last year, the domestic manufacturers were encouraged by Bush Administration officials to seek relief from imports through special tariffs to be determined by the Commerce Department. Foreign makers responded with outrage, saying the tariffs would effectively transfer profits gained as a result of previous import quotas to the United States Government.
The Commerce Department elected to assess tariffs averaging 36 percent, and in January it began requiring importers to post bonds for shipments. But before the tariffs could become permanent, American law required that the International Trade Commission rule that the imports were causing "material injury" to the domestic industry.
Today, the commission announced that such injury could not be proved in a little more than half the cases.
The domestic producers had argued that the loss of a single case today could jeopardize their future. They contended that a few currently underutilized mills in one country might expand production, and in doing so, flood the United States with steel unless tariffs were assessed.
Commissioner Carol Crawford discounted that argument, saying that customers now have such precise demands for the hardness, thickness and finish of steel that mills cannot easily replace each other.
 
Taking a Different Approach
 Most of the commissioners are lawyers and economists being rewarded for service as Congressional aides or Administration officials. During much of the 1980's, the commission tended to side with domestic industries, but two Bush Administration appointees, Peter Watson and Janet Nuzum, brought a new emphasis on detailed legal analysis to the commission's determinations.
Mr. Watson, the vice chairman, voted with the majority in all but two cases today and led the rough consensus in favor of protecting corrosion-resistant steel and not the other categories. Don E. Newquist, a Texas farmer and associate of Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, the commission chairman, voted for the domestic steel industry in most cases.
The United States has protected its industry in various ways since the late 60's. Steel executives say this is necessary to compensate for heavy subsidies by foreign governments to their manufacturers. They also accuse foreign companies of forming cartels to keep prices high in their markets while dumping excess production in the United States and thereby avoid laying off workers.
Foreign makers deny that they rig their home markets and counter that American steel companies benefit from pension insurance and other Government policies.

HEADLINE: U.S. Says Ukraine Has Begun Dismantling Nuclear Missiles

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 27

 BODY:
Ukraine has begun dismantling some of its SS-19 long-range nuclear missiles in an effort to address American concerns that it is determined to preserve its nuclear arsenal, Pentagon officials said today.
But while American officials described the move as an important first step, Ukraine has declined to discuss a schedule for dismantling its more modern SS-24 missiles. Nor has Ukraine promised to put the warheads from the SS-19 missiles immediately under international control or ship them back to Russia for dismantling. 
 The Ukrainian move comes against a backdrop of growing concern in Russia and in the West over Ukraine's nuclear weapons.
While the Ukrainian President, Leonid Kravchuk, and Defense Minister, Gen. Konstantin Morozov, have said they are committed to eliminating the arsenal, the Ukrainian Parliament has yet to approve such a move and some Ukrainian nationalists have urged keeping a small nuclear arsenal.
 
U.S. Cooperation Is Lure
 The Clinton Administration has sought to strengthen the hand of the Ukrainian President and Defense Minister by using the lure of economic and military cooperation.
The new Ukrainian move was disclosed by Pentagon officials today after a meeting between General Morozov and Defense Secretary Les Aspin.
Clinton Administration officials said that General Morozov had promised that Ukraine would dismantle all 130 SS-19 missiles. Each missile carries 10 warheads.
In response to the Ukrainian move, the Pentagon said it was planning to provide the Ukraine with $175 million in assistance to dismantle its nuclear weapons.
 
Joint Military Group
 Earlier today, General Morozov and Mr. Aspin signed a military cooperation agreement, providing for an annual exchange of visits. In addition, a joint working group of military officials is being established to expand contacts, and the Pentagon has offered to help the Ukraine transform military industries to civilian use.
Ukraine inherited a potent nuclear arsenal when the Soviet Union broke up. In addition to its SS-19 missiles, it has 46 SS-24 long-range missiles that each carry 10 warheads. It also has long-range cruise missiles with nuclear warheads.
The Pentagon sought to persuade General Morozov to establish a timetable for eliminating its SS-24 missiles. But he declined to agree to a firm schedule. Ukrainian officials have told the Pentagon that they are prepared to dismantle the cruise missiles, which are in storage.
Some officials said a major decision on the Ukrainian arsenal is unlikely before September, when a popular referendum is to be held on the Government.

HEADLINE: Mideast and Bosnia Call Christopher Back to U.S.

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 27

 BODY:
As the situation in Bosnia continues to deteriorate, the Clinton Administration is considering an urgent French request to use air power to punish Serbian attacks against French peacekeeping troops, a senior Administration official said today.
President Clinton summoned Secretary of State Warren Christopher home from a trip to Asia for wide-ranging discussions with other officials at the White House Wednesday on what to do next in Bosnia, including the possible use of American warplanes to enforce United Nations resolutions providing humanitarian measures to ease the suffering in Sarajevo, the official said. 
 Other matters scheduled for discussion at the White House meeting, the official said, include possible economic sanctions against Croatia, which has launched fierce attacks against Bosnian Muslims in recent months.
The French Foreign Ministry in Paris asked the United Nations and NATO today to accelerate plans to protect French peacekeepers operating under the United Nations flag as they came under fire again.
 
Effort to Calm CrisisXx
 When asked by reporters at the White House today why Mr. Christopher was unexpectedly cutting short his trip to Asia, Mr. Clinton indicated that it was part of an effort to calm the mounting crisis in the Middle East, saying, "I thought that in view of the events there, that he ought to come home and we ought to have a conversation about it before he goes to the Middle East."
But other senior Administration officials said a more important reason for Mr. Christopher's return was Bosnia, not the Middle East. The official added that the Bosnian situation was so critical that it could not wait for Mr. Christopher to travel on from Asia to Australia and then to the Middle East. Mr. Christopher's Asian trip will resume after the current talks, officials said.
The abrupt return of Mr. Christopher reflects the quandary facing the Administration as it tries to deal with two increasingly volatile conflicts at the same time.
Bosnia -- and ways to end the fighting there -- will be on the top of the agenda during a regularly scheduled lunch on Wednesday with Mr. Christopher; the national security adviser, Anthony Lake, and Defense Secretary Les Aspin, senior officials said. It is expected to be the main focus of a meeting between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Christopher at a separate meeting at the White House on Wednesday.
 
U.S. Role in Retaliation
 Among the issues that will be discussed are the American role in any retaliation against the Serbs for attacking United Nations troops, the relief crisis in Sarajevo and the possibility of imposing economic sanctions on Croatia, the officials said.
The crisis in Bosnia was discussed at the White House on Monday at a meeting of the so-called deputies' committee, which makes recommendations to members of the National Security Council, other senior officials said, adding that the meeting was not intended to produce recommendations.
At a White House meeting two weeks ago, Mr. Clinton's top national security advisers failed to agree on a plan to rescue Sarajevo. Since then, Serbian forces have advanced closer to the center of the besieged Bosnian capital, while the Clinton Administration has faced intense criticism for its inaction.
As for the Middle East, Mr. Clinton pledged that he would not allow the violence in southern Lebanon, which has left scores of civilians dead and driven tens of thousands from their homes, to derail the American-led initiative to make peace. Indeed, Mr. Christopher, who left Singapore for Washington today, plans to proceed with his trip in an effort to rescue the moribund Arab-Israeli talks. He is scheduled to arrive in Cairo on Sunday.
 
Praise for Syrian Restraint
 In Mr. Clinton's brief remarks on the Middle East, he went out of his way to praise Syria for not intensifying the crisis further. But he made no reference to the fact that Syria provides substantial support for the Party of God, the militant Islamic group that has launched repeated attacks against Israel from bases in southern Lebanon, and has at least some influence on its behavior.
"I think the Syrians have shown commendable restraint so far," Mr. Clinton said, in what senior officials said was a reference to Syria's not striking back against Israel for the death of six Syrian soldiers as a result of Israeli attacks.
But curiously, in the same sentence he blamed the Party of God, also known as Hezbollah, for trying to sabotage the Middle East talks, as if the group had no connection with Syria.
Mr. Clinton's support for Syria illustrates the Administration's dual approach to President Hafez al-Assad: while it castigates him as a sponsor of terrorism, it embraces him as a responsible partner for making peace.
 
Responsibility for Attacks
 The Party of God launched the attacks against Israel that left seven Israeli soldiers dead earlier this month. The State Department's 1992 report on terrorism states that Syria provides sanctuary for several terrorist groups, including the Party of God and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, in areas of the Bekaa, Lebanon's eastern valley, under Syrian control.
Both groups have taken responsbility for the attacks that killed the Israeli soldiers.

Bosnian Talks Resume
 GENEVA, July 27 (Special to The New York Times) -- As the three sides in the Bosnian civil war began another round of peace talks today, the Muslim-dominated Government appeared to resist mediators' pressure to accept a partition of Bosnia, insisting on a relatively centralized state of three "federal units" with boundaries not drawn strictly on ethnic lines.
The Bosnian position, hammered out by its collective presidency, offers some concessions to a Serbian-Croatian plan for the ethnic division of the country. But officials close to the mediators, Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, said the Bosnian stand was unacceptable to the Serbs and Croats who now control most of the land.

Pearson to Shed Fine China and Oil Units

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LONDON, July 27

 BODY:
Pearson P.L.C. said today that it would spin off its fine china company, Royal Doulton, and its oilfield services company so that it could concentrate on its publishing and television operations.
Pearson publishes The Financial Times, owns Thames Television P.L.C. and has a stake in British Sky Broadcasting Ltd., a satellite broadcasting operation also owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. 
 "We believe that concentrating most of our resources now on appropriate sectors in the media industry will benefit shareholders," Pearson's chairman, Lord Blakenham, said in a statement.
Royal Doulton will be split off from Pearson by the end of 1993 and listed on the London Stock Exchange as an independent company, the statement said. Newly created Royal Doulton shares will be given to Pearson shareholders.
Pearson said it would sell its majority stake in the oilfield services company Camco in a public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. The offering is planned for the first half of 1994. Pearson added it would keep a minority stake in Camco for a limited time.
Royal Doulton and Camco accounted for 38 percent of Pearson's $2.4 billion in sales in 1992 and about 7 percent of the $234 million in operating earnings.
Royal Doulton is one of the world's biggest manufacturers of fine bone china. It sells china under its own name and under the brand names Royal Crown Derby, Minton and Royal Albert. More than half of Royal Doulton's sales are outside Britain, mainly in the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan and Continental Europe.
Although china sales have increased in the first half of 1993 amid signs that the worst of the recession is over, profits in the Royal Doulton division have been hurt, Pearson said. Sales were $301.5 million in 1992, little changed from the previous year.
Camco provides specialty drilling products and services like bits and submersible pump systems to the oil and gas industries. Its sales fell 9 percent, to $435 million, in 1992.
Pearson said it planned to expand its existing media interests, including satellite technology.
Pearson has been investing in satellite television in Britain for the last five years. It recently acquired program rights and production capability through the $148.5 million purchase of Thames Television P.L.C., which lost its London broadcast franchise in a Government reorganization of TV licenses.
Pearson also said it would keep its interest in the British arm of the Lazard Freres investment banking house.

HEADLINE: HUD'S CHIEF SEEKS WIDE NEW POWERS

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 27

 BODY:
Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros asked Congress today for broad new powers to deal with what he said was his department's most serious problem: the rapidly growing inventory of Government-owned apartment buildings.
The projects, many of which are in poor condition, have come into the hands of the Department of Housing and Urban Development because of a spate of defaults by private developers on Government-insured mortgages. Government auditors have estimated that as much as $11.9 billion worth of mortgages may not be repaid over the next few years, probably expanding the number of buildings in Government ownership. 
 To ease the sales of the projects the department now owns and manages, Mr. Cisneros is seeking to loosen the restrictions on selling property to private developers or nonprofit groups. He asked Congress today to repeal a 1987 statute that requires the housing department to attach expensive rental subsidies to most of the projects being sold.
 
Seeks Wider Discretion
 That law was intended to preserve the supply of low-income housing in the United States, and Mr. Cisneros wants Congress to give him discretion to use less expensive means to protect existing tenants.
Aides to Mr. Cisneros insisted that none of the tenants now in buildings owned by the housing department would face rent increases when their buildings are sold off. But tenants advocates said that issue is a crucial one, and needs clarification.
The housing department now owns 170 buildings, totaling 29,000 apartments, and that number is expected to more than double by the end of the year. If the department were to follow the law, the General Accounting Office estimates it would need as much as $3 billion in rental subsidies to sell off the buildings already owned by the Government.
"This is the tip of a big iceberg directly in our path which will hurt the department and Administration badly if were not able to get a handle on it," Mr. Cisneros said.
 
Reinventing an Agency?
 The legislative proposals unveiled today, part of Mr. Cisneros's plan to "reinvent" HUD, also includes changes in the law on public housing so tenants who find a job would not be penalized with higher rents. In addition, the housing department wants to expand a $2 billion program to spur economic development. Officials said it would provide low-interest loans to communities hoping to attract businesses that would create new jobs.
In describing his proposals to reporters, however, Mr. Cisneros made it clear that the most pressing problems were posed by the rising inventory of apartment buildings. In 1991, his aides said, the housing agency took over 72 buildings, and sold 11. Last year, it foreclosed on an additional 67 buildings, and sold only 27. The main impediment to selling off the property, HUD officials said, was the lack of subsidy money to meet the requirements of the law.
Mr. Cisneros and other officials acknowledge that HUD has a poor track record of managing apartment buildings it does own. Many of them turn into slums as they wait years for buyers.
Senior aides to Mr. Cisneros said that even if the department wins Congressional approval of he proposed changes, sales of apartment buildings would still require substantial new appropriations. Bruce Katz, Mr. Cisneros's chief of staff, said in an interview that $500 million to $750 million annually will be needed in rental subsidies over the next five years. Last year, Congress appropriated only $93 million for this purpose.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Slips

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 27

 BODY:
Consumers' confidence in the economy slipped in July for the third consecutive month, amid poor employment prospects and slow growth in wages.
The Conference Board's consumer confidence index declined to 57.7, from a revised reading of 58.6 in June, the private research organization said today. 
 "With unemployment stuck around 7 percent, jobs remain the public's greatest concern," said Fabian Linden, the director of the New York-based group's consumer research center.
While consumers feel slightly better about current economic conditions, they have grown more pessimistic about the future, the survey of 5,000 households found.
The index of expectations declined, to 65.4, from 69.6 in June. Almost 27 percent of those surveyed expressed concern there would be fewer jobs in the months ahead. That number was up from less than 23 percent last month.
Another report today highlighted consumers' concerns. The Labor Department said wages, salaries and benefits increased a modest nine-tenths of a percent in the second quarter. The gain in the employment cost index, the Government's most comprehensive measure of labor costs, followed a 1 percent advance in the first quarter.
For the 12 months ending in June, the employment cost index rose 3.6 percent, the same increase as a year earlier, the Labor Department said.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
When Free Marketers Turn Their Faith Over To Central Planners.

BYLINE: By Kurt Eichenwald

 BODY:
FEW would ever argue that Wall Street makes a lot of sense. At a time when some strategists grumble that new taxes and regulations from Washington pose greater risk for American companies' share value, their investment banking colleagues think they have found a place where corporate prospects are just dandy: China.
That excitement for Chinese companies was evident earlier this month, when shares of China Tire Holdings began trading for the first time on the New York Stock Exchange. Demand for the enterprise, a Bermuda holding company that controls two tire manufacturing subsidiaries in China, was intense: The 6.1 million shares in the initial public offering July 15 were priced at $17 each, above the expected range of $13 to $15. 
 The success was predictable. Just a few weeks earlier, the I.P.O. of Ek Chor China Motorcycle had also been oversubscribed, and was priced several dollars above the expected range of $16 to $18 a share. Investors buzzed that China Tire would be another Ek Chor.
Investors were right -- but not in the way they thought. Shares of both companies began a long march downward shortly after their debuts. But China Tire had the distinction of having the worse performance in share price. Shares have slid since the first day after hitting a high of $18.75. The shares closed yesterday at $12.875, down almost 30 percent from their high.
What happened? Some bulls argue that the share price is just under pressure from the flippers, who profit by purchasing pieces of new offerings and flip them back into the public markets once the price goes up. (Of course, the price stopped going up the first day of trading, but never mind that.)
Instead, the trading history of China Tire points up the dangers of what can happen when free marketers turn their faith over to central planners. On July 18, The China Daily, an official Chinese newspaper, reported that the Government had imposed tighter controls on institutional purchases of autos as part of Beijing's new austerity plan.
The result, the newspaper said, was that vehicle prices were declining while inventories were rising rapidly at auto makers, where inventories were up as much as 40 percent at the end of May from a year earlier. A glut of cars usually translates into lower production. And lower production means less demand for tires. In any language, that means that now may not be the best time to hold a tire maker's stock.
Worse, it means that the big customers for China Tire are likely to start experiencing a financial squeeze, and they have been far from eager in the past about paying their bills. In its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, China Tire noted that a collection problem resulted in a significant charge to 1991 earnings.
"Steps by the Chinese Government to control inflation," the company writes in a phrase that describes exactly what China Daily reported, "may increase the liquidity problems of the operating subsidiaries' customers."
And China Tire is not the only company in this giant market. As the Chinese industrial market opens up, more foreign competitors are likely to join the more than 100 tire manufacturers already in the industry.
In fact, so many companies are competing to jump into the tire market that even Communist officials have recognized what seems to have escaped some investors: When lots of companies are producing tires, soon there are too many of them.
"Chinese Government officials have indicated that, as tire producers expand, tire production capacity in China may exceed domestic supply," China Motorcycle says in its S.E.C. filing.
Could it be that the Communist Government understands the rules of production and supply better than Wall Street?

HEADLINE: Clinton Seeks More Powers To Stem Illegal Immigration

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 27

 BODY:
President Clinton asked Congress today for more money and new laws to tighten the borders against illegal immigrants, speed interviews of people seeking political asylum and let the Government have the same tools it uses against organized crime to fight foreign gangs promoting illegal immigration.
The President said his decision to push for this legislation was prompted in part by the World Trade Center bombing, which showed how porous the American immigration system is. But he said it was also an attempt to meet what is likely to be one of the biggest domestic challenges the country will face in the 1990's: how to stem the increasing flow of illegal immigrants while maintaining the fundamental American commitment to legal immigration and legitimate political refugees. 
 "This has nothing to do with our support for keeping the rainbow and the melting pot of America going and growing and enriching and strengthening this country," Mr. Clinton said after unveiling his proposal at the White House to an audience of legislators, with heavy representation from immigrant-heavy states like New York and California.
"But the kinds of practices that are manifest in who can get into this country on an airplane, what kinds of illegal smuggling can go on, and the fact that our borders leak like a sieve: those things cannot be permitted to continue in good conscience.
"It's not good for the American immigrants who are here legally in this country, for the American economy, for the cohesion of our society, or for the rule of law worldwide," he added. "And we're going to try to do better."
 
Pattern of Abuse
 The most controversial aspect of the Clinton plan involves new procedures for on-the-spot administrative hearings to determine whether immigrants seeking political asylum at a point of entry have legitimate claims. This is intended to counter what Administration officials argue is a growing pattern of abuse of American asylum laws by illegal immigrants who do not have credible claims for political asylum but enter the country by air or sea, receive working papers and stay for years while their claims are processed and appealed.
Under the proposed plan, if a traveler claims political asylum, his or her case would be promptly heard at or near the port by a member of the Immigration and Naturalization Service asylum corps, a specially trained group of officers with expertise in interviewing technique and asylum law.
The asylum officer will determine whether an individual has a credible fear of persecution, whether he or she would be likely to qualify for refugee status or whether the person would be in danger if returned to the country of origin.
Under this plan for instant immigration justice, those determined to be bona fide refugees will given protection. Those whose claims are found to be fraudulent will be given the opportunity for a quick, limited appeal to Justice Department officials, and if the immigration service decision is not reversed they will be immediately deported.
Some immigration experts worry, though, that the provisions for quick justice in dealing with applicants for political asylum will be little bit too quick. The legislation limits court review to a technical habeas corpus proceeding, that is, a proceeding that essentially looks only at whether the right person is being deported, not whether the case has merit or whether the immigration officials are following regulations.
 
Some Reservations
 "Our concern is that this limitation would allow the immigration service to operate behind a veil of secrecy by denying constitutional due process and meaningful judicial review to legitimate asylum seekers," said Lucas Guttentag, Director of the American Civil Liberties Union Immigrants Rights Project.
The proposed legislation was pulled together by Vice President Al Gore and was expected to be introduced as a bill sponsored by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming. But Senator Simpson has decided not to be a co-sponsor for now because he was not satisfied with the review arrangements for those denied political asylum. The differences will have to be negotiated in committee.
The Clinton proposal also seeks to give the immigration authorities the same powers law-enforcement officials have in the anti-racketeering laws that are aimed at organized crime, including wiretaps.
The proposed bill says the Immigration and Naturalization Service "would be authorized to intercept wire, electronic, and oral communications of persons involved in alien smuggling."
The Clinton proposal also seeks an additional $172.5 million for next year's proposed immigration budget to add up to 600 Border Patrol agents, and to give them more high-technology equipment, like sensors and low-light-level televisions. The immigration service budget is already $1.6 billion.
Also in the technology realm, the Clinton bill would promote greater cooperation and communication between the various American Government agencies that deal with immigration, so that people like Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, some of whose supporters have been accused of involvement in the Feb. 26 World Trade Center bombing, will not be able to slip through cracks in the immigration and consular network.
It proposes to do this through a variety of means: upgrading the State Department's ability to issue fraud proof, machine-readable visas; expanding pre-inspection at foreign airports of American-bound passengers; upgrading the consular communications lookout network so that Consular Officers at embassies overseas can immediately share critical information about criminals and suspected terrorists with the immigration service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other agencies; making American passports more secure by digitizing passport photos and installing on-line computer systems to insure that multiple passports are not issued to the same person.

HEADLINE: Wheelchair Warrior Lays Siege to Schools

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

 BODY:
School officials hate to see Gregory Solas coming. But to the handicapped he is a champion -- a wheelchair warrior in the fight to make schools accessible to the disabled.
Mr. Solas is a 40-year-old former construction worker from Warwick, R.I., who has been in a wheelchair since his legs were crushed in an accident on the job seven years ago. Since 1990 he has filed complaints against nearly 2,000 schools, colleges and universities over the absence of ramps for wheelchairs, signs for the visually impaired and other accommodations required by Federal law. 
 Lawyers at the Education Department's regional Office for Civil Rights in Boston say 25 percent of their workload consists of investigating his complaints.
"Some people play golf," Mr. Solas said. "I file complaints."
 
Chorus of Complaint
 Aggressiveness by advocates of for disabled children is nothing new. But in recent years more and more parents and other advocates like Mr. Solas (whose own three children are not handicapped) are filing complaints. The Department of Education has received three times as many complaints in the 1993 fiscal year as it did in 1987.
Of Mr. Solas's nearly 2,000 grievances, many of which have already been resolved, virtually all were filed under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which requires public buildings, public programs and private groups and schools that receive some form of Federal aid to be accessible to the disabled.
The remaining complaints cite the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, which expands protections for the disabled to employment and public services. The Education Department says his complaints are usually upheld and lead to agreements with school systems to upgrade their buildings.
"He is a very accurate advocate," said Norma Cantu, the new Assistant Secretary of Education for Civil Rights. "Is he a thorn in my side? By no means. If anything, he is highlighting the need to inform public schools and colleges and universities about the law."
But at a time when budgets are stretched thin by recession and its aftermath, schools say resolving complaints like Mr. Solas's are forcing them into costly renovations, diverting money from other pressing needs.
 
'Outrageous' Demands
 According to one study, it costs $20,000 to $200,000 to equip a school with ramps, elevators, escalators, barrier-free bathrooms and wider doorways, depending on the age of the school building and the extent of its renovation. Federal disability laws spell out how public buildings should accommodate the disabled, from how far water fountains should be lowered to where signs for the visually impaired should be installed.
"The parents of disabled children are increasing their demands to an outrageous extent," said Gwendolyn Gregory, deputy general counsel for the National School Boards Association. "They are asking for things that parents of nonhandicapped children would have no right to ask for."
School districts say that they are not opposed to serving disabled children, but that parents often demand that a neighborhood school be outfitted to accommodate the handicapped when a school 20 minutes away has the very program a student needs.
Parents say it is a matter of perspective. "Like other minority groups, we get tired of listening to bureaucrats rationalizing what they do to us," said Linda DiCecco, a Warwick mother who is hearing impaired and who has three children with hearing or vision difficulties. "All we want are the same rights that the majority takes for granted." Of Mr. Solas, she said, "At least Greg is getting us into the school buildings."
 
Vow to Help Handicapped
 Mr. Solas, who has long been criticized as a grandstander, shrugs off the criticism. "The law is the law," he said. "If I could, I would make them stand at a chalkboard and write, 'I will not discriminate.' "
Mr. Solas was injured at a construction site seven years ago when a steel beam fell off its wooden piles and pinned him to the ground at the hips. As he lay beneath the beam, he says, his legs crushed, not sure whether he would even live, he vowed, "I'll help the handicapped."
In 1990, he took on the Warwick Public Schools, a system of 28,000 students, 1,800 with physical or learning disabilities. He remembers being unable to negotiate the entrance of an elementary school where the parent-teacher organization meeting was held.
He says he was told to go home; the district would send him a videotape of the meeting. "All of a sudden, I was a guy who was a pain in their behinds," he said.
Mr. Solas said he refused the videotape and instead staged a one-person picket outside the school administration building during a late-winter storm. He ultimately filed a complaint with the Education Department, which forced the school system to renovate its administration building. The parents' group finally moved its meeting to a site more suitable for Mr. Solas's wheelchair.
He took on the district again a year later when his daughter's school held a father-daughter dance in a building that could not accommodate his wheelchair. The school system moved the dance.
And just last month, he filed still another complaint, this time over plans to hold graduations in an auditorium that was not wheelchair-accessible. The district relented and made arrangements to accommodate Mr. Solas.
"The law is the law," he said. "It does not mean you can do it halfheartedly."
 
Expanding His Mission
 Since he first took on the Warwick Public Schools, Mr. Solas, who can walk with a cane but uses a wheelchair most of the time, says he has spent thousands of hours and more than $6,000 of his own money to right the wrongs he sees in schools.
As he has traveled on vacations, he says he has taken pains to look at other schools, maintaining that "if they were violating the law in Warwick then there must be other schools doing the same thing." In other instances, parents of disabled children have called him or he has called schools at random to ask whether they are accessible.
To school administrators, Mr. Solas is equal parts burden and irritant. "He's abrasive and aggressive," said Henry S. Tarlian, who became Superintendent of the Warwick system after Mr. Solas filed the first of his several complaints. "And that causes a society and community to rebel."
Mr. Tarlian said there were ramps at the elementary school where Mr. Solas wanted to attend the parent-teacher meeting, though the Superintendent acknowledged that they were steeper than they should have been.
The Superintendent also says that after one Solas complaint that singled out the aged Warwick School Administration building, the district spent $100,000 last year retrofitting the building, $20,000 of which to comply with Federal disability laws. The system is also renovating six schools to resolve Mr. Solas's complaints.
Although Mr. Tarlian acknowledges that disabled students should be protected to the full extent of the law, he agrees with other education experts that advocates like Mr. Solas have run amok.
He cites one complaint by parents who sought to move their disabled child to a school that did not have a program that could accommodate the youngster. The district wanted to keep the child in the school where he was enrolled, which had a suitable program. The dispute went to a hearing, which the district won. But the school system spent $28,000 defending itself.
"That's like opening a window and throwing out $28,000," said Mr. Tarlian. "There is no question about it. The reason the school has been attacked is because they are the most vulnerable."

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Legislator to Run For Comptroller Next Year

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 27

 BODY:
Assemblyman John J. Faso of Kinderhook today became the first Republican to announce his candidacy for state comptroller, and in the process provided a preview of his party's 1994 strategy for unseating the Democratic incumbent, H. Carl McCall.
Mr. Faso tied Mr. McCall to both Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Mayor David N. Dinkins, calling them "a double-barreled disaster for the New York State economy and the New York City economy." 
 He also questioned the independence of Mr. McCall, who was elected by a Democratic-controlled vote of the Legislature last spring to fill the unexpired term of the former Comptroller, Edward V. Regan. Mr. Cuomo, a longtime ally of Mr. McCall, led many in the Legislature to believe that he strongly supported Mr. McCall.
"Let's face it," Mr. Faso said while announcing his candidacy in an airport terminal here. "The fact that this Comptroller is attached at one hip to Governor Cuomo means that sometimes he's not going to be independent."
 
Monitor and Auditor
 Mr. McCall said he would counter Republican attacks by demonstrating his independence. "I'm busy doing my job as the independent Comptroller of the State of New York, and I'm not going to be distracted by political carping at this time," he said.
The comptroller serves as the official monitor of the state's fiscal practices and has the power to certify to Wall Street whether New York's budget is balanced. The comptroller also audits state agencies and local governments, and administers the state's $55 billion pension fund.
Mr. Faso, a four-term Assemblyman whose district includes parts of Columbia, Greene, and Albany Counties and all of Schoharie County, said he would run as a fiscal conservative. He said he would use the comptroller's office to "raise the alarm when things are out of control." Thousands of businesses and individuals have fled New York, he said, because of an economy that "has been devastated by high taxes, spiraling spending and burgeoning debt."
More than 15 months before Election Day, the 40-year-old Mr. Faso starts the campaign with little name recognition outside his upstate district. He said he had raised $40,000 -- a July 11 financial disclosure form shows $19,160 -- for a race that he predicts will cost at least $2.5 million to win.
 
Reputation for Eloquence
 His only statewide experience came as campaign manager for Pierre A. Rinfret, the Republican gubernatorial nominee who lost a disastrous race in 1990. After several disagreements with Mr. Rinfret, Mr. Faso realized he could neither influence nor control his candidate and left the campaign.
But as a member of the Assembly minority, Mr. Faso has a reputation for being smart, eloquent and aggressive. He helped mount an unsuccessful court challenge against the Assembly Democrats' redistricting plan last year and has criticized Mr. Cuomo for everything from the state's borrowing practices to the Governor's appearance in state tourism advertisements.
Several other Republicans have expressed interest in the comptroller's race, including Suffolk County Comptroller Joseph R. Caputo and State Senator Roy M. Goodman of Manhattan. But party leaders predict that if Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato decides to run for governor, any number of Republicans who currently are considering a gubernatorial campaign might drop down to the comptroller's race.

HEADLINE: U.S. Grants $4.5 Million to Help Military Contractors Shift Focus

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WOODBURY, L.I., July 27

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo came here today to announce that the Federal Government has awarded the state a $4.5 million grant to help Long Island's sagging military industries convert to peacetime pursuits.
"This grant will enable us to do a lot of things, like expanding the state's industrial effectiveness program," Mr. Cuomo said to an audience of about 500 business owners at the Crest Hollow Country Club. "It will fund new training programs for defense workers, expand new market development for defense firms and set aside $2 million as a working capital revolving loan fund to help finance individual diversification programs." 
 The grant is the largest awarded so far under a 2-year-old Federal program intended to help companies reduce their dependence on military contracts, said Wilbur Hawkins, Acting Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Economic Development. Under the program, the state must provide an additional $1.1 million and the private sector must contribute $5.6 million.
 
Dire Need Found
 Uses for the money included helping retrain workers to make products like cellular telephones for the commercial market. The companies make a range of products from landing gear for jets to medical supplies. The money is available immediately for companies that apply.
The size of the grant is based on the area's needs, Mr. Hawkins said. Long Island was deemed to be in dire need because prime military contracts awarded to companies here like Grumman Corporation in Bethpage and the Hazeltine Corporation in Greenlawn were valued at $5.28 billion in 1987, but declined to $2.86 billion in 1992. Between 1985 and 1991, Long Island lost some 15,000 military-related jobs as the Pentagon reduced its weapons procurement programs.
"Our goal is to assist in productivity improvement and make sure we are able to retrain and have a focus on the overall sustainabilty of the economy," Mr. Hawkins said. "This is a major accomplishment."
Several executives at the meeting today said they were pleased with the government's interest in their plight, but said the grant was not enough.
"The Defense Department eliminated a million and a half high-skilled workers," said Martin Bloch, chief executive of Frequency Electronic Inc. of Mitchel Field. The company makes timing devices for aircraft and missiles. "We can put them on the unemployment lines and spend $50 billion keeping them on those lines or try to find them work. That's what they're trying to do and we're pleased."
 
'It's a Demonstration'
 Long Island business owners grew so concerned about the sliding military industry that earlier this year they formed a network of more than 100 Defense Department subcontractors called the Aerospace and Defense Diversification Alliance in Peacetime Transition.
Greg Frisby, chief executive of Frisby Airborne Hydraulics Inc. of Freeport and head of the group of subcontractors, said in June that local companies needed about $200 million in loans to secure about $1 billion in commercial contracts.
"This grant is not enough by itself to help solve our problems, but it's a demonstration by the Federal and state governments that they are interested in helping us," he said.
The state applied for the loan under its diversification program, which was started by Mr. Cuomo in 1991.
"We applaud Commerce Secretary Ron Brown for his support of this economic strategy," Mr. Cuomo said. "Military spending helped to create an advanced high-technology economy for Long Island. In this post-Cold War era, public resources can help defense firms identify the new markets and new technologies they can utilize to compete in the global commercial marketplace."

HEADLINE: Court Sets a 2-Year Limit On Sex-Harassment Suits

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, July 27

 BODY:
Victims of sexual harassment will have to file suits within two years or lose their right to sue, the New Jersey Supreme Court said today.
The court said the question of the statute of limitations for such claims has been "murky." Sometimes lower courts have treated the cases as economic loss suits, with a six-year limit, and sometimes as personal injury claims, with a two-year limit. 
 In its unanimous opinion today, the court said the two-year limit should apply to claims brought under the state's Law Against Discrimination, which covers sexual harassment cases. The result will be more efficient and uniform prosecutions of such cases, the court said.
Earlier this month the court established standards for claiming job-related sexual harassment -- that it must be so "severe" and "pervasive" that a reasonable woman or man would believe that the work environment had become "hostile" or "abusive."
Justice Stewart G. Pollock, writing for the court in today's ruling, said a quick resolution of harassment claims is fairest to the accused, the accuser and the judicial system, since the outcome often depends on a decision about who is telling the truth.
"Evidence of discrimination, especially proof of sexual discrimination, is vulnerable to the passage of time," Justice Pollock said. "With racial slurs, insults about sexual orientation, or sexually suggestive remarks, the proof generally depends on testimonial evidence.
 
Reasoning for Difference
 "Depending on the memory and availability of witnesses, that testimony can dissipate or even disappear over time."
The New Jersey court said that other jurisdictions, when looking for an appropriate statute of limitations, generally have selected periods of three years or less. "Although they may reach that decision by different analytical paths, those courts concur that civil rights complaints should be timely filed," the court said.
The New Jersey law, first enacted in 1945, provided for the filing of complaints with the Division Against Discrimination, which became the Division on Civil Rights in 1960. The law has been amended several times since then to broaden its scope, , but it has never included its own statute of limitations. The court said the Legislature could still enact its own time limit on suits if it disagreed with today's decision.
In 1977 the law was amended to underscore the state's concern with discrimination based on "race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry, age, sex, marital status, liability for service in the armed forces of the United States or nationality." In 1991 the law was amended to protect against discrimination based on "affectional or sexual orientation," and in 1992 another amendment was enacted to prevent discrimination because of "familial status."
The decision today was prompted by a sexual harassment claim filed in 1989 by Jessica Montells, an employee of the American International Adjustment Company. Ms. Montells asserted that her supervisor had made lewd comments and had touched her in sexually suggestive ways in 1987.
When the company took no action in response to her complaints she resigned and was paid through May 13, 1987, according to the facts in the State Supreme Court ruling. She filed her suit on May 23, 1989, and the trial judge ruled that she missed the deadline for filing the suit by a few days. Ms. Montells appealed, pointing to the use of the six-year limit in some earlier discrimination suits.
 
Other Cases
 Although the state's highest court today disagreed with her argument, it did something that the lower courts had refused to do -- it said its ruling applied only to cases that arise after today. It sent Ms. Montells's case back to the lower court for a trial.
Chief Justice Robert N. Wilentz and Justices Marie L. Garibaldi, Robert L. Clifford, Alan B. Handler, Daniel J. O'Hern and Gary S. Stein joined in Justice Pollock's opinion.
The court split, 4 to 3 and 5 to 2, on two other rulings dealing with state police searches that found cocaine in the trunks of motorists' cars. The owners of the cars had consented to the searches but the luggage containing the illicit drugs belonged to passengers, leading the court to issue decisions meant to instruct the police on how to conduct such searches.
In one case the passenger told the trooper that he was the owner of a blue canvas bag that turned out to hold drugs. The trooper continued the search without asking the passenger's permission. The passenger later made a motion to suppress the evidence but also pleaded guilty to drug charges and was sentenced to 12 years in prison.
Today the court threw out the conviction, ruling 4 to 3, that a warrantless search of a container in a car based on the consent of the driver is invalid if a passenger asserts ownership of the container.
In the second case the court upheld a search under similar circumstances because the passenger did not claim ownership of the bag with the drugs. The trooper continued to search based on the "objectively reasonable" assumption that the driver's consent covered all the items in the trunk, the court said in a 5 to 2 opinion.
But while it found the search valid, the court threw out the conviction of the passenger on other grounds. Both cases were sent back to lower courts for new trials.

Treasury Prices End Day Mixed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities ended mixed yesterday after the market swallowed $16 billion in new two-year notes, an auction that analysts said drew lukewarm investor response.
However, the auction results were viewed as reasonably favorable considering the bearish tone that has spread through the market as a result of comments by Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, last week that inflation was still a concern. 
 The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond was down 2/32 point and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, remained unchanged at 6.67 percent.
Breaking a monthlong drought of new intermediate- and long-term issues, the Government's sale of two-year notes was the first in a wave of supply scheduled to reach the market over the next few weeks.
The Treasury sold the notes at a high yield of 4.26 percent, the highest rate since two-year notes sold for 4.28 percent on Jan. 26. Many market participants had expected the notes to yield 4.25 percent, and the higher rate reflected the ability of investors to be somewhat choosier about the returns they will accept.
 
Bid to Cover Ratio
 The bid to cover ratio, a measure of demand that compares the number of bids offered with those accepted, was 2.24 to 1. That was lower than the 2.73-to-1 average over the last 10 auctions of two-year notes.
"It was a little bit soft, but it was a big issue," said David Ader, a market strategist for Technical Data in Boston. "The market cleared the first hurdle of the heavy supply and handled it well."
The market may have a harder time absorbing today's scheduled sale of $11 billion in five-year notes, some economists said. Two-year notes have built-in demand, because banks routinely buy them as a way to store their money at fixed rates of return. Longer-term securities, on the other hand, depend more on demand from portfolio managers and other so-called retail investors.
Next week, the Treasury is scheduled to detail its plans for selling 3-year, 10-year and 30-year securities in the second week of August.
Nancy Kimelman, Technical Data's chief economist, said the Treasury is expected to sell $38.5 billion during the refunding -- $16.5 billion in 3-year notes and $11 billion each of 10-year and 30-year securities.
The market's uncertainty about absorbing new supply was compounded last week when Mr. Greenspan testified in Congress that the Fed was ready to raise short-term rates to combat any new signs of inflation.
That depressed prices in the bond market, since higher rates on newly sold securities would erode the value of already sold bonds.
Also hurting the bond market are worries that President Clinton's budget package will not result in substantial deficit reduction, Mr. Ader said.
The market had little response toward fresh economic data that showed sluggishness in the economy. The results were largely expected.
The Labor Department said wages and salaries increased 2.8 percent for the year ending June 30, failing to keep pace with the 3.0 percent inflation rate for the period as measured by the Consumer Price Index.
Also, the Conference Board reported that consumer confidence in the economy fell in July for the third straight month.
Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 3.16 percent as the discount edged up 0.01 percentage point, to 3.10 percent. Six-month yields rose to 3.34 percent as the discount increased 0.02 point, to 3.25 percent. One-year yields rose to 3.59 percent as the discount rose 0.01 point, to 3.46 percent.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 1016/32 , down 1/16 from late Monday. The average yield to maturity was 5.82 percent, up from 5.81 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of two-year Treasury notes:

HEADLINE: Selling the Shreds of the Cold War

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

 BODY:
In a deal that only the end of the cold war could produce, America's largest munitions maker will soon begin cutting up more than 200,000 tons of surplus Ukrainian ammunition, much of it made for firing at United States troops, and selling it for scrap.
The joint venture between Alliant Techsystems Inc. of Edina, Minn., and the Ukrainian Defense Ministry is believed to be the first between an American company and a former Soviet republic for dismantling such materiel as tank ammunition, artillery shells and mortar rounds. 
 The agreement does not deal with the nuclear weapons that Ukraine inherited from the former Soviet Union. United States officials have urged Kiev to dismantle those weapons.
Alliant and Ukrainian officials estimate that sales of scrap copper, steel, brass and aluminum from the discarded weapons casings and components could generate more than $100 million in revenue in the next five years. The company and the Ukrainian Government would divide the proceeds.
 
A Demilitarization Market
 For Alliant, a leading torpedo and tank-shell maker for the Pentagon, the deal signals an entry into a small but growing international market of demilitarization. Many military contractors in the United States, Germany, Japan and Israel are exploring this market to help offset declining orders for weapons.
For Ukraine, the agreement brings in American capital and technical expertise to reduce huge stockpiles of munitions that date, in some cases, to 1905. In some instances, these arsenals pose safety or environmental hazards.
Toby G. Warson, Alliant's chief executive, and Gen. Konstantin P. Morozov, Ukraine's Defense Minister, are to announce the agreement in Washington today.
For decades, armies around the world have disposed of surplus or obsolete munitions by burning them, burying them, dumping them at sea or blowing them up. But as environmental concerns grow in the United States and elsewhere, these methods are becoming increasingly restricted.
Under the deal, Alliant will set up automated dismantling assembly lines at two ammunition depots in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Government has already started dismantling some munitions at one of the sites, in Icnja, a village 90 miles northeast of Kiev.
At each site, munitions will be taken apart mechanically or by using a high-pressure water jet. Alliant officials said the fine stream of water, under pressure of 50,000 pounds per square inch, could cut through shells without detonating the explosive.
Once the munitions are cut up, rendering them useless, propellants and explosives will be removed and converted into commercial explosives used in mining, construction, synthetic fuels and fertilizers. The scrap metal will be sold on the commercial market.
Alliant is shipping the initial dismantling equipment to Ukraine and is expected to be operating there later this summer. Alliant's initial capital investment is about $15 million, said Larry J. Blagdon, the company's director of ordnance, reclamation and demilitarization.
Eventually, the venture is expected to employ about 100 Ukrainians, mainly civilians who now work at weapons depots.
Industry analysts say that demilitarization is a still a peripheral business for major military contractors, but that broader applications will be possible.
"This part of the industry is still embryonic, but any new business for these guys is good these days," said Byron Callan, a military industry analyst at Prudential Securities in New York.

Dollar Is Up Against Mark But Down in Yen Trading

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar firmed against European currencies yesterday but fell against the yen as the Japanese currency climbed to a record high against the German mark.
Gold prices declined. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, the actively traded gold contract for August delivery fell $1.90 an ounce, to $391.20. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted spot gold at $391.00 an ounce, down $1.80 from Monday. 
 The yen was the main beneficiary as investors fled mark-denominated assets on expectations that Germany would cut interest rates to reduce pressure on the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. The yen peaked at 61.46 per mark, breaking Monday's record of 61.55 yen per mark.
Dealers said they were betting that the Bundesbank would cut its key discount rate, currently at 6.75 percent, by a quarter- to half-point at its council meeting tomorrow.
"The Bundesbank will have to ease," said Steven Jury, chief dealer at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York. "If it doesn't it will sacrifice the current parities in the E.R.M."
The dollar rose to 1.7271 marks in late New York trading from 1.7245 marks late Monday. But it fell to 106.10 yen from 106.65 yen.
 
Inflation Unlikely to Matter
 Dealers thought it unlikely that German price data would deter the Bundesbank from easing. Annual inflation hit its highest level in three months at 4.3 percent in July, but many economists had forecast an even bigger price rise.
The Bundesbank's weekly open market operations today should lend some clues on monetary policy, dealers said. Most expect Germany's short-term money market rates to decline.
Speculators massed against Spain's peseta and Portugal's escudo. Rumors that Spain would announce alarmingly high unemployment this week helped push its currency to the bottom of its European Rate Mechanism range.
The French and Belgian francs and Danish krone held up better, but few believed the pressure was off for good.
The British pound declined sharply, falling in New York to $1.4890, from 1.5010 Monday.

A Shape From Nature Helps Curb Noise

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSH

 BODY:
To replace conventional mufflers on trucks and other noisy machines, a Canadian company has developed a "silencer" whose inner workings are shaped like a conch shell.
The developer, Temro of Winnipeg, Manitoba, a subsidiary of the Budd Company of Troy, Mich., contends that the device for diesel engines is up to three times as effective a sound deadener as a conventional muffler and can eliminate 75 percent of the noise from a truck's exhaust pipe. 
 Mufflers work in two ways: by reflecting sound waves back on each other so they cancel out and by using sound-absorbing materials. Temro says its muffler, called the Cowl Silencer, uses both methods.
Stainless steel wool within the walls helps absorb sound while small holes in the spiraling walls allow waves to pass through and cancel others. Because it does not have the baffles and chambers of typical mufflers, the spiral design reduces the back pressure that can limit an engine's performance.
The device is similar in diameter to conventional mufflers, but is only one-third as long. Temro would not specify prices for the mufflers, which are now reaching the market, but did say they were more expensive than conventional mufflers and would probably not be economical for cars. The target markets are buses, air compressors, commercial boats and earth movers.

HEADLINE: Unusual Heart Therapy Wins Coverage From Large Insurer

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL

 BODY:
In a move that could be a boon to alternative medicine, the nation's largest provider of health insurance for individuals announced yesterday that it would reimburse patients participating in a program that combines diet, meditation, exercise and support groups to reverse heart disease.
The "reversal program," which was developed by Dr. Dean Ornish, director of the Preventive Medicine Research Institute in Sausalito, Calif., is the first non-surgical, non-pharmaceutical therapy for heart disease to qualify for insurance reimbursement, which it was granted yesterday by the Mutual of Omaha Insurance Company. 
 With the exception of chiropractic care, it is the first alternative medical technique, not taught in traditional medical school curriculums, to gain approval by a major insurance carrier. Insurance executives say it will not be the last.
 
'Very Hot Area'
 "Alternative therapies are potentially a very hot area," said Dr. Jeffrey Weiner, senior medical director of U.S. Healthcare, a health-maintenance organization with 1.6 million subscribers, based in Blue Bell, Pa.
Other insurance companies may soon follow Mutual of Omaha's lead. The Blue Cross and Blue Shield Companies of California are "considering Dr. Ornish's plan quite positively and will make a final decision about reimbursement at our next meeting," said Mike Odom, a company spokesman. Similar therapies are being considered for inclusion in the national health-care policy being developed by the White House, according to several physicians who are working with the White House and who asked not to be identified.
Dr. Joseph J. Jacobs, director of alternative medicine at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., said, "I think it's terrific that insurance companies are beginning to acknowlege the value of therapies outside conventional forms." He added that non-traditional therapies could be effective in dealing with chronic problems like heart disease, repetitive stress syndrome, arthritis and back pain and that they were often much less expensive than conventional treatment.
Dr. Ornish's reversal plan, for instance, costs $3,500 a year, about one-tenth the price of conventional coronary care, according to Dr. Richard Collins, director of cardiology at the Immanuel Medical Center in Omaha. Immanuel Medical Center plans to begin offering a reversal program in October; other hospitals offering the program are Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan and Griffin Hospital of Yale University in Derby, Conn.
Patients on Dr. Ornish's program eat a vegetarian diet that gets 10 percent of its calories from fat, practice stress management through meditation and yoga, exercise moderately and participate in a support group to help them adhere to these life style changes.
Jack Weekly, the president of Mutual of Omaha, said that Dr. Ornish's program "is a model for the preventative treatments that are critical for better quality, more economical health care." The company provides health insurance for 10 million people nationwide through individual and group plans.
Dr. William C. Roberts, editor-in-chief of The American Journal of Cardiology in Dallas, agreed. "Americans spent $18 billion dollars last year on coronary-bypass surgery, making it the number-one health bill in the nation," he said. He added that while traditional therapies could retard heart disease, they have not been shown to reverse it.
"More often than not, the patient's cholesterol actually goes up after the traditional interventions," he said. The American Heart Association estimates that if work loss is added to the cost of hospital, surgical and pharmacological intervention, heart disease costs the United States about $117.4 billion a year.
 
Support From Studies
 In three studies financed by private foundations as well as by the National Institutes of Health over a 17-year period, Dr. Ornish has proved that his program not only retards but can reverse heart disease. "In the first year, 82 percent of patients demonstrated overall reversal of coronary artery disease," he said.
Dr. Ornish says his program is an adjunct to traditional therapies, not a replacement for them. Thousands of people have attended his week-long seminars on the program.
In its early years, Dr. Ornish's research struck many conventional cardiologists as a remnant of the feel-good, self-help 1970's.
"There was resistance and disbelief," Dr. Roberts said. "People thought he was a radical." Dr. Ornish said that his colleagues had treated his research as suspect until his findings were published in professional journals like The Lancet and The Journal of the American Medical Association.
Today, he said, few cardiologists doubt that heart disease can be reversed through a stringent, low-fat diet. And in the world of technological coronary care, Dr. Ornish's self-help approach is viewed as a "conservative alternative," Dr. Roberts said.
Dr. Ornish's move from the alternative fringe into the mainstream of American medical practice was predicated on rigorous, well-designed clinical research, according to Dr. Jacobs of the N.I.H. "In order to validate therapies outside the traditional forms, the researcher has to lay a solid groundwork," Dr. Jacobs said.
In addition to his research, Dr. Ornish has written two best-selling books, "Dr. Dean Ornish's Program for Reversing Heart Disease," (Random House, 1990) and "Eat More, Weigh Less," (HarperCollins, 1993). He has also developed a line of frozen vegetarian meals called Life Choice, which is distributed by direct mail through Conagra Inc. based in Omaha.
 
Promoting a Message
 Dr. Ornish said: "It is very threatening to ask people to change what they put in their mouths 21 times a week and to ask them to practice activities that are outside their realm. I figured the more familiar my name became, the less threatening my message would be."
But it may still be threatening to conventionally trained cardiologists. Dr. Roberts said, "It's tough to make a living passing out eating advice." Like conventional heart specialists, Dr. Ornish prescribes heart medicine, but he does not recommend cholesterol-lowering medication for people following his program.
Dr. Ornish's detractors, such as Dr. Adam Drenowski, dean of nutrition at the University of Michigan School of Public Health in Ann Arbor, question whether adherence to a stringent low-fat diet is feasible. "My research has shown that, unless threatened by death, adherence is impossible," Dr. Drenowski said in an interview last winter.
Others, like Dr. Peter Kaufman, director of behavioral medicine at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in Bethesda, say that pulling alternative treatments into mainstream medical practice requires some retraining.
"We are in the early stages of using alternative interventions that rely on behavioral changes in health care," he said. Mutual of Omaha, he said, "is also helping to shape the practice of behavioral medicine, which is in its infancy."
By opening the door to other forms of preventive treatment, insurance reimbursement for the reversal program is also the first step toward changing the way medicine is practiced in the United States, said Dr. Collins of Immanuel Medical Center.
"Physicians have become procedure-providers instead of health-care providers," he said "That's where the money has been."
Dr. Collins plans to do his part to change that when he opens his reversal center in October, using Dr. Ornish's procedures. "We're promising a money-back guarantee," he said. "If reversal doesn't work, we'll deduct its cost from any additional procedure the patient might require."

HEADLINE: Another Generation Lost

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
"The Lost Generation," the title of tonight's NBC News special, refers to the many young people who, as Tom Brokaw puts it, have "walked out of high school into a recession." It is no revelation that good jobs are hard to find these days, and this hourlong report tends toward the familiar and repetitious. But the subject is important enough to bear some repeating.
By way of example, Mr. Brokaw visits an Ohio town whose General Motors plant, once its major employer, shut down in 1987. Since then, youngsters who would ordinarily have followed their parents onto the assembly line at union wages have had to settle for minimum-wage jobs in fast-food chains. Instead of rearing families and putting money in the bank, they are scrambling to get by, and prospects are bleak. Interviews bring out their feelings that they have somehow been betrayed, that they will never attain the simple but solid comforts their parents took for granted and they expected. 
 There are also glimpses of young folks who, it is suggested, have been driven to crime or to religion by tough times. The camera keeps busy with all manner of unnecessary tricks, perhaps in an effort to distract viewers from Mr. Brokaw's generally routine comments, which evidence no acquaintance with the long history of generational disaffection.
About halfway through, the program gets into the significant if depressing subject of what the millions of young Americans who are not college bound are being taught. This "Lost Generation," two-thirds of high-school students, is not being prepared for better jobs than dishing out hamburgers. Mr. Brokaw goes on to report on experiments around the country, like apprenticeship arrangements with local businesses, to do something about it. They seem like worthy efforts, but it is hard to get one's hopes up as long as jobs of any sort remain in short supply.
 
'48 Hours'
'On Sunset Boulevard'
CBS, tonight at 10
Tonight's edition of "48 Hours" is all about comings and goings in Los Angeles. Coming in are hundreds of thousands of immigrants, mostly illegal and mostly from Latin America, along with aspiring movie stars and commuters who clog the so-called freeways. Going out are middle-class families, for whom the California dream has been contaminated by crime, pollution and a long economic recession.
Political discontent is signaled by an organization called the Voice of Citizens Together, formed to oppose illegal immigration. Its leaders warn that their city is "exporting jobs and importing poverty." An environmentalist says the future "is as murky as the water."
Given such dire assessments, "On Sunset Boulevard" is a remarkably cheery hour. Hispanic newcomers are seen learning English. A 22-year-old actress is as hopeful of being discovered as young performers always have been while they wait and wait tables, and Lana Turner's picture still hangs at Hollywood High. Surfers continue to surf, although the water keeps getting dirtier. And a man who drives a bus full of neighbors on a two-and-a-half-hour commute and then works nine hours in a Los Angeles bank before driving the bus back home to their distant suburb positively rejoices in his schedule.
But the most cheering moment for New Yorkers comes from a departing woman who says she is returning to New York City. And safety.

China Needs Time To Deserve the Games

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY

 BODY:
IF we all can curb our suicidal instincts for war and pollution, China must surely be an Olympic host for the first time, very early in the next century. But not in the year 2000.
At the point when the decision must be made, in Monaco on Sept. 23, the International Olympic Committee should use the yardstick of preparedness for not choosing Beijing. Then while China is improving its stadiums and hotels, it can work on its observation of human rights, without having been seen as openly criticized. 
For better or for worse, comfort and technology are the major factors in choosing Olympic sites these days. It is a sad fact that most countries will never have a shot at staging the Games, but the emerging nation of China will be a host of them, the sooner the better.
The I.O.C. delegates were not humming "It's a small, small world" when they selected a second-tier American city, Atlanta, to be the host in 1996, only 12 years after Los Angeles.
Telephone lines. Roads. Practical time zones for European and American television. American corporate sponsors. Creature comforts. Can you imagine Carl Lewis and I.O.C. delegates staying in anything but five-star hotels? Having given in to their own top-dog tendencies, the I.O.C. delegates are in perfect position to ask China to wait four years.
Another reason being advanced for delaying China is the violent repression of the Tiananmen Square demonstrations in 1989, and wide-scale persecution of dissidents.
"There is no reason to believe that once the Games are awarded, China will be persuaded to loosen the screws," said Richard Dicker, a lawyer with Human Rights Watch, in his testimony before a Senate committee on July 15.
The House of Representatives passed a resolution on Monday urging the I.O.C. to find "another more suitable venue," and many senators also favor a resolution.
They are aiming these resolutions at one former Olympic bronze-medal rower, Anita DeFrantz, the American delegate to the I.O.C. DeFrantz recently told a Senate committee that "respect for human rights, civil rights and human dignity have also been guiding principles in my own moral compass," and she added, "I honor and respect the intent of the resolution." But she has no obligation to any pressure.
She is also a lawyer, a black woman and a resident of Los Angeles, which has seen its share of agony since the so-called Rodney King turmoil. She is not about to say that China is the only country in the world with problems. She lost her second chance to participate in the Summer Games because of President Carter's boycott of the 1980 Games in Moscow following the invasion of Afghanistan.
She was an official in the 1984 Games in Los Angeles, which were diminished to a Disney celebration because most of the Soviet bloc stayed home. Boycotts beget boycotts. Dr. Leroy Walker, the president of the United States Olympic Committee, fears political rejection of China could start a new wave of Olympic power plays.
There are clearly precedents for punishing nations with bad records on human rights. South Africa was barred for 32 years because of its blatant policy of apartheid. In Brazil, off-duty police officers are apparently murdering street children with some overtones of racism, but Brasilia is also a candidate for the 2000 Games. So are Istanbul, Berlin, Sydney and Manchester, England.
There have been religious murders in Turkey, racial murders in Germany, open discrimination against Asians and blacks in the United Kingdom and past repression of aborigines in Australia. Where do people of conscience draw the line?
Fortunately, there is a middle way to send China a message. Twelve Olympic officials have evaluated all six candidate cities, based on 23 factors. The report was supposed to be distributed only to the 94 delegates, but copies became public. Sydney received the highest grades, followed by Manchester and Berlin, while questions were raised about Istanbul, and Brasilia fell far short, and Beijing was particularly criticized for stadium sites and pollution.
"We would also urge you to . . . consider the current economic, political and other factors which may not be covered by the technical evaluation," wrote Gunnar Ericsson of Sweden, the I.O.C. delegate who led the committee.
DeFrantz is much too discreet to tip her hand, but the former Olympic rower did say she always thinks of the conditions for the athletes. "Nobody will ever know how we vote," she said.
China is showing great signs of flexing its economic muscles. It must not be discouraged from even tangential pursuits like sports. Four years to upgrade its infrastructure and take a look at human rights? What are four years to China?

HEADLINE: DEMOCRATS VOICING DOUBT ON CHANCES FOR ECONOMIC PLAN

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 28

 BODY:
Amid rising anxiety among Democratic leaders over the prospects for President Clinton's economic package, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, a quarterback in the drive to push the plan through Congress, proclaimed today that he lacked the votes to pass the measure in the Senate next week and was not sure how to get them.
As Mr. Moynihan and Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Chicago shuttered themselves in the Capitol today, trying to work out a compromise version of the plan that could pass both houses of Congress, the plan's political woes only seemed to mount. 
 Several lawmakers who had previously supported the plan appeared to be climbing onto the political fence. And a legislative revolt seemed to be brewing against a crucial element of the package, a tax on gasoline and diesel fuel that House and Senate negotiators are counting on to supply at least $5 billion a year.
 
Chicken or Chess?
 But in the feverish atmosphere enshrouding these last days of bargaining over Mr. Clinton's $500 billion package of tax increases and spending cuts, no one could tell how much of Mr. Moynihan's hand-wringing was genuine and how much was bluff, how much of the gasoline-tax revolt was real and how much was posturing, or how many Democrats would really vote to doom Mr. Clinton's economic plan and their party's political credibility. The negotiators are rushing so the package can be voted on before the monthlong recess that begins on Aug. 6.
Rather, Democrats at both ends of the Capitol were playing a high-stakes game of chicken, warning that they or others could singlehandedly vote the package down unless someone, somewhere bowed to demands that the package be softened, or toughened or left as is.
 
Thinnest of Margins
 "A lot of this is posturing going on now," said Representative Mike Synar of Oklahoma, a Democrat who is a leading supporter of Mr. Clinton's package in a state where outright support is rare. "When it's time to vote, each individual member is going to have to look at themselves and at the future of this country."
Minutes later, Mr. Synar hinted that the proposed gasoline tax was causing even his enthusiasm for the package to wane. "It's not a show-stopper for me," he said of the tax. "But it's sure an intermission."
Such warnings are credible because time is so short, and Mr. Clinton's support is so thin. By most readings, the President's plan will fail if he loses even one supporter in the 100-member Senate, or as few as two or three in the 435-member House.
Mr. Moynihan said this afternoon that the negotiations with the House to produce a compromise bill were going well, even as the politics deteriorated. The talks today, which included Administration aides, produced agreements in spirit, but not number, on most items except the fuel tax, he said.
Lawmakers also said a compromise on that tax seemed near with the House and Senate negotiators reportedly discussing an agreement that would raise the proposed tax from the Senate's 4.3 cents per gallon to between 6 and 7 cents. That tax increase would be added to the current tax of 14.1 cents a gallon.
Still uncertain is whether any compromise can muster support in Congress. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said he believed a gasoline tax would be in the final package, but pointedly noted that its fate was an open question among House Democrats.
Mr. Synar and other House members of both parties said the package would probably pass there, but by as a little as one vote. The Senate vote appears to be an even dicier proposition.
"It may be we'll do this thing," Mr. Moynihan said in a telephone interview. "But as of 7 last night, we didn't have the votes." House leaders have told him that they will not schedule a vote on the package until passage in the Senate is assured, he said.
Mr. Moynihan's declaration, which came after what one participant called a "gloomy" meeting Tuesday evening with top Congressional and White House officials, may have been meant as a wake-up call to fellow Democrats. Or it may have been the truth.
The downbeat reading seemed to be affirmed this afternoon, when two Democratic Senators who had earlier supported the economic proposal, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Herb Kohl of Wisconsin, joined Oklahoma's David L. Boren, in expressing new qualms.
That left Mr. Moynihan up to three votes short of the number needed to pass the economic package, with no firm prospects of finding support elsewhere.
Mr. Kohl said he had told Mr. Clinton at a White House meeting today that he felt that the gasoline tax should be dropped from the package to erase the last vestige of taxation on middle- and lower-class families and to deprive Republican critics of a political club in the debate.
 
No Lines Drawn Yet
 Mr. Kerrey told reporters that he had voted for the Senate version of the measure in June to avoid embarrassing Mr. Clinton, as he was headed to Tokyo for his first economic conference with leaders of industrial nations.
Mr. Clinton's backers took some solace in the fact that both men, like Mr. Boren before them, pointedly refused to say that they were definitely opposed to the package.
"I don't want to draw a line in the sand," Mr. Kohl said.
On Tuesday, Mr. Boren had denounced Mr. Clinton's proposal, saying the President should scrap his package, make "significantly more" spending cuts and open negotiations with Republicans to construct an economic plan with bipartisan support. But he had also denounced the Senate version of the economic package before voting for it last month, and negotiators held out hope that he would come around again.
"David Boren has a magical quality about him: he has appeared where you least expected him many times before," said one aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "David Boren is someone on whom you must never give up."
The Senate negotiators and the White House are also not giving up on at least two Democrats who voted against the plan in the Senate last month, Richard Bryan of Nevada and Sam Nunn of Georgia. Mr. Clinton called Mr. Bryan to the White House for a meeting on Sunday, and House and Senate negotiators are considering easing proposed rules on deductions for business meals and entertainment expenses, a big issue for Las Vegas's hotel and convention industry.
Mr. Bryan opened the door a crack today. "He's asked me to keep an open mind until the final package is put together," he said of Mr. Clinton, "and I've agreed to do so."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Merck Will Pay $6 Billion For Giant Drug Discounter

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Heralding the far-reaching changes in the business of health care, Merck & Company, the world's largest pharmaceutical company, announced yesterday that it would spend $6 billion to buy the country's largest mail-order drug company.
The purchase of Medco Containment Services Inc. gives Merck a discount drug distribution arm at a time when prescription drugs, its main business, are coming under increasing price pressure from Washington and employers eager to curtail rising health care costs. 
 The cash-and-stock acquisition is the latest of several moves by large drug companies to try to fit into the emerging world of managed health care, in which consumers' choices are limited and costs are reduced.
Having lost their virtually unrestrained ability to raise prices, many prescription drug makers are striking deals to get their products into other segments of the market in the hopes of keeping sales and profits growing. For instance, the Warner-Lambert Company announced yesterday that it was forming joint ventures with Glaxo P.L.C. and Wellcome P.L.C. to develop versions of two widely used drugs that will soon be available without a doctor's prescription. [Page D5.]
And Marion Merrell Dow Inc. said recently that it would buy Rugby-Darby Group, the biggest maker of low-priced generic versions of drugs whose patent protection has run out.
Merck estimated yesterday that 90 percent of all prescription drugs would be provided free or at reduced prices by government or employer health plans within the next 10 years. About half of prescriptions are financed this way. Medco provides drugs under these plans through its mail-order business and through pharmacy sales to health-plan members who carry a special card.
Medco, based in Montvale, N.J., says it supplies drugs to employer health plans with 33 million members.
In the case of its mail-order business, Medco seeks the lowest-priced drug for each type of illness. Merck had balked until recent years at offering price cuts demanded by Medco and other managed-care buyers.
Companies like Medco and other large drug buyers like health maintenance organizations increasingly influence which drugs are prescribed by giving their members incentives to choose certain drugs.
Analysts said President Clinton's health care program, or whatever version emerges from Congress, probably would accelerate the trend.
But discount drugs are not the only services provided by Medco. It makes telephone calls to customers' physicians to urge them to prescribe selected drugs. It also keeps elaborate electronic records of each patient's drug purchases, and it alerts pharmacists to side effects that might endanger people who take multiple drugs.
 
Offering Advice
 P. Roy Vagelos, Merck's chairman, said Merck would study the Medco electronic records to try to show health maintenance organizations and employers that Merck's products would generate large savings for patients who might otherwise need expensive hospital care, which would mean lost days of work.
Citing research findings that 50 percent of patients with chronic ailments stop taking their medicine within 18 months, often without telling their doctor, Dr. Vagelos said Merck hoped to push patients to stay on their regimen. That could not only mean more drug sales for Merck, it could also save billions of dollars in wasted prescriptions, he said.
The acquisition will produce "the first complete vertical integration of a pharmaceutical company from the discovery of drugs to the patient's mouth," Stephen W. Schondelmeyer, a pharmaceutical economist at the University of Minnesota, said.
Merck, which is based in White House Station, N.J., said the Federal Trade Commission would review the Medco acquisition for potential problems with antitrust laws. With $9.7 billion in 1992 revenues, Merck has about 10 percent of the fragmented American drug market.
Medco, with $1.8 billion in sales in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 1992, has about half of the mail-order drug business and 22 percent of those eligible for employer-financed drug benefits.
"That's a colossus in an industry that is highly fragmented," said Samuel Isaly, an analyst at Mehta & Isaly Worldwide Pharmaceutical Research. He said Merck executives hope to double their American market share, to 20 percent, in 10 years. But at least for now, he said, the combined Merck and Medco business would not be large enough to be "anticompetitive."
Martin J. Wygod, Medco's chairman, will stay on as head of the business. He said it would be a "free-standing subsidiary of Merck" that would continue to buy products from other drug makers on the basis of cost effectiveness.
But some analysts said some drug companies might shy away from dealing with Medco, fearing their price offers would become known to Merck.
"If another company approaches Medco, Merck can say 'We'll match that price,' " Dr. Schondelmeyer said. "They can never be beat."
Barbara Ryan, a drug securities analyst with Alex. Brown & Company, said other drug manufacturers would now seek to make their own alliances with Medco's competitors. The Merck announcement "caught a lot of other drug companies with their pants down," she said.
Under terms of the agreement signed yesterday morning after an all-night drafting session, Medco shareholders would get $39 in cash, or 1.21401 Merck shares for each Medco share. The cash payments would be limited to 40 percent of the total, to keep the transaction tax free, the companies said.
Merck shares closed at $30.75 yesterday, down $1.375 in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Medco gained $4.375 to close at $34.125 in Nasdaq trading.
 
Big Stock Issue Is Set
 Judy C. Lewent, chief financial officer of Merck, said the company would raise $2.4 billion through medium-term and short-term borrowing, taking advantage of low interest rates. It will also issue 112 million shares of common stock. She said the value of Merck stock would be temporarily diluted but the value would be restored by 1996 because of anticipated sales growth.
Mr. Wygod, who acquired Medco 10 years ago, when it was a $20 million-a-year business, said he would convert his personal holdings of two million shares of Medco common stock and 1.2 million Medco stock options to Merck shares. He also plans to buy "$20 million to $40 million worth of Merck stock," he said, "as soon as I get an O.K. from the attorneys."
Two senior Medco executives will convert their holdings to add $10 million to $20 million more in Merck shares, Mr. Wygod added. Kenneth S. Abramowitz of Sanford C. Bernstein & Company said Mr. Wygod had pledged to hold onto the Merck shares for at least three years. The investments are intended to seal the executives' commitment to Merck.

HEADLINE: Cuba Will End Restrictions On Exiles Wanting to Visit

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, July 28

 BODY:
Accelerating a drive to obtain desperately needed foreign currency, the Cuban Government will announce the lifting of tight restrictions on travel to the island this week for Cuban-American exiles that had forced most to wait for months or even years for visas allowing them to visit their families.
Travel agencies in Miami that specialize in trips to Cuba for Cuban-Americans say Havana has notified them that it will quickly seek a fivefold increase in the number of exiles visiting the island. To accomplish this, the Cuban Government has said it will reduce the processing time for most visa applications to about two weeks. 
 The travel agencies say they have also been told that Cuban-Americans who visit the island may carry an unlimited amount of dollars with them, play host to their relatives in tourist hotels and shops, and return as often as they like.
The relaxation of restrictions on visits by Cuban-Americans is the latest in an increasingly bold series of economic and political gambles that analysts of Cuban affairs say are aimed at buying time for a Government that is nearing financial asphyxiation. This week President Fidel Castro announced that Cubans may legally possess dollars for the first time in three decades,
 
Risks for the Government
 The new measures, broadly hinted at in a speech by Mr. Castro on Monday, were first reported in The Miami Herald today.
Many experts say that while the measures may quickly generate vital new revenues for the island's Communist Government, they also carry incalculable risks.
"This is a gutsy, but really quite dangerous move for the kind of regime they are trying to maintain, with very little political opening," said Jorge Dominguez, a Harvard University specialist in Cuban affairs. "It is dangerous to have all of these free spirits wandering around, none of them with a warm feeling in their hearts for the Government."
Andrew Zimbalist, a professor at Smith College who has made a specialty of studying the Cuban economy, said: "This is really going to open a Pandora's box. You will have a crazier mix of incentives than ever before.
"Blacks will not have access to dollars, party members who are supposed to be relatively better off will have less money than taxi drivers and if the Government doesn't take some other serious steps a lot of people will see no point in working in their 500-pesos-a-month jobs at all."
Relatively few blacks have emigrated from Cuba since Mr. Castro took power in 1959, meaning they would not benefit from remittances sent by relatives abroad.
 
Behind the Mariel Boatlift
 The last time Havana encouraged large-scale tourism by Cuban-Americans, in the late 1970's, the ensuing social ferment, caused in part by the contact with much more affluent and free-speaking visitors, led to the Mariel boatlift of 1980, when over 100,000 Cubans fled their country in a chaotic scramble.
About 100,000 Cuban-Americans visited Cuba in 1979. Since the start-up of Radio Marti, a special United States Government station broadcasting to Cuba, in 1985, travel to Cuba by exiles has been severely limited by a series of restrictions, most of which are now being lifted. On average, about 90 visas a week are granted to Cuban exiles.
That the Cuban Government is carrying out such a policy now, experts say, reflects its dire economic situation.
By Mr. Castro's own most recent estimates, given in a speech on Monday, a lack of foreign exchange has caused the value of imports to fall to $1.7 billion this year, from $2.2 billion last year. In 1989, before the disintegration of the Soviet bloc, which had long provided sustenance to Cuba, total imports valued over $8 billion.

HEADLINE: Trade Pact May Hinge on Border-Bond Plan

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 28

 BODY:
In an effort to win support in Congress for the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Clinton Administration plans to create a joint agency with the Mexican Government that would issue $6 billion to $8 billion worth of bonds to pay for the cleanup of the two countries' border, a senior Administration official said today.
"It's a new Mexico-U.S. binational authority," the official, who insisted on anonymity, said. "It would be like the Port Authority in New York -- it would be able to go into the market and float bonds paid for by user fees." 
 The border authority's bonds would be used to build treatment centers for sewage and for drinking water along the Rio Grande and other border-area rivers. Sewerage and water fees from local residents on both sides would be used to repay the bonds.
The border region is one of the most polluted in either country. Hundreds of little-regulated factories have sprung up in Mexico to serve American markets, and many pour sewage and other waste into rivers.
Some counties on the American side are among the poorest in this country, with limited availability of clean water and sewerage.
Environmentalists in the United States, fearing that the trade agreement may result in intensified business activity along the border, have demanded that the Administration assure cleanup of the region as the price for their political support. Such groups have estimated the cleanup costs as high as $30 billion, and it was not clear how they would react to the Administration estimate.
Top American negotiators have begun to discuss the idea with their Mexican counterparts. American deputy Cabinet secretaries and other senior Federal officials involved in the North American trade agreement reached a rough consensus favoring the border authority at a meeting on Tuesday, the senior official added.
The plan was worked out with the help of New York investment bankers who specialize in municipal bonds. But because the Administration has not completed work on the plan's legal details, no investment bank has been chosen to manage any of the bond issues and none will be soon.
Projects that do not generate enough money to repay the bonds will be subsidized in several ways to make up the difference, the Administration official said. Mexico will be able to borrow money from the Inter-American Development Bank, an institution like the World Bank that lends money in this hemisphere to poor countries' public works projects.
The United States is considering the possibility of guaranteeing repayment of the border projects' bonds, which would allow their issue at much lower interest rates than if they were ordinary revenue bonds. A second possibility is that the Federal Government would guarantee the new authority's bonds. A third way would be to set up an arm of the Inter-American Development Bank that would be allowed to lend on the United States side of the border.
The Administration's guiding principle for the new authority, and for other environmental programs, is that Washington would channel private money into the cleanup programs. "A lot of the work that has to be done on the border pays for itself," the Administration official said.
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, is to meet here this week on the trade pact with his Mexican and Canadian counterparts. In addition to addressing the accord's costs, these officials will try to resolve disputes concerning pivotal labor and environmental-issue side agreements.
Mr. Kantor and other officials visited members of Congress this week in efforts to gain support for the side agreements, which are intended to prevent any of the three countries from allowing companies to violate their laws as a way of cutting costs.
The touchiest issue now involves whether companies or countries are to be penalized if they allow systematic abuse of labor and environmental laws. A possible compromise, already broached by American officials in talks with the Canadians and Mexicans, calls for initial fines on national governments. Only in cases of severe and persistent abuse, and after several legal proceedings, would more severe sanctions be imposed, like tariffs on imports.

HEADLINE: Party Lines Extra Hard and Fast

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 28

 BODY:
Rarely have the two parties in Congress been so united in opposition to one another. Rarely have the political stakes been so high. And rarely has it been so uncertain which side was gaining the political advantage.
When the final version of President Clinton's economic program comes up for votes in the House of Representatives and the Senate next week, no amendments will be allowed. So the representatives and senators will have no choice but to vote for or against the entire package of tax increases and spending cuts. 
 Almost every Democrat will vote for it. Every single Republican will vote against it. As matters stand now, the measure will pass or fail by the narrowest of margins.
The Republicans are so unified that they make the Democrats appear to be sharply divided. That perception was strengthened Tuesday when Senator David L. Boren, a maverick Democrat from Oklahoma, stepped into the spotlight once more to trash the President's program.
But the fact is, not since World War II have Democrats in Congress been as steadfast as they have been this year.
When the deficit-reduction measure squeaked through the first time around, only 38 Democratic representatives and six Democratic senators voted against the President.
That means that 85 percent of the Democrats in the House and 89 percent of those in the Senate voted with the President, a remarkable show of party loyalty.
According to Congressional Quarterly, 90 percent of the Democrats in Congress have held the line this year on what the service calls party-unity votes, those votes when a majority of Democrats go one way and a majority of Republicans go the other.
By contrast, each year in Jimmy Carter's Presidency, the last time a Democrat was in the White House, fewer than 70 percent of the Democrats in Congress held ranks on such votes.
But on the budget and on several other big issues as well this year, every Republican voted against the President.
"A huge percentage of our people are sticking together," said Representative Vic Fazio of California, a member of the Democratic leadership. "The problem is that without any Republican votes, the cracks in the seams in our party become more evident."
Republicans got their noses out of joint early this year when President Clinton and his Democratic allies in Congress had the hubris to develop their budget plan without the courtesy of consulting any Republicans.
The Republicans gained confidence when they were able to defeat the President's economic stimulus plan with a filibuster in the Senate. It takes 60 votes to break a filibuster. The Democratic majority in the Senate is only 56 to 44. So as long as they stick together, the Republicans realize, they are unbeatable on most issues.
Fortunately for the Democrats, the rules prohibit a filibuster on the budget. But the Democrats' margin is small enough that seven defectors are enough to kill the legislation if Republicans remain solid.
In the House, the Democratic majority is slightly more comfortable, 258 to 176 with one independent, Bernard Sanders of Vermont, who almost always votes with the Democrats. But dozens of Democrats, mainly Southerners, come from very conservative, very Republican districts, and if more than about 40 of them switch sides on any issue, the Democrats lose.
The first time around, with all Republicans in opposition, the deficit-reduction legislation was passed by the House by a mere six votes and by the Senate on the strength of Vice President Al Gore's tie-breaking vote. Congressional scholars have not been able to find a single piece of legislation that became law in recent years when all the members of one party in the House and Senate voted against it.
 
Unifying Principle
 "We're not just trying to scheme and embarrass the President," said Senator John C. Danforth of Missouri, a Republican who in years past often operated in a bipartisan fashion. What happened, he said, was that Mr. Clinton has run up against the one principle that unifies Republicans: that the Government is too big and too costly.
Maybe so, but it may be hardball politics, too. Republicans also seem to believe that if they vote solidly against higher taxes at every turn, they can ride that issue back into the White House in 1996 and perhaps into control of the Senate, if not the entire Congress.
For their part, the Democrats are sticking together because they feel they will carry the day if they can show that they can attack the country's problems and govern successfully when they finally control both the White House and Congress.
Which strategy is better in pure political terms is impossible to gauge at this stage.
Former Senator Warren B. Rudman, a New Hampshire Republican, said in an interview the other day that the Republicans might be making a mistake as a policy matter to try to thwart the President at every turn but that it was probably good politics.
Even if the Clinton program is enacted, Mr. Rudman said, the budget deficit will still be over $200 billion in 1996, and Republicans will be able to say that the pain of tax increases and spending cuts had been futile.
Democrats say that if the Republicans remain intransigent, they can be portrayed as guardians of gridlock.
But ultimately, the success or failure of the parties' political strategies will turn on whether the economy strengthens.
If it does, Democrats will probably prevail in the midterm Congressional elections next year and in the Presidential election in 1996. They will be able to take credit for turning the economy around as Ronald Reagan did in 1984.
But if the economy turns sour, the Democrats will be blamed, and that is what the Republicans are banking on. "What's going to happen," said Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, the top Republican on the Budget Committee, is that the economy is going to go bad because of defense cuts and higher taxes. Then we can say, 'You should have done it our way.' "

HEADLINE: Blue Cross Plans a Rate Increase For Individuals by 20% or More

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TRENTON, July 28

 BODY:
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Jersey is preparing to raise rates for its 200,000 individual policyholders, possibly by 20 percent or more, a company spokesman said today.
While the spokesman, Fred Hillman, would not say exactly what the increases would be, he said they were necessary to make up for double-digit inflation in health-care costs and the loss of a subsidy the insurer had received from a surcharge on hospital bills. 
 Mr. Hillmann said there was no connection between the rate request being filed soon and the fact that Saturday is the day Blue Cross and Blue Shield and two other companies are scheduled to start selling policies under a revamped insurance law intended to make sure no one can be denied coverage for health reasons.
 
Increases Part of a Strategy
 However, a top aide to Gov. Jim Florio said the rate increases appeared to be part of a strategy to persuade customers to seek coverage in the company's new health maintenance organization policy, HMO Blue, which restricts the doctors and hospitals policyholders can use. Blue Cross and Blue Shield says the managed-care arrangement helps control the costs of health care better than is possible when people are allowed to choose their own doctors.
"The Governor feels if the increases are as rumors indicate, in the 25 to 30 percent range, those are outrageous," said Brenda Bacon, Governor Florio's top health-care adviser. "We think this is a cruel marketing strategy."
Mr. Hillmann said Ms. Bacon was reacting to speculation because nothing had been filed.
He said the Florio administration had been keeping rates low for political purposes.
"You put your head in the sand if you don't acknowledge health care costs inflated in double digits," he said.
He said the increases would take effect in five or six weeks at the earliest, and possibly later when policies come up for renewal.
Under a new health-care law enacted in November, Blue Cross and Blue Shield no longer needs state approval to raise rates, as long as the insurer provides documentation that at least 75 cents of every premium dollar will be paid out in claims. The previous ratio had been in the 90 percent range, so there should be no problem with the increases, Mr. Hillmann said.
Previously, increases had to be granted by the Department of Insurance and could be challenged by the public advocate.
During hearings on the new law, the Blue Cross president, John Petillo, said increases would not exceed inflation. Mr. Hillmann said he was referring to health-care cost inflation, not the consumer price index.
Blue Cross and Blue Shield also announced the price it plans to charge for its Basic Blue insurance policy, which will cover 30 days of hospitalization and 50 percent of the cost of doctor visits.
The plan will cost about $1,300 a year for individuals, $2,400 a year for a parent and child and $3,300 for a family.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Net Surges At Chrysler And Ford

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 28

 BODY:
Providing more evidence of the strong rebound in auto sales, the Ford Motor Company reported today that its earnings had doubled in the second quarter, while the Chrysler Corporation said its profit was nearly four times the level of a year ago.
Ford and Chrysler each benefited from the recovering automotive demand in North America. But Ford, which relies heavily on overseas operations, said it lost money in Europe, where auto sales were off drastically from a year ago. Chrysler, which does not have significant European operations, escaped the negative impact of Europe's weak economy.
 
Earnings Meet Forecasts
 The General Motors Corporation, the largest auto maker in the world, is expected to announce improved earnings on Thursday but, like Ford, will almost certainly be hurt by poor sales in Europe. The three principal nonautomotive subsidiaries of G.M. posted healthy earnings reports today. 
 Both the Ford and Chrysler earnings were in line with analysts' forecasts, but Chrysler stock dropped sharply in heavy trading after the earnings were announced. The stock fell $2, to $42.625, with more than nine million shares traded, making it the second-most-active stock on the New York Stock Exchange.
Neither Chrysler executives nor analysts had a satisfactory explanation for the trading; the latter suggested that traders with short-term perspectives had influenced the selling. Ford shares rose 75 cents, to $52.
The strong showing of the auto industry comes as contract talks continued between the Big Three and the United Automobile Workers union. David N. McCammon, the vice president for finance at Ford, said the latest profit picture should not be viewed by the union as a horn of plenty.
 
'Several Tough Years'
 "We have gone through several tough years," Mr. McCammon said at a news conference. "We have to make money to afford wages and new product programs."
Speaking about the European economy, Harold A. Poling, the chairman of Ford, said in a statement, "I'm not sure we have seen the bottom there yet."
But the domestic automotive operations were a different story. Ford said it had a net profit of $367 million for the quarter, compared with earnings of $42 million for the comparable period a year ago. Overseas automotive operations earned $28 million, down from $61 million.
Ford's financial services group posted $380 million in net profit, compared with $284 million last year. Over all, Ford's net profit was $775 million, or $1.43 a common share, roughly double last year's profit of $387 million, or 70 cents a share.
Ford's revenue was $29.4 billion in the quarter, up 9.7 percent from $26.8 billion in the comparable period a year ago. Worldwide factory sales of vehicles were 1,675,000, up from 1,640,000 a year ago.
Pleased with the increase in sales volume, Mr. McCammon said Ford hoped to maintain its pricing as demand picked up. The auto maker is paying about $750 in incentives per vehicle sold in the United States, he said. He also rebutted criticism from Wall Street that Ford's sales were made up of a great deal of leases, which carry an uncertain future liability.
"These aren't fleet sales; they're retail sales being financed through leases," he said. "We are very conservative in how we value the vehicles at the end of their leases. And we think this gives us a good chance to sell our customers another vehicle when the lease expires."
Chrysler reported second-quarter net income of $685 million, or $1.86 a common share, which included after-tax gains of $71 million from the sale of its stake in the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation and $39 million from the sale of some plastics operations.
Last year, Chrysler earned $178 million, or 54 cents a share, in the period. Chrysler's revenue for the quarter was $11.03 billion, up 18.5 percent from $9.31 billion in the comparable period a year ago. Worldwide factory sales were 657,050 vehicles, compared with 575,928 vehicles last year.
Robert J. Eaton, the chairman of Chrysler, said the strong results in the quarter were "were marked by tremendous market acceptance of our new products." The auto maker's L/H sedans, mini-vans and Jeep Grand Cherokee sport utility vehicle helped boost its share of the new-vehicle market in the United States and Canada to 15.4 percent, up from 13.3 percent a year ago.
 
New Pickup Debuts
 Tuesday, the first new Dodge Ram pickup truck rolled off the assembly line in Warren, Mich. The truck is Chrysler's first new pickup design in 15 years.
The Chrysler Financial Corporation said earnings for the quarter fell to $44 million, from $49 million in the comparable period a year ago.
Harvey Heinbach, an automotive analyst for Merrill Lynch, said the Chrysler results were on target, but added that some investors were interested in taking profits now because the third quarter is typically weak because of lost production as lines are converted to new models.

HEADLINE: Bienvenidos a los Suburbios;
Increasingly, New York's Outskirts Take On a Latin Accent

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT CHESTER, N.Y.

 BODY:
A rich man once advised Rudy Rodriguez, "Follow the sun and always stay close to where the wealthy people live, because you will find money there."
So after Mr. Rodriguez left Bogota, Colombia, he settled in 1973 in this gritty harbor village on Long Island Sound, sandwiched between two of the nation's most prosperous towns -- Greenwich, Conn., and Rye, N.Y. He took jobs for people in those towns, mowing their lawns, shampooing their carpets, driving their limousines and doing other manual labor. 
 Eventually, Mr. Rodriguez, now 43, earned enough to set up a luncheonette called Rudy's Express, to buy a $300,000 home across the state line in Old Greenwich and to bring in 15 relatives.
"We came here with no papers, no money, no friends, and we make it," said Mr. Rodriguez, who boasts that he once chauffeured George Bush and Sylvester Stallone.
 
Exodus to Suburbia
 In the last decade, thousands of immigrants like Mr. Rodriguez have come from Central and South America to search for opportunities in the New York City suburbs, and their presence has reshaped the cultures and economies of Westchester County, northern New Jersey and southwestern Connecticut.
The distinctly Hispanic accent is apparent not just in industrial cities like Yonkers, Bridgeport or Jersey City, but in more suburban places that still offer a critical mass of cheap housing and nearby jobs.
Even Greenwich saw a doubling of its small Hispanic population during the 1980's, to 2,583, and New Jersey's Somerset County, whose hills are favored by horse riders like Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, experienced a 149 percent surge, to 10,187. The increase in Somerset, says James W. Hughes, a professor of planning at Rutgers University, was attributable to the burgeoning office complexes along Route 287 that drew both white-collar workers and the blue-collar people needed to maintain them.
Many of the Hispanic suburbanites are themselves middle class. They have chosen the suburbs because, like Esmeralda Santiago, whose book "When I Was Puerto Rican," is to be published soon, they prefer greener settings reminiscent of home. In almost-rural villages like Katonah, N.Y., where Ms. Santiago lives, that can also mean isolation from other Hispanic people, however.
"You are here, but not surrounded by people who can celebrate your success," she said. "There is a sense that there is a part of me I can't express."
 
Merengue on Main Street
 Perhaps no place illustrates the fortified Hispanic presence in the New York suburbs better than Port Chester, whose Hispanic population doubled in the 1980's to 7,500, or 30 percent of its 25,000 residents.
The evidence is written across the face of Main Street. A decade ago, its boarded-up storefronts reflected the decay of a village that had lost employers like the Life Savers candy factory. But Main Street has come alive again with Peruvian, Colombian, Mexican and Salvadoran restaurants, two botanicas that sell folk herbs, and a covey of grocery stores, travel agencies and discotecas that cater to Spanish-speakers. Open a door, and the boisterous sounds of merengue and salsa come tumbling out.
Kelly's Taxi Service is owned by a Salvadoran. The Blockbuster Video outlet has a Spanish-language section. The local newspaper, The Westmore News, started a free Spanish monthly edited by a Peruvian journalism student.
"I see new immigrants moving in, then opening up stores, taking over stores originally owned by Italians," said Richard Abel, the publisher of the newspaper and the Spanish monthly, America Latina. "Those immigrant kids will then move up the ladder. It's the same cycle. Ideally, in the long run, this paper will turn English."
This summer saw the start of a Saturday soccer league at Columbus Park, where teams and rooters are sorted by nationalities. The school system, with 43 percent of its 2,953 students bearing Hispanic surnames, has 16 bilingual teachers and, at one school, requires English-speaking students to take 45 minutes of Spanish daily.
Police Chief Carl P. Verrastro, who has hired two Hispanic officers and keeps a Berlitz dictionary at hand, speaks of the "culture shock" his 58 officers go through in a hybrid village, with its mix of ethnic backgrounds and patches of wealth and poverty.
"An officer may go to one call at a $300,000 home that involves a family dispute," he said. "The next minute you're in the other end of town in a situation you might encounter in the South Bronx."
 
Tension and Exploitation
 Along with the cultural effervescence, the Latinization of the suburbs has brought a host of tensions.
The March mayoral campaign here featured a heated debate about the Central American migrants who come for the spring and summer to tend suburban lawns while living illegally in attics and basements, often in the homes of retired couples. Investigators looking into an apparent vendetta murder involving Mexican immigrants stumbled upon a room that held 10 boarders who slept in shifts on mattresses on the floor, paying $150 a week each.
"I've been told that those conditions are better than they were living in back home," said Chief Verrastro. "But this is America and people shouldn't have to live that way."
Mayor John Branca has ordered a crackdown on illegal dwellings. But Luis Andrew Penichet, president of Westchester County's Hispanic Advisory Board -- 10 percent of Westchester's 875,000 people are Hispanic -- has cautioned him to blame exploitative landlords, not the workers.
An informal labor market reminiscent of longshoremen's shape-ups has sprouted on Poningo Street. Men cluster at one corner waiting for gardeners and building contractors driving by in pickup trucks to offer them a day's work, usually in the homes of Rye and Greenwich. These off-the-books jobs may deprive the state of taxes, but the men can be exploited, too, when some bosses renege on pay.
The influx of immigrants has challenged the village to familiarize immigrants with the tacit codes of the suburbs and to acquaint longtime residents with the immigrants' different mores. Chief Verrastro and leaders of a Hispanic group have developed a short flier to tell immigrants what is and is not considered acceptable -- explaining that public drinking is against the law, for example. At the same time, the police have had to remind some residents that outdoor gatherings, common in tropical countries, are not illegal unless they block the street.
 
'We Came Here to Work'
 "We're loud," says Jose Santos, a 41-year-old Dominican who owns two groceries and recently ran for village trustee. "If we play music, we like the whole neighborhood to hear. We like to have a beer like you have a soda. But we have to understand what are the home rules. If you hit your wife in the country, you can't hit your wife here."
At the same time, some immigrants complain that the police are too quick to arrest them. Frank Barcenes, 37, recently opened Rinconcito Salvadoreno, a narrow Main Street restaurant, so the village's Salvadorans could gather in a clean place with familiar foods, like brown sugar wrapped in corn husks. When a crowd gathered outside his store on July 4, Mr. Barcenes said the police were needlessly rough in breaking them up.
"They were trying to clear the sidewalk, but they were treating people like animals," he said.
Some Americans, says Mr. Barcenes, have misconceptions about the immigrants and why they are here. "We came here to work," he said. "We do not have access to welfare. Most of us came illegally, so we have to work. There's no other way to survive."
Port Chester's Hispanic community grew out of a nucleus of Cubans who fled Fidel Castro's rule in the early 1960s and came here to work at a string of waterfront plants. Though many of those plants have closed, Port Chester's economy would wither without Hispanic workers.
The village's cheap commercial rents have made it a haven for restaurant owners who know that customers will drive into the most raffish neighborhoods for good food. Pearl of the Atlantic, in a secluded spot along the Byram River, serves Portuguese paella, but its chef is Peruvian, a waitress is Bolivian, a dishwasher Salvadoran, and a busboy Honduran.
"I can never find Americans to wash dishes," said the owner, Lucia Carlos, whose parents are from Portugal. "Nobody's going to work for $5 or $6 an hour."
 
Success Through Hard Work
 In politics, the Hispanic residents here have so far exerted little weight. In the village election, fewer than 500 of the 3,500 votes were cast by Hispanic voters, Mayor Branca estimates. Mr. Santos, the grocer, lost his bid for trustee. Mr. Penichet, of the county advisory board, guesses that even many of those who are here legally work at two or more jobs daily and don't consider voting a priority.
For some Hispanic residents, success through hard work has translated into conservatism. Now a citizen, Mr. Rodriguez faults America for its welfare policies. "We are creating a dependent society because the incentive to do something is dead," he said. "Why should I work if I can get a check and food stamps? I have to be stupid."
One feeling that never seems to abate is a yearning to return to the homeland, even if the immigrants' memories include tyrannical political leaders and pay scales of $1 a day. "You cannot get an airplane space for Christmas anywhere in South America," said Roberto Portal, a Peruvian who owns New Horizons Travel. "We go to our country and have the greatest time of our lives, and then we go back to reality."
Still, Port Chester has come to grow on him and other Hispanic immigrants.
"Twenty years ago, if you saw a Hispanic person, you held him and said 'I'm Spanish,' " Mr. Portal said with a laugh. "Now, we are so many that if we see a Hispanic, we go across the street."

GRAPHIC: Photos: For many Hispanic immigrants, the search for opportunities has skirted the cities. Rudy Rodriguez started doing odd jobs in New York City's suburbs.

HEADLINE: Dow Falls 12.01 Points in a Mixed Market

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

 BODY:
Despite several strong earnings reports, the stock market was mixed yesterday. Most leading market indicators rose slightly, but the Dow Jones industrial average fell further from Monday's record high.
"It's a market that is really very stock-specific," said Robert Freedman, chief investment officer for John Hancock Mutual Funds in Boston. "We're still in that trading range we've been in for so long, with an upward bias." 
 As jumpy investors flee companies that issue soft earnings reports, Mr. Freedman said, long-term investors have an opportunity to buy good stocks at low prices. He cited Novell, which makes software that controls computer networks, as an example of a good value. On Tuesday, Novell's stock hit a 52-week low, at 17 5/8, after the company announced that third-quarter earnings would not meet expectations.
 
 
'Quality Company
 "In the long term, it's a quality company, and should do fairly well," Mr. Freedman said. Yesterday, its stock rose 1 1/8, to 19 1/2, in active trading.
With I.B.M. giving back some of the gains it made on Tuesday, falling 1 5/8, to 44, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 12.01 points to close at 3,553.45. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 major stocks fell 1.05 points, to 447.19, but the Nasdaq composite index gained 4.59 points to close at 705.59. Trading was heavy, with 273.1 million shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, compared with 256.8 million shares on Tuesday.
The announcement that Merck would buy Medco Containment Services hurt the Dow but helped the Nasdaq index, as Merck fell 1 3/8, to 30 3/4, and Medco, a Nasdaq issue, gained 4 3/8, to 34 1/8.
After pleasantly surprising investors with improved second-quarter earnings, Eastman Kodak gained 1 3/8, to 52 3/8. MBNA, a credit card issuer, also benefited from a strong second-quarter report. Its stock advanced 2 1/2, to 31.
Du Pont reported that second-quarter profit was up 11 percent, at $537 million, which was below expectations. Its stock slid 1 3/8, to 47 1/4.
But earnings reports did not tell the whole story yesterday. Caterpillar, the manufacturer of construction equipment, fell 1 1/8, to 77 7/8. The stock has declined steadily since its close at 80 1/4 on Friday, as stocks in other companies in the same industry have also fallen. Deere, for example, fell 3/8 yesterday to 64 -- down from 65 1/8 on Friday.
 
 
Earnings Projections Cited
 The reason for the slide in the construction-machinery sector may be because investors have been alarmed by company warnings that there will probably be a decline in third- and fourth-quarter earnings.
Such drops are a normal part of the companies' cycle, because of the seasonal nature of their business, said Karen A. Ubelhart, a senior vice president of Lehman Brothers. This year, the companies were evidently afraid that investors had forgotten that fact.
"They've been worried that people would say, 'There's not going to be a third-quarter slowdown this year because of the economy,' " Ms. Ubelhart said. "And they're saying, 'Oh, yes there will.' "

Silver Prices at 3-Year Highs As Economic Signs Improve

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Silver prices climbed yesterday to their highest levels in more than three years as solid economic news combined with strong supply and demand.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, silver for September delivery jumped 11 cents, to a new intraday high of $5.195 an ounce, before closing 8.5 cents higher at $5.17. 
 "Investment demand is particularly strong for silver, as well as for the other precious metals," said Fred Demler of Paine Webber, who said prices had not been this high since early 1990.
 
Gold Moves Higher
Gold prices also advanced, partly as a result of a threatened South African miners' strike vote next week. August gold rose $2.20, to $393.40 an ounce.
Mr. Demler said the prices of both metals seemed to have broken out of a consolidation phase, after rising sharply earlier this year on inflation fears.
Most recently, currency turmoil in Europe and Russia had created a rush by investors to the safe haven of gold and silver.
Silver prices have shown particular volatility lately, Mr. Demler said, reflecting more balanced supply and demand for silver and its use by many industries.
The unexpectedly strong 3.8 percent rise in durable goods orders for June, which reflects orders for products that last more than three years, helped silver rally, analysts said.
"Underlying industrial demand for silver looks constructive," Mr. Demler added.
For the second consecutive day, soybean prices plummeted on the improved weather forecasts for the rain-soaked Midwest and the drought-stricken Southeast.
August soybeans declined 14 cents, to $6.88 3/4 a bushel; September corn fell 3.25 cents, to $2.41 1/4, and September wheat dropped 5.75 cents, to $3.1575 a bushel.
Oil prices dropped despite a bullish report showing a decline in domestic stocks of crude oil and strong demand for gasoline.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, September oil declined 19 cents, to $18.23 a barrel; August heating oil eased 0.29 cent, to 51.35 cents a gallon, and August unleaded gas dropped 0.55 cent, to 52.39 cents a gallon. September natural gas rose 3 cents, to $2.14 for a million British thermal units.

HEADLINE: Edward Wilson, 84, Ad Agency Officer And a Civic Leader

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Edward G. Wilson, a retired executive vice president of J. Walter Thompson advertising agency and a civic leader, died at home on Saturday. He was 84 and lived in Sharon, Conn.
The cause was cancer, his family said. 
 Mr. Wilson created Thompson's legal department and held numerous posts in the firm as it grew to become the world's largest advertising agency and expanded with the advent of radio and television.
He was general counsel, director, senior vice president, corporate secretary and head of the international division. One assignment, when ad agencies produced broadcast programs, was to preview Walter Winchell's Sunday night radio scripts.
After retiring in 1971, Mr. Wilson devoted much of his time to his alma mater, Earlham College, where he became board chairman.
 
Served on Several Boards
 He was a founding trustee of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists Pension and Welfare Funds, secretary of the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges and an officer of the International Chamber of Commerce. He also served on the boards of State Charities Aid Association, Manhattan Society for Mental Health and the Common Fund.
Mr. Wilson was born in Richmond, Ind. After graduating from Earlham, he started working at Thompson in 1930. After earning a law degree in night classes at New York University, he worked two years for the Donovan, Leisure, Newton & Lumbard law firm, then returned to Thompson.
In World War II he served in the Office of Strategic Services, where he reached the rank of lieutenant, commanded the agency's Cairo station, worked with Gen. William J. Donovan on Asian affairs, and received the Legion of Merit Award.
His survivors include his wife of 60 years, the former Jane Johnson; a son, Edward F., of Kansas City, Mo., and three grandchildren.

Big Japanese Railroad's Stock Will Have An Eager, Built-In Clientele.

BYLINE: By James Sterngold

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
FOR most people who live in Japan's urban areas, the morning-rush-hour ritual involves rail-station employees using fullback-like techniques to squash hapless passengers into cars as the doors squeeze past their errant briefcases, articles of clothing and limbs.
But what the system lacks in comfort, it makes up for as one of the most efficient railroads in the world, which is why the Government's plans to privatize the largest leg of its national rail system in September has drawn a good deal of interest in an otherwise wobbly stock market. 
 After six years of planning and several false starts, Tokyo plans to sell half of the four million shares it owns in the East Japan Railway Company, known as JR East. The first 600,000 shares will be auctioned, and the remaining 1.4 million sold at a fixed price, in one of the largest and most important privatizations in years.
A failure of the JR East offering could badly hurt the overall stock market and damage the Finance Ministry's credibility.
Individual investors driven to the sidelines in the first stages of the stock market's plunge nearly four years ago are expected to be among those purchasing JR East shares.
"If this issue failed, it would be a national crisis," said Jesper Koll, senior economist here with S. G. Warburg Securities. "They are desperate to prove that the Japanese stock market can function in the economic sense, channeling savings to investments."
This is a nation of railroads. Each Japanese travels an average of 1,800 miles a year on the rail, compared with just over 600 miles per Frenchman and 48 miles for each American. Japan's metropolitan regions are remarkably dense, allowing JR East to carry many more passengers than the national railroads of Germany, France, Britain and Switzerland with only a fraction of their employees and far fewer miles of track.
JR East was one of seven systems created when Japan National Railways was broken up in 1987 as it edged toward bankruptcy. It had a long-term debt of 37.2 trillion yen, now equivalent to almost $350 billion.
JR East is the biggest and among the most promising of the new operating units, serving the region from Tokyo north to the top of Honshu, the main island. There are two bullet-train lines, as well as a spider's web of commuter lines running through the Tokyo region.
In the fiscal year that ended on March 31, JR East had pretax profits of 100.9 billion yen, the equivalent of $943 million, and it projects a very small increase this year, to 101.2 billion yen. It also has total long-term debt of more than 5.1 trillion yen -- almost $50 billion.
But the company is heavily regulated, with a virtual monopoly on most routes. The Government can decree its profitability by setting rates.
Robert Rowland, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities here, said that JR East stock could fetch as much as 550,000 yen a share, but that efforts to restrain the price will probably keep it below 400,000 yen. He expects the stock to show solid if unspectacular growth and to benefit from Government support.
The Finance Ministry has already registered its concern for the market's overall health by forcing a number of pension funds it controls to purchase huge numbers of shares of stock.
"It's like buying a utility," Mr. Rowland said. "It's something you buy and hold."
One worry is that the offering may just be too big in a fragile market. It could bring in as much as 600 billion yen, compared with 431 billion yen corporate Japan raised from the issues of all new securities in April, said Jeff Bahrenburg, senior market strategist at Merrill Lynch Japan.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Government Bonds Rise Modestly

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Government bond prices rose modestly yesterday in seesaw trading as the market responded to reports that President Clinton was considering an executive order to control entitlement spending.
The news raised expectations for substantial deficit reduction, helping fuel stronger-than-expected investor demand at the Treasury's auction of new five-year notes. 
 The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond rose 13/32 point, or $4.06 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.65 percent from Tuesday's 6.67 percent.
Bond trading got off to a rocky start after the Commerce Department reported that orders to factories for durable goods jumped by a larger-than-expected 3.8 percent in June.
That raised the possibility that the economy was growing at an inflationary pace, a prospect that worried bond investors. Inflation can erode the value of fixed-income securities.
But bond prices recovered as details of the report emerged, economists said. Excluding a 15.1 percent rise in transportation equipment, orders rose just three-tenths of 1 percent in June, following a 1.8 percent decline in May.
Buying picked up further following the late-morning news of Mr. Clinton's support for an executive order to control mandatory spending, known as entitlements.
A substantial reduction in the Federal deficit would bolster the value of existing bonds because the Treasury could pare its sales of new securities, decreasing supply in the secondary market.
 
A Bullish Tone in Auction
 The bullish tone continued into the Government auction. The Treasury sold $11 billion in five-year notes at a yield of 5.25 percent, well within expectations. The bid-to-cover ratio for the five-year note, a measure of demand that compares the number of bids submitted with those accepted, was 2.77 to 1, better than the 2.60 average of the previous 10 auctions.
But prices began to decline again after the White House softened the tone of earlier reports, saying an executive order is just one of several options President Clinton is considering to control the deficit.
Still, the market maintained a strong tone as investors reasoned that even the threat of an executive order could increase chances for passage of the budget package in Congress.
Short-term Treasuries ranged from 1/16 point to 3/32 point higher, while intermediate maturities rose from 3/16 point to 7/32 point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported.
Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 3.14 percent as the discount dropped 0.02 percentage point, to 3.08 percent. Six-month yields fell to 3.32 percent as the discount fell 0.02 point, to 3.23 percent. One-year yields dropped to 3.58 percent as the discount fell 0.01 point, to 3.45 percent.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 101 6/32 , unchanged from late Tuesday. The average yield to maturity held at 5.82 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of five-year Treasury notes:

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls Against Mark And Softens Versus the Yen

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar fell against European currencies yesterday after a decline in German money market rates diffused pressure within Europe's Monetary System.
It also softened against the yen as former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, President Clinton's choice as ambassador to Tokyo, expressed concern over the American-Japan trade gap. 
 The dollar weakened despite a Bundesbank move to ease credit by allowing a key money market rate to drop. Dealers said the move by the Bundesbank suggested that it would cut its official discount rate, currently at 6.75 percent, by a half-point when it meets on Thursday for its regular council meeting.
"The Bundesbank is almost forced to cut," said Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at BankAmerica in London.
Normally, lower German rates would spur dollar purchases by making mark-denominated assets relatively less attractive. But dealers said the German easing led to a waning of European currency tensions, reducing the dollar's status as a safe-haven currency.
 
Late Trading in New York
The dollar closed at 1.7178 marks in New York, down from 1.7271 marks Tuesday. Earlier in London, the dollar finished at 1.7185 marks versus 1.7250 marks Tuesday.
In comments that pushed up the yen, Mr. Mondale cited the importance of cutting the trade gap with Japan at his Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearing for the post of ambassador to Japan. While there was no direct comment on the dollar-yen relationship, his testimony was seen as supportive of a strong yen, which would tend to ease the trade imbalance.
In reaction, the dollar fell as low as 104.85 yen in New York trading -- just above its record low of 104.80 yen. But the dollar later bounced back to 105.80 yen, still below the 106.10-yen level of late Tuesday.
The French franc and Spanish peseta, lately the target of speculators betting these currencies will be devalued, firmed today on news of easier German interest rates. Softer rates in Germany allow other European countries to lower rates without undermining currency parities.
The British pound rose in New York to $1.4950, above $1.4890 Tuesday.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS: Study in Milken's Name;
Overpaid Executives? Takes One to Know

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
The Milken Institute for Job and Capital Formation said yesterday that Americans cited "corporate executives being paid too much" as a leading cause of job losses.
The institute, a private, nonprofit research group, may seem an unlikely source for assertions that executives are being paid too much money. It is named for its chairman, Michael R. Milken, who in 1987 alone was paid $550 million in salary and bonuses by his former firm, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 
 The Milken Institute says high executive pay remains an "emotionally charged fairness issue that many people fail to look at objectively." It did not elaborate.
The institute describes its aim as "improving economic growth through job creation and capital formation." It released findings yesterday of its second annual jobs survey, which it conducted with Princeton Survey Research.
Mr. Milken transformed the junk bond market in the 1980's. The Government began investigating him in 1986 for possible violations of securities laws.
Mr. Milken pleaded guilty in 1990 to six felonies related to Federal securities law violations. He recently concluded serving a prison sentence in California.
Among other projects, he has talked about starting a cable television network with Michael Jackson, the pop singer.
Mr. Milken hardly needs publicity. He was the subject of at least three books published in the last few years, including "Den of Thieves," a best seller. And Robert De Niro's production company has a movie of Mr. Milken's life in the works, with the Oscar-winning actor talking about playing the lead role.

HEADLINE: ON THE BUS WITH: Merle Haggard;
Under the Growl, a Crooner

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE

DATELINE: ALEXANDRIA, Va.

 BODY:
THE Hag is talking apocalypse. "It's like a war zone coming back here," he says.
"Back here" is the East Coast, and Merle Haggard, the country music legend, has descended from his Northern California ranch to cover it by bus, armed with his guitar. 
 The enemies outside the bus windows are many: traffic jams, overpopulation, immigrants -- those he calls "people that can't speak English, and they look like they're starving to death and they'll take anything from you if they could."
Mr. Haggard has been warning of American decline in his blunt, proud, sometimes inflammatory way since at least 1969. That's when he exploded to fame with "Okie From Muskogee," a nationalistic anthem that frowned on marijuana, hippies, love beads and the 60's Zeitgeist in general.
But that chaos "was just the evening of it all," Mr. Haggard says. "I think we're into the dead of night now." A conversation with Mr. Haggard follows this pattern of oblique, often mixed but clearly foreboding metaphor. "The snowball effect I'm talking about is like if you jump out of an airplane," he says, referring to the nation's accumulating problems. "It's just like, compared to the trip down, the ground rush."
He leans forward with a creased, handsome face and stunning blue eyes. "I think you know what I'm talking about," he says.
After three decades of relentless road and studio work, Mr. Haggard has secured his place in country music history. But his position with his creditors is a bit more precarious.
He is 56, $5 million in debt and mired in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy-protection proceeding. He is feuding with his label, Curb Records, and he hasn't had a new release in three years.
So while younger country artists are enjoying unprecedented wealth and popularity, Mr. Haggard is working state fairs and clubs as small as the Birchmere, a 350-seat folk house here. "Forty-one No. 1 records and $5 million down," he says. "How does that compute?"
Almost 400 singers have recorded his 1969 classic, "Today I Started Loving You Again," but tonight his own version will be marred by a waitress five feet from the stage who barks, "Cheeseburger!"
Although Mr. Haggard's 10-member band is known as the Strangers, it is an odd title for a group that includes musicians who have toured with him for 30 years. Indeed, there isn't a stranger in sight.
He is accompanied on stage by Bonnie Owens, one of his four ex-wives. His son Noel is his warm-up act. Dean Holloway, his childhood chum, and Fuzzy Owen, his first manager, are along for the ride.
Playing 100 venues in a typical year, Mr. Haggard lives about half his life out of his customized bus, the Super Chief. The band travels in theChief, an accompanying bus with nine submarine-style sleeping slots and a bag of pretzels splayed open on the kitchen table beside a huge squeeze bottle of French's mustard.
An air of quaint informality prevails, as Ms. Owens powders her face and Noel Haggard unpacks an iron to crease his jeans. Biff Adam, Mr. Haggard's publicist (also his drummer and bus driver), has forgotten about a scheduled interview, so he drafts Ms. Owens as a stand-in until he can rouse the legend. "Bonnie, tell him something about Merle," he says.
Ms. Owens, a sparkling woman with mustard on her shirt, addresses her transition from wife to supporting vocalist. "It's not a touching relationship," she says. "Sometimes he's like my kid; sometimes he's like my brother."
What's clear is that Mr. Haggard's retinue idolizes him.
"One of the best damn singers in the world," says Norm Hamlett, his steel guitarist, who sports a silver belt buckle that says simply "Hag."
"The best singer," Ms. Owens says.
Mr. Haggard has recorded more than 70 albums and has more No. 1 hits than any country singer besides Conway Twitty. He is a very good guitarist, a great songwriter and a singer for the ages. He is also an old-fashioned bandleader (adept at country jazz and country blues) and an utterly unpredictable performer.
Mr. Haggard will start one song, grow bored and suddenly switch to another, forcing the band to scurry along as his nods call forth solos on fiddle or horn, steel or electric guitar.
Someone once called his show "polished." Mr. Haggard was insulted.
The core Haggard collection includes not just "Okie" but songs like "The Fightin' Side of Me," in which Mr. Haggard complains about "some squirrely guy" who won't fight to defend his country, and "Workin' Man Blues," in which he penned a quintessential line of blue-collar resentment:
"Hey, hey, the workin' man, the workin' man like me/I ain't never been on welfare, and that's one place I won't be."
Many critics have lamented his reputation for right-wing populism, arguing that it has obscured dozens of great songs on other themes. Mr. Haggard sings sentimentally of family, mournfully and mischievously of love and enticingly of adventure -- the Jimmie Rodgers, hop-a-freight-train kind.
He will celebrate the virtues of Mama in one track and those of "Make Up and Faded Blue Jeans" in the next. He can be as sentimental as Norman Rockwell, as rebellious as Woody Guthrie or as jaded as the honky-tonks where many of his songs are situated.
What's consistent is the magic of his voice, which growls one moment, yodels the next and distills down to something pure and sweet and sad, a crooner's croon.
"What you hear is real, lower-class struggle," says Bill Ivey, the director of the Country Music Foundation in Nashville. "You just get the sense that all the history he's absorbed, all the hard living, all the personal struggles -- it just gets focused, through a funnel, into his voice."
Mr. Haggard also has what Mr. Ivey calls "an authentic country music biography," meaning that while Mary-Chapin Carpenter attended Brown University, Mr. Haggard attended San Quentin.
His parents were Oklahoma farmers who moved near Bakersfield, Calif., in 1935, two years before his birth. The family lived in a converted railroad boxcar. His father died when Merle was 9. Mr. Haggard hopped his first freight train a year later, and he hasn't slowed much since.
Starting at age 14, he resided at (and escaped from) a series of increasingly tough penal institutions, where he was sent first for truancy and later for car theft and burglary.
Mr. Haggard was behind bars when each of his first two children was born. His ticket to San Quentin got punched one night when he got so drunk he tried to burglarize a nightclub that was still open. He was 23 when he was paroled in 1960, after serving almost three years.
Mr. Haggard calls himself one of the few people prison has straightened out. But his frank autobiography ("Sing Me Back Home," Times Books, 1981) makes clear that this straightening is a relative matter.
There have been bouts of hard drinking and numerous marital infidelities. There have been his legendary failures to appear at his own concerts. (He once walked out on "The Ed Sullivan Show" because he thought the choreographers were making him look effeminate.)
There has also been violence. Mr. Haggard writes that he was once trying to backhand his first wife when she jumped from a car traveling 60 miles an hour. And that wasn't their worst fight.
So while it might be hard for some artists to sing convincingly of hard times while surrounded by wealth and fame, that doesn't seem to have been a problem for Mr. Haggard.
"Being vocal, disgusted and emotionally drained -- all those things lend themselves to good music," he says.
While the critics may fear that Mr. Haggard's politics drown out his music, he does not seem concerned. When he emerges for a half-hour chat, he seems to have a frank and unflattering phrase for almost everyone.
On immigration: "If we don't stop it, then there's not going to be anything here that people want to come to."
On Japanese investors in northern California: "The people we fought in World War II, remember those people? They're taking over that country up there."
Mr. Haggard denounces President Clinton's plans to close military bases and accept homosexuals in the armed services as so much self-evident nonsense, and, perhaps colored by his own unfortunate finances, he is predicting a global depression.
"Some sort of economic tumble has got to be just around the corner," he says. "I'm talking something big, global, you know."
Angry at George Bush for raising taxes, Mr. Haggard said he probably would have voted for Ross Perot if he was the kind of person who voted. But he is not.
Mr. Haggard was similarly dismissive of contemporary country music. "I don't listen to very much of it," he says, arguing that the airwaves are filled with "drugstore music" that calls itself country just to gain play time.
Garth Brooks? "He's a nice enough boy," Mr. Haggard says. "He's not turning my crank."
Mary-Chapin Carpenter? "I don't know much about her," he says. "I like the way she looks." He does like Alan Jackson, John Anderson and Clint Black.
Mr. Haggard is hoping to patch things up with his record company and have an album out by fall, when he is scheduled to marry for the fifth time. The album, he said, ought to rescue him from his debts, which he blames on both his recording drought and his accountants.
Meanwhile, there is the life of prison, adultery and disarray, and the songs of Mama, prayer and patriotic pride. How to reconcile the two?
"There's the guy I'd love to be and the guy I am," he says. "I'm somewhere in between, in deep water, you know, swimming to the other shore."

Final Workout Ends in Tragedy

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, July 28

 BODY:
Deo Djossou, the forward for the Northeastern University Huskies, arrived at the Celtics' practice gym shortly after 6 P.M. Tuesday evening for a low-key workout with Reggie Lewis, his friend and mentor.
"We must have missed him by 15 minutes," Djossou said today in a somber voice. 
 Lewis, who was the Huskies' career-leading scorer before he moved on to become captain of the Celtics, was shooting baskets with a few current players from his college team when he collapsed and then died.
For the past two summers he had played informal pickup games with the Huskies. But since Lewis collapsed during a playoff game in April, there had been no practices this summer.
 
Ready to Work Out
 "He said he was ready to work out," said Djossou, who said he spoke to Lewis over the weekend. "This would have been the first time this summer."
So Djossou, along with a few teammates and friends, traveled to the gym where the Celtics practice, at Brandeis University in Waltham. At first, when they did not find Lewis, they thought they were late. Then they heard the news.
Today they tried to talk through their grief.
"Reggie was special," said Djossou, who will be a senior this year. "He was encouraging, telling me what I needed to do to progress my game. I was nervous the first time I played with him, but he made me comfortable."
 
'The Whole City Is Quiet'
 "It hurts now," he said. "The whole city is quiet."
Amir Weiss, a 20-year-old junior at Brandeis majoring in economics, said he was playing ball in the Shapiro Gymnasium with a few friends when he saw Lewis collapse at around 5:05 P.M.
"I was shooting hoops on the court next to him and every once in a while I'd take a look over at him," Weiss said. "He seemed to be doing great. He was kidding around, giving high fives, taking 3-point shots.
"He wasn't even sweating," he said, adding that Lewis had someone else running after rebounds. "He was taking it so easy. He wasn't running.
"Next thing I knew I heard this large slurping sound. I turned around and saw Reggie on the floor, trying to breathe. His arms were shaking at his sides."
 
Stunned Players React
 Stunned players left the other courts to gather around Lewis. Some tried to prop him up while others went to call the Brandeis police.
"After a minute or so he simply stopped breathing," said Weiss.
Joseph C. McDonald Jr., the director of public safety at Brandeis, said that the campus police were first alerted at 5:12 that someone had collapsed. A sergeant who was outside the Gosman Athletic Center, where the Shapiro gym is located, responded to the call.
According to a transcript provided by Brandeis, the sergeant radioed the dispatcher at 5:13. A second officer arrived and began to give Lewis mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. The ambulance got there at 5:19, and emergency medical technicians tried to revive Lewis with electric shocks.
 
Worse and Worse
 But Lewis looked worse and worse. Weiss said his eyes had rolled back.
"He looked more like a rag doll than a person," Weiss said. "I kept saying, 'My God, Reggie's dead.' "
McDonald said the rescue workers continued their attempts to revive Lewis before moving him. Lewis arrived at Waltham-Weston Hospital, about five blocks from the gym, shortly after 5:40 P.M. The Brandeis police blocked traffic along the route to the hospital.
After spending 1 hour 50 minutes trying to resuscitate Lewis, doctors pronounced him dead at 7:30 P.M.
Today, Weiss enrolled in a CPR class at the hospital. "There's no way I'm seeing this again as an observer," he said.

Return of Houdini: He Works for Padres

BYLINE: By Murray Chass

 BODY:
Sometimes making players disappear is the most difficult task a general manager has. If Joe McIlvaine, for example, or Al Harazin before him could find a club willing to take Vince Coleman in a trade, he would be a magician of the highest order. Poof, gone is the surly, troublemaking, largely noncontributory left fielder.
Gene Michael, the Yankees' general manager, has earned his magician's wand more than once. A year and a half ago, he traded Steve Sax to the Chicago White Sox when Sax was just beginning a four-year, $12.4 million contract extension. Last August he traded Tim Leary, with one year left on his contract at $1.3 million, to the Seattle Mariners. 
Sometimes the general manager facilitates his disappearing act by agreeing to pay part of the traded player's contract, but it often is a magical feat nonetheless.
The newest prestidigitator among general managers is Randy Smith, at age 30 the youngest at his job in the major leagues. Smith, a rookie general manager as well as a rookie magician, made Bruce Hurst disappear the other day.
Trading a healthy Hurst would have required no sleight of hand. He is a veteran left-hander whom many contending teams would have coveted, indeed did covet, waiting only for him to return to active duty and show that his surgical shoulder was sound.
But Smith didn't wait for Hurst to be healthy. Before a stunned audience of colleagues around the major leagues, he waved his magic wand, and the pitcher instantly disappeared from the San Diego stage and materialized in the Rocky Mountains.
Smith, however, had at least one other trick up his sleeve in performing his act, maybe two.
To induce Smith's former boss, General Manager Bob Gebhard of the Colorado Rockies, to take Hurst, the Padres agreed to continue paying Hurst's salary until he is off the disabled list, where he has been virtually all season. That means the Padres, through today, are responsible for all except $1 million of Hurst's $2.75 million base salary, and their share will continue to grow until he pitches for the Rockies.
Some general managers suspect that Smith used yet another trick. We'll give you Greg Harris, they think he could have told Gebhard, if you take Hurst, too. Harris is the healthy pitcher who was in the five-player trade the teams made Monday.
Healthy or otherwise, Harris and Hurst were the last two high-priced players the Padres wanted to purge from their payroll. They released Kurt Stillwell the next day, but they have to pay the rest of his $1.75 million salary.
So Smith has done the job he was hired to do, the job McIlvaine didn't have the stomach for. Nor the lack of integrity, though that is not to question or malign Smith's integrity because he took the job under different circumstances than McIlvaine.
It is the Padres' owners who should be questioned, no matter what Bud Selig says. Selig, acting head of the major leagues, says Tom Werner is "one of the brightest owners who have come into baseball in years." He also says the Padres' owners can't be faulted for trying to live within their means. Therefore, he said several weeks ago when the team could be salvaged for the fans, he would not even consider taking any action against the Padres to stop them from systematically dismantling their team.
But if Werner is so bright, why did he tell McIlvaine when he hired him less than three years ago he was prepared to do what it took to build a contender? Why did he allow the 1993 media guide to put Gary Sheffield, "Batting Champ," and Fred McGriff, "Home Run King," on the cover? Why did he include in the guide an owners' statement of commitment to make the Padres "contenders for years to come"?
If Werner is so bright, why doesn't he find a buyer for the team who will give San Diego fans what he and his partners have promised but won't -- not can't -- deliver?
The Padres have been able to shed their best players with impunity because the major leagues do not have a commissioner who could have stepped in and halted or at least questioned their actions, as Bowie Kuhn did with Charlie Finley in 1976.
Selig won't act because he himself owns a team in a small market (Milwaukee), he is suffering financially and he feels for the Padres.
Furthermore, the worse the economic situation looks for small-market teams, the stronger their case for getting a greater share of the large-market clubs' revenue. The Pittsburgh Pirates, another small-market club, have done their part in that quest by firing two vice presidents ostensibly because they couldn't afford them. Some baseball people would rather have the examples of the Padres and the Pirates than do anything or criticize them.
The Padres' owners, though, are not without redeeming value. If they sell the team, they could move to Washington and offer their services there. Anybody who can reduce a payroll in less than four months from $24,557,333 to $10,458,333 should be able to do something with the national debt. They're the real magicians.

HEADLINE: A Wise Decision on Steel

 BODY:
It's tempting to criticize the decision by the International Trade Commission to eliminate many of the tariffs that protect American steel producers from foreign competition. After all, the Commerce Department had ruled that many foreign suppliers were violating U.S. trade laws by selling at prices that did not cover their costs -- an injustice the tariffs were designed to correct.
But the criticism is off target. The commission's decision is a model of professional discretion. It carefully sifted the data to determine, as U.S. law requires, whether foreign subsidies and price cutting had injured the large, integrated steel mills that brought the complaints. What the commission found was that in many cases the foreign imports weren't the villain. 
 The large mills have lost business, and racked up huge losses, primarily because of the explosive growth of other American producers -- the minimills that cut costs by using scrap metal and non-union labor. The commission's staff also showed that imported steel often sold at higher prices than American steel because of its high quality or availability.
The commission came down in favor of one set of domestic producers -- the thousands of manufacturers that use steel -- over another, the large integrated mills that sell steel. That was not only the right legal decision but also the best choice for the economy because it will protect the jobs of thousands of American workers in steel-using industries -- everything from baseball cleats to automobile parts. And by lowering manufacturing costs, the commission's decisions will lead to lower prices for millions of consumers.
The rulings were not all bad news for big steel manufacturers. Where the evidence justified it, the commission slapped heavy tariffs on selected products -- such as rust-resistant steel imported from Japan.
The commission's work (despite the "international" in its title, it's a Federal agency) is governed by laws against unfair foreign exports. These laws are hopelessly biased in favor of the domestic industry that brings a complaint. They find unfair price-cutting and domestic injury where none exist. But the evidence in this case couldn't meet even this easy test. The commission honored itself (and helped the economy) by taking each case separately and making decisions on the merits.
The battle over steel tariffs is far from over. The industry took about three nanoseconds to decide to take its case to Capitol Hill, where it hopes to win with politics what it couldn't with economics. Congress and President Clinton will be lobbied hard for quotas that can only hurt steel-using manufacturers, their workers and millions of consumers.
The commission got it right, and Congress ought to leave matters alone.

HEADLINE: Our No. 1 Objective Is to Keep the Yankees in Yankee Stadium;
Let Him Go

 BODY:

To the Editor:
During the John V. Lindsay administration, New York City spent about $75 million to renovate Yankee Stadium. George Steinbrenner now threatens to leave the Bronx because he says the neighborhood is not safe.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo proposes that the $75 million go down the tubes, the city take over the ballpark, do what with is anybody's guess, and the public foot the bill for a new stadium on Manhattan's West Side. 
 New York City and State are in economic and social crisis. It is not the fault of George Steinbrenner, but neither is he the cure. We should take a cue from San Francisco and San Jose, Calif., which said no when the Giants asked for more.
Richard Sandomir's July 13 sports column points out George Steinbrenner pays New York City nothing from his $486 million cable television deal and has not paid $6.1 million in rent for the last three years and $1.6 million in electricity since 1991. Mr. Steinbrenner thinks the city owes him $2.6 million. The Yankees may be playing world class baseball, but it seems to me George Steinbrenner is a world class freeloader. If he does not want to act like a responsible citizen, let him go.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Tandem Reports a $550 Million Deficit in Third Quarter

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON

 BODY:
Tandem Computers Inc. yesterday reported a $550 million third-quarter loss because of charges for a corporate overhaul that will result in the loss of 1,800 jobs in the next year.
Wall Street analysts and industry experts were surprised at the size of the loss and the depth of the restructuring, even though the company had warned earlier this month that a quarterly loss and dismissals should be expected. 
 "This is not unlike I.B.M. and Apple, which went through similar restructurings," said Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, a research firm in Santa Clara, Calif. "All these guys were living with the luxury culture of the 1980's," he said, referring to a period of fat profit margins and growing revenue for computer makers.
Tandem said its entire work force of 10,734 would experience a permanent 5 percent cut in pay and benefits. The company's current round of streamlining will also result in consolidation at Tandem offices throughout the nation. The company already consolidated its manufacturing sites in 1991.
Even without the restructuring charges, Tandem had an operating loss of $44 million in the period, which ended June 30. Revenue fell 5 percent in the period.
Tandem, based in Cupertino, Calif, makes fault-tolerant computer systems, which are designed not to fail even under extreme conditions. Like other computer makers, Tandem is being battered by weak economic conditions, particularly in Europe, and steep price-cutting by competitors and the move away from expensive mainframes.
Last week, Tandem belatedly joined the discounting fray with its new Himalaya systems, which the company says are half the price of its old Cyclone systems and twice as powerful.
The company's quarterly results were hurt by customers who held off making purchases in anticipation of the new product.
James G. Treybig, Tandem's president and chief executive, forecast in a statement that streamlining will return the company to profitability within six months, even assuming only 5 percent revenue growth.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET DEBATE;
Clinton Gives His Tax Plan a Homey Touch

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 29

 BODY:
The flowers were fake, the books borrowed and the stiff poses could have been from "Family Feud." But the faux homey set on a White House stage had a real political purpose: to give a human dimension to President Clinton's fight for an economic plan that is being derided as taxing and spending.
Arrayed in awkward tableaux on sofas, love seats and chairs were three families who described themselves as both working and poor. With coaxing from the President and his wife, Hillary, the families spoke in poignant terms about how a Federal tax credit was helping them escape the depths of poverty. 
 The President has proposed a $28 billion expansion of the earned-income tax credit program, the greatest in more than two decades. A scaled-down version of his proposal now appears almost certain to win favor on Capitol Hill, even while other important elements of his economic plan lie in grave danger.
But the White House also sees the program as carrying the kind of basic appeal that might help to carry the whole plan -- and bitter medicine like higher gasoline taxes -- past its critics. As he stood today with the families from Georgia, Kentucky and Oklahoma, Mr. Clinton said he believed that its intention of lifting every working family with children above the poverty line should be "part of the human creed."
"People who can work, should work," the President said after his guests shared simple stories of using the tax credit to pay overdue bills, buy school clothes and to pay for a used car as transportation to a faraway job. "But if they do work, their families at home shouldn't be poor," he added.
The spectacle today was the most ambitious effort in a new White House campaign using techniques honed by Mr. Clinton in last year's Presidential campaign. But now the talk-show style that helped in selling a candidate are being used in a bid for support for a package whose contents -- like the broad-based energy tax and the earned-income tax credit itself -- are generally known only in arcane terms.
A test of the effort got scant attention on network television news. But the White House, which today released 50 one-page documents in contending that each state would benefit if the tax credit were expanded, appears to be relying even more on its ability to generate favorable local coverage.
 
A Living-Room Setting
 Each of the families had been flown to Washington by the White House, and carpet and upholstered furniture carted in by the General Services Administration transformed a bare wooden stage into the kind of living-room scene used on television interview shows.
The theory, White House officials said, is to win public support for the economic program by trying to tell Americans exactly what it contains.
"People don't know what's in the plan or what it does," one strategist said today in an interview in a "war room" that is being used to coordinate that appeal from the ground floor of an office building across the street from the White House.
As a battle behind closed doors in a Congressional conference committee dwelt on questions like how many more cents Americans should pay for a gallon of gas, the strategist, Ricki Seidman, contended that attention given to those issues had obscured more attractive elements of the economic package.
"This plan will improve people's lives," Ms. Seidman said, expressing a message that Mr. Clinton, top Administration officials and their representatives across the country have repeated in hundreds of interviews, speeches and conversations in recent days as the White House fights to keep the President's economic alive.
Mr. Clinton himself has met individually with at least seven senators and with House Democratic caucuses representing conservative, liberal, black, female and Hispanic lawmakers.
Today's appeal for the plan to expand the earned-income tax credit elaborated on what Mr. Clinton described in his State of the Union Message as a "solemn and simple commitment" to help the millions of Americans who remain in poverty even while holding full-time jobs.
 
House and Senate Versions
 A Clinton proposal approved by the House would provide for a $28.3 billion increase over the next five years in what is now an $11-billion-a-year program to assist the working poor.
The Senate approved an $18 billion version of the plan, which would increase current benefits and expand the number of eligible workers. But White House officials said today that they were confident the Congressional conferees would approve a compromise that would allow the President to fulfill his pledge: that Americans who work 40 hours a week and have a child at home would no longer live in poverty.
For that reason, White House officials conceded today that their purpose in bringing the Risners of Mount Sterling, Ky., the Dorseys of Atlanta and the Dikemans of Tulsa, Okla., to Washington did not reflect any concern about the tax credit's immediate fate.
The officials said instead that they wanted to remind Americans that beyond the abbreviations and acronyms of the budget plan lay a proposal whose billions of dollars in new spending would serve people who worked just as hard as they did but still faced heavy burdens.
As the Clintons listened from a small love seat, Kevin Dorsey, a 31-year-old warehouse manager, said a credit amounting to $800 a year had "opened doors" for his family of four, sitting with him on a couch. And Robin Dikeman, a divorced mother whose son and daughter sat and stood on either side of her armchair, said, "I can honestly say that it is one of the few things that's kept us going."
"This is the real world," Mr. Clinton told the lawmakers and reporters who looked on at the living-room set from seats in the auditorium. "You met it today."

HEADLINE: Man in the News;
A Crusader For Change: Morihiro Hosokawa

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 29

 BODY:
When he was Governor of Kumamoto, a prosperous prefecture on the southern island of Kyushu, Morihiro Hosokawa liked to tell about the time he tried to move a downtown bus stop.
"For an advanced country, this is embarrassing," he told two Americans lingering over coffee in his sunny office one afternoon. "To move the stop a few hundred meters, I had to send a delegation to Tokyo. In Japan, you can't tie your own shoes without official permission." 
 Over the years this story has become a metaphor for his uncommonly harsh critique of his own country. That afternoon he argued that Japan, fattened by wealth and complacency, had surrendered to turf-minded bureaucrats and "politicians who bow at every phone pole rather than think about the broad problems of Japan." What Japan needed, he said, was its own Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a veteran of the system who was willing to shatter it.
This afternoon, in perhaps the oddest twist yet in recent weeks, Mr. Hosokawa was handed that chance. Only 14 months after he started the Japan New Party, he was tapped to become the head of a coalition Government that seems destined to seize power from the Liberal Democratic Party.
By early next month, when Parliament votes, the tall 55-year-old firebrand will be master of every bus stop and telephone pole in the world's second largest economy -- and inheritor of a political system that by his own description has "grown moribund, and out of touch with the realities of the rest of the world."
It is a critique that many Americans will doubtless applaud, and it echoes many of the United States' own complaints. But now that he appears on the verge of coming to power far more quickly that anyone expected, there are already doubts about whether a man who revels in playing the outsider can achieve what he calls the "third opening of Japan."
The first was brought about by the arrival of the American fleet in the 1850's, the second by the Occupation forces, who ran Japan when Mr. Hosokawa was a teen-ager. This one, Mr. Hosokawa says, Japan will have to do on its own.
It will not be easy. Even before Mr. Hosokawa steps into the Prime Minister's residence, many in Tokyo suspect he is being set up to fail. Inexperienced in the ways of the capital, he may prove an easy target for the powerful bureaucrats whom he has lambasted. The party he once belonged to, the Liberal Democrats, will be waiting for his fragile coalition of Socialists and conservatives to splinter, looking for its chance to regain a grip on the nation few thought it would ever lose.
 
An Unknown Quantity
 In a country that warms to predictability, Mr. Hosokawa is an unknown quantity, chosen by the coalition precisely because he appears untainted by an endless stream of corruption and influence-peddling that has tarred most of the other leaders.
The direct descendant of a famous family of shoguns, Morihiro Hosokawa was born on Jan. 14, 1938, in another era of political chaos. At the time his maternal grandfather, Fumimaro Konoe, was Prime Minister, advocating a reduction in the West's influence in Asia and the rise of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.
Historians still argue over whether Mr. Konoe was a moving force behind the invasion of China and the militarist policies that led to Pearl Harbor, or whether he was manipulated by the military. But his name was high on the list of those the United States sought to put on trial as war criminals. He killed himself just before he was supposed to enter custody.
If there is a lesson from his grandfather's experience as Prime Minister, Mr. Hosokawa wrote last year in Japan's leading intellectual magazine, Bungei Shunju, it was simple. "If you raise your voice," he said, "you must raise it clearly."
 
12 Years in Parliament
 In a journalistic and political career that spans 30 years, Mr. Hosokawa has usually followed his own advice -- until recent weeks, when he has said surprisingly little about the political upheaval beneath his feet.
A graduate of Sophia University, he went to work in 1963 for Japan's most liberal newspaper, the Asahi Shimbun. He was a conspicuous presence even then: A friend from that time remembers that Mr. Hosokawa drove a Volkswagen, wore expensive suits, and kept houses in Kyoto and the resort town of Karuizawa, high living for a reporter.
But he soon quit the job for politics, running under the Liberal Democratic flag for the less-powerful upper house of Parliament. He won at age 33, and spent the next 12 years in the Parliament, serving in second-tier posts. He later recalled watching the system at work, with legislators "mere tools of Government agencies, constantly trying to reflect the ideas of bureaucrats in party decisions."
"I was appalled," he concluded.
He returned to Kumamoto, where the Hosokawa daimyo, or fief, had lasted from 1632 to 1868. Elected Governor in 1983, he quickly gained a reputation for energy -- he competed in a nationwide ski contest for the prefecture -- and for economic development. The area's rice fields are now dotted with technology parks and semiconductor plants. But he also found himself constantly at battle with the Government, which he described as "even more reactionary and absolutist than the premodern, feudalistic system of the shoguns."
His big break with the party, however, came last year, after the mounting frustrations of serving on a Government panel charged with streamlining Japan's administrative system. He watched helplessly as the Ministry of Finance watered down a key recommendation to create a Security and Exchange Commission to crack down on stock fraud.
 
Election Successes>
 Soon he decided to create the Japan New Party, vowing to end one-party rule, to bring more women into politics, to clean up corruption and to offer a reasonable alternative to opposition parties like the Socialists that have "addled and grown rigid with age."
He talked vaguely of a new age of relations with the United States, a place he clearly admires. Like many in Japan's elite classes, he has sent his children to the United States for education.
The New Party scored modestly in upper house elections last summer, when he spoke often and fervently, but rarely to very large crowds. That has begun to change. In recent months the party has blossomed, scoring impressively in Tokyo elections and then in the contest on July 18 for the lower house. It won 35 seats, and merged forces with another group of Liberal Democratic Party dissidents. One of the most tireless campaigners was his wife, Kayoko.
Inevitably, Mr. Hosokawa has begun to face criticism along the way. An aide who was forced out of the party recently portrayed him as a minor tyrant, and many have complained that he recruited inexperienced candidates who are bound to lose after the party's novelty wears off. At times he seemed too close to the old-line politicians.
In May he wrote that it would be "tantamount to a suicide" for his party to collaborate with the forces being gathered by former Finance Minister Tsutomu Hata and by Ichiro Ozawa, perhaps the country's most powerful politician. But this week, saying it was the only way to bring about a change of government, he announced the collaboration, leading to his selection as the man to stand for the premiership.

HEADLINE: COALITION IN JAPAN NAMES NEW LEADER TO BECOME PREMIER

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 29

 BODY:
A conservative populist who has promised to reduce the intrusive role of government in the Japanese economy was all but assured today of becoming the country's first non-Liberal Democratic Prime Minister in 38 years when he was chosen to lead a coalition of opposition parties.
The selection of Morihiro Hosokawa, a descendant of feudal lords who at 55 would be the second-youngest Prime Minister in the postwar era, is expected to be formalized at a special session of Parliament beginning next week. 
 "The leaders of the seven parties have made this decision, so I humbly will comply with this divine mission," said Mr. Hosokawa.
 
Two Months of Change
 Today's decision capped two months of the most drastic change in recent political history and started the industrial world's most conservative country on a slow journey toward a more open economy, greater support for consumers and a more active international role, all goals that the United States has pushed in recent years.
The decision would install a sort of rainbow coalition of conservatives and Socialists whose policy differences have been papered over so they can achieve their principal shared aims -- to unseat the discredited Liberal Democrats and reform the corrupt electoral system.
Beyond those goals there is great uncertainty over the speed of any changes, in particular because some proposed policies are expected to face fierce resistance from bureaucrats.
 
'Beginning of the Beginning'
 "This is the beginning of the beginning of something," said Haruo Shimada, an economics professor at Keio University and an adviser to Mr. Hosokawa's Japan New Party. "It's part of an important learning process for all Japanese. We've chosen to change the power structure. Now we have to think about what we want the new Government to do."
He added: "In the short-term, I don't think there'll be much change. It may take at least 5 or 10 years to tackle some of these problems."
Former Liberal Democrats make up the core of the coalition. Mr. Hosokawa's main rival for the premiership was Tsutomu Hata, who led a wave of defections by three dozen Liberal Democrats last month.
The coalition's composition has prompted some to question how different the group's policies will really be. Mr. Hosokawa's reformist credentials rely on the fact that he took the risk of leaving the Liberal Democrats to mount his challenge 14 months ago, when the party still looked unassailable.
The first two items the new Government is expected to tackle are a budget including a heavy jolt of spending to lift the economy from its stubborn recession, and legislation to end corporate political donations and reshape the electoral districts.
The coalition promised that it would generally preserve current foreign and security policies, but in one highly symbolic departure, said it intended to open a new era in relations with the rest of Asia by confronting the memories of World War II and offering for the first time a full apology for the suffering caused by Japanese aggression.
Beyond that, however, lies great uncertainty. Mr. Hosokawa, a former Governor of prosperous Kumamoto prefecture in southwestern Japan, is a man of modest national political experience who has already reversed his policies several times in his quest for the premiership.
He said earlier that he would lift the ban on rice imports, an issue with great symbolism here, but the coalition opposes that position.
 
Abandoning Past Policies
 He will be leading conservatives who have insisted they will abandon years of favoring big business joined with Socialists who have promised to abandon decades of resistance to Japan's military and its nuclear power plants.
This disparity in basic views has led to widespread expectations that the new government will falter in its attempts to enact some of its major programs and thus will be forced to call new elections within a year.
Many business leaders have supported the nascent two-party system, despite their huge financial support for the Liberal Democrats, and have tacitly approved to the coalition. But they are already indicating that they want results rather than vague statements and too heavy a focus on electoral reform as an end in itself.
"People are talking too much about political reform," said Minoru Murofushi, president of Itochu, one of Japan's largest trading companies. "It is important, but we need economic recovery more."
Until this morning, it looked as if the coalition might be led by Mr. Hata, a former Finance Minister. His defection from the Liberal Democrats last month brought about the downfall of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and eventually resulted in the party's loss of a parliamentary majority.
 
Hata Passed Over
 Mr. Hata, head of the conservative Japan Renewal Party, is expected to have a large voice in the coalition's policies. But he was reportedly passed over for the top post because he and his chief lieutenant, Ichiro Ozawa, are perceived as having been too closely aligned with the most powerful and corrupt faction of the Liberal Democrats.
Mr. Ozawa in particular suffers from a damaging taint because, though he has been charged with no wrongdoing, he was the protege of Shin Kanemaru, the party's former kingmaker, who went on trial for tax evasion last week.
Nonetheless, Mr. Ozawa is expected to play a key, if quiet role, and some credit him with having masterminded the remarkable sequence of events that, in the span of two months, turned Japanese politics on its head.
"It's really up to Ozawa," Mr. Shimada said when asked about the prospects of a tax cut. "He's controlling everything behind the scenes."
The coalition also includes the Clean Government Party, which is affiliated with a Buddhist organization; the Harbinger Party, composed of recent Liberal Democratic defectors, and several small centrist groups.
The coalition has laid out policies that could, over time, have a major impact on the economy and on society.
 
Tax Changes Promised
 In the economic sphere, it said it would introduce a package of government spending programs to stimulate the wobbly economy and consider reducing individual taxes.
It has promised to ease the heavy regulations under which the economy labors and to decentralize the government. And it endorses a major effort to ease trade frictions with the United States, and thus, by implication, to take steps to reduce Japan's huge trade surpluses.
The political reform plan would create a hybrid electoral system in the lower house of the Parliament. Currently, anywhere from three to six representatives are elected from each district, which often pits members of the same party against each other.
Under the proposal, about half of Parliament would be made up of representatives from single-seat constituencies, and the rest elected by proportional representational along party lines.
Equally important, the coalition proposed banning corporate campaign contributions, introducing public election financing and stiffening penalties for violations of election laws. It is believed that this could help build a two-party system and introduce policy debates to election campaigns.
"You have to keep in mind that what we are creating is a framework for political debate," said Kazuo Aichi, a central policymaker in the Japan Renewal Party. "It's not unlike your Democrats and Republicans."

HEADLINE: At the Bar;
After the Deluge, Midwest Lawyers Are Offering Free Ports in a Gathering Legal Storm.

BYLINE: By David Margolick

 BODY:
The lovingly restored law office of F. Coulter de Vries, in what was once a warehouse in Kansas City, Mo., recently sat under several feet of the Kaw River and Turkey Creek, two tributaries of the swollen Missouri River. His files were waterlogged, his furniture floating, his computers saturated with silt and sewage.
"There was brown slime everywhere," he said. "An inch of mud covered the carpeting. And you could tell that everything had floated for a while." 
 Lawyers generally favor either high-rise office buildings or the high ground adjacent to county courthouses or high-rent districts far from flood plains. So Mr. de Vries notwithstanding, they may not have been victimized by the floods in the Midwest in proportion to their numbers. But as the eight states within the newly declared Federal disaster area prepare to dig out and dry out, lawyers there are pitching in.
For the past dozen years, the Young Lawyers Division of the American Bar Association has contracted with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide free legal assistance to disaster victims. Through Hurricane Hugo and the San Francisco area earthquake in 1989, and during the Los Angeles riots in the spring of 1992, its efforts were modest. But things intensified last August in Florida, when, along with everything else, Hurricane Andrew left a host of legal worries in its wake.
Must one pay rent on a home transformed into a pile of sticks? Must a Miamian pay his bills on time when his checkbook floats somewhere in the Gulf of Mexico? Is a contractor liable when his work fails to withstand acts of God? About 2,000 lawyerscounseled thousands of fellow Floridians on such problems. And now, just as many lawyers in Iowa, Missouri and half a dozen other states are gearing up to do the same thing.
Lest the program degenerate into well-organized ambulance chasing, the rules are clear: All services are free; any fee-generating cases are sent to lawyer referral networks, which farm out clients to lawyers not participating in the program.
It is the kind of effort more likely to excite Charles Kuralt than Jay Leno, whose recent swipes at the bar association led Michael Scanlon, its public relations czar, to complain to the comedian. (He got an apology, plus an invitation to the "Tonight Show."
"No one is making a buck out of this," said Dirk Behrends of the Young Lawyers Division, who is the administrator of the program.
The deeper the water, the more intense the lawyers' efforts.
Martha Fagg, a Des Moines lawyer who is coordinating the disaster program in Iowa, said plans are under way to hold seminars for flood victims in Davenport, Denison, Burlington, Waterloo, Maquoeketa and several other cities, with eight to 10 lawyers participating in each. Many volunteers are in Cedar Rapids today for a seminar on flood-related legal issues, organized by the Legal Services Corporation of Iowa. What they learn will enable them to field questions at FEMA disaster assistance centers and over a toll-free hot line.
The calls are already coming. A riverboat captain unable to ply his trade in the swollen waters wants to know if he is eligible for unemployment benefits. A homeowner wants to know if the city can be stopped from pumping water onto his property. A parent complains that a day care center unable to take her child because of the flood is nonetheless dunning her for its services. There have been 30 such calls so far, fewer than Dennis Groenenboom, executive director of the legal services office, expected.
"In many parts of the state, people are still bailing out," he said. "They haven't got past the point of figuring out where they're going to eat, where they're going to live, where they're going to get water." He expects the legal storm to set in months after the meteorological one has subsided.
In Missouri, lawyers are working at 26 disaster application centers. Their presence, said Rick Morefield of Kansas City, the Young Lawyers representative in the state, will spare Missouri the kind of portable law offices that sprouted up like toadstools amid the detritus in Florida.
One lawyer who will not be participating is Mr. de Vries, who is too busy setting up a new law office -- on higher ground -- and helping paying clients deal with the damage.
At the same time, he is busy salvaging what he can from his old office. He is getting help from one of his clients, American Catastrophe and Environmental Services Inc., which cleaned up the hotels, palaces and government buildings of Kuwait after the Persian Gulf war. Also assisting are his three young daughters, who are squeegeeing soggy files, then blow-drying them.
"We've already gotten everybody tetanus shots, and we're going to have to iron some of the documents," Mr. de Vries said. "But we've got everything saved."

HEADLINE: C.I.A. Official Sees Cuba in Crisis

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 29

 BODY:
Riven by food shortages and economic hardship, Cuba is suffering its worst political crisis in 30 years, a senior Central Intelligence Agency official said today.
"Castro's Government is in acute distress," the official, Brian Latell, the C.I.A.'s top analyst of Latin American affairs, said at a rare open meeting of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. "The impact of the economic crisis on the populace has been devastating." 
 Cuba's economy is half what it was four years ago, the sugar harvest is the worst since 1963 and next to no money remains to import basic consumer goods, Mr. Latell said. Half the workers lack steady jobs, food shortages are causing malnutrition and disease, fuel shortages leave Havana without power for up to 16 hours a day and public transportation has all but collapsed, he said.
President Fidel Castro legalized the use of United States dollars in Cuba on Monday, intending to provide a measure of economic relief by spurring foreign investment and tourism. But the C.I.A. analyst said that would only aggravate social and political tensions because relatively few Cubans would receive dollars from relatives in the United States.
Quoting Ricardo Alarcon, the President of the Cuban National Assembly, he called such changes "feeding a Trojan horse."
A central question for the United States, which spent considerable energy in the 1960's trying to overthrow the Cuban Government and assassinate Mr. Castro, is whether try to help Cuba, or try to speed Mr. Castro's collapse.
"What is our vision of a post-Castro Cuba?" asked the chairman of the intelligence committee, Senator Dennis DeConcini, Democrat of Arizona. "What can we do to assist in bringing about a successful transition without violent eruptions and social upheaval?"

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Bonn's Rate Stance Is Blow to Currency Union

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, July 29

 BODY:
The foundations of European monetary union seemed gravely threatened today after Germany's central bank left a key interest rate unchanged, deciding that defending the mark from domestic inflation was more pressing than trying to help ease the recession in France.
Since France and Germany, the European Community's two strongest economic powers, had hoped to firmly establish the monetary union by the end of the century, it had been expected in Paris and elsewhere that the political importance of the two countries' alliance would outweigh parochial concerns about whether German inflation rose by a fraction. 
 Thus, for more than a week, it had been anticipated that the German bank, the Bundesbank, would lower its discount rate -- even though its leading officials had repeatedly made clear that defending the value of the mark against inflation was their foremost concern.
 
Unchanged at 6.75 Percent
 But late today, the Bundesbank decided to leave the discount rate, the lending rate to Germany's most creditworthy commercial banks, unchanged at 6.75 percent.
Instead, with little public comment after today's meeting -- its last before a month's vacation -- the bank's central council announced that a second interest indicator, the Lombard rate, which acts as a ceiling on money-market rates, would be lowered half a point, to 7.75 percent from 8.25 percent
To some, this seemed akin to throwing a dry bone into a two-week feeding frenzy of speculation against the franc on currency markets. In late trading today in New York, the French currency traded at 3.4237 to the mark, sinking near its established floor of 3.4305 to the mark, in Europe's grid of exchange rates. This was down from 3.4040 francs to the mark before the Bundesbank's announcement.
The weakening franc prompted the Bank of France to buy francs and sell marks to prop up its currency with the aid of other central banks.
The price of gold soared above $400 an ounce yesterday for the first time in about three years as growing concern that the European Monetary System might fall apart sent investors rushing to buy precious metals. In New York, spot gold settled at $397.80 an ounce, up $4.40, after trading as high as $401. [Page D14.]
The German discount rate is critical because it sets a floor on short-term interest rates both at home and in other countries like France whose currencies are closely tied to the mark. Despite step-by-step reductions that have brought this rate down over the last year, the Bundesbank has been reluctant to cut it faster because of a wave of inflation set off by record government and private borrowing to finance the very high costs of rebuilding the formerly Communist eastern part of Germany, which was reunited with the west in 1990.
 
Mechanism in Trouble
 Now, "the odds of a European Exchange Rate Mechanism realignment or collapse have risen sharply," said Kermit L. Schoenholtz, chief analyst for Salomon Brothers International in London.
Other analysts agreed. "The Exchange Rate Mechanism is going to find it incredibly difficult to survive," a Merrill Lynch economist, Darren Williams, said.
Their advice was, in effect, that clients should sell francs and other European currencies tied to the mark and hold marks or still other currencies. The American dollar quickly rose to more than 1.73 marks, its highest level in 22 months, from 1.7185 late Wednesday.
If investors spur a selloff of francs on Friday, the Bundesbank, which has bought billions of francs in recent weeks to try to shore up the French currency, is expected to join the Bank of France in doing so again.
But if the selling continues because people think that the French will be forced to devalue anyway, they may have to accept either a devaluation of the franc against the mark or suspend the franc temporarily from the European Monetary System. The system, a network of closely linked currencies, was designed to be the forerunner to a single European currency.
There was no immediate reaction to today's German decision in Paris, where President Francois Mitterrand and the conservative Prime Minister, Edouard Balladur, have vowed to keep the franc strong against the mark.
Confident of support from the Germans, Mr. Balladur said earlier this month that there would be a change of government before there would be a change in the value of the franc, and on Monday in London, Mr. Mitterrand predicted that "in a few years from now, we will have a single currency."
This Government policy led the Bank of France to sharply raise its short-term interest rate last Friday, to 10 percent from 7.75 percent. The move was intended to show currency speculators that Paris would not be bullied into devaluing the franc against the mark, even though higher interest rates were the last thing that it needed in the current European recession.
These steps and the policy itself also symbolized Mr. Mitterrand's determination to press on to monetary union even though most German bankers privately believe that it will not be achieved until sometime in the next century.
 
Looking to Bundesbank
 The Bundesbank's president, Helmut Schlesinger, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl have repeatedly expressed the view that no fundamental economic factors justified a devaluation of the franc, but what the markets were looking for today was to see whether the German central bank would put its money where its mouth was and lower short-term rates by half or even a whole percentage point, to get the franc off the hook.
Instead, it did what it has nearly always done and put the mark first. Now, depending on what happens on the currency markets, the French authorities may have to choose between devaluing their currency against the mark or suspending their membership in the European Monetary System.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET DEBATE;
Fear Is Rife in Capitol As the Tax Figures Fly

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 29

 BODY:
The papers keep writing that a handful of wise and crafty lawmakers are closeted this week in big mahogany-slathered rooms in the Capitol, bifocals on and ties askew, reworking President Clinton's economic package to meet Congress's practical political needs. Literally, this is true.
But something altogether different is also going on. The mahogany doors have been closed for two weeks now without results, and fear is mushrooming among the political animals outside; rumor is riot, and everyone smells the annual August recess, now eight days distant, the way long horns smell water in cattle-drive westerns. 
 And so the deliberative process of producing a budget compromise has lost much of its deliberation, and all its privacy. The whole Congress has elbowed its way in -- at least, all 314 Democrats have -- and the craft of legislation has become equal parts Istanbul bazaar, World Wrestling Federation and London during the blitz, waiting for the bombs to fall.
Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Chicago, the head of the House budget negotiators, is asked where the Senate negotiators, led by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, stand on the issues.
 
A Temper Restrained
 "I don't know where the Senate is!" he barks, then catches himself. "I mean, physically, I don't know where the Senate is."
He is asked whether the Senate would pass a 6.5-cent increase in the gasoline tax if it was included in the economic package.
"They can't pass anything!" He catches himself again, and pins that opinion on the Senate. "That's what they say. I don't know."
No one knows. That is what has made these talks over Mr. Clinton's proposal to raise $250 billion in new taxes and cut $250 billion in spending over the next five years so wrenchingly difficult, and so dangerous for the President.
Presented with a vacuum in consensus, Democrats of every stripe are rushing to fill it with propositions of their own, based on everything from lengthy analysis to undiluted politics, and frequently in direct conflict.
Delicate alliances, toothpick-and-glue affairs built with months of persuasion, begin to fragment under the weight of anxiety and public pressure.
On the crucial question of a gasoline tax -- a big-ticket money-raiser whose revenue binds the entire economic package together, like mayonnaise in a tuna salad -- the deterioration is almost visible.
When House Democrats approved their version of the package in May, they voted for a broad-based energy tax that included a 7.6-cent-a-gallon tax increase on gasoline and would cost an average family nearly $15 a month.
Today Congress was gossiping about the prospect of a 6.5-cent gas tax increase, costing an average driver perhaps $3.50 a month, and was balking at that.
 
Counting Drivers' Dollars
 Representative Bill Richardson, a New Mexico Democrat who is one of the House leadership's most energetic vote-counters, called that figure "saleable."
But Representative Charles W. Stenholm of Texas, who voted for the energy tax in May, now calls the 6.5-cent gas tax a "middle-income tax," and predicts that the House would reject it.
Over in the Senate, Herb Kohl, a first-term Democrat who faces a potentially difficult re-election battle, voted for that chamber's 4.3-cent gas tax in June. Now he looks at 6.5 cents -- an extra buck and a quarter a month, for average drivers -- and blanches. "Above 4.3, I would not be able to vote for it," he says.
Back in the House, Representative Kweisi Mfume, a Maryland Democrat and an influential liberal, strolls into an ornate hallway to promote another idea. He would raise the tax rate on corporate income to 36 percent from 34 percent -- a point above the current proposal -- and use the proceeds to lower the gas tax and finance social programs.
Mr. Rostenkowski hears that and erupts, knowing that would drive conservatives away in droves. "The corporate rate is agreed to!" he snaps, and walks into House Speaker Thomas S. Foley's office.
 
Heavy Courting by Clinton
 So it went all day, one lawmaker floating a tax increase that affronted another lawmaker's stance on the need for balance between taxes and spending, that upset still another lawmaker's political necessities -- all linked, and none alterable without changing everything else.
There are two ways to break this gridlock. Mr. Clinton has been trying one this week, courting recalcitrant lawmakers with private visits in the Oval Office, pledges of future assistance and blandishments from other celebrities in the Administration.
One holdout Democrat, Representative David Minge of Minnesota, said he believes the White House is collaring his local political backers and asking them to lobby on the White House's behalf.
To persuade Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona to switch from "no" to "yes," the President not only dispatched Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt -- a fellow Arizonan and a logical choice -- but Secretary of State Warren Christopher as well.
The other way is being practiced by Mr. Rostenkowski and Mr. Moynihan, who truly do gather in mahogany-slathered rooms, bifocals on noses, and grind away at the numbers with their cadres of aides.
 
'I Am Not Nervous'
 Mr. Moynihan has been visibly gloomy about the pace of events lately, but today he was mum. Asked whether he was nervous about a Senate defeat, he sniffled, fingered a package of decongestants, and evaded. "I am not nervous," he replied. "I am a man preoccupied with the question of how you get a cold in July. And what the hell is Coricidin D?" With that, he stalked into an elevator.
But Mr. Moynihan and his fellow bargainers are nervous.
"You want to think you're making all the decisions for good policy reasons," said Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia, an earnest Democrat who is that chamber's chief negotiator on health-care spending. "In fact, decisions are being driven by another reason: mathematics. And some decisions are being driven by another kind of mathematics -- the ratio of spending to spending cuts."
 
'A Few Nicks, That's All'
 Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, a fiscally more conservative and even more earnest Democratic Senator, was derisive of the process in a different way. "The mood of the country is to cut expenditures," he said during a ride from the Capitol to his office on one of Congress's toy subway trains. "The leadership tells us we'll have a chance to cut when the appropriations bills come up for a vote. We all know what's going to happen on the appropriations bills -- nothing, a few nicks, that's all."
His argument was that coalitions of politicians are always at the ready to spend more money or protect existing programs, but rarely to cut programs or raise taxes. "They just voted $94 million this week," he said, "for a courthouse I didn't even ask for, in Omaha."
That is a truism, of course. But rarely has it seemed truer than this week, when Messrs. Rostenkowski, Moynihan and Clinton are trying to push, drag and seduce their party into approving what is, by most accounts, the largest tax increase and spending cut in any Government's history.
Can they do it? "Miracles can happen," said Representative William O. Lipinski, like Mr. Rostenkowski a Chicago Democrat from a strongly ethnic neighborhood.
But Mr. Lipinski voted no on the package in May, and so far, he said today, nothing had persuaded him to change his mind.
