HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Listening for A Scary Word: Depression

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
War and peace caught traders' attention last week, but the growing evidence of a deteriorating economy may yet have a bigger impact on securities prices.
"People have basically not concentrated on the domestic problems," said Stanley Shopkorn, a vice chairman and chief equity trader at Salomon Brothers. "They should." He is bearish, and thinks even a short and successful war would produce only a brief rally in stocks. 
 There are signs that the government officials with the most responsibility for dealing with financial problems are getting scared. Last week, L. William Seidman, the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said that while there are problems, the banking industry "is not, however, in a situation like the Great Depression, or anything like that magnitude."
Sometimes, more can be learned about what is going on from what officials choose to deny than from what they affirm. Not long ago, a statement that the difference between the 1930's and now was only one of "magnitude" would have been unthinkable.
Then on Friday, The New York Times reported that Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, really would have liked the Fed to ease credit more quickly, but had allowed other Fed policy makers to keep policy tighter for too long. It is unusual, to say the least, for word to leak that a Fed chairman has not controlled monetary policy, and sounds suspiciously like a man seeking to avoid blame for a situation that is deteriorating far more rapidly than he ever expected.
The big question this time around is not whether the Fed should have started to ease a month or two sooner than it did, but whether the easing will work at all. "A depression is not a more severe case of a recession," says Ray Dalio, an economist who runs the Bridgewater Group, a money management firm. "It is an entirely different phenomenon."
In a depression, says Mr. Dalio, Fed easing does no good. The Fed can bring down interest rates and with them the cost of servicing debt, but incomes fall even faster and "you have self-reinforcing credit problems."
Mr. Dalio thinks this is a depression, but concedes he could be wrong. It is certainly a minority view among economists. The signs to watch, he says, will be whether the economy shows signs of responding to the Fed easing, and whether the savings rate starts to pick up. In the past, savings rates have risen in recessions and fallen in depressions.
Short-term interest rates tend to fall in both recessions and depressions, and are doing so now. with Treasury bill rates nearing 6 percent. The drop was accelerated last week by a flight to safety, which also sent the Dow Jones industrial average down 64.60 points, to 2,501.49.
This week, with Tuesday's deadline for an Iraqi pullout looming, the Mideast news may again dominate the market. But eventually traders will again focus on the economy, and its implications for corporate profits. They may not like what they see.

HEADLINE: Aquino's New Chief of Staff Is Raising Hopes in Manila

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANILA

 BODY:
The young and energetic Oscar Orbos, newly appointed executive secretary to President Corazon C. Aquino, is expected to work varying miracles on behalf of a faltering administration facing severe economic difficulties.
In his new job, which is sometimes called "the deputy presidency," he is Mrs. Aquino's John H. Sununu, in charge of coordinating the entire range of Government policy. 
 Mr. Orbos, a 39-year-old lawyer and former Congressman from Pangasinan Province in central Luzon, first came to general attention after a coup attempt in December 1989, which nearly succeeded. He was brought into the Cabinet, its youngest member, as Transportation Secretary, where he gained a quick reputation for action by displacing some vendors and getting traffic to flow a bit better on Manila's main streets.
Such an achievement was so unusual that some of Manila's multitude of columnists, always in search of something fresh, however diaphanous, started promoting him for the presidency.
 
Advice From Columnists
 In December 1990, after a confusing and badly coordinated effort to raise the prices of petroleum products held Mrs. Aquino up to further ridicule, she dismissed her longtime executive secretary, the drab Catalino Macaraig, and installed Mr. Orbos.
Columnists immediately started giving him advice. They suggested that his 7 A.M.-to-2 A.M. workdays would lead to burnout in a job that is impossible anyway.
In conversation, Mr. Orbos, universally known as Oca, has a better grasp of what is possible. Mrs. Aquino became President in 1986 saying she was only a housewife and could offer sincerity, honesty and her best efforts. Mr. Orbos promises little more.
But besides integrity and a "leaner, more efficient government," he does promise decisiveness, a quality that critics of Mrs. Aquino say she lacks.
"People say we need more leadership, and I agree," Mr. Orbos said. "But I don't think our problems will be resolved by 1992," when Mrs. Aquino's term ends and nationwide elections are to take place. "We're getting into rough seas. We're there already."
 
Urgency Called Lacking
 With a recession coming, a battle with the International Monetary Fund over deficits and economic restructuring, a possible war in the Persian Gulf and a consistently uneasy military, Mr. Orbos said, "the whole country needs to feel a sense of urgency we don't frankly feel."
Filipinos spend too much time "blaming others," whether the United States, the International Monetary Fund or someone else, he said, "or they look to the same forces to move the heavens and save us."
"We don't look to ourselves sufficiently," he said over a late dinner, with two more appointments yet to keep. "We have to realize we have only ourselves to depend on primarily. But I firmly believe we can pull it together and share the sacrifice in these rough seas."
It will be difficult, he admits, with only 16 months before the May 1992 elections, which Mrs. Aquino says she will not contest. At the moment, every office in the land will be at stake on the same day, and about half those in the 23-member Senate have talked about running for President. Potential candidates include the Senate President, Jovito Salonga, and the Speaker of the House, Ramon Mitra Jr.
So statesmanship is not likely to prevail in Congress, Mr. Orbos conceded. "But I told my colleagues in the House: 'Let's not belittle what we have. Let's not throw the onus all on the executive. Let's have more help from everyone.' "
 
Buying Time for Aquino
 Did they listen? Mr. Orbos smiled and shrugged. "Well, if they're looking for old patterns of politics here, they'll be sadly mistaken," he said. "Many ordinary people hate all this posturing for the presidency in the midst of this crisis. If Congress won't help, we'll go around them and rally the people."
Yet some diplomats suggest that Filipinos' expectations of this Government's being able to make a difference in their lives has fallen so low that it would be difficult to rally them now in great numbers for anything.
At this point, a senior Asian diplomat said, "the perception of movement is almost as important as movement itself."
"Orbos," he said, "buys her more time."
A senior Western diplomat said: "This is a Government that lives day to day, week to week. Orbos is very bright, with good political instincts. He comes in very late. But he can help her, and everyone basically wants him to succeed."
 
'Let's Do It Now'
 If Mr. Orbos, who does not lack ambition, can find some success, it will help his reputation, he acknowledges. And if he fails, it may not hurt him much, since many think that no real transformation is possible at this stage when Mrs. Aquino is perceived as a lame duck.
That is a view he strongly rejects. "Let's do it now," he said. "Why wait until '92?"
More is at stake than Mrs. Aquino's reputation, Mr. Orbos said. "I want to give her a boost, so that she will be judged by history in a kinder way, rather than go out sinking, causing us to sink downward, too."

HEADLINE: Trade Talks With Japan Face Stormy Reopening

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Trade negotiations between Japan and the United States, which resume here Thursday, are headed for rough weather.
At the talks in Tokyo, the agenda includes a review of an accord reached last summer to reduce the so-called structural impediments to trade. 
 Japan agreed to revise business practices to encourage competition and to increase spending on public works to stimulate demand for imports. The United States, for its part, promised to reduce the Federal budget deficit, deregulate certain industries and improve the quality of American education, all steps aimed at bolstering American competitiveness and producing goods that foreigners would want to buy.
While American negotiators have reported a growing peevishness within the Bush Administration about Japan's stance on various trade matters, a senior Japanese negotiator said this week that Japan was perplexed by the American failure to keep its promises of last summer.
 
'More Confrontations'
 "I very much anticipate more confrontations with the United States," a Japanese negotiator said. "We are very satisfied with our own responses to the United States, but we are not satisfied with the American replies."
In the next few weeks, in several "working group" sessions, the United States intends to take up what it regards as Japanese barriers to American exports of computers, semiconductors and paper products.
The Administration is also pressing Tokyo to ease restrictions on American lawyers and law firms in Japan, and to move faster to allow foreign banks and securities firms to compete on equal terms in Japanese financial markets.
There will also be another round of talks reviewing a 1988 Japanese pledge to open up 14 big Japanese construction projects to bidding by foreign companies. The Bush Administration charges that Japan has been slow to carry out the accord, and that it should open up more projects to foreign bids.
 
Teams of Negotiators
 The American negotiators at the structural impediment talks will be led by Richard T. McCormack, Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs; S. Linn Williams, the deputy United States trade representative; J. Michael Farren, Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade; and Charles Dallara, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs.
The Japan team includes Koji Watanabe, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs; Makoto Utsumi, Vice Minister for International Affairs at the Finance Ministry, and Naomichi Suzuki, Vice Minister for International Affairs at the Ministry for International Trade and Industry.
The following weekend the American delegates will go to Hakone, a resort near Mount Fuji, for talks on general issues of trade and economics. The Japanese side will again be led by Mr. Watanabe.
 
Frustration Over the Middle East
 American impatience over Japan's failure to send personnel to the Middle East after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait has also increased frustrations.
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu has committed $2 billion in assistance for the military buildup against Iraq and another $2 billion in economic aid for Jordan, Egypt and Turkey. But less than half of the money has actually been disbursed.
The United States is also unhappy with Japan over its tactics at the global trade talks in Geneva that collapsed last month. President Bush criticized Tokyo for blocking the Administration's efforts to reduce trade barriers and subsidies for farm products, including rice in Japan.
Mr. Bush said the opposition of Japan and the European Community was "all the more disappointing" because the world's poorest countries had offered to reduce import barriers in return for being able to sell their farm products to Europe and Japan.
 
Big Transit Project
 In the dispute over construction projects, Washington contends that the choice of a Japanese group to provide a transit system at the Kansai International Airport, outside Osaka in western Japan, was a slap at AEG Westinghouse Transportation Systems Inc., an American-German joint venture that has built several such systems.
After the American protest, the airport authorities awarded contracts to a group of American, Japanese and German companies to install a baggage-handling system. A Japanese official said he viewed the dispute as resolved. But American officials in Japan said they remained concerned about the bidding procedures used in awarding various airport contracts.
In the structural impediment talks, American officials said Japan's pledge to spend more than $3 trillion on public works in the next 10 years is on its way to being carried out. Such spending is being sought to spur consumer demand generally, and demand for imports specifically.
 
Bid-Rigging Charges
 But the United States contends that Tokyo is not going far enough in its proposal to punish companies guilty of bid-rigging and other anti-competitive practices, and Washington is also pressing the Japanese to introduce the concept of the rights of stockholders in Japanese companies.
The United States also wants Japan to make it easier for Japanese citizens to sue to punish companies guilty of antitrust behavior.
The Bush Administration is joining many critics of the Government in Japan in saying that Prime Minsiter Kaifu's proposal to increase the tax on land holdings, aimed at encouraging increased sales and development of land, is not sufficient to have any impact.
Japan, in addition to resisting these steps, has its own agenda of demands on the the United States, most notably a reduction in the Federal deficit. The budget deficit is regarded as hampering the American savings rate and undercutting industrial productivity.
Although President Bush accepted a deficit-reduction package last year that included tax increases, the Japanese seem unimpressed. "We appreciate the effort, but the result was nonsense," a Tokyo official said.
Japan also seeks greater American steps to ease antitrust laws and other business regulations, including abrogation of the ban on selling oil from the Alaskan pipeline to foreign countries. Japan also wants the Bush Administration to promise to block Congressional legislation that Tokyo considers adverse to foreign investment.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Crowds in European Cities Protest a War in Gulf Area

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Mobilized by leftist, environmental, pacifist and trade union groups, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets of major West European cities today to demand that force not be used against Iraq in Kuwait.
As part of an international day of action coordinated with antiwar groups in the United States and Japan, protests against the military buildup in the gulf were organized in Britain and France, which have sent troops to Saudi Arabia, as well as in Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Sweden and Norway. 
 The demonstrations appeared to reflect a surge of anxiety in Europe about a possible gulf war as the Jan. 15 deadline fixed by the United Nations for an Iraqi withdrawal approaches. Until now, protests against Western policy in the crisis have drawn minimal crowds.
 
Big March in Paris
 In France, where the Government is leading European efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis, the largest turnout was in Paris, with more than 50,000 demonstrators marching from the Place de la Bastille to the St.-Augustin Church near President Francois Mitterrand's Elysee Palace.
A letter delivered to a Presidential aide by the protest organizers demanded that more time be allowed for economic sanctions to force Iraq to leave Kuwait. Max Gallo, a prominent member of Mr. Mitterrand's Socialist Party, said, "France has everything to lose in this absurd war."
At Chambery, in southeastern France, 100 protesters blocked a train with American military supplies destined for the gulf region. The train was delayed for 90 minutes.
Antiwar demonstrations were also held in Lyons, Marseilles, Bordeaux and dozens of smaller French cities.
In Britain, polls show considerable public support for the West's tough stance against Saddam Hussein. But the police in London estimated that 40,000 protesters marched from Hyde Park Corner to Trafalgar Square, where they were addressed by antiwar and antinuclear veterans like Tony Benn, a prominent leftist in the opposition Labor Party.
"Hundreds of thousands of innocent men, women and children could well be slaughtered by the most modern weapons, often manufactured by the same arms companies and supplied to both sides," he said. "The oil wells may well be set alight, causing a major environmental disaster for the whole region and beyond."
Smaller demonstrations were held in other British cities, including Glasgow, where the city's Roman Catholic Archbishop, Thomas Winning, said that war was not a legitimate option. "There may be a thief in Baghdad," he said, "but war is not the way to get him to surrender his booty."
 
Protests in Germany
 In Germany, 200,000 joined antiwar demonstrations organized by the Peace Cooperative Network in more than a dozen cities, including Berlin, Cologne, Stuttgart, Hamburg and Munich. In Bonn, small groups of protesters held a candle-light vigil outside the United States and Iraqi Embassies. In Frankfurt, one march ended outside the headquarters of the United States Army's Fifth Corps.
In Rome, the Italian Communist Party was the main organizer of an antiwar rally that drew a crowd of 30,000. "For oil, they want a massacre, this is the goal of the United States and NATO," some demonstrators shouted.
A few hours before this demonstration, Pope John Paul II told Rome-based diplomats accredited to the Vatican that "the time is more than ever for dialogue, negotiation, the pre-eminence of international law" because even a limited war, he said, would be "specially murderous, without taking into account the ecological, political, economic and strategic consequences."
 
Other Expressions
 Suggesting that such consequences were out of proportion to the results a gulf war could achieve, the Pope said that "by leaving intact the deep causes of violence in this part of the world, peace obtained by arms could only lead to new violence."
In Oslo, about 1,000 people carrying banners saying, "Iraq, Out of Kuwait" and "No Blood for Oil," marched past the United States Embassy. In Stockholm, a protest outside the American Embassy drew only about 200 people, the police said.
In Switzerland, where antiwar groups have urged the public to hang white sheets or cloths outside windows and doors to protest a possible gulf conflict, the bells of Protestant and Catholic churches are to ring together for peace on Sunday afternoon. Antiwar demonstrations have also been scheduled in other countries, including Spain, for Sunday.

HEADLINE: No Malaise, Please;
Reports by Dinkins and 3 Governors Focus on Silver Linings, Not Money

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
In major speeches in recent days, the Governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut and the Mayor of New York City assessed the generally grim state of their respective domains, looked into a future tempered by a souring economy and gaping holes in their budgets and tried to sound at least a little optimistic.
 Typically, their annual reports to constituents and inaugurals are laden with new goals and new programs, and all four officials, in their own way, seemed reluctant to disappoint their audiences. The speeches, which reflected on silver linings as well as dark clouds, opportunities as well as disappointments, were doubtless intended to shore up confidence in a region shaken by the loss of more than 100,000 jobs last year, plunging real-estate prices, growing social problems and no sign of a quick turnaround. But at a time when spending on vital programs will be cut -- sometimes deeply -- the leaders may have risked raising expectations to a level that cannot be fulfilled, and missed a chance to prepare constituents for the worst. 
 "You have a very bewildered electorate," said George Sternlieb, professor emeritus of urban and regional planning at Rutgers University, who found the speeches often at odds with the deteriorating economic and fiscal climate. "It was a lost opportunity."
The four speeches formed a kind of political continuum. On one end, in the view of Mr. Sternlieb and others, was Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York City, who arguably has the biggest problem -- a budget deficit estimated at up to $2.1 billion in the coming fiscal year and the need to combat rising violence and a sense of foreboding that shrouds his city -- but seemed the most optimistic.
 
'A Rebound Is Coming'
 The Mayor acknowledged he would have to cut the budget "to the bone," but insisted: "This is no time for despair."
"Though our prospects may seem dim at the moment, a rebound is coming," he said, "and it will be based on the wealth of resources that we sometimes, in our gloom, overlook."
Mr. Dinkins asked for tougher laws on juvenile crime and talked of a march on Washington for gun controls. But he did not mention probable changes among his senior aides, or dwell on labor agreements that had been criticized by the city's fiscal monitors. At several points, he sought to see positives in negatives, like falling real-estate prices that he said would make New York City a cheaper place in which to do business.
Mr. Dinkins, Mr. Sternlieb said, "basically seems to be under a misapprehension that this is 1988. He's sort of frozen in past grandeur."
 
'No Broken-Field Running'
 Elected Governor last fall, Lowell P. Weicker Jr. was not around as Connecticut's deficit widened alarmingly. It is now projected to be a bigger percentage of spending than the gap Mr. Dinkins must close. Yet in his short inaugural the former Senator declared: "So let's get this deficit business done -- and fast. No broken-field running, ladies and gentlemen, straight into the line. We take our licks so that we can restore the caring and quality of life that is Connecticut."
And while he was at it, Mr. Weicker said he stood by his commitment "to rekindle business in Connecticut, to save and expand jobs, to generate the revenues to turn this state around."
He did not say exactly how he intended to do all this, but his language suggested that Connecticut might not long be among the 10 states without an income tax.
"This is a wonderful year for raw truth," said Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in an address combed for signs of a Presidential bid. "We don't have any money."
He talked about goals not now affordable, like a longer school year; programs others would pay for, like an expansion of child-care services to be financed largely with Federal money; initiatives for which financing was not specified, like new funds for transportation and environmental projects, and laws that would require little or no new money, like a ban on assault weapons.
"Basically, he became a born-again conservative with a heart," said Mitchell L. Moss, head of the Urban Research Center at New York University, who declared the Governor's speech his best since his address to the 1982 Democratic national convention.
Social-service advocates, however, worried about the declining purchasing power of welfare grants and Albany's commitment to AIDS programs.
Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey, for his part, acknowledged that he may have moved too fast in raising taxes by $2.8 billion. But having made their investment, taxpayers would now reap dividends, he said, on auto-insurance and property-tax bills.
He also spoke of creating 7,000 new jobs through an increase in state highway and other construction, reduced-cost mortgages for first-time home buyers, health-care programs for uninsured hospital patients and a doubling of resources for child care, though he was not specific about how some of this would be financed.
 
Florio Calls Taxes Farsighted
 Mr. Florio maintained that last year's rise in the sales tax and income-tax rates for the wealthy had been necessary and farsighted, but acknowledged that New Jersey could not "tax its way out of a troubled economy."
In what came to be called his "national malaise" speech of 1979, Jimmy Carter proved how dangerous it can be for a politician to traffic in gloom. Then again, Mr. Cuomo's predecessor, Hugh L. Carey, took office declaring that the "days of wine and roses are over."
"I understand the impulse to remain optimistic," said Richard Ravitch, the former head of the Metropolitan Transportaton Authority who ran for mayor last year. "You've got to give people some sense of confidence that the world is not going to end."
Pessimism can also unsettle nervoous credit markets. Still, Mr. Ravitch and Mr. Sternlieb both said the politicians should have been sounding fiscal alarms earlier.
"The longer you tell them happy stories," Mr. Sternlieb said, "the greater the shock of landing."
For all four politicians, though, days of reckoning are approaching. They must soon submit budgets in which bad news will be inescapable.

HEADLINE: Hopeful E.P.A. Report Fans a Debate as Talks on Warming Near

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
The Environmental Protection Agency says that at a time when most other countries have only pledged to take action, the United States has already taken steps that will keep emissions of heat-trapping atmospheric gases at current levels for the next two decades.
The conclusions are playing a crucial role in the United States' preparations for an international conference in Washington next month to negotiate a treaty to control emissions of the gases, which scientists say could cause a catastrophic warming of the Earth in the 21st century. 
 More than 20 industrialized countries have committed themselves to stabilizing or reducing emissions of carbon dioxide, the gas that would play the largest role in the warming. The Bush Administration has opposed such a target for carbon dioxide, arguing that the extent of the problem is too uncertain.
 
Reliability Is Questioned
 The E.P.A. study is already generating argument. Some critics question its reliability and assail it as a ploy to justify what they see as the Administration's go-slow policy on global warming. They say that even if the findings are reliable, enough of the gases are already in the atmosphere to require stronger action. Scientists say, further, that a substantial reduction in emissions will be required if the global concentration of the gases is to be stabilized at current levels.
But William K. Reilly, the E.P.A. Administrator, said in an interview that the study showed that the United States had already acted to stabilize its overall contribution to warming. Mr. Reilly has long advocated emissions targets, provided they encompass all the implicated gases, not just carbon dioxide.
Atmospheric concentrations of the gases are steadily rising as a result of human activity. Scientists say that because they trap heat much as a greenhouse does, they could cause drastic climatic changes in the next century.
Some experts on the international politics of global warming say the findings of the agency's report could prompt the United States to drop its objection to targets. In this view, Washington might recapture leadership on the issue of global warming if it proposed an overall target that included all the gases implicated in global warming -- a target that the E.P.A. study suggests it could meet.
 
Sununu Opposes Targets
 "If they don't do it, they're going to have a very hard time getting back in the game seriously, in terms of playing a leading role in shaping an international approach," said William Nitze, a former State Department official who was responsible for coordinating Government policy on global warming and who represented the United States in international meetings on the subject. He left the Administration last September to become president of the nonprofit Alliance to Save Energy, based in Washington.
Whether the Administration will now embrace targets in light of the report's finding remains to be seen. The idea has considerable support among officials of Government agencies who are discussing what the United States' stance should be, Administration officials say. But higher officials, including John H. Sununu, the President's chief of staff, have successfully opposed any targets in the past. Mr. Sununu said through an aide that he was aware of the report but would not comment on it.
Mr. Reilly says that while the study is not yet "fully researched" or scientifically reviewed, "it's the best we have."
Recently adopted measures that the E.P.A. study says will limit the United States contribution to the greenhouse effect include these measures:
*Provisions of the new Clean Air Act amendments that will slow carbon dioxide emissions.
*Recent energy-saving measures mandated by the Department of Energy, including efficiency standards for appliances, the development of energy-saving building codes, and initiatives to expand hydroelectric power, promote solar energy and stimulate greater efficiency by the electric-power industry.
*The phasing out of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's. These chemicals, used as refrigerants, solvents and propellants, are being abandoned primarily because they destroy the ozone layer that protects living things from ultraviolet radiation. But they also are even more powerful and long-lived heat-trappers than carbon dioxide.
According to a report on the study by Alex Cristofaro, director of the agency's air and energy policy division, researchers calculated the effect of the recent Government measures on emissions of the various greenhouse gases. It converted all the gases to carbon-dioxide equivalents, in terms of heat-trapping capacity.
It found that the United States contribution to the greenhouse effect, expressed in carbon-dioxide equivalents, would be about the same in 2000 as in 1987, and that it would either drop slightly or show an increase of about 4 percent by 2010. This could change, the study said, if the new Government measures do not materialize as expected or if the economy grows faster than expected.
 
Can It Be Painless?
 One Government official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified, said that the study's conclusion means that "the problem is possibly less intractable than it might appear at first glance." He said it suggests that "we could quite painlessly" take further action to limit greenhouse emissions over the next few years.
Environmental skeptics doubt that a United States pledge to stabilize its overall greenhouse emissions by the year 2000 would be a sufficient response. "It would still be a considerably weaker position than that adopted by the Europeans," said Michael Oppenheimer, a senior scientist and expert on global warming at the Environmental Defense Fund, an environmental research and advocacy group.
He said the Europeans have committed themselves to capping or reducing carbon dioxide emissions. "In addition," he said, "they will do the same as we're doing with CFC's, namely, eliminate them." Most of the world's nations have agreed to halt production of CFC's by the end of this decade.
The E.P.A. study shows that carbon dioxide emissions in the United States would continue to grow over the next two decades, even though this nation's overall contribution to the greenhouse effect would stabilize.
Moreover, Dr. Oppenheimer said, overall greenhouse emissions by the United States would resume their growth after CFC's have been eliminated if no further action is taken. "In my opinion," said Dr. Oppenheimer, "the U.S. is trying to pull the wool over everyone's eyes under the guise of stabilizing greenhouse emissions."
Mr. Reilly, a career environmentalist before he joined the Bush Administration, has consistently advocated targets to stabilize or reduce overall greenhouse emissions. By setting overall targets, he argues, individual countries are afforded more flexibility.

HEADLINE: Rising Personal and Public Toll In New England Economic Plunge

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GARDNER, Mass., Jan. 11

 BODY:
For decades, Gardner has called itself "Chair City," for the furniture factories that dominated its economy.
But that was before Conant Ball shut down with a loss of 105 jobs, before Gem Industries closed its rambling old red brick mill, laying off 110 workers, before Temple Stuart went out of business, idling 400 workers, and before Collier-Keyworth closed its factory, eliminating 450 jobs -- all in the past two years. 
 "It's scary; it's like unemployed people are coming out of the sky, there are so many of them," said Arlene Morin, who had been a furniture assembler at Temple Stuart for 17 years in this city of 20,000 people in north-central Massachusetts.
 
A Regional Calamity
 In the past year unemployment in Gardner has more than doubled, to 11.4 percent, the fastest loss of jobs for any area of the country, according to the United States Department of Labor. So widespread has been the effect of the downturn that not long ago a banker in his 50's and his son, a public school teacher in his mid-20's, were laid off at the same time.
Although Gardner's job losses are extreme, its situation reflects the economic freefall throughout the six states of New England: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont. While the rest of the nation has just entered what many economists believe will be a mild recession, New England has been in an economic slump for nearly two years and has now plummeted into what regional economists say is a severe recession.
The economic calamity has made a mockery of what had been called the Massachusetts Miracle, the extraordinary growth in the 1980's that had served as former Gov. Michael S. Dukakis's platform in his 1988 Presidential campaign.
"It wasn't a miracle, but an apparition," said Richard F. Syron, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
In the past two years, New England has lost 254,000 jobs, a decline of 4 percent, and currently accounts for one fifth of all the jobs being lost in the United States, though the region accounts for only 5.5 percent of the country's population, said Wayne Ayers, chief economist for the Bank of Boston.
Housing prices in Boston, which had been the highest in the country three years ago, have dropped 20 percent to 30 percent, real estate agents say. Commercial real estate values have fallen as much as 50 percent. And business failures increased 193 percent in New England last year, as against 14.5 percent nationwide, according to the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation.
In recent days the area's misery was symbolized by the failure of the Bank of New England, once the area's second-largest bank, which was taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation after it was forced into insolvency by bad real estate loans.
In Rhode Island, 15 banks and credit unions that were part of the state's private insurance fund that failed two weeks ago remain closed. Despite a program to set up a new fund, Gov. Bruce G. Sundlun, a Democrat, estimated that one quarter of the depositors may never regain their money.
 
Coping With Anxiety
 The reversal in the region's fortunes, coming so swiftly and sharply, has had an intense psychological effect. Last fall the Consumer Confidence Index in New England, measured by the Conference Board in New York, plunged to the lowest level ever recorded for any area of the country.
William Roiter, a psychologist and vice president of Hurst Associates, which offers counseling to businesses in the Boston area, said that since last summer he has seen an abrupt shift in the main concern of white-collar workers. In the 1980's they worried about coping with stress, he said, but now their concern is coping with depression and anxiety.
"The difference is that with stress, people come in and say they have too much to do and not enough time to do it in," Dr. Roiter said. "Now people feel like they are losing things -- losing status, or jobs and homes. That's very frightening for people."
The economic downturn has caused a sharp drop in tax revenues, contributing to budget crises in all six states. The situation is most critical in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, where the shortfall between revenues and spending is at least 12 percent of their total budgets. Connecticut ranks third, with a shortfall of about 9.5 percent.
In Massachusetts, the crisis has already led to cuts of 20 percent in spending for the state's colleges and universities. "The mood is one of discouragement," said Joseph Duffey, chancellor of the University of Massachusetts, where the faculty has been reduced by 160 positions since 1988 and several senior administrators have resigned in the past two weeks to accept other jobs.
In Maine, the battle over the budget is so intense that Gov. John R. McKernan Jr., a Republican, has threatened to "engage in one-man rule," unilaterally cutting all state spending by 15 percent. State Representative Joseph May, the House majority whip and a Democrat, has denounced the plan as "financial martial law."
 
'A Very Strange Recession'
 In examining New England's troubles, some economists are particularly troubled by the nature of the recession. "The real issue is that it's a very strange recession because it involves a shrinkage of non-cyclical parts of the economy that are usually resistant to recession," said Gary Ciminero, chief economist for Fleet/ Norstar Financial Group, the large banking holding company in Providence, R.I.
Mr. Ciminero said he believes that the recession began in the region's overexpanded real estate and construction business and spread quickly to other, usually more stable sectors like services, retail trade and public employment. "This is bad news indeed," he said, "because after they've shrunk, they don't plant the seeds for their own recovery, as usually happens in a recession when jobs contract and wages drop. It's like a sweater that has shrunk."
In Gardner, Dick Batt had worked for 30 years as an engineer in the now-shuttered Collier-Keyworth plant. As the town grew in recent years, spurred by the addition of families who commute to the high-technology industries nearer Boston, Mr. Batt, 60 years old, had grown accustomed to a middle-class life, including ski trips with his children and regular dinners out with his wife and friends.
"Now we find ourselves avoiding going out in groups, because we don't want to be in the situation where we have to buy cocktails," said Mr. Batt, who is still looking for work. "We can't afford them any more."
Mr. Batt is fortunate that he owns his house, with only a small mortgage, but he is fast using up his retirement savings to pay for medical insurance.
Lisa Pepper, a 21-year-old resident of nearby Winchendon, had managed a store that sold overhead doors until it was closed last January as the construction business dried up. Her husband, a carpenter, was laid off for much of the year. She has been busy sending out resumes, but has found that often there are 300 applicants for any job opening.
"It's discouraging to be caught up in this turmoil, competing with all these other people for that one job," she said.
 
$8.50 an Hour at McDonald's
 Karl E. Case, a professor of economics at Wellesley College in Wellesley, Mass., said he believed that the real estate boom of 1984 to 1986, when New England's economy was growing fastest, "did serious damage to our economy." Most of the new jobs added in Massachusetts in those years came in construction and among people rushing to become real estate brokers, he said That helped to drive the state's unemployment rate down to 2.4 percent and to push wages up.
"Labor was so scarce that McDonald's had to pay $8.50 an hour to get workers," Professor Case said. At the same time manufacturing was shrinking, though with little public notice, "so we had the fiction of a boom, but it was not about our core economy"
The labor shortage pushed wages in Massachusetts well above the national average, which along with the high cost of housing led companies to stop investing in the area. While housing costs have fallen sharply since their peak in 1988, New England remains "the least affordable area" of the country, said Sara Johnson, managing economist at DRI/McGraw Hill in Lexington, Mass.
Several economists project that the region's recession will continue through the end of this year, with the loss of another 100,000 jobs. Then, assuming that the national economy recovers from its recession and that the Persian Gulf crisis does not produce a prolonged war, New England would see "a very gradual recovery" starting in 1992, Mr. Ayers said.
But Ms. Johnson of DRI cautioned that because "New England got a head start on the recession and because it has been in recession longer, so it will be longer and deeper here." And the national recovery must come first, she said, because the orders and investment to stimulate New England's economy must come from outside the region. She estimated that in the first half of the 1990's New England would grow slower than the rest of the country, with growth returning to the national average around 1995 as its wage and housing costs come more into line with those elsewhere.
But Mr. Syron, of the Federal Reserve Bank, cautioned against writing the region off, saying, "There is an extraordinary lack of perspective about the New England economy."
In December, unemployment in Massachusetts rose to 7.4 percent, according to the United States Labor Department, the highest of any of the major industrial states and almost double the 4 percent figure at the end of 1989. But, Mr. Syron noted, in the recession of 1973-74, unemployment in the state reached nearly 12 percent.
 
Question of Perceptions
 In the earlier recession, he said, "everyone was sure New England would end up as the world's biggest bird sanctuary," as the region's traditional industries like leather, shoes and textiles shriveled. Then in the mid-1980's, with the computer business along Route 128 outside Boston and the jet engine and submarine factories in Connecticut booming, "everyone was sure New England would go on forever being a perpetual prosperity machine."
Now, everyone is again convinced that New England is finished, he said, although it is still the wealthiest in the country in per capita income. In addition, he said, "we still have an edge in the basic research infrastructure, the universities, that will contribute to the revival of the region."
Largely as an outgrowth of research in schools like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New England has 15 percent of the nation's 22,000 emerging high-technology companies, Mr. Ayers said. Some of those companies, in fields like biotechnology, computer software and environmental control systems, could do for the area in the 1990's what makers of minicomputers did in the 80's.
But, he added, biotechnology companies in Massachusetts now employ only 7,000 people. So these new companies are likely to be smaller than the computer giants and will take time to grow.

HEADLINE: Design Your Own Games, Monopoly Rivals Told

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
In what could be characterized as an anti-antitrust action, the makers of Monopoly, the board game, have filed suit in Federal District Court in Manhattan, seeking to maintain their monopoly on their famous game board.
"They should go directly to jail," said Arthur Greenbaum, a lawyer representing Parker Brothers, conceding that the quip was a bit obvious. Mr. Greenbaum was referring to a California-based company that is marketing Big Appleopoly, as well as 70 other municipalopolies, including Bostonopoly, San Diegoopoly, San Franciscoopoly, Torontoopoly and even Berlinopoly. 
 "This is crazy," said Arthur Mitchell, vice president of Cityopoly, the company in El Cajon, Calif., that manufactures the rival games. In them, players do not buy the real estate in Monopoly, but with a roll of the dice and for a few fake dollars, acquire such enterprises as the Plaza Hotel ($400), the Four Seasons restaurant ($300) or New York Telephone ($200).
"What is the difference if we're making this game," Mr. Mitchell said, "when other companies have marketed Farmopoly, Medical Monopoly, Legal Monopoly, Anti-Monopoly?" -- not to mention Worldopoly, Europopoly, Condoopoly and even Rockopoly.
 
Streets of Dreams
 "The answer," Mr. Greenbaum said, "is we don't object to anyone using 'opoly.' There are other games out there that we do not object to. But this company takes all of the Monopoly indicia -- the things that are synonyms, in a sense, for the Monopoly game -- and they've copied our game."
Parker Brothers, based in Beverly, Mass., has sold more than 100 million Monopoly sets since it bought the game from an unemployed heating engineer, Charles B. Darrow, in 1935. Mr. Darrow used Atlantic City's thoroughfares as his Depression-era streets of dreams.
Mr. Mitchell said Cityopoly has sold "a few hundreds of thousands" of its games in the last two years.
From the word "Go," Mr. Greenbaum insisted, similarities between the two are striking. In Big Appleopoly, "Go," becomes "Start," with the underline reading, "$200 Reward As You Pass."
 
The Same Colors
 "They've taken the same colors for the properties," Mr. Greenbaum added. "We have Boardwalk as the blue property; they have the Plaza as their blue property. The price for the properties is the same. The money is in the same denominations and the same colors.
"We have 'Go to Jail.' They have 'Go to Sing Sing.' We have 'In Jail' and 'Just Visiting.' They have 'In Sing Sing' and 'Just Visiting.' They even use our famous green houses and red hotels."
Mr. Mitchell cited some of the same examples to insist that the games were different. "I don't see how they're the same," he said. "They have 'Go.' We have 'Start.' We don't 'Go to Jail.' You 'Go to Sing Sing.'
"The rules aren't even the same," he continued. "With us, you build high-rises and buildings, you buy and trade businesses, not real estate. This is an entrepreneur's game."
 
Suing for an Injunction
 Mr. Greenbaum, of the law firm of Cowan, Liebowitz & Latman, said the suit was filed on Tuesday. "We don't know what their sales have been," he said.
"We're certainly suing for an injunction to make them stop, and for an accounting," Mr. Greenbaum said. "We want them, as we lawyers say, to disgorge their unjust enrichment."
Mr. Mitchell said there was precedent for like-designed games on the market. "Pictionary is a game where you draw a picture and people try to figure out what it is," he said. "Win, Lose or Draw is a game where you draw a picture and people try to figure out what it is. And they both sell in the same stores, side by side."
Pointing out one significant difference, Mr. Mitchell said, "Our game is even more expensive -- $24.95 retail." Monopoly costs between $10 and $15.
The Mayor of Atlantic City, James A. Whelan, assumed a posture of parochial pride in his city's "good symbiosis" with the Parker Brothers product. "There's only one Atlantic City and only one Monopoly," the Mayor said. "Boardwalk is Boardwalk and Park Place is Park Place. We've got 'em. Monopoly's got 'em. And nobody else is ever going to have 'em."

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
CONGRESS ACTS TO AUTHORIZE WAR IN GULF; MARGINS ARE 5 VOTES IN SENATE, 67 IN HOUSE

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
After three days of solemn, often eloquent debate, Congress today voted to give President Bush the authority to go to war against Iraq.
The Senate approved the use of military force by a vote of 52 to 47. The majority included 42 Republicans and 10 Democrats, mostly Southerners who were convinced that economic sanctions would not force Iraq from Kuwait or who were unwilling to vote against the President. Two Republicans joined 45 Democrats in opposing force. 
 In the House, the vote was a more comfortable 250 to 183, as 164 Republicans and 86 Democrats voted for force, while 179 Democrats, 3 Republicans and 1 independent were opposed.
 
'All Necessary Means'
 The measure, the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution, said Mr. Bush was authorized "to use United States armed forces pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 678," which authorized member nations to use "all necessary means" against Iraq if did not withdraw from Kuwait by midnight Tuesday, Eastern standard time.
Mr. Bush asked Congress for this declaration last Tuesday, and its passage removed the last political obstacle to an attack by United States-led forces against Iraqi troops occupying Kuwait.
Under the terms of the resoluton, before force may be used Mr. Bush must send a message to Congressional leaders saying that diplomacy and sanctions will not be effective in geting Iraq out of Kuwait. [Excerpts from the debate and roll-calls of the votes, page 10; excerpts from the debated resolutions, page 11.]
 
'Last Best Chance for Peace'
 At a news conference immediately after the votes, President Bush said the action by Congress "unmistakably demonstrates the United States's commitment to enforce a complete Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait."
The President added that he was inclined to order military action against Iraq "sooner rather than later," but suggested that he might hold back if President Saddam Hussein began a large-scale withdrawal from occupied Kuwait before Tuesday. [Page 8.]
Just before the Senate voted, Senator Bob Dole, the minority leader, said the time to authorize the use of force had come. "Let's not pull the rug out from under the President when the pressure is building on Saddam Hussein by the minute," he said. "Let's don't give him any relief."
 
Foley Favored Sanctions
 The losing argument for continued reliance on sanctions was voiced by Speaker Thomas S. Foley in a rare speech to the House. He said all members owed Mr. Bush their "informed and reasoned judgment." And he said, "If you believe that more can be done, if you believe that Saddam Hussein is growing weaker every day, if you believe that the coalition will hold," then members should vote to continue reliance on sanctions and not support force now.
Their comments were just two examples of a remarkably full, thoughtful debate by more than 268 Representatives and 93 Senators, many of whom waited until the early hours this morning for a chance to go on the record. And today, both chambers usually had majorities of the members sitting and listening as the final arguments were offered.
Today's action was the first time since Aug. 7, 1964, when the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was adopted, that Congress had voted directly for offensive military action. But today's votes were far closer than the 88-2 Senate margin or the 414-0 result in the House for the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which was cited for years afterward by foes and supporters of the war effort as Congress's critical move.
The last time Congress was comparably divided in deciding to go to war was with its votes to launch the War of 1812; the House voted 79 to 49 in favor and the Senate followed, 19 to 13.
 
Sanctions Lost in First Votes
 Before voting for force, each House foreshadowed its crucial decision by defeating resolutions urging continued reliance on sanctions.
In the Senate, the vote was 53 to 46, with only 1 Republican, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, joining 45 Democrats in the losing effort. In the House, the vote was 250 to 183, with 179 Democrats, 3 Republicans and 1 independent in favor and 164 Republicans and 86 Democrats opposed.
The House also passed, 302-131, a measure reasserting Congress's exclusive constitutional authority to declare war.
But whatever resolution was formally before the House or the Senate, the arguments seemed interchangeable, whether for force or for sanctions, for support of the President or the United Nations, or warning of the costs in lives or dollars, or complaining of the level of support from other nations.
 
'How Can We Turn Our Backs?'
 Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the minority leader, said: "President Bush has openly and forthrightly asked for our help. How can we turn our backs on him?"
Representative David E. Bonior, Democrat of Michigan, urged members to "pause before you cast your vote."
"Ask the same question that thousands of Americans are asking their families today," he said. "Is this the cause for which you would ask your son or daughter to risk their life?"
Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn, who got his political start running a campaign based on opposition to the Vietnam War, said the circumstances were fundamentally different today.
 
'Economic Jugular of the World'
 He urged support for the use-of-force resolution that he took the leading role in writing and said, "If we prevail, we will have prevented a brutal dictator from getting his hands on the economic jugular of the world."
Mr. Foley and Dante B. Fascell, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who supported the authorization to use force, each warned members not to think of the vote as anything less than the equivalent of a declaration of war.
But William H. Broomfield of Michigan, the senior Republican on the Foreign Affairs Committee, argued that today's vote was a vital diplomatic bargaining chip that might persuade Iraq to quit Kuwait.
In the Senate, Mr. Dole predicted that today's votes would be the last chance to persuade Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Iraq. He said it was the time "to send the mesage that we want a peaceful world."
 
'Defining Moment in Our History'
 Representative Jim Slattery, Democrat of Kansas, said "Saddam Hussein will not see our threat as real" until Congress votes to authorize force. Predicting victory for the resolution authorizing force, he said "today is a defining moment in our history."
Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, argued that with sanctions weakening Iraq: "We are playing a winning hand. I see no compelling reason to rush to military action."
Senator George J. Mitchell, the majority leader, said that the greatest risk in supporting force is the loss of human life. "How many people will die? How many young Americans will die? And for the families of those young Americans who die, for every one of us, the truly haunting question will be, did they die unnecessarily?"
Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, scorned the other members of the anti-Iraq coalition, "a coalition that has allowed us to take on 95 percent of the sacrifice across the board."
 
$2 Billion a Day for War
 Senator David L. Boren, Democrat of Oklahoma, called Japan's $4 billion contribution "paltry" and said that if war came it would cost $2 billion a day at a time when scarce tax dollars "are needed to solve problems at home, to rebuild the strength of this country, to get American ready to compete as a world leader in the next century."
"We can't even get countries like Japan to pay their pledged share," said Representative Mary Rose Oakar of Ohio.
Before voting on the competing issues of war and sanctions, the House adopted the resolution asserting the exclusive authority of Congress to declare war and insisting that Congressional authorization was required for any offensive actions against Iraq.
The resolution won the support of 260 Democrats, 41 Republicans, and one independent, and was opposed by 126 Republicans and 5 Democrats.
 
Significance for the Future
 One of its sponsors, Representative Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said the resolution was important, not perhaps for the moment, but for the future. "Over the long term," he said in an interview after the vote, "it was a major statement by the House about its relationship with the White House."
Throughout the day, Senators and Congressmen spoke of their votes as the most important they would cast in their careers, and compared them to others. Representative Charles E. Bennett, Democrat of Florida and a Silver Star veteran of World War II, said that "Out of the 17,000 votes I have cast, the only one I really regret was the one I cast for the Bay of Tonkin Resolution."
Today the 80-year-old lawmaker urged opposition to war, but told his younger colleagues "a vote ought to be cast on the basis of what you think is best for our country, not best for the Republican or the Democratic Party, not best for the President, not best for you, but what's best for our country and what's best for the world."

HEADLINE: The Nation;
The Road to Bank Reform May Be Bumpy

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AMERICA'S banking system is in serious trouble, and a consensus has developed in the White House, in the Capitol, on Wall Street and on Main Streets across the land that something must be done in Washington to change the laws that govern the banks. The laws, written during the Great Depression, are obsolete.
Congress was told last week that the fund that insures deposits is barely solvent. And the top regulators said that many more large banks would surely fail, as the Bank of New England did last weekend, if the flagging economy does not rebound within a few months. 
 While most authorities do not think a disaster like the one that hit the savings and loan industry is in the offing, the prevailing view is that the banks will never thrive again unless the 60-year-old rules that sharply limit how and where they can operate are overhauled. But there is no consensus on exactly what to do. There is also serious doubt whether the political leadership to bring change to such an entrenched system exists in the White House, in the Treasury and on two key Congressional committees, where one chairman, Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., is tied up in an ethics investigation and another, Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, is unusually unpopular; a third of his Democratic colleagues voted to remove him from his chairmanship.
With the country on the brink of war, no one would expect President Bush or Congress to be focusing on banking issues, as important as they are. But this is a matter politicians have failed to address for years, ever since Richard M. Nixon tried unsuccessfully and half-heartedly more than 20 years ago to lift some of the restraints on bank operations.
Insurance companies, investment firms, brokerage houses and even credit unions are also weakened. In those industries and in banks as well, bad management caused some of the problem, and market forces like declining real estate prices much of the rest. But outmoded Government rules are contributing factors and Mr. Bush has promised that legislation to restructure the financial system will be his top domestic priority in 1991. A year ago, he instructed the Treasury Department to develop the policy. Now, barely two weeks before the President is to outline the legislative proposal in his State of the Union message, the Treasury still has not finished many of the details.
But the basic principles are clear: The package will include measures to shore up the deposit insurance fund, which is expected to lose $5 billion this year, entering 1992 with just $4 billion in assets; in one form or another, these measures will probably be enacted, and individual deposits of $100,000 or less will continue to be protected completely against loss. Other provisions of the legislation would break down the 60-year-old barriers that now keep commercial banks, investment houses and securities companies out of each other's businesses and prevent banks from opening branches nationwide; these measures are less certain to be approved. Finally, the Administration wants to consolidate overlapping Federal supervision that is now divided among several agencies; if the regulators can agree among themselves on consolidation, Congress may go along.
All that is a large mouthful for Congress to swallow. Dozens of different groups will have to be mollified. Regional divisions will have to be bridged. Many lawmakers fear that letting banks get into new lines of business would repeat the mistake that led to the savings and loan mess. (Administration officials deny this, saying banks are better capitalized and better regulated.) Overcoming these obstacles will require enormous political skills.
Congress is rarely confronted with legislation of this scope. The last time was in the mid-1980's when Ronald Reagan proposed revamping the entire income tax system. Mr. Reagan threw his personal popularity and the full weight of his Administration behind the effort. The drive was led by James A. Baker 3d, then Treasury Secretary, and Richard G. Darman, then his deputy, both masterful political tacticians. In Congress, two powerful committee chairmen, Representative Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois, and Senator Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, were basically on the Administration's side.
The principle figures on the banking issue do not seem to have equivalent political skills or authority. Even before the Persian Gulf crisis, Mr. Bush paid less attention to domestic matters, and had less influence on them, than Mr. Reagan did.
 
Brady Too Diffident?
 Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who will command the Administration's troops in the fight for the banking legislation, is viewed in Congress as too diffident to be an accomplished legislative power-broker. His chief aide, Under Secretary Robert R. Glauber, is a specialist in finance who has little political experience.
The Administration official in the banking area who has the most influence with Congress is L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. But as an independent regulator he must avoid political activities like lobbying. Moreover, Mr. Seidman's habit of straight-talking, which has made him popular in the Capitol, has lessened his authority within the Administration, where he is seen as unpredictable and unreliable.
The chairmen of the Banking Committees, Senator Riegle of Michigan and Representative Gonzalez of Texas, both Democrats, may not, say some of their colleagues, have the stature or the capacity to handle monumental legislation. Mr. Riegle is one of the five senators whose dealings with Charles H. Keating Jr., a symbol of the savings and loan debacle, are under investigation by the Ethics Committee. The inquiry has sapped Mr. Riegle's political strength, other senators say.
 
A 'Leaden Autocrat'
 The word on Mr. Gonzalez, said a senior aide who takes soundings for the Democratic leadership, is that the chairman "has been autocratic in that he doesn't permit flowers beneath him to bloom, and leaden in that he has not been an activist."
House committee chairmen are normally re-elected by the Democratic caucus unanimously or with only token opposition, but more than a third of the party's Congressmen voted last month to oust Mr. Gonzalez. Six Democrats on the banking panel quit and took a different committee assignment this year, in part because they did not like serving under him.
Many lawmakers who favor sweeping changes in the financial system fear that the drive to enact such changes may fail because of weak political leadership. But others say that could paradoxically work to the Administration's advantage. Senator Jim Sasser, a Tennessee Democrat, said that lawmakers might accept the President's proposals without the scrutiny they deserve.
In the end, said Representative Jim Leach, an Iowa Republican, the fate of the legislation may hinge on events in the Persian Gulf. "If the gulf goes well," he said, "you'll have a stronger Administration. That could make all the difference."

Sounding Notes of Fiscal Stability, Austerity and Pain

 BODY:
THEY are as much a January ritual as the department-store white sales: the State of the State speeches in Albany and Hartford and the State of the City address in New York. But last week the customarily upbeat rhetoric was overshadowed by the reality of recession and its consequences: declining revenues, skyrocketing deficits and -- perhaps most frustrating to elected officials not accustomed to having expensive initiatives scuttled for lack of cash -- scaled-down dreams.
The new goals and hoped-for new programs were tempered by the realization that the new programs may never be and that existing ones may have to be cut drastically. The region's economy is, according to most experts, getting worse, not better. The prospects for a quick turnaround are considered remote. 
 Following are some of the unhappy details, and excerpts from the speeches of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. and Mayor David N. Dinkins.
 
GOV. MARIO M. CUOMO -- ALBANY

 
 
 
The Problems
 Mr. Cuomo, beginning his third term as Governor of New York, said the times demanded a new austerity. Although the Governor and the Legislature closed a $1 billion budget gap only last month in a $29 billion budget, state fiscal analysts say the shortfall in the next fiscal year could approach $4 billion. Mr. Cuomo said that money was not available for goals he has outlined in past years, like universal health insurance.
 
The Speech
 "The immediate goal is to live within our means, closing the gap between what we would have proposed to spend and our diminished resources. It is essential that we do this, because if we do not maintain fiscal integrity by taking this bitter medicine, then we lose the capacity to pursue the mission.
"Then, having done that, the ultimate challenge is -- while balancing the budget -- to keep alive our vision of America here in New York, giving our people the chance to thrive by helping them become participants and shareholders in a strong New York State economy.
"Everywhere in that message, and in that budget, you will see a candid recognition that our fiscal emergency will require great sacrifice . . . even wrenching readjustment.
"And throughout both those documents, you will also see that I have taken pains to assure that the sacrifices are distributed fairly among all people of this state -- with no elite exempt class protected by political power, and no easy victims offered up because they lack political influence.
"There will be no sacred cows . . . and there will be no sacrificial lambs either."
 
GOV. LOWELL P. WEICKER JR. -- HARTFORD

 
 
 
The Problems
 Mr. Weicker took office as Connecticut's first independent chief executive in more than a century. Some lawmakers speculated that to solve budgetary problems, Mr. Weicker might propose a state income tax when he presents his budget next month. Connecticut is one of 10 states that do not tax regular income. If current spending is maintained, the shortfall the Governor will confront is expected to approach $1.5 billion in the fiscal year beginning July 1. This is in a budget of slightly more than $7 billion.
 
The Speech
 "You in this chamber and those who sent me here expect nothing short of total candor in dealing with the problems and opportunities of our state.
"So let the message of this day be simple -- and bold. No more sacrifices postponed. No more decisions ducked. No more lowest-common-denominator solutions.
"A deficit has taken control of our lives, coloring all else as it climbs beyond comprehension, sapping our confidence and humbling our visions.
"The past is not worth the best of our courage and creativity. That belongs to the future. So let's get this deficit business done -- and fast.
"No broken-field running, ladies and gentlemen. Straight into the line. We take our licks so that we can restore the caring and quality of life that is Connecticut, unmatched anywhere, hard to define, but a treasure worth every moment of our commitment and spirit during this session.
"What I seek is your grit and ingenuity; your resolve to accept sacrifices long postponed to gain achievements long denied."
 
MAYOR DAVID N. DINKINS -- NEW YORK CITY

 
 
 
The Problems
 At a time when financial experts say New York City may be facing the most difficult problems in the region, Mr. Dinkins gave the most upbeat speech. As for a budget gap that could reach $2.5 billion over the next 18 months, the Mayor said the budget would have to be cut to preserve fiscal stability. He said he wanted to make sure that the State's Financial Control Board, which monitors city finances, did not have to intercede. Governor Cuomo, who last year seemed to be growing exasperated with Mr. Dinkins's handling of fiscal matters, has already indicated that such a step might be unavoidable.
 
The Speech
 "Our economy has contracted at a breathtaking pace, and it shows no sign yet of recovery. Thousands of city employees will lose their jobs in the coming months because the size of our government must fit the size of our rapidly declining economy. However, before we eliminate any essential service, we must first cut out the fat -- and we have already begun.
 "In the future, ours will be a smaller government, but a stronger one, more creative, more productive and more responsive, one able to cope with the rapid changes the rest of this decade will surely bring. And, more importantly, it will be our government. By spending no more than we take in, we will maintain our fiscal integrity -- and will avoid losing control to outside monitors. The people of our city elected us to make the difficult choices, enlightened by our sensitivity to their needs. We will not seek to escape that responsibility. And until our economy rebounds, we will rely on our resourcefulness to protect those who need help the most."

Are the Pentagon's Cuts Leaving Defense Thin?

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
THE Navy promised a technological marvel when it persuaded Congress to begin paying for the A-12 Avenger attack plane in 1988. The carrier-based aircraft would be able to fly deep into enemy territory without being detected by radar and drop bombs with pinpoint precision. But even before a single plane was built, the program's costs soared at least $1.6 billion over budget.
Angry over the mismanagement of the program and unwilling to go back to Congress for more money, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney canceled the A-12 last week, shocking the Navy and the arms industry and making clear that a harsh new economic reality has settled over the Pentagon. But if this and other recent cancellations left some applauding the Pentagon's decisive action to trim waste, others wondered if the Administration's lack of a comprehensive plan for defense cutbacks might lead to decisions that will later be regretted. 
 The cancellation left the Navy scrambling to find an alternative to the A-12, which was to replace the 25-year-old A-6 Intruder starting in the mid-90's. It was also a major blow to the nation's two largest military contractors, the McDonnell Douglas Corporation and the General Dynamics Corporation. The companies were equal partners in the A-12 project, and had counted on selling 620 of the planes in coming years for a total of $57 billion.
Within hours of Mr. Cheney's announcement on Monday, the companies began laying off 9,000 workers, mostly in St. Louis and Fort Worth, and began storing away their work on radar-evading technology and state-of-the-art aircraft design. Thousands of workers at subcontractors and suppliers around the nation could also lose their jobs.
The timing of the decision to kill the A-12, the largest program ever to be canceled by the Pentagon, seemed incongruous, coming as the nation appeared headed toward war in the Persian Gulf. But it was just the most visible of a string of weapons projects that have recently fallen victim to rising costs, hard bargaining by the Government and mismanagement by the industry. Last summer the Navy killed a new submarine-hunting plane, the P-7A, being developed by the Lockheed Corporation, and last month the Army terminated a missile program known as FOG-M being developed by the Hughes Aircraft Company and the Boeing Company. On Thursday, the Air Force canceled a Boeing contract for an air defense system for Saudi Arabia.
The cancellations have given new impetus to questions that Government officials, arms industry executives and analysts have been pondering since it became clear that the need for expensive new high-technology weapons would decline sharply in a post-cold war world. It appears to them that the Pentagon does not have any clear plan for dealing with the shrinkage of the defense industrial base, and some experts say that the Government could come to regret some of the decisions it is making as problems crop up with one weapons system after another.
"It's decide as you go and not decide in accordance with a coherent policy," said Gordon Adams, the director of the Defense Budget Project, a non-partisan research group in Washington. "There has been no fundamental attempt made to decide what current programs we need, and there has not even been much thinking about the next generation of weapons needs and the industrial capability necessary to support them."
The problem is particularly acute because the armed services have been cutting back purchases of existing weapons systems to help pay for newer, more exotic and more expensive systems, leaving contractors dependent on the payoff from future programs.
The new weapons, in turn, have been plagued in many cases by cost overruns and other financial troubles even as the military need for them has diminished. More than any other single factor, Government officials and industry executives agree, the financial problems with the programs stemmed from the fixed-price contracts that the Reagan Administration imposed in an attempt to cut costs. Both the Government and the industry learned that there is almost no way to predict the cost of developing a new technology. The industry has absorbed billions of dollars in cost overruns and the armed forces have been forced to kill weapons that they still consider essential.
As big new programs are cut, experts think some of the large prime contractors will be forced to merge and that more and more of the small and medium-sized companies will be forced out of the business or will shift to commercial work.
"As we narrow our technological base, we face the real question of whether we will be able to maintain our superiority across a broad range of weapons systems," said Ethan B. Kapstein, head of the Economics and National Security program at Harvard University.
Industry executives see little chance that the Bush Administration will adopt any formal policy to deal with the shrinking of the industry. Such an approach would fly in the face of the Administration's commitment to free-market ideology, and advocating an industrial policy within the Pentagon can be professional suicide. The former head of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Craig I. Fields, lost his job last year when he pushed for limited Government support for companies developing new technologies.
But while many industry executives clearly wish that the Pentagon would step in to alleviate the financial pain they are beginning to feel, they don't expect it to.
"I'm not optimistic in the short term at all," said Malcom R. Currie, the chairman of Hughes Aircraft. "The Defense Department is likely to say the problem is so large, how can we the Government make choices? How can we help the industry over this hump without being accused of favoritism or of engaging in industrial policy? They'll say we have a free-market society, let the chips fall where they may."

HEADLINE: The World;
For the Europeans, Worry That War Could Hit Home

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
IF the United States decides to force Iraq out of Kuwait, Western European governments will have no choice but to support the action. They have all endorsed the Jan. 15 United Nations deadline for an Iraqi pullout, Britain and France have significant troop contingents in Saudi Arabia, and most others have sent warships or aircraft into the gulf region.
But led by France, the European Community's last-minute scramble to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis after the failure of last week's United States-Iraq talks also reflects the growing nervousness of many governments as public indignation over Iraq's aggression begins to give way across much of Europe to fear of war. 
 With dozens of demonstrations this weekend reminding their leaders of escalating pacifist sentiments, France, Germany, Italy and others are busily talking peace. They are offering Iraq the face-saving formula of an international peace conference on all Mideast problems, even risking charges of appeasement, to show that if war comes, only Baghdad is to blame.
Yet more than public opinion is driving this offensive. European governments know war will be unpopular. But they also fear it will mean terrorism and economic recession and will bring a deep instability to the Arab world that will itself be felt in Europe. So diplomacy is much preferred -- if only Saddam Hussein would offer the smallest hint of flexibility.
As it is, the 12-nation community feels trapped. It has been repeatedly rebuffed by Baghdad and it cannot urge Washington to allow more time for United Nations sanctions to work without seriously damaging the Atlantic alliance. And, having stood back as the United States assumed responsibility for defending Western interests in the gulf, it now has only a small voice in deciding what happens next.
Among those who oppose the use of force against Iraq, the notion is even growing that Europe is being dragged into war more by Washington's impatience than by Baghdad's intransigence. In a letter to the United States Congress last week, 50 members of the 518-seat European Parliament warned that opposition to war "is much broader and deeper than is indicated by the official attitude of European governments." The initiative to prevent war, they said, should come from the United States.
In France, where antiwar protests are being led by mothers of some of the 10,000 French troops stationed in Saudi Arabia, a similar sentiment was echoed by the Defense Minister, Jean-Pierre Chevenement, who urged the United States to make the first concession by agreeing to a peace conference on the Middle East. Conservative opposition parties favor firmness with Iraq, but the French Communist Party said the Jan. 15 deadline should be scrapped. In one recent poll, 79 percent of Frenchmen questioned said "no cause, even if just, is worth a war."
In contrast, public support remains solid for Britain's decision to send 35,000 soldiers to the gulf region and even for moves to topple Mr. Hussein. But the Labor leader, Neil Kinnock, wrestling with a strong antiwar lobby inside his party, has suggested that sanctions against Iraq be given more time to work, while Dennis Healey, a former Labor minister, warned that war "would turn the whole Muslim world against us." Breaking ranks with the Government, a former Tory Prime Minister, Edward Heath, said of President Hussein: "We have got to be prepared, in order not to have this ghastly war, to let this man save face."
German public opinion, distracted by unification, seems more intent on blocking direct German participation in a gulf conflict. But polls also show strong opposition to the use of force against Iraq, with the Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, cautioning that a war could cause havoc to the economies of Eastern Europe's new democracies. Last week, President Richard von Weizsacker told diplomats assigned to Bonn that "there are no national interests that could justify plunging hundreds of millions of innocent people, who already live in deprivation, into new depths of misery."
Certainly, one factor undermining support for military action in many countries is that, except for relatives of soldiers and sailors sent to the gulf, Iraq's annexation of Kuwait has barely touched ordinary people's lives -- no oil shortage, economic slump or terrorism. Yet war, many people fear, could bring all three. Further, outside Britain, which has traditional ties to Kuwait, there is little sympathy for the ousted princes of the emirate. Support for a solution to the Palestinian problem, on the other hand, is widespread.
For the governments of the European Community, however, the crisis has raised other issues. They have a long history of economic and political involvement in the Middle East and have much to lose if a war with Iraq spreads chaos through the Arab world. Millions of Muslim migrants now live in France, Britain, Germany and Belgium. At the same time, more than the United States, Western Europe's strategic interests would be directly threatened if Mideast oil supplies were controlled by Iraq.
The gulf crisis is also testing the community's relations with Washington. Until Aug. 2, the end of the cold war had made the United States' huge troop presence in Europe seem unnecessary. But after Iraq grabbed Kuwait, the community saw that it lacked both the military power and political institutions to respond adequately. Looking to the future, it began planning common foreign, security and defense policies. In the gulf, though, it had to follow Washington's lead.
Unsurprisingly, the United States, long accustomed to speaking for the West on cold war issues, has now reacted with suspicion to the community's diplomatic efforts. Yet American and European interests are not identical on the Middle East. American ties to Israel are unique. Europe's multifaceted exposure to the Arab world is greater. While sharing the objective of liberating Kuwait, then, the allies are approaching this week's dark deadline with different views of how this should best be done.

In the Shadow of War

BYLINE: By Anna Quindlen

 BODY:
On the imitation wood-grain surface of the table lay a pile of fliers, small print dominated by letters two inches high: STOP THE WAR NOW! Like Proust's madeleine on low-grade bond, it flung me back, to hundreds of undergraduate bulletin boards, dozens of speeches, but especially to one march in 1972. I held my notebook like a shield between my face and the angry man, on his way home from the night shift, who was watching people move down the avenue beneath banners of peace. "Put down that they're a disgrace to this country," he shouted over the noise of the chanting. "Put down that I'm a veteran of World War II."
By the imitation wood-grain table sat a man, narrow as an exclamation point, telling why he came to the first meeting of the New York City chapter of the Military Families Support Network. "I'm a World War II veteran," he said softly. "My youngest son is in the gulf. I keep thinking there's going to be a war. There must be another way of dealing with this. It seems to be going on every 20 years. It has to stop." 
 Today we wake in the shadow of war, some from the sound sleep of onlookers, others from the long nights of parents, wives, husbands and children of soldiers. The antiwar effort now is immediate and powerful, as though it were a kind of retribution. This time, the activists seem to be saying, we will get it right. There are marches and vigils planned aplenty. There is an 800 number that provides information on resistance and a 900 number that arranges overnight delivery of letters to senators and Congressmen. Every leading religious denomination and several powerful labor unions have come out in opposition to war in the Persian Gulf.
This is not because of great similarities between Southeast Asia and the Middle East. It is because of great differences between who we are now and who we were then. With the end of the cold war, the bust of our economic boom and the disintegration of our families, we are a nation struggling to understand itself. One of the most powerful events of our national history was fermenting and souring 20 years ago, a war that divided and defined us in ways we came to hate.
Our national character has changed. Our notions of masculinity, always linked to our notions of face and force, are different today. The woman thing, as the President might call it, has shaped this event. Statistics show a gender gap: 57 percent of men in a recent Times poll favored military action if Iraq does not withdraw from Kuwait by Tuesday's deadline, while 37 percent said we should give sanctions more time to work. The results for women were almost exactly the opposite: 36 percent voted for immediate action, 56 percent for patience.
Our earliest image of this conflict was of women in camouflage fatigues kissing their children goodbye; say what we will about the idea that fathers are as important as mothers, it made some people think on a more human scale about what war means. (Memo to Senator Alfonse D'Amato: Forget the rhetoric about "our boys" during debates and fast-forward to 1991.) Last week a group of feminists demonstrated, personifying the button making the rounds: We're Going To War To Defend People Who Won't Let Women Drive?
To the extent that we still think of men as resolving differences through force and women through talk, there is a feminization of national feeling. Macho is no longer our national pastime, and there seems to be a declining number of little boys exhorted "Go out there and fight like a man." So far, no "Love It or Leave It" bumper stickers. "I love my country, but . . ." began two of the testimonials at the Military Families Support Network meeting.
We no longer have illusions about war. We have seen the carnage on CNN. Some protesters are sending the White House black plastic trash bags, to remind the President of how people come home from combat. The shadow that hangs over us all seems to be the shadow of another war. But it is really the shadow of what we will think of ourselves when this is over. Dorothy Thompson, for many years America's most prominent woman columnist, wrote a column after World War II about disarmament. "You cannot talk to the mothers with planes and atomic bombs," she wrote. "You must come into the room of your mother unarmed."
Some of her editors found her sentiments treacly and hard to take. They need to be updated in one respect; many of the fathers now feel the same way. Some people consider this a failure of will. I think it's progress.

HEADLINE: On the Eve of Drifting Into War, Once Again;
Justice for All

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I am 22 years old and torn over the question of what I will do if war breaks out in the Persian Gulf. Am I morally compelled to offer my life to fulfill the objectives of Operation Desert Shield? International leadership, as guided by President Bush, has made this difficult to answer.
If the objective is to insure that powerful nations cannot usurp the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of militarily weaker ones, with might alone serving as justification, the answer is yes. If it is to insure that the industrialized world can continue to run its motors at convenient costs, the answer is no.
Contradiction arises in considering these two possibilities in light of global circumstances. The relationship between China and Tibet shows a situation where it is internationally tolerable for a powerful nation to usurp the independence of a weaker one, even while committing confirmed human rights abuses. The Soviet Union's illegal occupation of the Baltic republics shows another such situation.
The world offers many examples of powerful governments forcing their wills on weaker nations. Though few so simply and indisputably constitute injustices as the cases of Kuwait, Tibet and the Baltic republics, all demand serious discussion.
My point is that if I am to offer my life to accomplish the goals of Operation Desert Shield, I need an assurance that the same conviction will be devoted to the correction of all situations where might has unjustly made right, and not just to the ones where there is an attractive economic interest.

HEADLINE: Why a Cashless Society Wouldn't Work;
Shades of Technocracy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Harvey F. Wachsman is probably right that an all-electronic, universally accepted transfer of symbolic assets in a cashless society would do wonders to curb the underground economy, stifle the drug trade and maybe raise Federal revenues.
Aside from the ever-present danger of catastrophic systemwide failure or sabotage of any such mega-grid or the myriad of little practical quandaries (would every taxicab also carry an electronic currency station aboard; would every child be issued a biomedically impregnated card and present it at every vending machine to be deducted from his or her allowance?), there is a fundamental question of social organization that ought to precede any such hypertech fix.
In the 1930's, there was a movement in the United States called Technocracy, made up of engineers and scientists who wished to get away from cash by issuing scrip to the populace, denominated not in dollars but in energy units. They proposed basing charges for each article on the energy units used in its production and distribution.
In those precomputer days, it was quite a feat to imagine a gigantic clearinghouse allocating credit to each citizen and balancing the resulting supply and demand. To its credit, Technocracy began by acknowledging that modern industrial society was inherently wasteful, that most of our manufactured goods could easily be redesigned to last a lifetime, that the whole industrial system could be allowed to slow down or operate only intermittently -- and that our work hours and living patterns could be adjusted accordingly, as long as everybody received the basic citizen allocation of credit as a fundamental insurance of survival in a technological society.
We might re-examine the premises of our social compact before we sink further into the quagmire of mere technofixes.

Day 3: Remarks in Congress During the Last Hours of Debate

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the debate in Congress Friday night and today on President Bush's request for support for military action in the Persian Gulf, as transcribed by The New York Times:
 
 
 
Senator Robert C. Byrd
Democrat of West Virginia
 Now Mr. President, a superpower has claws and it has teeth. The superpower, as against this third world power, doesn't have to be impatient or impetuous. A superpower doesn't have to feel rushed. We can afford to be patient and let sanctions work. They say the morale of our soldiers will suffer. Mr. President, we should have thought about this before we proceeded to double our forces and terminate the rotation policy in the Middle East. Nothing damages morale more than early large losses of life. . . .
Mr. President, the two economic giants of Germany and Japan have hardly spoken eloquently with their pocketbooks. They have only opted to hold our coats while we take on Hussein. Mr. President, I think this is a shame and a disgrace that Germany and Japan, two countries which will benefit far more than will the United States, two countries whose need for the oil of the Middle East far exceeds our need, will stand by and cynically watch American men and women shed their blood in the sands of the Arabian desert and refuse to help to finance in their treasury the costs of this effort.
I think, Mr. President, I have difficulty finding the words to express my feelings that other nations would stand by. It's a monstrous disgrace and the American people will remember it.
 
 Representative Ted Weiss
 Democrat of Manhattan
 Speaker, when we take those 30 seconds to take the oath of office and we raise our right hands and we puff out our chests, that's not just a formula that we're going through. We swear to preserve and protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.
When we do that, we do it in the particular. And for the last 10 years at least, there has been such a tremendous erosion of our commitment to protecting and defending and preserving the Constitution.
And this institution has played a role in that. We've abdicated. When we think that it's O.K. to wage small wars ourselves, whether it's Grenada or Panama, without the prior approval of the Congress, it seems to me that we're eroding the Constitution.
And when we try to depend on international law, having set that kind of example, we erode the Constitution and our leadership role.
The Bennett-Durbin Resolution should be adopted, because it reasserts that which the founders of this nation intended -- that the people make that fateful decision. And it should be done at this time. It is being done; it wouldn't have been done if the Secretary of State or the President had been left to their own. This body made that happen. Let's adopt this resolution to make it absolutely clear.
 
Senator Bob Graham
 Democrat of Florida

 We make a basic mistake, I suggest, if we think that what we are dealing with is one man -- Saddam Hussein. I see Saddam Hussein not as the cause of those fundamental events, but rather as the guileful person who has taken advantage of those and other fundamental factors occurring in this region.
We also, drastically, have contributed to the past. We have accommodated Iraq over a period of more than a decade, accommodated in terms of covertly assisting them in the war with Iran, within the shadow of the invasion of Kuwait, continuing to extend substantial economic assistance to Iraq.
We also have contributed to the past by our failure to have a sustained commitment to a rational national energy policy, failure which has made us increasingly hostage to the circumstances in the Middle East and the personalities of today's and tomorrow's Saddam Husseins.
Looking to the future, I would suggest that as we attempt to assess how we should respond to the current crisis today, we should ask ourselves what do we want to have as some of the consequences not just of the next 10 or 60 days but over the next decade in this region and what do they say about U.S. policy around the world in this new post-cold-war era.
I am going to support the resolution which will give the President of the United States the authority to use force. I am going to do so because I believe that the President of the United States deserves to have a presumption of correctness of his actions, and that he especially deserves to have a presumption of correctness as it relates to matters of our national security and relations with other nations.
I am reluctant to draw universal conclusions from a short visit to the Middle East, but that reluctance will be overcome to this extent: that I came away with the sense that this was an an extremely complex fabric of interrelated and divergent issues, factors, personalities, history and culture that we were dealing with in this crisis. It is not just the simple issue of a large and powerful state invading, pillaging and occupying a weak neighbor. And that the institution of the Presidency was in the best position to integrate, evaluate, assess options and implications of those options, and reach a judgment which was in the national interest.
 
 Representative Thomas S. Foley
Democrat of Washington
 I would not feel it right as a Speaker to stand behind the usual custom not to vote and not to speak on the question of this importance. I do not ask anyone to follow me but I do as you feel so often I think, the need to explain to my constituents, to those who have sent me here why I will cast a vote for Hamilton-Gephardt and against the Michel-Solarz amendment.
Those who believe that the President must now be armed with what is unquestionably . . . a virtual declaration of war, those who believe that that must be done, should not hesitate to vote that way, should not hesitate to give him that power.
But let me suggest to you one thing. Do not do it under the notion that you merely hand him another diplomatic tool, another quiver of economic leverage or international leverage.
The President has had no doubt about this. He has said again and again that if given that power he may well use it and perhaps sooner than we realize. If that is your judgment vote honorably and calmly and securely.
But if you feel that more can be done, if you feel that the sanctions have not yet wasted their opportunity, if you believe that Saddam Hussein is growing weaker everyday under their impression, if you believe the international coalition will hold, if you believe that this nation's leadership is best expressed in this body and in the other body and in the coalition of constitutional consent, then vote for Hamilton-Gephardt.
But however you vote, as the majority leader has said, let us come together after the vote with the notion that we are Americans here, not Democrats and not Republicans, all anxious to do the best for your country without recrimination as to motive, without anything but the solemn cry that on this great decision day we voted as our conscience and judgment told us we should. And then though our opinion may change over the years, we will not bear the burden of a harsh judgment on our honor and our actions at this moment.
 
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato
 Republican of New York -
 Mr. President, Saddam Hussein is like a glutton, a geopolitical glutton. He's sitting down at the banquet table overflowing with goodies. And let me tell you, like every glutton, he's going to have them all. Kuwait is just the appetizer. He's gobbling it up. But it's not going to satisfy him. After a noisy belch or two, he's going to reach across the table for the next morsel. Now what's it going to be -- Saudi Arabia? Could be. The U.A.E? Who knows? I don't.
But I do know two things with absolute certainty: he's going to keep grabbing and gobbling, and the main course somewhere on that menu is the State of Israel. The Israelis know that and that's one big reason that Prime Minister Shamir within the past 48 hours has again stated his unequivocal support for President Bush's policy.
What's a little hard for me to understand is how some of Israel's strongest supporters in this body have joined into this chorus of "Let's give Saddam more time." Saddam has already had too much time. And I'm not talking about just these past five months, Mr. President. I'm talking about the years and years in which we, the United States, ignored his brutality, condoned his repeated aggressions against both his neighbors and many of his own people, and actually subsidized him with American taxpayers' money. It's time, Mr. President, to blow the whistle on Saddam Hussein. It is time to let him know, this grisly glutton, that the free lunch is over. It's time for him to pay the bill.
 
Senator Charles S. Robb
 Democrat of Virginia
 We can and should take the President to task if we disagree with him on a whole variety of matters here at home -- from the budget to the rest of the domestic agenda.
But in the great issues of war and peace, I believe we ought to make every effort possible to speak with one voice, or at least with the strongest majority voice possible.
On balance, the majority of us would give the President very high marks for the way he has handled the gulf challenge to date. Yet now that we have reached the truly critical stage, I believe it would be a fundamental mistake to give even the appearance of withdrawing our trust and support.
There is no question that the risks are great. I don't want to minimize the potential consequences if we're wrong. We can't escape responsibility for the actions we are about to authorize, and we shouldn't. We are risking thousands of American lives, and that fact weighs on the conscience of every member here -- particularly on those who have known the unhumane brutality of combat firsthand. And maybe future Saddam Husseins will act rationally when they look back on how the free world responded to the first real challege to the concept of collective security in the post-cold-war era.
Let's give peace a chance by giving the President the authority he believes he needs to achieve it.
And if Saddam Hussein understands that we have not only the capability but the will to carry out such an attack if necessary, maybe he'll act rationally in the first instance and we'll be able to bring the troops home soon.
 
 Representative Charles E. Bennett
 Democrat of Florida
 When I first came to Congress, I wore a ribbon, the Silver Star. I did it partly for apology for being crippled. I haven't been wearing it recently. I'm not quite sure why I'm not wearing it. But I do know this, that when I was given that, I was given that with a citation that said, "Gallantry in Action." Friends, there's no such thing as gallantry in action.
I don't want to run down anybody else's award. But action -- military action -- is a horrible experience. There's no gallantry in it. There's no beauty in it. It's a horrible experience. It's up to us in Congress to bite the bullet ourselves and to do something about seeing to it that peace is secured, if it can be secured, for the benefit of everybody, and it can be done.
There are things that are unmentionable, things that can't be linked, for instance, that antagonizes a lot of people. But the world knows if this war ends the way it's now going, we're going to have a worse war in the future, a much worse war which may last for thousands of years.
So this question of settling the Palestine problem, protecting Israel in its boundary and things like that are things that can be met. That takes courage because it can defeat us to do anything about it. But that's why we were elected. We were elected to make this kind of decision. We weren't elected to stay here forever. We were not elected for our salaries. We were elected to take a responsible position of government when the opportunity came -- comes to take it, and that's what we're not doing it unless we pass some way to see to it this process of trying to find a solution to this, other than combat, takes place. That's our responsibility. That's the courage that we must show today, and this is the place it has to be. It's not in Saudi Arabia. It's here in Washington, D.C., in this chamber today.
I'm 80 years of age. I've been in this chamber for 43 years. Out of the 17,000 votes I've cast, the only one I really regret was the one which I cast for the Bay of Tonkin resolution. I particularly regret it because I knew that it was a declaration of war, and just as is the Solarz measure before us today, it's a declaration of war. And if you pass it, you make a compliance with the thing that I'm now asking you to vote for, which is to say you ought to decide ----
. . . it means that a vote ought to be cast on the basis of what you think is best for our country, not best for the Democratic or Republican Party, not best for the President, not best for you, but what's best for our country and what's best for the world.
So take that in your heart. Hold it close to you and realize this is a tremendously important opportunity you have here today, and cast your vote on that basis.
 
 Representative Nancy Pelosi
 Democrat of California
 The King of Jordan last night on "Nightline" said that if we go to war, we could have an ecological disaster of the first order. Some of the consequences could be -- and this is according to the United Nations Environment Program -- oil spills equal to a dozen Exxon Valdez spills coursing through gulf waters; oil fires raging for weeks and perhaps months; smoke and debris blocking sunlight, causing temperatures to drop and altering crop seasons which could result in widespread famine; toxic plumes ascending to the upper atmosphere and falling as acid rain; millions of fish, dolphins, sea birds and other marine life wash onto Gulf shores; chemical contamination of air, water and vegetation; the Persian Gulf as a dead sea.
The point has already been made how important it is for us to have an energy policy to avoid such conflicts in the future. The point is already made how we have to have a better policy toward nuclear disarmament. I hope the point will be made that we take very seriously the environmental consequences of our actions.
 
 Senator Robert J. Dole
 Republican of Kansas
 I think everyone would agree that sanctions without a credible military threat would never have any severe impact on Iraq or Saddam Hussein.
Now I've said to the President of the United States in a meeting with Republicans and Democrats that we need to pursue every avenue for a peaceful solution. I've said to the President of the United States, when I look into the eyes of a young man in the desert in Saudi Arabia I see his parents, maybe his children, his spouse. And if we talk about burden-sharing as we have in the dollar terms, wait until we start counting the deaths, how many Egypitans, how many Americans, how many Saudis, how many British. This is the real burden-sharing.
And I've implored the President, who also has been there in World War II, that what we are attempting to do in the Congress of the United States is to strengthen his hand for peace, not to give him the license to see how fast we can become engaged in armed conflict.
As far as this Senator knows, nothing in the United Nations resolution says that on the 15th you have to do something. But I think on the 15th, Saddam Hussein will understand that if he wants peace he can have it.
So Mr. President, I know that everyone in this chamber wants Saddam Hussein to get out of Kuwait, and some have additional demands they would make on Saddam Hussein. I believe that the resolution we're about to vote on does exactly the wrong thing. As I've indicated, it actually gives Saddam Hussein a holiday from the threat that we might use force. . . .
It would seem to me that the pending resolution wipes out this credible threat unless we're going to maintain 400,000 men there and all the military threat we have up until some day in the future, maybe this year or next year or the next year. And I've always thought that if he had sort of a holiday, as Saddam Hussein would have, that he probably wouldn't just take the holiday, he'd probably dig in deeper and make preparations so he can inflict even more casualties on the United States and on our young men and our young women and other forces from other allied nations in this period. So it's a two-edged sword.
So it seems to me we have to think about the ultimate result. Do we save lives by waiting six months or waiting a year? Or do we by our votes today indicate to Saddam Hussein that now it's up to you? . . .
So I would hope, Mr. President, that we're going to demonstrate today that the President of the United States is the Commander in Chief. The Congress of the United States certainly has a role to play. I said last November and December we ought to have been here debating then, when the policy was being formulated instead of coming in at the 11th hour after having been AWOL for three or four months and trying to change the direction of the policy President Bush has so patiently and successfully put together. This is not the United States versus Iraq. It's the entire international community with just a few exceptions versus Saddam Hussein and Iraq.
 
Representative Thomas M. Foglietta
 Democrat of Pennsylvania
 I sit on the Armed Services Committee and we have heard experts come in and talk to us about the number of casualties, the number of young American men and women who will come back to us in body bags. Those estimates have ranged from as low as a thousand on up to 40 or 50 thousand. I say to you that we should do all we can to seek peace, to prevent those body bags from coming back to this country. So far, we have negotiated. We had one meeting -- one meeting, which lasted for six hours, during which time our representatives, our Secretary of State, issued an ultimatum: either you do what we say or else.
Don't you believe that those 10 to 40 or 50 thousand young men and women deserve more? Deserve more time, more consideration and more negotiation? I do.
 
 Senator Al Gore
 Democrat of Tennessee
 My decision today is the product of an intense, may I say excruciating, effort to find my way to a place as close to a sense of the ultimate truth in this matter as I am capable of getting.
I've struggled to confront this issue in its bare essence -- to separate what I think is fact, or at least highly probable, from what I think is false, or at least highly improbable -- to strike a balance and to take my stand.
We've all made that journey, regardless of where it has lead us. Each of us has stood here to describe it. And now it is my turn. I stood in a different place halfway through last year, when men and women from my home town in Carthage, Tenn., joined the units of many other towns across this country, leaving their loved ones, saying goodbye to husbands and wives and children and parents and preparing to become part of this army now massed in the desert of Saudi Arabia.
I felt, up until recently, especially after the hearings in which I played an active role, questioning, probing, searching for the truth, I felt that I would support a move to continue the sanctions and hold open the option of force at a later time. As I searched my heart on this issue over the last few days with special intensity after we all heard the Secretary of State enunciate the word regrettably in Geneva, I found myself feeling that if I voted for the Mitchell nonresolution I would do so hoping that it did not prevail. I found myself feeling even late last night that since it now appears that there is a majority in favor of the other point of view that it would pass and will pass regardless of how I vote.
I found myself pulled once again to support the Mitchell nonresolution, speaking only of the process I've gone through.
And, Mr. President, I feel that I owe it to those who are there prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice, to give the best judgment of my head and my heart on what this nation should now do. I cannot reconcile myself to a point of view and a vote that says in effect, we will let this deadline come and go and try the sanctions perhaps until the next window, next August when military operations would again become feasible.
 
Representative Bud Shuster
 Republican of Pennsylvania
 Mr. Speaker, we're asked, what's the hurry? Well, after five months of rebuffed diplomacy, every day that this Congress procrastinates Saddam's factories are producing more chemical and biological weapons; more anthrax, more botulism, more sarin, which is a lethal nerve gas, and yes, more progress on nuclear weapons.
And make no mistake about it, my colleagues, if we must resort to military force, those factories of death and destruction and terrorism will surely be targets.
So today, not next week, not next month, but today, we must give the President the authority to remove this scourge or the face of history will pass judgment upon us as the Congress that failed to do its duty.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 15, 1991, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of a transcription error, excerpts on Sunday from a speech about the Persian Gulf by Senator Al Gore, Democrat of Tennessee, rendered the name of a resolution incorrectly. The passage should have read, "I found myself feeling that if I voted for the Mitchell-Nunn resolution, I would do so hoping that it would not prevail." The Senator did not say "Mitchell nonresolution."

HEADLINE: Banking's Real Estate Miseries

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Imagine every office building in Manhattan empty, a commercial ghost town. Now double it. That's how much vacant office space -- 500 million square feet -- there is in the United States today. Behind much of that empty office space stands the nation's banking system.
The Bank of New England was pulled down by a massive pile of loans made to build office towers, apartment complexes and shopping strips that went sour -- a pile that grew steadily as the local economy withered. The Boston-based institution is a magnified example, but it's clear that the entire American banking system went on a commercial real estate binge in the 1980's, and it's equally clear that the binge has brought on a period of worsening troubles now in the early the 90's. 
No one is predicting that the real estate troubles will prompt a replay of the 30's, when thousands of American banks failed. But concern for the banking system runs deep. "Our banks are going into this recession weaker than they have been since the 1930's," said James Barth, a professor of finance at Auburn University.
The crucial issue for the nation's more than 12,000 banks in this recession will be handling their real estate problems. To be sure, the banks have other trouble spots, including the risky loans to finance large takeovers and a legacy of overly ambitious lending to developing countries. But real estate lending is by far the largest problem area for the banking system as a whole, especially as the United States enters a recession with banking's profits meager and its cushion of capital to offset losses badly depleted.
With the economy slumping, the real estate troubles of the banks go well beyond the foolish decisions of the previous decade of excess, when overzealous lenders poured money into everything from churches built on speculation to a "high-rise country club" in Texas that was never more than a hole in the ground. Today, major banks who lent money for blue-chip projects in excellent locations suddenly find themselves with vacant office buildings that may not be filled for years, like the stylish 73 Tremont Street building in downtown Boston, backed by J.P. Morgan and 95 percent vacant, or the sleek Gatehall complex in suburban New Jersey, owned by Chase Manhattan and 70 percent empty. Or 1515 Broadway, a Manhattan office tower now owned by Manufacturers Hanover. It is 88 percent full, but with rents falling is losing an estimated $30 million a year.
 
A Spreading Recession
 The worry today is that the real estate recession, which is spreading nationally, could severely weaken the banking system, pulling down many smaller banks and a few big ones as well. L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, told Congress last Wednesday that more large bank failures like the Bank of New England could occur if the recession were not "short and shallow." Banking regulators have estimated that 170 to 200 banks will fail this year, which will mean that the fund that protects bank deposits will lose $5 billion.
But if the experience of the savings and loan crisis is any guide, Washington's cost estimates of problems in the financial system could escalate sharply. Some private estimates are much higher. A severe recession driven partly by failed real estate projects and loans could force the cost of bank problems to the F.D.I.C. into the $40-to-$60 billion range over the next few years, according to David C. Cates, chairman of Ferguson & Company, a bank consulting firm.
Other analysts view those numbers as high, but not outlandish. A recent McKinsey & Company study concluded that the cost of bank failures over the next few years to the Government's bank insurance fund could be $20 billion, assuming that commercial real estate loan values are marked down 20 percent in the regions of the country going through severe real estate recessions. If commercial real estate values fall 25 percent, McKinsey estimates the losses could reach $40 billion. (In the Texas real estate slide of the 80's, commercial real estate loans lost 35 percent of their value.) Losses of the magnitude of these private projections would be another big drain on the economy and the pocketbooks of the nation's taxpayers.
"The danger is that we get a downward spiral with the real estate problems leading to more bank failures, then a credit crunch that affects other industries and increases the depth and duration of the recession," said Richard J. Boyle, vice chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank. the nation's third-largest bank.
Mr. Boyle and others are hopeful that what some bankers call a "death spiral" can be avoided. But they stress that containing the wreckage in the banking industry and curbing the cost to America's taxpayers will require skillful management and patience by both the banks and Government regulators to work the real estate problems out of the financial system -- a painful cleansing process that will take years, they say.
 
A Quick Response
 Yet fashioning a coordinated Government-industry solution to the problem will not be easy. A major issue is how banks and regulators place a value on real estate loans. After the savings and loan debacle, in which Federal examiners were blamed for moving too slowly, they are now moving quickly to have banks recognize problems, mark down the value of troubled loans and take losses.
However, bankers and accountants argue that in today's depressed real estate market valuing a property and the loan behind it based on what the property could be sold for at the moment is misleading -- and likely to make the banks' troubles worse. Losses reduce a bank's capital and thus its ability to make new loans, which makes less credit available to finance economic recovery. This "mark to market" approach to valuing real estate, however well-intentioned, needs to be modified to solve the real estate problem, bankers insist.
"The mark to market concept makes no sense because a market does not exist today, " said Mr. Boyle. "Real estate is not like an orange -- it isn't going to rot. Real estate values will rise again eventually, and the issue for any institution is whether it has the staying power to make it through this severe downturn. But the regulations almost encourage more bank failures. The banking industry is facing a long-term problem and it needs a long-term solution."
Robert L. Clarke, the Comptroller of the Currency, replies that it is not so much the regulators' standards that have changed but the real estate markets', particularly in depressed regions like New England. "The changed environment," he explained, "has forced us to look at the quality of loans much more closely." Moreover, regulators contend that the tough approach forces the banks to face up to their real estate troubles before things get worse and the taxpayers have to pick up the bill.
 
The Plunge Into Lending
 Solutions to the current problem may be a matter of dispute, but how the banks got into the real estate quagmire is not.
They plunged into real estate, lending with abandon in the late 80's. From 1985 to 1989, roughly 60 percent of all new bank lending was in real estate, mainly for commercial properties. Real estate loans as a share of total bank loans jumped over those years from 25 percent to a record 37 percent. It was a lending spree prompted by a blend of optimism and necessity. Traditional corporate customers were increasingly sidestepping the banks by raising money for themselves in the securities and debt markets. Besides, real estate lending seemed a sure thing for the banks during the 80's, as the value of everything from office buildings to homes continued to go up and up.
The 1981 tax law, which allowed investors to depreciate property over 15 years instead of 30 years, made investment even more attractive, as office and apartment buildings became tax shelters. The deregulation in 1982 of the savings and loan industry freed them up to invest their deposits in real estate, bringing in a group of inexperienced but aggressive investors. With lenders eager, developers were able to get easy terms, such as loans of 100 percent or more of the presumed value of a project. The 1986 Tax Reform Act removed the special tax benefits for real estate investment, but money kept flowing into property projects.
 
A Vicious Cycle
 The glut of commercial real estate resulted, with rents falling and buildings vacant across much of America. The vacancy rate for downtown office space has soared to 17 percent nationally, up from less than 4 percent a decade ago and more than double the historic average of roughly 8 percent. The scarcity of tenants means developers have trouble paying their loans; eventually they default, leaving the banks with mounting loan losses and as reluctant landlords.
Regionally, this process of deterioration familiar. It occurred first in Texas, where the Government bolstered the state's failed banks with a $7 billion rescue fund in 1987; now New England appears similarly threatened. "Our real estate market is as bad as we've had since the 1930's," said Leo Spang, a Boston banker and president of the Real Estate Finance Association, a trade group.
Though not as bad as Boston, suburban and downtown markets all along the East Coast are weak. The Middle West participated less in the 80's real estate boom than the two coasts, so has held up better.
Even California, whose vibrant economy has long overperformed the rest of the country, seems in trouble. During the 80's, California's huge construction industry doubled its employment, to about 650,000 workers. But today, both office and home prices in the coastal areas surrounding Los Angeles and San Francisco are slipping, and private economists predict that the California economy will shrink this year. "We have all the makings right now of a recession in California, and real estate is a big part of the reason," said David Hensley, senior economist at the University of California at Los Angeles Business Forecasting Project.
The current slump is more than a cyclical dip, far worse than the mid-70's slide when the banks suffered large losses on real estate. First, the overbuilding during the 80's was much greater than in previous real estate cycles, so the "inventory" of vacant buildings will take longer to fill. Salomon Brothers estimates that there is a 10-year supply of office space already built.
Second, demographics are working against a rebound in demand for commercial space. The low birth rates in the 1970-75 period, or "baby bust" years, mean that two decades later fewer new workers will be entering the labor force from 1990 to 1995. The shift of American women into the workforce has also leveled off. Finally, the brunt of job losses during the current recession have been in industries that are major consumers of office space, including finance, insurance and real estate, and more job cuts are expected in those fields.
"This real estate crisis is far worse than past cycles in the industry," said David Shulman, managing director for real estate research at Salomon Brothers. "And that means that digging our way out of this hole will take longer."
 
The Cost of Foreclosure
 The Gatehall office complex in Parsippany, N.J., about 25 miles west of Manhattan, illustrates how a regional economic downturn can hit a lending bank and why the banks' real estate problems will likely take years to work through. The 250,000 square foot project was conceived by a local developer in the optimism of the mid-80's, when the New York economy was in full bloom. Chase Manhattan Bank had loaned about $40 million for the project, said Richard Byrne, a bank vice president, who explained that he was using "rounded off" numbers. By the time Gatehall was opened in 1988, the region's economy had slowed considerably. When the building's largest tenant, an insurance company, pulled out last year, the developer could no longer pay the interest on its loans and Chase Manhattan foreclosed on the property.
When it took over the property, Chase absorbed a roughly $10 million charge against earnings because the estimated market value of Gatehall was about 25 percent less than its original $40 million loan. Gatehall is an attractive stone-and-glass office building, with an artificial waterfall, atrium and other amenitities. Chase executives are confident it will become a valuable property once the local economy rebounds. But today, it sits 70 percent vacant, further improvements like walls, air conditioning and interior decorating may cost another $10 to $25 a square foot to lure tenants. In a weak market, tenants have a strong bargaining position and may be able to sign several-year leases allowing them to make no rent payments for a year or two.
Mr. Byrne, a 15-year veteran of Chase's real estate business, spends his days shuttling around the country -- he was in New York, Boston and Dallas last week -- attending to Chase's problematic real estate loans. He huddles with brokers, advises project managers and cajoles prospective tenants. In a foreclosed property like Gatehall, the bank makes all the key decisions, from fine points of interior decor to what tenants to pursue. "The closer you are to ownership, the closer you have to be to the real estate," Mr. Byrne said. "It's a hands-on business. You have to nurture value back into a property."
 
Hoping for an Upswing
 The goal at Gatehall is gradually to get enough tenants into the building to generate a stream of income that, in turn, will attract a buyer for the property. With skill and a strengthening economy, it is entirely possible that Chase could sell the Gatehall property to an investor for more than the marked down value of the original loan, with the difference becoming a profit for Chase. (After taking $800 million in real estate loan writeoffs in the mid-70's, the bank eventually recovered more than half that amount.) How this failed loan in New Jersey will turn out for the bank is impossible to predict but, in any case, the answer will probably not come quickly; Mr. Byrne says it may be three to five years before Chase sells Gatehall. "Every dollar that we get through this process is a dollar that is not lost for the bank," Mr. Byrne said. "What more can you do for a bank?"
 
THE REGULATORY OUTLOOK
 Most of the blame for the banking system's real estate lending woes today can be laid at the doorstep of the banks themselves. But it is also true that the regulatory limits on banking tend to encourage a focus on the few businesses open to them that seem attractive. During the 80's, commercial real estate was hot. The changes in banking now being considered in Washington, would allow banks to become national and diversify their risks.
The Treasury has proposed letting banks get into the securities business, permitting them to become interstate banks and allowing industrial companies to own banks. But in exchange for these new freedoms, there would be restrictions on what risks banks can take with Federally insured deposits. Congress and the Administration seems to be heading toward a regulatory category of "core" banks financed with Government-insured deposits that could engage in less risky businesses like consumer banking. Bank holding companies could engage in more risky areas like commercial real estate lending and financing of takeovers, but not with insured deposits, thus in theory protecting taxpayers from the banks' bad loan decisions.
 
ASSIGNING A PRICE TO PROPERTY
 Valuing a piece of commercial real estate, and the loan behind it, is as much an art as a science.
The calculation typically means establishing a value to a property based on its ability to generate a flow of income from rents and other sources. For the banking industry, which during the 80's boom often loaned developers 100 percent of the estimated value of a project, the "valuation" issue today is central.
With vacancy rates high and rents decling, valuing a property at its current worth -- the approach being pressed by regulators -- can mean big loan writeoffs, an erosion of a bank's capital and a diminished ability to lend in general to finance economic recovery.
Yet bankers argue that is much fairer and economically wiser to look at real estate for its long-term worth -- not its value at the moment.

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the real estate troubles of American banks misstated the involvement of J. P. Morgan & Company with a Boston office building, 73 Tremont Street. A subsidiary, J. P. Morgan Investment Management Inc., invested pension money from clients in the office development and the Morgan-managed fund is now the principal investor in the building. The bank itself made no loans to the Boston building.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Creating a Theater of Different American Voices

BYLINE: By HILARY DE VRIES; Hilary de Vries writes about the arts for The Los Angeles Times and other publications.

 BODY:
"I hate the word sexism," says Emily Mann, stubbing out a cigarette in a Manhattan cafe. "But as a director you produce what you need to produce, and in this country there is a feeling that people don't want to hear stories about women. But I'm an optimist. Things can change. And with more and more women running arts institutions -- yes, they are -- I think you can stage all kinds of stories."
A director as well as the author of the plays "Annulla: A Survivor," "Still Life" and "Execution of Justice," Ms. Mann has earned a reputation as a chronicler of women, war veterans and the gay community. 
 Now, she is bringing her populist vision to a new role as artistic director of the McCarter Theater Center for the Performing Arts in Princeton, N.J., one of the state's oldest and largest not-for-profit stages. Not only is Ms. Mann one of the few dramatists heading an American regional theater, but her appointment adds to the small but growing ranks of influential women artistic directors -- a list that includes Sharon Ott at the Berkeley Repertory Theater and JoAnne Akalaitis at the Public Theater, Lynne Meadow at the Manhattan Theater Club and Carey Perloff at the CSC -- all in New York.
 Originally the home of Princeton University's amateur dramatics club, the 62-year-old McCarter had become a $5 million performing-arts center known as much for presenting dance and musical events as for producing plays. Under the previous artistic director, Nagle Jackson, the theater was a respected but low-profile company mostly staging revivals of British and European comedies and dramas.
Ms. Mann, who cites Brecht and Beckett as her theatrical influences, sees her three-year appointment as an opportunity to create a higher-profile, more issue-oriented theater that will be the center's flagship operation.
"The question is 'Do you want to be just a booking house or do you want to be a great theater, which means producing?' " she said during a recent interview in Manhattan. "There are invisible racial and economic barriers that I want to break down with this theater. I want to create a theater of different American voices."
Her first season at the McCarter, which opens Friday after completion of an $8 million renovation, has been culled from "old and new masters and emerging American writers," the director said. The first production, starring Shirley Knight, is a revival of Tennessee Williams's classic, "The Glass Menagerie," a play Ms. Mann has done successfully before. It will be followed next month by "Those the River Keeps," the world premiere of a new David Rabe play, and by "Betsy Brown," a rhythm-and-blues musical by Ntozake Shange and Ms. Mann opening in April. The season is to conclude in May with "Film Society," a drama about South Africa by the young American playwright John Baitz.
"I'm interested in American musicals, global writing and new work as well as the classics," Ms. Mann said. "I want this theater's focus to be on great writers and great actors and to be truly an American experience."
After graduating from Harvard University in the early 1970's, Ms. Mann, who is in her late 30's, began her professional career as a resident director for the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York and, later, at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, where she directed an acclaimed revival of "The Glass Menagerie." She subsequently directed at several regional theaters, including the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, the Goodman Theater in Chicago and the Hartford Stage Company.
She has had one Broadway production, the 1986 "Execution of Justice," her dramatization of the events surrounding the slayings in 1978 of Mayor George Moscone of San Francisco and Harvey Milk, a city supervisor and the first avowed homosexual to hold high public office in that city.
The play had several successful regional productions before it went to Broadway, where it ran for 8 previews and 12 regular performances in 1986. In his review, Mel Gussow wrote in The New York Times that the play, which Ms. Mann also directed, was a "bold attempt to explore not just one crime but contemporary moral values and the criminal justice system."
Despite its failure in New York, "Execution of Justice" has contributed to Ms. Mann's reputation as a theater artist concerned with moral and social issues as well as one who tends to write non-naturalistic political works based on documentary material. "Execution of Justice" used courtroom transcripts, while "Still Life," about the Vietnam War, and "Annulla," a dramatic monologue about the Holocaust, were written from a series of interviews she conducted with war survivors.
That such potentially static scenarios can be a drawback was a point raised by Frank Rich in his review in The Times of the 1981 "Still Life." "The setting is a conference table, complete with water pitchers and ashtrays, at which three characters sit to address the audience for 90 minutes," Mr. Rich wrote. "Though Miss Mann, who also directed, occasionally allows her capable actors to stretch their legs, her play's title all too literally describes its method."
Central to her interests, the director says, is staging more women's plays, such as Ms. Shange's "Betsy Brown." Ms. Mann describes the musical as "the coming-of-age story of a young black girl that is very different from a male coming-of-age story. I just feel it is rare for a white male producer to understand the work of a black woman. But once it is on stage, people respond to it as something that is simply human."
"Emily has a real sense of political fervor," said Mark Lamos, artistic director of the Hartford Stage Company. And according to Mark Bly, the former literary manager of the Guthrie Theater and the current dramaturg at the Seattle Repertory Theater, "As a writer, Emily has a gift for focusing on those political events that polarize a community. She hears the voices that are crying out to be heard about social issues."
Ms. Mann's selection by the McCarter's board of directors can be seen as an adventerous choice for a regional theater that is respected but low key. "We were looking for a higher profile for our theater," said Ruth Wilson, the board president. "In music, dance and other special events we were getting Lincoln Center-quality artists, but we knew there were other, better-known regional theaters out there, and we wanted the theater to be as strong."
To that end, Ms. Mann has implemented several changes offstage. She has eliminated the McCarter's resident company of actors in the hope of attracting bigger-name performers, installed the theater's first literary manager and expanded the community outreach program in local schools.
But significant challenges remain. Despite the McCarter's $5 million operating budget, only $1.2 million is allotted for theater productions. In addition, the McCarter, which for several years had received annual state arts grants of nearly $1 million, is now experiencing cutbacks, specifically a $240,000 decrease in state arts council support this season. Theater subscriptions, which had been as high as 12,000, have fallen to less than half that number -- a significant drop for a 1,000-seat house.
"This is a disastrous time for theater," Ms. Mann said. "We're in a recession. There is the furor over the National Endowment for the Arts. Tax laws are not in our favor. This a combat situation for the arts."
But, she added, "I think women are uniquely suited to work this way. Theater is about collaboration, about people working together, and that involves real nurturance. What you're doing in a resident theater is making artistic homes for people and enhancing the quality of life in a community. And that's long been a female job."

HEADLINE: For Glasnost in the Arts, Blues in the Night

BYLINE: By HILARY DE VRIES; Hilary de Vries writes about the arts for The Los
Angeles Times and other publications.

 BODY:
While Mikhail Gorbachev battles a sagging economy in the Soviet Union, glasnost has become one of the hottest trends of the American arts scene. Since the restoration of cultural relations between the two superpowers six years ago, the flow of artists from East to West has achieved near flood-tide proportions. In concert halls, regional theaters and museums around the country, the number of Soviet artists is at an all-time high: glasnost can also mean boffo box office.
 Long fascinated by such glamorous emigres as the dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov, Americans have more recently been entranced by Mr. Gorbachev's media triumphs involving the changes in Soviet society. It might be said that after the recent wave of Gorbymania, Soviet artists, long exiled to Siberia at the world's cultural parties, are now seated at the main table. 
Yet a number of American producers and directors believe that the quantity of Soviet culture being exported is beginning to outstrip demand, that the unprecedented influx of Soviet arts groups into the United States has brought a decline in quality, and that work by less than top-rank artists has resulted in lackluster commercial and critical response. The so-called glasnost industry, these arts leaders say, may have peaked and the shaking out begun.
 "That old cultural bugaboo that foreign-language arts don't play well here is still true," said Harvey Lichtenstein, president and executive producer of the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York. "Just because Soviet companies are feeling the pinch at home doesn't mean that Soviet culture is necessarily interesting or good. Many people have been sold a bill of goods by promoters and much of the hype has been misleading."
 Until a few years ago, American audiences were accustomed to infrequent and carefully regulated foreign tours by Soviet performers. Today, Soviet dance companies, theater ensembles and even circus troupes appear not only in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles but in Rochester, Houston, Minneapolis and Atlanta, as well as at numerous city-sponsored arts festivals. Individual Soviet artists now work directly with American arts groups, either as permanent company members or as guest performers.
 While extensive tours by major Soviet cultural troupes -- like the recent appearances by the Bolshoi Ballet -- may still play well with audiences and critics, smaller, less well-known groups are meeting with diminished success. And a handful of contemporary Soviet art exhibits, like the show "Between Spring and Summer: Soviet Conceptual Art in the Era of Late Communism," now on a tour of American cities, have received serious, though not rapturous, critical attention.
 Mixed reviews and less than enthusiastic audience response have greeted a number of productions at regional theaters during the last few years. These have involved either Soviet companies performing in Russian or Soviet directors working with American actors in English-language works. Among the recent collaborative efforts have been "Ivanov" at the Yale Repertory Theater, "Brothers and Sisters" at the Old Globe Theater in San Diego, "Crime and Punishment" at the Arena Stage in Washington, "Phaedra" at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass., and "Zoya's Apartment" at Circle in the Square in New York.
 "Russian companies are a tough sell," said Thomas Hall, managing director of the Old Globe, which was the host for the Maly Theater of Leningrad in 1989. The Maly production of "Brothers and Sisters" was part of the San Diego festival "Treasures of the Soviet Union." "Frankly," Mr. Hall said, "if we hadn't had the festival packaging around us, we would have been in terrible trouble."
 
Quality vs. Quantity

 Is It Russian Roulette?
 Many American arts leaders cite the benefits of such cultural exchanges, whether they channel much-needed hard currency to struggling Soviet artists and their institutions, help forge esthetic ties between the two nations or simply serve as windows through which to examine recent Soviet events.
 Yet do Americans, after all, clamor to see Soviet cultural presentations? Some critics and artistic directors suggest that the quantity of offerings may have as much to do with cultural hucksterism as with any real American appetitefor all things Russian.
 "I don't know if there is a hunger on the part of American audiences for Soviet culture," said Michael Kahn, artistic director of the Shakespeare Theater at the Folger in Washington, which was a recent host to the Georgian Film Actors' Studio, an experimental theater troupe of stage and film artists. "These appearances have more to do with awakening American audiences, who've been very insular."
 Robert Arsenault, a Washington-based Soviet arts consultant who worked on the New York International Festival of the Arts in 1988, said, "The bloom is not quite off the rose in terms of audience demand. But there is a lot of schlock coming in now, and a lot of producers think that just because it's Russian they can make a buck off it."
 According to Martha Coigny, president of the International Theater Institute, which has sponsored exchanges of Soviet and American artistic directors, "A lot of people have mounted Soviet productions because it's chic. It will be interesting to see what will go beyond the 'flavor of the month' syndrome. Now we are seeing interest being paid to African and Latin American groups as well as to those in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. The Soviet fashion may die down a bit."
 
Dollar Diplomacy

 Which Came First, Art or Rubles?
 The origins of the glasnost industry may, in fact, have been based more on the capitalistic needs of the Soviet Union than on any fascination by Americans for Soviet culture.
 Traditionally, Soviet-American cultural exchanges were a few choice events presented as the highly visible handmaid of diplomacy. In the mid-1970's, appearances by Soviet artists who performed in the United States were carefully controlled by the powerful Soviet Ministry of Culture and a handful of experienced presenters, such as the late Sol Hurok, who produced the Bolshoi and Kirov Ballet tours and exercised a virtual monopoly over Soviet performances in the United States.
 But the breakdown of diplomatic barriers, notably the signing of a new General Exchanges agreement in 1985, cutbacks in government subsidies and the restructuring of the Soviet economy -- including bureaucratic changes within cultural agencies -- changed everything. Soviet arts groups eager for hard currency discovered the lucrative foreign tour, especially to the United States. The image of this country among Soviet cultural representatives is that it is "still the land of milk and honey," according to Steve Boulay, vice president of the Space Agency, a Salt Lake City concert presenter that produced a recent tour of the Red Army Chorus.
 The result is that more and more Soviet performing-arts companies are bypassing their own government bureaucracy to sign individual contracts with cultural institutions and commercial producers here.
 "Why are we seeing so many arts groups in the United States?" asked Mr. Boulay. "The answer is simple -- greed. They want dollars, dollars, dollars."
 
Visa Fever

 But Once Here, Tours Can Fizzle
 Whether it is increasingly frequent appearances by such leading groups as the Bolshoi Ballet, first-ever exhibitions of Russian Conceptualist painters or debut performances by little-known groups, like the native tribes in "Siberian Music and Dance From the Island of Sakhalin, the Soviet Far East" at the Asia Society in New York, more Soviet artists are arriving in the United States. State Department officials report that the number of visas annually granted to Soviet visitors, including arts groups, has climbed from 10,000 to nearly 100,000 in the last five years, with no leveling off foreseen.
 "In all disciplines -- visual arts, music, dance, theater -- Soviet companies are coming here at a time when their own country is in a great deal of chaos," said Lee Lamont, president of I.C.M. Artists, which produces the American tours of the Leningrad Philharmonic and the Moiseyev Dance Company. "They are coming here in order to function, to perform their work and to get paid for it."
 According to Yuri Grigorovich, artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet, "The arts are no longer at the top of the priority list in terms of state subsidy. Any arts group that can get over to the States does get over. And recently there has been a flood of not very high quality groups."
 For some Soviet artists the American dream ends in cold reality: half-filled auditoriums and galleries, shortened tours and occasional strandings of performers when ticket sales fail to materialize. For every sold-out performance by the Red Army Chorus at the Kennedy Center in Washington, or by the Moiseyev Dance Company at Radio City Music Hall in New York or even by the Sovremennik theater troupe, which performed in Seattle last summer, there are dozens of partly filled houses for major company tours.
 For second-tier arts groups the consequences can be disastrous: empty arenas, bounced checks, hotel evictions. In the last two years, several groups -- notably the Great Circus Bim Bom and the Ukrainian Donetsk Ballet -- were all but abandoned by their American producers.
 
A Tighter Borscht Belt

 As Fees Rise, So Do Jitters
 Some producers say much of the current problem has its origins in longstanding and well-publicized difficulties with Goskontsert. The concert agency, which traditionally pocketed some 80 percent of the fees from foreign tours of Soviet groups, has shown a growing willingness to approve agreements with the highest bidder, whether they have sufficient financial backing or not. Arts presenters and museum and theater directors say they must pay Soviet artists increasingly high performance and exhibition loan fees -- fees that can run from $10,000 to more than $1 million for a single exhibition or tour.
 "These companies are at least twice as expensive as they used to be," said Jane Sahlins, producer of the International Theater Festival of Chicago, which presented the State Theater of Lithuania there in 1988. "They get fewer government subsidies, so you have to pay them more, and there are always special arrangements that have to be made."
 The subsequent financial risks are often too much for small producers working with lesser-known groups. But even more established deep-pocket organizations, such as I.C.M. Artists, are voicing caution.
 The Nederlander theater organization in New York, which co-produced the most recent Bolshoi tour last year, is not currently involved in the Soviet arts scene. "You don't really make any money on those tours," said Arthur Rubin, the company's vice president and general manager. "It's more of a cultural thing. As long as you don't lose money, that's about it."
 
The Art Market

 If It's Novel, It Must Be Soviet
 In the area of fine arts, some museum directors and gallery owners say that despite first-ever exhibitions of contemporary Russian paintings, the market for such works is driven more by novelty than real collector interest. Few American galleries regularly sell contemporary Soviet paintings and those that do, such as the Feldman Gallery in New York, are finding buyers largely for the work of such established Soviet emigre artists as Vitaly Komar and Alexander Melamid.
 Few American art institutions have purchased works by living Soviet artists, or sponsored major contemporary Soviet art shows. Today only a handful of critically acclaimed smaller exhibits have been mounted, including "Art Into Life," an exhibition of Soviet Constructivism that opened at the Henry Gallery in Seattle last summer, and "Between Spring and Summer," that began at the Tacoma Art Museum.
 "We've had this big bad enemy for so long that our interest has been piqued, but this is not a hot trend," said Ronald Feldman, owner of the Feldman Gallery. "European interest in Soviet work is way ahead of ours, and no one really knows how long it is going to last."
 According to Martin Friedman, the former director of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, which co-sponsored the "Art Into Life" exhibit last year, "The answer is not blockbuster exhibits but more collaborative and specialized exhibits that build critical relationships between museum staffs." Unless these foundations are laid, Mr. Friedman said, "there will be a fading of interest here in Soviet art."
 
Theater of Difficulty

 A Risky Stunt And a Hard Sell
 Although regional theaters had been at the forefront of institutions seeking cultural ties with the Soviets, many directors now say that contemporary Soviet theater, with its parochial political themes and translation difficulties, is a box-office risk and a logistical and financial headache. Sponsoring a Soviet theater company usually means transporting, housing and paying fees to large ensembles; the costs can run to hundreds of thousands of dollars, significantly higher than for most domestic productions.
 "The word in the industry is that Soviet theater just doesn't sell," said Norman Langell, producer of the Goodwill Arts Festival in Seattle last summer. Daniel Sullivan, artistic director of the Seattle Repertory Theater and one of the city's few arts leaders who declined to sponsor a Soviet troupe during the festival, concurs. "There is a certain amount of bandwagoning that is going on," said Mr. Sullivan, who described most of the theater he saw during a recent Moscow trip as "more of a political thing," adding, "Soviet theater may not be as rich a trove as we thought."
 In some cases, hiring a Soviet director to mount a production with American actors has become a less expensive, less risky yet still trendy means of bringing Soviet stagecraft to the United States. Although some directors say that such joint productions make for legitimate cross-fertilization, others maintain that language difficulties and differences in rehearsal practices make the arrangements little more than theatrical stunts.
In a review of last fall's production of "Ivanov" at the Yale Rep, with American actors directed by Oleg Yefremov of the Moscow Art Theater, Frank Rich wrote in The New York Times that "it suffers from the mistaken conviction that a brilliant Soviet director can drop in to a foreign theater and . . . re-create a celebrated Moscow production." The result, Mr. Rich said, "failed to fulfill the play at hand and the highest standards of either the Soviet or American artists involved."
 During the residency of the Georgian Film Actors' Studio at the Folger Theater, Keti Dolidze, a Georgian director, said, "We have much to learn from American actors. But a three- to six-week rehearsal period? It is impossible for us to work in such a short time."
 
International Strains

 Who Will Win At the Arts Game?
 A number of arts leaders caution that few long-term links between Soviet and American arts groups have been forged and that American audiences have not developed an educated appreciation of Soviet culture.
 "More and more the United States is becoming responsive to the international arts scene," said Mr. Lichtenstein of BAM. "The Soviet Union is only part of the mix. Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe -- it's all part of our growing cultural diversification. But the idea of being interested in something Russian just because it's Russian, that's not interesting."
 Everyone, said Mr. Boulay of the Space Agency, "is looking for a quick buck with Soviet artists. When the demand stops, the supply will stop. The level playing field will prove to be a harsh reality for the Soviets."
 
MOSCOW NIGHTS HAVE DWINDLED
 When the United States and the Soviet Union signed the new General Exchanges agreement in 1985, the first artists over the fence included the Russian pianist Vladimir Horowitz in a celebrated return to Moscow and the pop singer Billy Joel in the first Soviet tour by a major American rock star. Since then, the flow of artists has all but reversed direction.
 While several dozen Soviet arts groups annually visit the United States, less than half a dozen major American groups perform in the Soviet Union, according to American officials who monitor such exchanges. Those that have visited recently include the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Acting Company of New York and the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.
 The reasons, say American arts representatives, are largely financial. While Soviet artists anticipate a profit on their United States tours, most American groups must cover their own expenses -- or obtain corporate or government grants -- and usually receive only a modest honorarium.
 The Chicago Symphony Orchestra's tour in November, for example, which included four performances in the Soviet Union plus stops in Hungary and Austria, cost the orchestra more than $1 million.
 A recent trend among American organizations is to send a single artistic director to help a comparable Soviet arts group. "They have an incredible thirst for American management techniques," said Robert Orchard, managing director of the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass., who made the trip last year.
 "The Soviets are very depressed about their own theaters -- they can't fire anybody. Their subsidies are being reduced. They don't know how to write contracts. And so far they have only had the Broadway commercial theater as a model."
 
WHAT DO AUDIENCES IN AMERICA WANT?
 Measuring audience demand for Soviet cultural imports is difficult, in part because many commercial producers who sponsor such events do not release profit-and-loss statements.
 Certainly some Soviet productions sell well. Recent tours by the Bolshoi Ballet and the Red Army Chorus, for example, were considered critical and box-office successes.
 The popularity of some other imports, however, has hinged on non-Russian factors. "Ivanov," at the Yale Repertory Theater last year, was thought to have sold out not because of Oleg Yefremov (in photograph), its Soviet director, but because of its star-studded American cast, which included William Hurt.
 The well-received performances by the State Theater of Lithuania at the Chicago Theater Festival in 1988 had as much to do with enthusiastic critical notices as Chicago's extensive Lithuanian population, which, according to Jane Sahlins, the festival's producer, made up a large percentage of the audience.
 And still other Soviet productions and exhibits simply do not perform as expected. Part of the problem, according to producers, is that auditoriums are too large, tours too frequent and ticket prices too steep. The top ticket price for some events has been up to $100 a seat, double what comparable companies here charge, and dicey in a recession economy.
 "The glory days are past in terms of making a profit," said John Ballard, president of the Space Agency, a concert presenter in Salt Lake City that has handled the tours of a few prestigious Soviet arts groups. "These are incredibly expensive tours, and there are just too many of them."

HEADLINE: Now That the Recession Is Official ... Three Experts Predict the
Recovery

BYLINE: By JOEL KURTZMAN

 BODY:
Amid a great deal of publicity -- and several false calls -- the recession has finally arrived. But by all accounts it is not a typical recession, nor was it pronounced in the typical way. The seven-member Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research normally makes its dour recession confirmation only after two quarters of a downturn in the gross national product have been observed.
 This time, by traditional standards, the committee's call was early. The Commerce Department's figures, which are complete only through the end of the third quarter of 1990, still show growth. 
Even so, it was the right call," said Donald Ratajczak, director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University in Atlanta. "The recession began in the fourth quarter of last year. That's the consensus forecast. Who says we economists can't agree?"
According to Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at CRT Government Securities, most recessions start after prices begin to rise and the Federal Reserve Board raises interest rates to dampen inflation. "Then the Fed opens the floodgates, which ends the recession but reignites inflation," he said. But this time, according to Mr. Levy, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has been far more prudent. In the midst of a slowdown, monetary policy remains fairly tight.
 This recession is also different in the way it is inflicting its pain on thecountry. Typically, recessions begin in the manufacturing sector and later spread to the services. But this time, one of the few bright spots in the economy has been export-oriented manufacturing. Services -- especially financial and retail services -- have been the hardest hit.
 Banks, savings and loans, Wall Street firms and even law firms are hurting. Layoffs from the financial and retail sectors are rising. Sears, Roebuck and Citicorp, the nation's largest retailer and bank, have both been thinning their ranks. "There is a tremendous restructuring going on in the service-producing industries," said Mr. Levy.
 As a result, the healthiest regions of the country are those with heavy concentrations of export-oriented industries -- the Midwest and Northwest. At the other extreme, the weakest region is the Northeast. This is exactly the opposite of the pattern observed during the last recession in 1982.
 Inventory accumulation is another indicator that is behaving differently from the past. Generally, inventories rise significantly when times are tough and goods remain unsold. But so far in this downturn, inventories have remained remarkably flat. New methods, like just-in-time inventory management, more outsourcing and ordering goods closer to the time of sale, have enabled companies to operate in a leaner fashion.
Housing starts, on the other hand, are doing the traditional thing -- falling. In the Northeast and West, housing starts and sales are already down to levels not seen since the last recession, in 1982.
 Then there was Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The subsequent oil price jump added to inflation and took more money from consumers' pockets. This slowed a weakened economy even more. And if there is a war -- long or short -- its effects on the economy are too uncertain to predict.

 
MICKEY D. LEVY

 Chief economist at CRT Government Securities in New York City.
 The current recession is merely a correction that will wring out a decade of excesses from the economy, according to Mr. Levy. As this happens, inflation will fall and prices will adjust downward. Real estate prices will continue to fall as unsold inventories of commercial property are cleared. But the recession will not be deep. Instead, there will be the long-sought "soft landing" in the first half of the year. The second half will begin a slow but steady recovery. While the service sector will be hurt by the downturn, the manufacturing sector will be helped by continued growth in exports. Because of its export orientation, the Midwest and Northwest will outperform the rest of the economy. Even though the Federal Reserve has eased somewhat on interest rates and on the reserve requirements for certain types of bank deposits, Mr. Levy believes it will continue to follow a relatively restrictive policy. "Mr. Greenspan has done an excellent job managing the economy," Mr. Levy said.

 
DONALD RATAJCZAK

 Director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University in Atlanta.
 Mr. Ratajczak thinks the recession will be a little deeper, but shorter than average. "The recession started in the forth quarter of 1990," he said. "It will have a duration of 8 to 10 months." In the first half of the year, unemployment is likely to rise to 7 percent and then drift upward to 7.25 percent before coming down in 1992. The fear of war and the reluctance of consumers to spend has put the brakes on the economy. These two factors particularly hurt the housing and construction sectors. Exports have also been affected because much of Europe has been slowed by the fear of war and of a subsequent disruption of its oil supply. But if war does come, Mr. Ratajczak believes, it will be short and do little damage to the oil delivery system outside of Kuwait. "If this is what happens, oil prices will come down and inflation will virtually vanish," he said. With inflation gone, consumers will have more money to spend, confidence will return and the growth of exports will resume.
 
A. GARY SHILLING

 President of an economic consulting firm in Springfield, N.J., that bears his name.
 Mr. Shilling has been predicting a recession for a long time. Now, he is finding his worst fears confirmed. In the Shilling view, the recession is likely to be deep and last at least through the end of this year. After that, growth is likely to be sluggish, "no more than 2 or 3 percent." And even though growth will become positive in early 1992, unemployment will continue to rise -- to a level above 9 percent, where it will stay until the end of 1993. "The factors that normally put the bounce in the economy are absent," Mr. Shilling said. At the same time, the Federal Government is constrained in its ability to help the economy. In 1991,the Federal deficit could swell to as much as $500 billion, which would prevent Congress from taking action to stimulate growth. At the same time, the Federal Reserve, even if it "dumps money into the system" will not see an end to the credit crunch. The value of tangible assets -- even investments like coins, antiques and precious metals -- will decline.

Developing The Waterfront

BYLINE: By KENT SHAW

 BODY:
AFTER years of haggling, voters here approved the first phase of a plan to develop extensive holdings of public and private land on the city's long-neglected waterfront. City planners say development of a 70-acre area could total $100 million to $140 million in 5 to 10 years.
Two major private developers, who own a total of about 15 acres of sparsely developed land, say they will wait for an economic upturn before proceeding. But with the approval of the voters last November, city planners can now move ahead on an 11-acre waterfront park. Bids on the $2 million project, which includes the purchase of the parcel, should be completed this month and the park could be open in time for fireworks on the Fourth of July. 
 Some critics question whether a park will provide the anchor they say is needed to attract large numbers of visitors. They are calling instead for mixed development, including housing and retail space.
But whatever the merits of the park, it may be the only development possible under a ruling issued last summer. State courts upheld the state's authority to use the land, which had been reclaimed from Lake Champlain in the 1830's and long used by the Central Vermont Railroad, for public purposes under the state's Public Trust Doctrine. Under that doctrine, the state claimed the right to the land once it fell into disuse by the railroad.
The same principle would apply to another waterfront parcel, of 43 acres, owned by the railroad, which must give the city first refusal on its sale. City appraisers say the land is worth about $1.6 million, while the railroad wants more than $9 milion. An arbiter is expected to resolve the difference this spring.
Also in the works is a city takeover of the Naval Reserve Station, if voters agree to spend $1.5 million for it. City planners want to use the 29,000-square-foot station for galleries, open-air markets, restaurants and performing arts. Outside there may be additional boat dockage.
The 50,000-square-foot former Moran Generating Station, another neglected waterfront structure, could house an aquarium, a planetarium and a research center, city planners say.
But private developers wonder who will visit the site without housing to create a distinct, year-round waterfront community. Thomas Cullins, an architect whose office overlooks the waterfront, said: "It looks as though they put something in the plan for everybody. Once it's a park, you're never in all of history going to rip up a park. It's death."

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: Dr. Harry J. Hartley;
Cheers and Problems for UConn President

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
HARRY J. HARTLEY was chosen last month from 117 candidates to be the 12th president of the University of Connecticut. A 52-year-old native of Pennsylvania who has spent his entire career in public higher education, Dr. Hartley came to UConn in 1972 as a professor of educational finance, served the school three years as dean of the School of Education and seven years as vice president for finance and administration.
He is well-liked on campus, chosen by the student newspaper as Man of the Year in 1978, and by the faculty senate as distinguished professor of the year in 1984. 
 When his selection was announced during a basketball game at the university's new Gampel Pavilion, the crowd of students, faculty members and alumni rose and shouted, "Harry! Harry!"
The walls of his office at Storrs are lined with cards, and the tables covered with flowers, from well-wishers. In a recent interview in that office, Dr. Hartley discussed his plans. Here are some excerpts from the conversation.
 Q. With all the financial and other problems facing the state and its institutions, why did you want to become UConn's president?
 A. How much different is that from being its chief fiscal officer? To me, it isn't that much different, and I really think a person familiar with financial issues has the right background for Connecticut in 1990. I trust my judgment better than I would someone who isn't in finance. But recessions come and go. It's the economic cycle. I think it will be nice to plan for the economic recovery.
 Q. A lot was made of the fact that your immediate predecessors were here only a few years. How much did your being here 19 years have to do with your selection, and how long are you going to be here?
 A. I'm not going to dwell on that, but I would simply say that with the last three presidents, and I did serve under all three of them as a fiscal vice president, it began to look like UConn was a stepping stone. Each one had the same pattern: each one came from outside, each one stayed exactly five years, and then each one went back outside.
There was a view, and it's coming out now as I read editorials and letters and so on, that there ought to be someone from Connecticut, someone from UConn, capable of doing this, who is committed to staying at the University of Connecticut. I think I fit that mold. I plan to retire here, and I've said that to anyone who has asked me.
 Q. There were 117 candidates for the job. If you were running the search, would you have hired someone without interviewing more than one of them?
 A. Well, eight of the trustees did interview the three finalists. Some of the others met some of the finalists. As I understand it, they were eventually down to two, because one of the finalists withdrew, and the other person had not been a president, was from out of state and was not familiar with Connecticut. I think the other trustees asked the screening committee, "What do you think?"
The key thing in selecting any administrator is not the absolute values of the individual but ratherthe "fit." What is the institution, what are its needs right now, and what skills does that person have? You may have an outstanding candidate, but it may not be the right fit.
 Q. Is that "fit" one reason you seem to be enjoying such popularity among faculty, students, legislators, alumni and so on?
 A. I guess the answer is yes. I'm very humbled by this. I don't know if you saw that first game at Gampel, but when you get a standing ovation, when you get students chanting, "Harry! Harry!" -- I had goosebumps, I had tears.
But my hat still fits. A good percentage of it is what I represent. It's not Harry, it's that I represent blue and white. I care about UConn. If there is one thing I understand it's the organizational culture of UConn. I think that's what the reaction was.
Q. Is that going to help you?
A. One way it's going to help me is that we are a united family right now. For example, the Thomas Commission made some controversial suggestions about reorganizing UConn. The consultants, who were from Florida, didn't understand the tradition and culture of UConn. They talked about abolishing the Board of Trustees and abolishing the system of regional campuses.
A Board of Trustees gives us what little autonomy we have and brings decision making closer to our clients, the students. And closing the regional campuses would make us the University of Storrs. Sometimes it takes that external threat to unite the family. And I do intend to build on it.
 Q. You have some tough decisions ahead of you. Is that good relationship going to hinder that process?
 A. Yes, but I've made tough decisions before as the chief fiscal officer. Many of the decisions I've had to make were against people, to reduce staffing levels.
I try to make the decisions as fairly and objectively as I can, but I'm very sensitive to the fact that any negative decision I make affects real, live human beings. There is no pleasant way to offer up cuts, but I'm going to try to do it as fairly as I can.
 Q. Governor Weicker has suggested some state agencies could face as much as a 20 percent cut in their budget. How would UConn deal with that?
 A. At that point UConn would have to declare financial exigency, a technical term having to do with reductions in staff, the elimination of programs and services. A 20 percent cut translates into about $30 million for us in the general fund alone.
Almost all of the general fund spending, about 93 percent, is salaries, and if we have to cut $30 million, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out it will take major staff reductions.
I think my credibility is being watched to see whether I am I going to resist all cuts. I think that would be unrealistic and it would probably backfire. However, there is a point at which it would have serious implications to the future of the institution. I don't know exactly where that point is, but at 20 percent, and even at 13 percent, it would create permanent damage.
At the 7 percent level, I think there are things we could do -- and I'm not advocating it -- but I think there are things we could do without major, permanent structural damage to the instructional program.
 Q. As tuition rises and enrollment declines because of staffing cutbacks, is UConn in danger becoming out of reach of the students it has traditionally attracted?
 A. One of UConn's objectives that I am very sensitive to is access. One of our goals is to provide access to qualified students who might not otherwise be able to afford to go to college. My first chance came in July, in my first month as interim president, when I submitted a budget.
Tuition increases have been 15 percent the last couple of years, but I lowered that to 7.5 percent. However, in this fiscal emergency we are in, it is one of the options I'm looking at, to restore some additional increase in the tuition fund. We will be submitting plans for a 6, 13 and 20 percent increase.
 Q. UConn started as an agricultural school in 1881, but that part of the institution is not growing as quickly as the rest of the university. What is the School of Agriculture's future?
 A. The other half of that school's title is more interesting: the School of Agriculture and Natural Resources. Yesterday I was at the Bartlett Arboretum in Stamford, the plant science department.
One of the red hot areas right now is turf management, for golf courses and so on. I just visited the pathobiology department on campus. Right now there is a major fear of Lyme disease. They are doing a lot of research, such as whether milk might contain it -- so far, none. We're putting up two new buildings for animal industries, one for dairy and the other for the horse barn, with privately raised monies.
I'm there at every one of these dedications because these are our roots. People still eat food, they still have plants.
 Q. With a big new sports complex and a successful 1989-90 basketball season, there's been some grumbling about athletics taking precedence over academics. Do you think that's happening?
 A. I view it the other way around. I think athletics is catching up to our academic status. We're a first-rate academic institution; we have achieved the status of Research University I ranked by the Carnegie Foundation;, we rank in the top 30 in Federal research funding. We're a first-rate school, and athletics caught up with that.
In my opinion, we can do both. But what's nice about athletics is when they go out on the court, it doesn't say "Chemistry Department" on the uniforms, it says "University of Connecticut."
And the Gampel Pavilion is not just a basketball arena. The entire sports and leisure studies department is now located over there. They were in three different buildings before. Now we can have a single commencement. And we can use it for interscholastic athletics.

HEADLINE: Publisher Buys A Lotus Unit

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Jan. 13

 BODY:
The International Data Group, which publishes periodicals dealing with information technology, has acquired the Lotus Publishing Corporation from the Lotus Development Corporation in Cambridge, Mass.
Neither company would disclose the price of the acquisition, but a Lotus spokesman said the agreement called for Lotus Development to share in profits from Lotus Publishing for an undisclosed period. Lotus Development does not disclose revenues and earnings for its separate business units, but industry estimates put revenues for Lotus publishing at $10 million in 1990. 
 Lotus publishes Lotus magazine, a monthly publication with an audited circulation of 368,000; Lotus Books, a line of books published in conjunction with Simon & Schuster Inc., and direct mail materials, all aimed at the 14 million users of Lotus Development's 1-2-3 software package as well as the company's other software products.
An International Data Group spokesman said Lotus Publishing was not profitable in its 1990 fiscal year. He added that plans were under way to begin Lotus newsletters and videos and to enter the conference and exposition business.
Internationl Data is the parent of Computerworld, a leading weekly newspaper in the information systems industry. Mark D. Flanagan will remain as president and chief executive of Lotus Publishing, which will become an independent business unit within International Data. The company will retain its staff and offices in Cambridge, Mass.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
War or Peace: Wall Street Waits

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Credit market analysts and participants are awaiting Tuesday's midnight deadline for Iraq to leave Kuwait with a rising sense of urgency.
If President Saddam Hussein of Iraq decides to leave Kuwait peacefully by the deadline, bond yields would fall sharply. Consumer confidence, which has fallen badly since the Aug. 2 invasion, would revive, providing the economy with a much-needed lift. 
 An outbreak of hostilities would also produce a swift response in the fixed-income markets. Seeking safety, investors would probably put even more money into short-term instruments like Treasury bills and sell bonds. Short-term interest rates fell last week as bond yields rose, steepening the yield curve.
 
'The Instant Shooting Starts'
 "The instant shooting starts, the yield curve will twist, with bond yields going higher and short rates falling," said Jerry L. Jordan, a senior vice president at the First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. "But there will not be much activity in terms of medium- and long-term markets, so price quotes won't mean very much. It won't be a very fluid market."
The first few days of war would be a time of extreme anxiety, which would not abate until the probable course of the fighting had been determined, analysts said.
Analysts said a short war in which the United States and its allies emerge victorious and oilfields remain intact would have much the same effect on the economy and on interest rates as a timely exit from Kuwait by Saddam Hussein.
"I would argue that a war would temporarily aid the economy if it is short in nature," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Bank. "However, the general economic malaise was in place before the Iraqi invasion, and a short war would provide only a temporary boost. After that, the economy would fall back into its rut."
 
Toll on the Economy
 A war that stretches out for more than a month, however, would begin to take a much more serious toll on the economy.
High oil prices would drive up inflation, and the Federal budget deficit would probably soar, reflecting the higher costs of a longer war. Consumer confidence would probably fall further, and the current recession would deepen. Long-term interest rates would move higher.
At the moment, the chances of a protracted conflict do not appear great, the analysts said. Moreover, fears about damage to Saudi oilfields are probably misplaced.
"There is every reason to think that Saddam could not take out the Saudi fields," said a former American diplomat with much experience in Saudi Arabia. "The Saudis have extensive security in the oilfields to limit damage and allow production to continue even if there is extensive fire or bombardment. I am sure there is no other country in the world that has in place such sophisticated security."
From the economy's perspective, a continuation of the current stalemate would be almost as damaging as a drawn-out war.
"Stalemate in the Middle East is almost the worst of all possible worlds for the economy," said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at the Pittsburgh National Bank. "Nobody likes uncertainty."
Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montagu Economics, said very few investment or business decisions have been made this month, largely because of the situation in the Middle East. "The longer that persists, the less overall activity we will have, and the longer it will take the Fed's easing tactics to provoke any new economic activity," he said.
Mr. Fabbri, who said he did not believe shots would be fired, projected the economy would contract for several more quarters, even though interest rates would fall and inflation would decline.
A host of economic reports are expected to be released this week, but the data shrink in importance compared with developments in the Persian Gulf. Trading activity will probably be thin and extremely choppy.
"At the moment we are ticker-tape trading, and volatility is the watchword," said Steven Slifer, a senior vice president and financial market economist at Shearson Lehman Government Securities. "I suspect we are in store for more of that this week. The economic statistics will take a back seat to the war."
Economists predict the data, which include reports on December retail sales and consumer prices, will show that the economy remained weak last month.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
TURKEY GIVES U.S. LIMITED BASE USE

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, Jan. 13

 BODY:
Turkey agreed this weekend to let the United States use air bases here in a war against neighboring Iraq, but said operations would be confined to "humanitarian and limited logistical support."
The decision, reached at a long Cabinet meeting Saturday night, means that American pilots would not be allowed to stage air strikes against Iraq directly from Turkish territory. 
 Instead, officials explained, the Americans would be able to use Turkish installations, notably the Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey, for such purposes as refueling fighter planes or ferrying the wounded out of the war zone. But to take off for a raid against Iraq, American aircraft presumably would first have to go elsewhere.
"We will give humanitarian and limited logistical support, and nothing other than this," said Mehmet Yazar, the chief Government spokesman.

 The Turkish decision was relayed today to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, who met in Ankara with President Turgut Ozal and other leaders as he ended a swing through Middle Eastern capitals to confer with members of the anti-Iraq coalition.
No mention of Turkish military support was included, however, in public statements about what was discussed. Rather, they focused on mutual expressions of support in the Persian Gulf crisis and on Turkey's hopes for further economic aid and trade concessions to help compensate for part of the $5.5 billion that officials say the country has lost by enforcing the United Nations embargo against Iraq.
In a statement released by his office, Mr. Ozal told Mr. Baker that the Congressional vote on Saturday to give President Bush the authority to go to war "might help increase the chances for a peaceful solution."
Despite the limited nature of Turkey's permission to use its air bases for war, the decision significantly increases its participation in the multination force arrayed against Baghdad. Even this circumscribed action is certain to upset Turks, including some senior military officers and foreign-policy advisers, who worry that Iraq might regard it as a provocation justifying retaliation.
 
Big Anti-War Rally Held
 That view was expressed today at an outdoor anti-war rally in Istanbul that was attended by an estimated 40,000 protesters and sponsored by the main opposition group, the Social Democratic Populist Party.
"Ozal is gambling with the lives of our citizens," Erdal Inonu, the party's leader, told the crowd. "We are definitely against the use of Turkish bases in this conflict."
Some of objections are rooted in unhappiness with Mr. Ozal himself, who is accused by critics of unconstitutionally ursurping too many powers as he single-handedly guides Turkish policy in the crisis. But the protests also reflect a traditional caution here about involvement in any fight among Arabs, on the argument that Turkey is slated by geography to live with and trade with often unpredictable and sometimes dangerous neighbors like Iraq.
So the problem for Turkey has been to support the American-led coalition and perhaps also remove President Saddam Hussein, who is almost universally loathed here, while not appearing to exceed actions mandated by various United Nations resolutions.

HEADLINE: Insilco Declares Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Jan. 13

 BODY:
The Insilco Corporation, a diversified company whose products include military equipment, Rolodex files and textbooks, filed today for bankruptcy protection from its creditors.
The company said it had bargained fruitlessly since May 1 to get easier payment terms from its leading bondholders. The company has a total debt of $764 million. 
 Insilco, based in Midland, Tex., was acquired in 1988 by two Texas oilmen, Cyril Wagner Jr. and Jack E. Brown, for $1.1 billion, which included the assumption of $208 million in debt.
 
$530 Million in 'Junk Bonds'
 It had struggled for the last year under a heavy debt load that included $530 million in high-yield "junk bonds" and senior notes with yields of 9.5 percent to 16.75 percent.
Debt costs totaled $113.5 million last year and had threatened to overwhelm the company for months. Its 1990 sales were approximately $700 million, a spokesman said today.
The bankruptcy filing was a blow to Merrill Lynch & Company, the investment bank that raised nearly $1 billion for the Insilco takeover in 1988. It also provided a new warning that many companies operating with huge debts piled on during takeovers, buyouts and financial restructurings in the late 1980's would default on those payments in a weakened economy.
In a statement, Insilco blamed its troubles on "an increasingly difficult business environment and recessionary economy." The company earned $44.8 million from operations in the nine months that ended in September and reported a net loss of $52.4 million for the period. Its sales totaled $501.3 million.
 
Four Units Not Included
 Four Insilco subsidiaries were not included in the filing. They were Daceasy Inc., a publisher of accounting software; the Taylor Publishing Company, a textbook publisher; the Valentec International Corporation, a military equipment maker, and Stewart Connector Systems Inc., which manufactures industrial equipment.
Insilco said that its cash flow from operations was positive, but that it was unlikely to be able to meet future debt payments.
"After reviewing all available options, management concluded that a filing was necessary to preserve the assets and values of the Insilco operations," the spokesman said.
Besides bondholders, other large creditors included a group of banks with loans outstanding to Insilco of $234 million. Wells Fargo & Company was the lead bank in the financing arrangement.
In a series of assets sales, Insilco raised $160 million in the last two years that was used to reduce debt. The 1988 buyout by Mr. Wagner and Mr. Brown was executed with $980 million in borrowed money. One of the auctioned subsidiaries was Red Devil paints, one of Insilco best-known consumer brands.
 
Bid Picked Over Managers'
 The Wagner-Brown group took Insilco private after the company's directors chose its offer over one initiated by management.
Insilco, a descendant of the International Silver Company, was listed at the time of the takeover on the New York Stock Exchange. The company shed its silverware business in 1983. In 1989, Mr. Wagner and Mr. Brown moved the company's headquarters to Midland from Meriden, Conn.
The buyout, completed in late 1988, came after Mr. Wagner and Mr. Brown had made huge profits in takeover battles but had never succeeded in completing a large buyout.
 
Teamed With Pickens
 They joined T. Boone Pickens in his 1984 attempt to acquire the Gulf Oil Company and, later, the Phillips Petroleum Company and the Unocal Corporation. On their own, they made separate, unwelcomed bids for the Midcon Corporation, the Panhandle Eastern Corporation and the USG Corporation.
Insilco said today that it would continue to operate all 12 subsidiaries, which have a total payroll of 6,600 employees and are in several states and foreign countries.
Before the bankruptcy filing, a group of banks agreed to advance Insilco $57 million to be used for operations, the company said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Newspapers Raising Prices as Advertising Falls

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
Across the country, newspaper prices have been increasing in a trend that has not been seen since the early 1980's, when prices jumped to their current levels.
While nearly 90 percent of the nation's newspapers now sell on newsstands or in racks for 25 cents or 35 cents apiece, several industry executives said they expect most papers to sell for at least 35 cents or even 50 cents within two years. 
 Similarly, although about 62 percent of the nation's Sunday papers now sell for less than $1, some executive predict that most Sunday papers will soon cost $1, $1.25 or even $1.50.
Yesterday, The Los Angeles Times raised the price of its Sunday paper to $1.25, up from $1, which had been the price since 1983.
A week ago, 11 newspapers owned by the Gannett Company raised the price of their Sunday issues to $1.50.
 
Moves by Three Dailies
 In the last three months, The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, The Kansas City Star and The Belleville News-Democrat in Illinois -- all owned by Capital Cities/ABC Inc. -- increased the single-copy price of their daily papers to 50 cents. Both the Fort Worth and Belleville papers had been sold for 25 cents and The Kansas City Star had cost 35 cents.
In early December, The Wall Street Journal raised its price to 75 cents from 50 cents.
Today, The New York Times raised the price of its national edition to 75 cents in the Midwest and the Southwest. It had cost 50 cents in the Midwest and 60 cents in the Southwest. As a test, The Times has been selling for 75 cents in the Southeast since September, but remains at 50 cents in the Far West and Northeast, and 40 cents in the New York City area.
Industry executives said circulation rates were rising because of the depressed advertising market and increased publishing costs. For example, the price of newsprint has gone up twice in the last seven months.
"The newspaper is still one of the best deals in town," said Jeffrey S. Klein, assistant to the publisher of The Los Angeles Times.
But in an industry that perceives increasing readership as a key to its future, there has been considerable reluctance to charge more for a newspaper because sales almost always drop, at least temporarily.
 
Ads vs. Circulation
 Publishers must weigh the appeal of higher revenues against the effects of lost circulation on advertisers. At the very least, newspapers that raise their prices must struggle to regain their former circulation.
Through most of the 1980's, both the total amount of advertising and the ad rates -- which generate about 75 percent of the revenue at most papers -- were increasing steadily and there was less pressure to raise prices.
In recent months, however, many newspapers have seen stunning drops in advertising because of the recession. Historically, when advertising revenue flags, publishers demand more money from circulation.
"People are likely to be more emboldened when they haven't got anyplace else to go," said Phillip J. Meek, president of the publishing group for Capital Cities/ABC.
 
The Payoff in Fort Worth
 The financial returns can be substantial, even if fewer copies are sold.
For instance, Weldon Whiteman, circulation director of The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, said his paper lost 24 percent of its single-copy sales after it doubled its price to 50 cents in November. About 25,000 copies, out of a daily circulation of 259,000, are sold in racks and at newstands.
But while The Star-Telegram received 16 cents a copy from wholesalers when the price was 25 cents, it now gets 32 cents a copy. Even with a 24 percent drop in the number of papers sold, annual revenues from single-copy sales would increase by about $650,000, to nearly $2 million.
When the single-copy price was increased, The Star-Telegram also raised the price of home-delivery subscriptions to $10.95 a month from $9.95. Mr. Whiteman said the paper's home-delivery circulation of roughly 230,000 dropped by only 1,000. Though some subscribers canceled, the single-copy price increase had apparently pushed some other people to subscribe rather than pay more to buy the paper each day.
 
Earlier Price Increases
 In the early 1980's, the last time that newspaper prices surged industrywide, most papers moved from 15 cents or 20 cents a copy to 25 cents and some crept up later to 35 cents. The most popular price for Sunday papers in 1980 was 50 cents or less; by 1985, almost half of them were selling for 75 cents or $1.
Similarly, in the mid-1970's,, most papers increased to 15 cents from 10 cents and Sunday papers to 50 cents from 25 cents.
In each case, the newspaper industry was in an advertising slump.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Takes Over Airport for Atlantic City

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY

 BODY:
After more than a decade of squabbling and intergovernmental rivalry, the State of New Jersey has acquired Atlantic City's tiny airport, promising to turn it into a "world class" place that will open this area to expanded tourism and a larger gambling market.
Though financing for the $11.3 million acquisition still has to be worked out and ground-breaking for a new and greatly expanded airport terminal and runways is at least six months away, backers promise great things. 
 "This airport will be the catalyst that spurs economic activity in the region," Senator Frank R. Lautenberg said at the announcement of the purchase on Jan. 9. "It is a known fact that when a major airport comes into being, there is a flurry of sustained economic activity that follows."
The agreement breaks a 12-year stalemate that has kept the airport from expanding.
 
City Tried to Keep Control
 Atlantic City, under successive mayors but most notably during the six-year tenure of Mayor James L. Usry, was determined to retain ownership and control of the airport.
The city not only owned the 83 acres on which the terminal stands but also had effective control of 5,000 surrounding acres used by the Federal Aviation Administration Technical Center. The city's contract with the Federal Government provided that if the land was used for anything other than Federal aviation, it would revert to the city.
For years, the city refused to allow sale to the state or county governments, saying it would invoke the reversion clause if it lost control of the airport property.
But when Mayor James A. Whelan took office last summer, one of the first things he did was offer to sell the airport to the state at what he called "a fair price."
Beyond the payment of the $11.3 million, which the city will use for capital improvements and repairs, it will continue to receive $300,000 a year through 1999 from Pan Am World Services Inc., which holds the contract for operations at the airport.
 
Beyond 'Skin-Deep Gold Coast'
 The state's acquisition of the city's 83 acres and the terminal building paves the way for creation of a South Jersey Transportation Authority to operate the airport. The airport is 12 miles west of Atlantic City and is now used primarily for charter flights serving the casino industry.
Gov. Jim Florio, who announced the acquisition, said expanding the airport would mean transforming the area into "something more than just a skin-deep gold coast."
The expansion plan will allow negotiations with major air carriers about establishing more regularly scheduled service from cities around the country.
In addition to the charter flights, USAir offers twice-a-day regularly scheduled flights to and from Philadelphia, Baltimore, Chicago and Pittsburgh.
Thomas D. Carver, president of the Casino Association of New Jersey, the trade group in Atlantic City, said he believed there was potential for major air service but the economic climate might make it difficult.
 
Trying to Replace Charters
 "We know we have the market," he said, "but Atlantic City is what is called a 'resort destination' and that means we are not high up on the list of cities to be served with air routes."
But he said there was potential for regular service between Atlantic City and Boston, Chicago, Washington and "some of the cities in the Sunbelt" like Atlanta. Planners are also trying to find ways to replace existing charter service to the New York area with regularly scheduled commercial service.
But Mr. Carver said the development of a major air terminal in the Atlantic City area was not intended simply to be a feeder service for the casino industry.
"There are 300,000 air passengers in this area who use the Philadelphia airport because there is no air service here," he said.
Thomas M. Downs, the New Jersey Transportation Commissioner, also said in an interview that the counties surrounding the airport, Cumberland, Salem, Atlantic and Cape May, "are the growth areas."
 
Shore Area Is Growing
 Part of the reason, he said, is that property values, while going up 25 to 30 percent last year, are still lower than elsewhere in the state.
"It's been down so long it looks like up," he said. "But what is happening is that people are making life style choices to live near the seashore, and that makes it a growth area. Low-cost areas like southern New Jersey have experienced moderate to rapid growth because the dollar values are better."
The $11.3 million for the acquisition and, later, money for improvement and expansion will not come from general revenue funds. Instead, it will come from Federal Aviation Administration Trust Fund grants and state money probably backed by revenue bonds covered by airline fees.
Mr. Downs and others also say that the South Jersey area, from the Shore to Camden, also has potential for growth as a high-technology manufacturing and research area, particularly because of the F.A.A.'s Technical Center at the airport.
"That is the single piece that no one else has," Mr. Downs said. "This is one of the highest-tech aviation facilities in the country, where they test the air traffic control systems for the entire country.
"The Federal Government will spend over a billion dollars here over the next five years, and there are already a thousand or more people employed in private-sector subcontracting. That could double, so the potential is here."

HEADLINE: Chief of Bridges To Seek Advice On Repair Plan

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
New York City's Transportation Commissioner, Lucius J. Riccio, said yesterday that he planned to enlist consulting engineers from outside the department to re-evaluate completely the Bridge Bureau's budget and maintenance priorities. He acted in the face of a city move to scale down a 10-year plan for the repair of all bridges.
Department engineers have said that the retrenchment, part of a round of deep city budget cuts, will inevitably lead to the closing of dozens of bridges. Recent inspections by city and state engineers have discovered conditions far worse than had been foreseen when the plan was adopted. 
 The current 10-year plan was adopted under the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch, but its goals and blueprints had been endorsed by the administration of David N. Dinkins.
 
Praise of Plan Dims
 The plan was the first effort to repair all the city bridges and institute a maintenance program of washing, painting and lubricating them to prevent further deterioration. The plan grew out of the 1988 closing of the Williamsburg Bridge, which had deteriorated badly after years of neglect.
But Mr. Riccio, who had praised the plan when he took office, says now that it is not complete and may no longer be appropriate for these hard economic times.
"If you look at it," he said, "it isn't much of a plan -- it doesn't specify what bridges need the most attention and at what time."
The Commissioner said that given the city's financial woes, he must re-examine which bridges are in need of immediate attention and which can stand delay. "There are some bridges that you can afford to repair, and others that you can't and might have to be closed," he said.
Mr. Riccio said that he was seeking qualified professional engineers, preferably on a volunteer basis, to help the city re-evaluate its bridge program.
 
Limited Resources Noted
 "I want to make sure that we are making the smartest decisions with the limited resources that we have," the Commissioner said, "and that we have a complete and thorough analysis of the bridge situation."
After dismissing his deputy bridge commissioner last week, Mr. Riccio is personally overseeing the city's Bridge Bureau until a replacement is found. The former deputy, David Steinberger, had spoken out against cuts in the city's program for bridge maintenance and rehabilitation.
The city has cut the bridge maintenance program for the fiscal year that begins in July by 38 percent from what was outlined in the 10-year plan -- to $5.8 million from $9.4 million in 1991. Spending over the next five years would drop to $930 million from a planned $1.2 billion, city officials have said.
Mr. Riccio did transfer $60 million in funds from highway repair programs to bridges in an effort to offset the cuts.
City engineers have said that as a result of the cuts, many bridges will not be painted or cleaned and scores of deteriorating ones will not be repaired until after 1995.
Mr. Riccio said priority would be given to heavily used bridges and those in worst shape, like the East River bridges.
Last year the city commissioned a report by a group of civil engineering professors from five city colleges. They warned that the city's deteriorating bridges could not survive further reductions in maintenance and repair.

If It's Tuesday, It Must Be Time To Fight Crime

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
When Mayor David N. Dinkins declared last year that New Yorkers must "take back our streets, by night as well as by day" nobody said it would be easy. Yet this may be one war in which some couch potatoes willingly enlist.
The Mayor acknowledged that the centerpiece of any war on crime had to be an expanded police force. Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown has managed to increase street patrols modestly through redeployment. But the prognosis for even the scaled-down public-safety agenda proposed jointly by Mr. Dinkins and the City Council last month is problematic, given the scale of economies that the Mayor is due to announce this week. 
 Another component of his exhortation last year could turn out to be nearly free, though. The Mayor appealed to New Yorkers "to come out to help stop the violence" and referred vaguely to his administration's commitment to "organizing Tuesday nights out against crime." Since then, his Consumer Affairs Commissioner, Mark Green, has transformed an imaginative concept into a concrete program that may augur a relatively minor, but measurable, improvement in the city's fragile quality of life.
Underlying the concept are three premises: that restaurants, theaters and garages can be persuaded to reduce prices one night a week when business, customarily slack, is worse because of the recession; that the bargains will induce more people to go out, and that there is greater safety in numbers.
 The proposal by Mr. Green, whose first premise has passed its initial test, represents a confluence of benefits. It is arguably pro-consumer, anti-crime and good for business. And it is unlikely to drain government resources and might even gen erate greater tax revenue.
 In earlier wars, Tuesday was associated with meatlessness (then regarded as a sacrifice, not a dietary goal). Mr. Green hopes to couple going out with Tuesday night in much the same way that the sports and television industries have linked Monday night with football (their success is one reason Mr. Green's proposed nights out are planned for Tuesdays) and that a pasta promoter attempted to tie Wednesdays with a brand of spaghetti.
Already, leading industry executives have endorsed these suggestions for Tuesday night discounts:
Participating movie theaters would reduce prices by about a third -- from $7.50 to $5, for example; restaurants would offer a 15 percent discount on dinner bills; parking garages would grant a flat $3 off regular rates; Broadway and Off-Broadway theatrical producers, many of whom already provide same-day, half-price tickets on consignment at booths operated by the nonprofit Theater Development Fund, would advertise the reduced rates and, with the fund, might waive all or part of the $2 a ticket service charge.
The discount proposal has been embraced by representatives of the Metropolitan Theater Owners, the Metropolitan Parking Association, the New York State Restaurant Association and the League of American Theaters and Producers. The American Express Company plans to publish and distribute a directory of participating establishments.
If necessity is the mother of invention, this one can claim at least two fathers. Mr. Dinkins's idea was inspired by an annual National Night Out Against Crime -- the seventh of which was marked last August in communities across the country -- and by Monday night discounts initiated a decade ago by movie-theater owners in France to lure potential filmgoers from their television screens.
While Mr. Green's proposal may help revive New York's entertainment industry, it risks inviting references to the Mayor's penchant for party-going ("no new tuxes," he promised, jocularly, last month). Nonetheless, while the former Mayor Edward I. Koch protested unsuccessfully against higher movie-theater ticket prices, Mr. Dinkins may actually succeed in lowering them.
How much the proposal advances the "new public order" that the Mayor has advocated will depend on the degree to which people participate and whether the police can adequately guarantee their lives and liberty as they pursue happiness.
In 1989, the last year for which complete figures are available, Tuesday was the busiest day of the week for New York City burglars and auto thieves and the second busiest for rapists and robbers. Implicit in Mr. Dinkins's appeal to take back the streets is an alarming acknowledgement: that many streets are now out of control. Even a small reduction in crime, though, would surely be worth the price of that admission.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Plans $500 Million in New Taxes in Next Fiscal Year

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
The Dinkins administration will propose to balance New York City's budget for the coming fiscal year with nearly $1 billion in service cuts and more than $500 million in new taxes, city officials said last night.
Most of the new revenue would come from an increase in property taxes, an uphill fight in the City Council in an election year. 
 Mayor David N. Dinkins and senior officials agreed on details of the spending plan in recent days as they prepared to present their preliminary budget on Wednesday. They hope to close a budget gap of more than $2 billion projected for the fiscal year that starts July 1.
At the same time some actions outlined inthe plan would go toward closing a gap of $500 million in the current fiscal year.
Budget Director Philip R. Michael declined to say just how large the proposed property-tax increase would be or what it would mean for the typical homeowner. But he said the overall tax plan would bring in between $500 million and $600 million.
 
Income-Tax Rise to Be Sought
 Officials said they would propose that part of the increase come from raising the personal income-tax surcharge, which would require approval by the State Legislature.
Many economists believe that increasing the property tax would do the least damage to the local economy. But the Council hastraditionally resisted increases for small homeowners, and with all 35 exisiting Council seats and 16 new ones at stake in a special election this year, that resistance is not likely to change. The Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, has vowed that tax increases must be a last resort after waste is cut from the budget.
Some city officials said the size of the proposed tax package had crept up in recent days as Mr. Dinkins resisted making deeper budget cuts. But Mr. Michael said that both the amount of the cuts and the amount of proposed taxes had increased as officials revised downward their projections of how much money could be raised through bond refinancing.
The city hopes to gain $200 millionthrough productivity improvements in its labor force and increased revenue collections, mostly through improvements in tax audits. It expects to pick up $100 million more through reductions in state and Federal mandates that require the city to perform certain functions, and it hopes to close the rest of the gap through bond refinancing and other financial maneuvers.
 
'Striking' Reductions Hinted
 Asked about service cuts, which would require a number of agencies to trim their operating budgets by more than 17.5 percent and to reduce everything from parks maintenance to street cleaning, Mr. Michael said, "I think it's going to be pretty striking how far the Mayor's gone."
Officials said that the plan would lead to thousands of layoffs in a number of agencies but that they had not yet determined the precise number.
The budget proposals, made as the city strives to cope with the effects of a regional economic slump and almost a decade of steady growth in the city work force, are sure to prompt debate, not only with the Council, which must approve the budget, but also with various constituency groups around the city that will fight to preserve their pet programs. Officials said the city's five district attorneys were bitterly resisting proposed cuts to their agencies.
 
Some Eliminations Planned
 Some smaller city agencies would be eliminated altogether and their functions shifted to other departments. They include the Taxi and Limousine Commission, which would be merged into the Consumer Affairs Department, and the Board of Standards and Appeals and the Mayor's Office of Construction, which would be folded into the Buildings Department.
But some other consolidations originally considered, like collapsing the Department of Cultural Affairs into another agency, were shelved after running into intense opposition.
Mr. Michael said that the plan was only a blueprint, but that because of the strict procedures instituted after the fiscal crisis of the mid-70's, it was more detailed than most plans that other governments might present so far in advance of a new fiscal year. "This gives us a terrific opportunity for six months of real planning," he said.

HEADLINE: Peru, Its U.S. Aid Imperiled, Plots a New Drug Strategy

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru Jan. 13

 BODY:
With Peru facing a March 1 deadline for the possible cutoff of $100 million in American anti-drug aid, officials here are working to fashion a new strategy to cut exports of the raw material of cocaine.
Despite millions of dollars in American aid money spent over the last three years to eradicate coca bushes, Peru's cultivation increased by 25 percent in the same period, reaching roughly 450,000 acres today. 
 Charging that Peruvian corruption has undermined eradication and interdiction efforts, some American drug officials are arguing in Washington that President Bush should not certify to Congress on March 1 that Peru is cooperating in the drug war.
Without this certification, Peru would fall into a sort of bureaucratic outlaw status. Peru would lose $100 million in United States economic and military aid scheduled for 1991. By law, the United States would have to vote against loans for Peru in multilateral banks.
"There is a real risk that Peru will be declared ineligible for aid," Diego Garcia Sayan, a human rights lawyer, said Thursday at a conference he organized to alert his countrymen to the problem.
 
Many Peruvians Unconcerned
 Although Peru's position as the source of 60 percent of the world's coca crop has become the overriding issue in relations with the United States, many Peruvians profess a lack of concern. Peruvians are more concerned by other statistics: a 1990 inflation rate of 7,650 percent, and a 1990 toll of 3,384 killed in political violence.
Helping a depressed economy, coca base has become the nation's single most successful export, earning about $1.5 billion last year. When Lima's largest selling newspaper, La Republica, recently published an eight-page interview with Peru's President, Alberto K. Fujimori, a question on narcotics only surfaced on the sixth page.
But the fast approaching deadline for certification has forced the six-month-old Fujimori Government to start moving on a new antidrug strategy.
"Our fear is that if Peru is decertified, the people will come out of the woodwork who want to legalize cocaine and to tax it," said an economist who is heading a Government antidrug task force.
 
Coca Prices Crash
 The Fujimori approach, which will be unveiled in Washington next month, stresses the interdiction of planes and crop substitution.
In contrast, the American-endorsed strategy has almost entirely relied on eradication and land seizures.
After four years, the eradication effort, directed out of a $1.2 million American-built base in the Huallaga Valley, has only blunted the explosive spread of the coca crop.
Indeed, American efforts notwithstanding, the crop has grown so fast that prices crashed in 1990. Today, a kilo bag of dry coca leaves fetches only 40 American cents in the Huallaga, well below the $1.40 break-even cost for growers.
Hoping to take advantage of these market forces, Mr. Fujimori wants to use $60 million in planned American economic aid to launch an aggressive crop substitution program.
 
The Weakest Link
 To further drive down the cost, the Peruvian authorities want to cut the drug chain at its weakest link -- the long-haul planes that carry semirefined cocaine base from Peru's growing areas to Colombia's cocaine laboratories.
On paper, Peru's current strategy of seizing coca base on the ground appears successful -- four tons last year. But this amount represents only 1 percent of the estimated 400 tons that were shipped to Colombia.
Officials of the Drug Enforcement Administration have complained that seizures would be greater if corrupt army officers in the Huallaga would stop tipping off traffickers before police raids from the base at Santa Lucia.
"There is little doubt that there was a fair amount of ratting going on," a diplomat here said.
Peruvians planning the new drug strategy acknowledge that corruption and interservice rivalry will threaten the air interdiction effort.
"You can't throw army generals who earn $350 a month against the drug business," the planner said.
 
One Effort Stalls
 Instead, a new agency, the Autonomous Authority for Alternative Development, is to use part of the planned $39 million in American military aid to form a highly paid, well-equipped and well-armed military unit that would intercept drug planes. By creating a transportation bottleneck, the Government hopes to further drive down prices paid farmers for their leaves.
But a timid effort against drug planes stalled in December when traffickers immediately fought back with bribes and blackmail, their two most powerful weapons.
In mid-December, a Peruvian Navy plane forced down a Colombian trafficker's plane in the Huallaga area. Within hours, traffickers were working the telephones, threatening to kill family members of key military commanders. The the military ordered a suspension of the campaign.
"Don't forget who are the drug traffickers in Peru -- the Shining Path, the M.R.T.A. and the soldiers," the planner said, referring to Peru's two Marxist guerrilla armies, both active in the Huallaga. "They all know how to shoot,"
A serious effort against the planes would require special high-security measures to protect lives of the campaign directors.
In a second effort, on Dec. 31, the Peruvian police caught traffickers loading coca base into a Colombian plane in Uchiza, a Huallaga town. Three police officers were ordered to accompany the Colombian as he flew to Santa Lucia, the American-built base 20 miles away.
Instead, the police officers were found later that day at an oil company airstrip several hundred miles north of Uchiza. The Colombian plane was nowhere to be found. The police officers had $24,000 in their pockets.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Baker Says Anti-Iraq Allies, Except Syria, Agree on Force

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, Jan. 13

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said today that except for Syria, the nations of the anti-Iraq coalition were in agreement on the timing and necessity of force to dislodge Iraq from Kuwait after midnight Tuesday.
Speaking to reporters at the end of his 10-nation tour, which involved talks with Washington's major military allies in the force against Iraq, Mr. Baker indicated that as far as the United States was concerned, both it and its allies were ready to open fire on Iraqi forces in Kuwait anytime after midnight Tuesday, Eastern standard time. 
 No further consultations are necessary, save for the precise hour of attack, unless Iraq makes some serious gesture to leave Kuwait before the deadline, American officials indicated.
"As we conclude this trip," Mr. Baker said after his talks this morning with President Turgut Ozal of Turkey, "it seems to me that the international coalition is well prepared politically, economically and militarily for any eventuality as we move toward midnight Jan. 15."
 
'No One Has Balked'
 "No one has balked," a senior Administration official said of Mr. Baker's visit to Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Switzerland and Syria and to the exiled Kuwaiti leadership in Taif, Saudi Arabia.
"France will fight," the official said, "if that is what it comes to. With respect to France, the deadline is real. In my opinion, France and other countries will want to do everything they can in order to try and achieve a political solution before midnight on the 15th of January. But if the balloon goes up, the French will be there."
Although the Soviet Union has apparently decided to use the diversion of the Persian Gulf crisis to crack down on the Baltics, much the way Moscow used the 1956 Suez crisis to invade Hungary, Mr. Baker did not appear to be particularly concerned now that events in the Soviet Union would disrupt the Administration's gulf strategy.
The senior Administration official traveling aboard Mr. Baker's aircraft said Washington saw no signs that events in the Baltics were either diminishing the Soviet commitment to see Iraqi troops out of Kuwait or were leading President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to conclude that he could now more easily defy the international coalition.
 
Incentive for Gorbachev
 If anything, the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, now has more incentive than ever to toe the American line in the gulf, in hopes that this might reduce the negative impact and publicity that his Baltic crackdown is generating with the American public and American decision-makers.
At the same time, though, the Bush Administration is clearly going to calibrate its response to the crackdown in Lithuania to make sure that Washington does not alienate Moscow to the point where it diminishes its support for America's gulf policy.
Still, juggling two full-blown crises at once is clearly taxing senior Administration policy makers. Mr. Baker telephoned the President three different times from three different countries on Saturday and at least twice on Sunday as he traveled from Turkey to London.
The senior Administration official said that of the 28 nations with "ground forces" in Saudi Arabia, only Syria's 15,000-man force is not certain to take part in any offensive action to dislodge Iraqi troops from Kuwait and Syria would prefer instead to confine its role to simply defending Saudi Arabia.
 
Defending Palestinian Cause
 President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, American officials said, has become concerned about how Mr. Hussein has successfully depicted himself as the leading defender of the Palestinian cause, a role that Mr. Assad believes rightly belongs to him, and is therefore leery about siding with Western powers in an offensive against Iraq.
The Syrian leader feels that going beyond using his troops to defend Saudi Arabia could undermine his Arab nationalist credentials, although he is still considering Arab requests for a more offensive role.
The official said that while France, like others, was doing all that it could to find a political solution -- even dangling an international conference before Mr. Hussein as a face-saving cover for him to withdraw from Kuwait -- President Francois Mitterrand has assured Mr. Bush that his forces will be engaged if and when the fighting has to begin after Jan. 15.
The official said some countries that have sent only small naval or air units to the gulf and no ground forces were not certain to take part in any fighting because their units were originally sent either to defend Saudi Arabia or to help impose the United Nations naval embargo on Iraq and their legislatures have not taken action yet to reassign them for offensive purposes.
 
Major Deployments by 4 Nations
 Nevertheless, these small naval and air units, from countries like Greece, have virtually no military significance, since in the event of a war the vast majority of air and naval power will be deployed by the United States, France, Saudi Arabia and Britain.
The key points from the perspective of American officials is that all the countries that have committed ground forces have signaled their willingness to use them.
The Administration official would not comment on limitations that President Ozal has imposed on the use of Turkish bases in a war to drive Iraq out of Kuwait, limitations that Mr. Ozal reiterated to Mr. Baker in their talks today.
The Turkish public remains highly ambivalent about the gulf crisis and their Government's involvement.
These reservations are based in part on a neutralist tradition in the Turkish Army, but even more on a concern by Turks that if Iraq is devastated by war, a power vacuum would be created that would generate chaos on their eastern frontier, which has been unstable for years because of the presence of millions of Kurds seeking independence.

HEADLINE: After Layoffs, St. Louis Rethinks Future, Again

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Jan. 10

 BODY:
Outside the gargantuan 400-acre complex of the McDonnell Douglas Corporation it rained ice this week; inside the dozens of buildings there was a blizzard of pink slips. In the wake of the Defense Department decision to scrap the unbuilt, multibillion-dollar A-12 attack aircraft, the aerospace company began laying off one out of every seven workers.
The St. Louis economy was in trouble even before the latest layoffs, the second set in six months at McDonnell Douglas. A Chrysler plant in nearby Fenton, Mo., was trying, vainly, to stave off a shutdown. The real estate market went stagnant. 
 Although Missouri's population has increased slightly in recent years, each year since 1988 more people have left the state than have moved into it. There was a net loss of 6,000 people in 1989 and 7,000 in 1990. The figure for 1991 is predicted to be 10,000.
 
A Powerful Symbol
 But McDonnell Douglas, which employs 3 percent of the metropolitan St. Louis work force of 1.2 million, is a powerful symbol. Like Stan Musial, the slugger who carried the St. Louis Cardinals through the 1940's and 1950's, "MDC" has been part muscle and part myth. To see the company drop 9,000 of 42,000 employees in six months recalls the bitter lesson of the early 1980's: An economy too closely tied to making automobiles and airplanes is an economy looking for an accident.
"This was our earthquake," said one McDonnell executive, referring to the quake that, despite predictions last year, did not happen in southeast Missouri.
The A-12's other builder, the General Dynamics Corporation, also has headquarters here, but its layoffs will primarily come at plants elsewhere.
Now this region, where people find poetry in blueprints and pride in engineering feats like the Gateway Arch, must again rethink its future. The unemployment rate in the St. Louis area, 6.5 percent, slightly above the national average of 6.1 percent, is expected to jump to 7 percent this month.
While it still has stable companies that employ thousands, like the Anheuser-Busch Companies, the Monsanto Company and Ralston Purina, and has a fast-growing health services field that has added 2,000 to 5,000 jobs annually since the mid-1980's, the metropolitan region still lost 17 percent of its manufacturing jobs in the 1980's, nearly triple the national loss.
 
Fewer Manufacturing Jobs
 "In terms of manufacturing employment, we lost 44,000 jobs," said Cletus C. Coughlin, a research officer at the Federal Reserve Bank in St. Louis. "Then it picked up a bit until the net loss was 35,000 between 1979 and 1989. One in four jobs here used to be in manufacturing. Now it's one in five, or a little more than five."
Russell Signorino, a researcher with the Missouri Division of Employment Security, said: "There's always been a sense of dependability in this area, a sense that makes you say, when you go to work for one of the larger employers, 'There will always be opportunity there. I can make a career there.'
"That's not reality any more. Anywhere. You have to be ready to deal with major changes that are possibly out of your control and out of the control of your employer. What has happened with McDonnell Douglas, with the auto industry, with financial services, it's going to occur everywhere."
The recent ups and downs of Tim Garrett, a 40-year-old tool and die maker laid off from McDonnell Douglas last week, are an eloquent illustration. "I came here about five years ago from a business that the Japanese had bought and shut down," he said. "I came here for this job. But the odds of anyone getting a job as a tool and die maker in this area are about nil now."
"I'm talking to a few of us, trying to get a couple of cars to drive to Wichita on Monday," in the hopes of finding jobs at a Boeing Company plant there, he said. If not, "we've got a little in savings. The question is, do you stay and weather this out? You could spend all your money waiting, and then how do you go looking?"
 
'Much Worse Last Time'
 Yet despite the gloomy prognosis, and the steady loss of jobs -- leaving about 85,000 people unemployed in the 10 counties in southwestern Illinois and eastern Missouri that make up the St. Louis metropolitan area -- it is hard to find unadulterated pessimism. Economists echo one another as they say, "It was much worse last time."
"Last time," was a decade ago, when the auto industry here went through its nightmare years. In 1979, more than 70,000 people were employed making cars here; one-third of those jobs disappeared in the next five years. By this spring, economists expect the number to be about 36,000.
The economy somersaulted so badly in that period that, by 1984, 130,000 people were unemployed and the unemployment rate approached 12 percent. But by the latter part of the decade, there was a minirevival both in the city's neighborhoods and the downtown.
The area's population continued to radiate outward, as building booms took place farther from the city. The region's population had dipped by 50,000 from 1970 to 1980 to 2.38 million; by the late 1980's it was back above 2.4 million.
The shock of the early 1980's was a harsh lesson in the virtue of economic diversity. Last week's upheaval at McDonnell Douglas was a lesson out of the same book, economists say. But it is a lesson easier to learn in theory than in practice -- especially in the scores of small communities around the city.
 
Beginning of Layoffs
 Last July, McDonnell had a major "reduction in force." By mid-fall, about 4,000 workers had been laid off or pensioned off. Some, like Lawrence Lieberman, had worked for the company most of their working lives.
Mr. Lieberman was one of scores of mid-level managers pressed to take early retirement when the layoffs hit. Since then, the 64-year-old chemical engineer, who earned $65,000 a year ago, has found no part-time work -- "unless I want to flip hamburgers or be a security guard," he said.
But there is more respect than resentment in his tone when he speaks of the company. Most of all, he regrets the way the layoffs have bolstered the attitude of new workers that a career is a sometime thing. "Only in the last four or five years has the attitude changed to: 'I'm going to be here four or five years and then go on to something else,' " Mr. Lieberman said. "That's not the way to look at it."
More and more workers see no other way to look at it. Beyond the shocks of the McDonnell layoffs, there are other worries here. For instance, some are worried about Trans World Airlines. If that company has to undergo a major shakeout, will St. Louis lose the prestige and economic advantage of having its airport as T.W.A.'s hub?
Another worry is what the state will be able to do to ease the city's pain. Missouri has one of the lowest per-capita tax rates in the country for state income and sales taxes. Retraining is now the buzzword here, but it is not clear how much the region can afford.
 
Steady Employers Remain
 Yet there are other large companies that remain steady employers. Anheuser-Busch, for instance, employs 5,500 workers locally. Although Monsanto had some business reversals, employment in the region's chemical industry stood at 19,800 in November, up 700 from a year earlier. But these employers cannot make up for the troubles elsewhere.
"If our business was of a cyclical nature, the layoffs would give a terrific opportunity to employ a terrific number of people," said Michael Roarty, an executive vice president at Anheuser-Busch. "At Busch it doesn't work like that. We can't absorb those people when thrown into the mainstream."

HEADLINE: State of the States, 1991: Rocky, Almost Everywhere

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Jan. 11

 BODY:
It is normally a time for upbeat comments about bright futures and expansive political visions. But governors from coast to coast, Republicans as well as Democrats, conservatives and liberals, have stood before their state legislatures in recent days to open the new year with refrains that were as depressing as they were similar.
The state of their states, they said, was anything but healthy, and the watchwords were retrenchment, caution and, inevitably, more taxes. 
 "There have been few times in the history of this state when the dual threats of war and a faltering economy have so dramatically and precipitously affected our lives," said Gov. John R. McKernan Jr. of Maine, a Republican, as he unveiled plans last week to lay off state workers, cut spending for most departments by 15 percent and raise new revenue to balance the budget.
 
California Faces Big Deficit
 His words found an echo 3,000 miles away a few days later from the new Governor of California, Pete Wilson. Standing in the ornate State Assembly chamber here, where some of the most innovative and costly social programs in America have been conceived, Mr. Wilson told lawmakers on Wednesday that the nation's most populous state was facing a budget deficit of $7 billion over the next 18 months.
The next morning, Mr. Wilson issued an austerity budget that would sharply cut welfare payments to single mothers, raise vehicle license fees and taxes on alcoholic beverages, extend the sales tax to newspapers, magazines, snacks and candy ("luxuries," Mr. Wilson called them), cut much of the state's planned increases in financial aid expected by school districts and community colleges and raise tuition at state universities by 20 percent. But Mr. Wilson, a moderate Republican, still found some money for prenatal care and other programs that fit his theory that the cure for social ills lies more in prevention than remediation.
It was sobering to know that all this was the good news. Like Mr. Wilson, many governors were basing their estimates on the assumption that the economy would rebound by midyear. Much worse could be in store, Mr. Wilson conceded. "We are in considerable flux," he said. "There is a distinct possibility of a worsening of the recession."
 
Drastic Moves by Democrats
 He spoke just a day after Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia, a Democrat, asked the State's General Assembly to grant him authority to furlough 100,000 state workers if necessary. "Clearly now is not the time to initiate new programs or to expand discretionary spending," he said.
The new Governor of Florida, Lawton M. Chiles Jr., a Democrat, was forced to cut $270 million from the state budget just three days after taking office, and the new Governor of Michigan, John Engler, a Republican, is expected to announce plans to lay off 8,000 state employees, 12 percent of the work force, amid skepticism that he could keep his campaign pledge to cut property taxes by 20 percent.
So it goes around the country, as governors press ahead into a recession that has forced even liberal Democrats like Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York to talk like fiscal conservatives.
"The immediate goal is to live within our means, closing the gap between what we would have proposed to spend and our diminished resources," Mr. Cuomo said in his State of the State Message on Wednesday as he faces what could be a budget shortage of $4 billion in the next fiscal year.
A day earlier, Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey offered a modest plan to create 7,000 new jobs and help middle-income people buy homes, but he faced the prospect of closing a $600 million budget gap at a time when it was politically impossible to raise taxes. Last year, at Mr. Florio's urging, the Legislature passed the largest tax increase in the state's history, and the political repercussions have been extreme.
So far, 28 of the 50 states have been forced to look at spending cuts or for added revenues to close budget gaps for the current fiscal year, and more are expected to join them, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers and the National Governors' Association.
Next week, six more new governors wade into this sea of red ink: two Republicans, Jim Edgar of Illinois and George V. Voinovich of Ohio, and four Democrats, Joan Finney of Kansas, David Walters of Oklahoma, Barbara Roberts of Oregon and Ann Richards of Texas.
When all the nation's governors have been installed, there will be 28 Democratic governors, 19 Republicans and 2 independents, both of whom are former Republicans; one state, Arizona, remains without a governor-elect pending a runoff election on Feb. 26.
 
Plans for a Lottery
 In Texas, no stranger to fiscal troubles, Governor Richards faces a $4.2 billion shortage in the two-year budget for 1992-93. She has said she hopes that a state lottery, along with a hiring freeze and some spending cuts, will avert the need for a tax increase.
Probably nowhere is the state of the states more dismal than in New England. In Massachusetts, with a long tradition of high services and high taxes, the new Governor, William F. Weld, a Republican, took office on Jan. 3 after a campaign in which he vowed to trim state government. In his inaugural address, the former Federal prosecutor prescribed what he called "entrepreneurial government."
"Let us make history as well as headlines by reinventing the way state government functions in this cradle of democratic capitalism," he said.
The fiscal dilemma is particularly pointed in California, a state that has grown in population by a staggering 24 percent, or 5.7 million people, in the last decade, mainly from immigration. This has added an enormous burden in social services and needs for new roads, classrooms, water supplies as well as more police and fire protection.
Governor Wilson rejected both across-the-board cuts and any general increase in income or sales taxes. He proposed to cut welfare grants under the Aid to Familes with Dependent Children program by 9 percent, reducing the monthly grant to a parent with two children to $633 from $694, for example. California welfare benefits are higher than any state's except Alaska. Mr. Wilson said he preferred to offer essential services rather than cash to such families.
The leadership of the Democratic-controlled Legislature did not like everything Mr. Wilson proposed, but, given the stressful times, neither did the Democrats reject his message. "We do not agree with some of the things the Governor proposes," said the President Pro Tempore of the State Senate, David A. Roberti of Los Angeles. "But we recognize the bleakness of the situation we face."

HEADLINE: MARKET PLACE;
Questions About New Glaxo Drugs

BYLINE: By Steven Prokesch

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
IN the last decade, Glaxo Holdings P.L.C. has been one of the strongest British stocks, largely as a result of Zantac, its anti-ulcer medicine that is the world's top-selling drug. In the year that ended June 30, Zantac accounted for 49 percent of Glaxo's sales of 2.85 billion ($4.98 billion).
But a slip in Glaxo's price in recent weeks on the London Stock Exchange has raised the question of whether the long rise is over. While not expecting an immediate plunge, several analysts believe the stock, long an overperformer relative to the market, could turn into an underperformer in the months ahead. They have recently downgraded their earnings estimates for Glaxo. 
 Glaxo is seeking regulatory approval around the world for several potentially important drugs. But analysts' doubts are mounting about whether sales will grow rapidly enough to compensate for a slowdown in the sales of Zantac, which is facing a powerful new competitor, Losec (Prilosec in the United States) made by Astra A.B. of Sweden.
With Glaxo still selling at a premium of 55 to 60 percent relative to the London market, "We think it looks expensive," said Jacquelyne S. Cantle, an analyst at Smith New Court Securities P.L.C. in London. She said Glaxo was trading at 15 times expected earnings for the year that ends June 30. She and other analysts predict that when the Persian Gulf crisis is over and the British economy begins to revive, investors will move out of drug stocks and into now-depressed cyclical stocks.
For now, Miss Cantle says investors should consider reducing their Glaxo holdings and buying more reasonably priced shares of British drugcompanies whose earnings she expects to grow more rapidly in the next couple of years. These include SmithKline Beecham P.L.C. and Fisons P.L.C.
Analysts say the dollar's strength against the pound is also hurting Glaxo's earnings. The United States accounted for about 40 percent of Glaxo's sales in the 1990 fiscal year.
But the biggest problem appears to be competition from Losec, which has been doing very well in Europe. Losec, a new type of drug known as a proton-pump inhibitor, is believed to be more effective in treating ulcers than the H2 antagonists, a class of drugs that now dominates the market. This class includes Zantac; Tagamet, from SmithKline Beecham, and Pepcid, from Merck & Company.
Analysts have been expecting the United States Food and Drug Administration to approve Losec within a few weeks for treatment of peptic ulcers and other gastrointestinal diseases where treatment involves reducing stomach-acid production.
Losec, which is licensed to Merck for sale in the United States, now has F.D.A. approval only for very limited use. While it has only about 5 percent of the $1.5 billion American market for anti-ulcer drugs, some analysts predict its share could grow to 15 percent in the United States and worldwide within two years.
The importance of the impending F.D.A. decision was apparent on Friday. It was learned then that a medical magazine would claim that the F.D.A. would not give Losec full approval but might permit it to be used only after other drugs like Zantac had been tried. That caused Glaxo's stock to jump 24 pence (46 cents) in London, to close at 8.42 ($16.06). Analysts were divided about the significance of the report. A week ago, the stock had sunk to 8.11, down from 8.74 in mid-December.
Glaxo's American depository receipts, which reached $34.63 in mid-December on the New York Stock Exchange, closed Friday at $32.75 each, up 87.5 cents.
Analysts predict that Zantac's sales, which in the local currencies of its markets rose 16 percent in fiscal 1990, will grow only 10 to 15 percent in fiscal 1991 and will continue to slow from there.
But Glaxo has other promising new drugs for which it is seeking regulatory approval. Those that analysts say have the highest potential include Ondansetron, a drug for combating nausea and vomiting in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy; Sumatriptan, a potentially revolutionary treatment for migraine headaches, and Salmeterol, a drug that unlike existing ones, would provide asthma sufferers enough medication to sleep through the night.
By the mid- to late 1990's, Ondansetron's annual sales could reach $400 million, Sumatriptan's $1 billion and Salmeterol's $750 million, said Paul Krikler at Goldman Sachs International Ltd.
The problem is the next year or two. In the year that ends June 30, several analysts expect Glaxo's earnings to grow by 5 percent at most. But echoing others, Mr. Krikler said: "I am positive on Glaxo for the longer term."
That view is not unanimous. While Glaxo says it is confident that patents protect Zantac until 2002, Robin J. Gilbert, an analyst at James Capel & Company, said it was unclear whether the protection would last beyond 1995. Companies that make generic drugs "are expecting to target Zantac," he said. It remains to be seen, he added, just how big sellers the new Glaxo drugs will be.

HEADLINE: Financing Is Offered on S.& L. Assets

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Jan. 13

 BODY:
In an auction next month, Federal officials plan to offer purchasers financing for up to 85 percent of the price of dozens of apartment buildings in Texas that the Government acquired in the savings industry bailout.
So far, the Government has not been able to attract enough bidders on these and billions of dollars of other foreclosed properties. 
 The auction, which also includes a few office buildings and retail centers, will be the largest so far with financing provided by notes from the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency in charge of the Government's savings and loan bailout. The Government appraised the properties -- almost all are in Texas -- at a total current value of $181 million.
 
Cash Demand Dropped
 The amount of capital available to finance real estate purchases has been reduced as bank examiners have cracked down on real estate lending and a glut of office buildings has produced large losses for individual investors, insurance companies, pension funds and financial institutions.
That is the main reason the Bush Administration was criticized for initially demanding cash for thousands of properties when Resolution Trust was organized in 1989. The Administration had wanted to recover as much money for the Treasury as rapidly as possible.
But analysts, economists and investors said real estate is rarely sold without most of the payment being borrowed. The decision last month to increase the amount of Resolution Trust financing available to $7 billion, from $1 billion, was more realistic, many real estate professionals said. At least $250 million of the total is restricted to financing the sales of low-income housing.
"Unless you want to permit a complete free fall in property values, I don't know that there is any alternative," said Bernard Weinstein, an economist at the University of North Texas in Denton. "The R.T.C. has been very sensitive to local market conditions. They don't want to start another wave of distressed selling."
 
Controls $34.6 Billion
 The agency already has granted approximately $50 million in promissory notes to property acquirers. On Sept. 30, the Resolution Trust controlled $17.5 billion in real estate it had acquired from insolvent savings institutions and another $17.1 billion in past-due loans backed mainly by real estate.
Craig Hall, chief executive of the Hall Financial Group, a Dallas-based company that manages 45,000 apartment units, including 20,000 in Texas, applauded the expanded financing program. "Given the magnitude of the problem the R.T.C. has, they have to consider a variety of approaches," he said.
Several private investors cautioned that the financing effort would fail if officials priced properties too high. In that case, rent payments could not meet monthly interest payments and maintenance costs, projects would fall into default and back into Government hands. Taxpayers would then face even steeper bills from the savings industry crisis.
Sophisticated buyers will not gloss over huge expenses to repair and improve troubled properties simply to take advantage of the Government's financing if the auction price is too high, said Alan Vitale, treasurer of the Woodlands Corporation, a developer based in the Houston area.
At the auction, bidders must pay a cash deposit equal to at least 15 percent of the purchase price. The balance can be financed at a fixed interest rate of 10 percent by the Resolution Trust. The debt is owed in 1998 but can be extended twice for one year if market conditions are bad.
 
Region in Recovery
 The Texas economy's gradual recovery during the last three years has slowed since the Persian Gulf crisis. Still, many economists have said the state is unlikely to follow the rest of the nation into recession. Apartment occupancy rates exceed 90 percent in big cities in Texas for the first time in seven years.
Mr. Hall said market values for Texas apartment projects were not likely to rise much in the years ahead. Dozens of troubled projects in the state remain to be forced onto the market through foreclosures. Moreover, falling home prices have given many renters an affordable alternative to paying higher rents.
Still, the Government's plan to sell dozens of apartment buildings to single buyers, among them insurance companies, pension funds and private investor groups, is a good one, Mr. Hall said. "There are more purchasers for that kind of volume than people might realize," he said.
Resolution Trust has scheduled a conference on Tuesday in Washington to discuss the 61 properties and mortgages in the auction. Bids are due on Feb. 21, with the results to be announced on Feb. 22.
The properties were culled from loan portfolios of two Texas savings institutions the Government took over in 1989: Commonwealth Federal Savings of Houston and Alamo Federal Savings of San Antonio.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
With a Sense of Foreboding, Jordan Puts Troops on Alert

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Jan. 13

 BODY:
Wedged between Israel and Iraq, Jordan has ordered a military alert and stationed thousands of troops in defensive positions overlooking the Jordan Valley, in part as a signal to Israel to avoid involvement in the Persian Gulf crisis, diplomats here said.
The troop deployment, which has been observed by Israeli forces from positions in the occupied West Bank, reflects a deepening mood of foreboding as the possibility of war approaches. This is spurring many Arab leaders to urge both the United States and President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to avert a conflict that could envelop and reshape the region. 
 "You may win one battle, but you will lose the entire Arab world" by fighting against Arabs, King Hussein of Jordan told an American television interviewer here this weekend as the Jan. 15 United Nations deadline approaches for Iraq to leave Kuwait or risk attack.
 
Arab Appeals to Iraq
 Jordan, whose population is more than half-Palestinian, has been portrayed as an ally of Iraq in the gulf crisis. Other Arab leaders, notably those of Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria, who have backed the American-led military buildup in the Persian Gulf, have also directed last-minute appeals to Iraq.
Both Syria and Egypt have contributed troops to the multinational force massing in Saudi Arabia, but, increasingly, Arab worries are focusing on the prospect of Israel retaliating against a strike by Iraq if war breaks out.
Israel's commitment to retaliation against an Iraqi missile strike is profoundly worrying to King Hussein, whose 74,000-man army is thought unable to withstand any Israeli ground assault. But a Western military specialist here said: "The Israelis can strike back at Baghdad by air. They do not need to enter Jordan. If they did, it would be difficult to stop them."
Jordan's latest deployment, according to diplomats who spoke in return for anonymity, involves tens of thousands of troops from four divisions who have been moved from bases in the east of the country to prepared positions in the high ground overlooking the Jordan Valley.
"The idea is apparently to deter Israel," a Western official said.
By Western accounts, Jordan's Army has 1,130 British and American battle tanks while its Air Force, whose budget was reduced last year because of the country's economic crisis, relies on aging American F-5 and French Mirage F-1 planes. Some of its recent air-defense systems, including ground-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft guns, were purchased from the Soviet Union.
The deployment of ground forces is concentrated in the area abutting the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which Jordan lost in the 1967 Middle East war, diplomats said. The army is 80 percent composed of Bedouins widely regarded as loyal to King Hussein.
In recent days, Israeli officials have reported seeing troops move into positions in the hills that had not been used for many years. Prime Minister Mudar Badran, in an interview published here on Saturday, sought to allay Israeli fears by saying Iraq had agreed not to use Jordan as a corridor for ground attacks on Israel. But he indicated that Jordan might call on Iraq to help defend it if it is attacked. Syria has also said it would help defend Jordan against Israel.

HEADLINE: Retailers Are Facing Hard Choices

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
After the worst and most perplexing Christmas season in more than a decade, American retailers face an agonizing quandary: Should they be cautious and conservative, or aggressive, hoping to force their luck?
As industry leaders gather in New York today for the annual National Retail Federation meeting, caution seems to be the prevailing mood. 
 Many executives say they would like to try more innovative merchandising and marketing and add new kinds of stores. But they quickly point out that now is not the time for drastic changes. They cite the economic uncertainty of the recession, the Middle East crisis and the slow-to-buy mentality of consumers.
 
Stakes Are High
 Perhaps more than in any recent year, the stakes are high in 1991. In recent interviews, every economist and many retailers predicted that sales and earnings would show no gain, or a decline, in the first half of the year, assuming a Middle East war or prolonged stalemate. They said they expected a gradual improvement in the second half of the year, assuming a resolution in the Middle East.
Retailers find some glimmers of hope in the prospect of lower interest rates.
The urgency this year is that weak retailers and those with high debts stand to lose local or national market share unless they move to improve their marketing position with new operating concepts.
"In such a situation, we can either roll over and play dead or be imaginative and aggressive," said Stanley Marcus, the former chairman of Neiman Marcus. "There really isn't much choice this year. There's a danger and hazard no matter what we do."
Those that have been successful in the last few years, notably general discount merchants like Wal-Mart Stores, specialty outlets like the Circuit City Stores electronics chain and clothing stores like the Limited, have not hesitated to announce strong expansion plans.
These chains plan to open new stores or make acquisitions to increase the size of their existing units or enter new markets.
That will make it much harder for several giant retailers already under severe pressure. These include Sears, Roebuck & Company, the nation's largest retailer, which last week announced it was eliminating 21,000 jobs to cut expenses; Federated Department Stores and the Allied Stores Corporation, two major chains now in voluntary bankruptcy; R. H. Macy & Company, which has been selling equity to reduce debt, and Ames Department Stores, a discounter that is in voluntary bankruptcy.
 
Altered Priorities
 Are there culprits for retailing's distress? One of America's most renowned designers, Geoffrey Beene, criticized the industry's merger and acquisition binge, saying the result had altered priorities to "cater to owners and creditors, not to the customers."
For now, Kenneth A. Macke, chairman and chief executive of the Dayton Hudson Corporation of Minneapolis, said: "It is a time to execute better all that we do rather than a time for uniqueness. The consumer is restless and has expectations of us that we can't afford to ignore in terms of service, being in stock on desirable goods and offering fair prices. We expect a tough first half and then a gradual pickup. But we are planning to be very cautious so that we don't have a lot of leftover inventory."
That strategy means strict control over how much and what style of merchandise to order, even to the point of risking running short on some items that customers want.
But stores that can afford to are trying new concepts in merchandising. Circuit City plans to open many more of its small Impulse stores that sell smaller-size electronics items.
People who follow the industry say it seems clear that the more "focused" retailer fared the best in 1990 and in the holiday season. For retailers, focused means presenting a clear picture of merchandise and service so that their store becomes a destination for consumers rather than a place to wander into.
Despite a 1990 that many retailers would rather forget, there were still several successes. Among them was Montgomery Ward, which expects to report record profits for 1990. Executives there mentioned their strategy for selling a four-head videocassette recorder for $248, the amount usually charged for a two-head machine that does not have comparable video or audio quality.
As Bernard Brennan, Ward's chairman, put it: "This was a way we could focus on particular merchandise. We sat down with some VCR producers, showed them our specs and guaranteed a large order. Last year, we sold almost $40 million worth of those recorders, or 160,000 units. That was about 3 percent of the total U.S. VCR market in sales."
For 1991, one potentially promising new retailing move is in the works by Frederick Atkins Inc., the New York-based research-merchandising organization owned by 29 large retail chains. It has developed what it calls an environmentally friendly line of sportswear called "Clean Clothes," which is expected to be sold in stores early next month. This 400-item line, which officials hope will tap the growing interest in ecology, is made of all-cotton fabrics with no synthetics. Paper wrappings are recyclable and buttons are made of wood rather than plastic.
Lee Abraham, chairman of the Associated Merchandising Corporation, a large research-merchandising arm in New York owned by large retailers, said, "One of my chief concerns is that given the current, economic conditions, retailers may resist investing in the technology they need to move forward strategically."

HEADLINE: NO SHORTAGE SEEN IN SUPPLIES OF OIL DURING A GULF WAR

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
A war in the Persian Gulf may not create shortages of oil in the United States, oil company executives, Government officials and other experts say. But they caution that prices may surge if panic buying drains supplies from gas stations and distribution centers.
While military officials say the Saudi oilfields are adequately defended against an Iraqi attack and would not suffer major damage, a war is expected to cut Saudi exports by more than a third, as oilfield workers flee and operations are closed. That situation would last until the United States and its allies establish air superiority. 
 But even that reduction in Saudi imports is unlikely to create a shortage of crude oil in importing countries, industry experts say.
 
Optimism on Price
 Indeed, some experts predict that the price of a barrel of crude oil may not rise above the $40 peak it reached in the fall. That would be a sharp contrast to the days immediately after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, when some people predicted $100-a-barrel oil in case of war.
Experts point out that in the long run, war will not affect oil supplies because oil underground is virtually invulnerable to attack. If wells are damaged badly enough, new ones might have to be drilled, but the companies will know where to set the holes.
There is also optimism that Iraq will not be able to interfere seriously with tanker traffic.
 
Little Naval Threat
 "Iraq doesn't have much of a navy to speak of," said Paul E. Mawn, an oil logistics consultant at Temple Barker Sloane Inc., a Boston consulting firm. Mr. Mawn is a captain in the Naval Reserve and a member of a logistics panel set up by the Chief of Naval Operations.
While guerrilla attacks are possible, Mr. Mawn said, "We control the seas and we control the air, and we will continue to do so."
Vahan Zanoyan, an analyst at the Petroleum Finance Company, a consulting firm in Washington, observed, "It's not easy to create a physical shortage."
As a precaution against attacks, oil-producing countries have moved large stocks of oil into tankers anchored closer to customers, or into storage on land.
Iran, for example, has so much oil at sea that some oil company executives have taken to calling it "the Iranian strategic petroleum reserve," a reference to the United States' own underground supply.
The Saudis have also moved large supplies of oil to sea and to land-based storage sites outside the Persian Gulf. Between them, the two countries probably have 60 million barrels or more situated near importing countries, experts say.
Stocks held by oil-importing countries also appear to be adequate.
John J. Easton Jr., the Assistant Secretary of Energy for International Affairs and Energy Emergencies, testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday that as of the end of the third quarter of last year, "Worldwide, commercial stocks in market economies are about 150 million barrels above the average level for the last four years."
Mr. Easton's figures did not include the United States' Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which contains 583 million barrels of oil, and which Mr. Easton described as "primed and waiting."
Germany and Japan also hold substantial strategic reserves of oil.
 
Weathering a Shortage
 So even if Saudi exports were reduced by as much as three million barrels a day, from last month's production levels of about eight million barrels a day, the level of commercial and strategic reserves suggests that the world could weather a long period with three million barrels a day less of Saudi oil.
"The only way the U.S. has a serious problem is if there's panic," said Theodore Eck, chief economist of the Amoco Corporation. That would occur, he said, if many people decided to rush out and buy gasoline or other products "before the hoarders do."
At the Phillips Petroleum Company in Bartlesville, Okla., C. J. Silas, the company's president, said in a speech last week, "I personally feel that a shortfall of three million barrels of oil a day would be manageable."
But he added, "My biggest fear is that people will perceive a coming shortage and immediately start buying and even hoarding oil."
 
Response of Drivers
 At Texaco, William K. Tell Jr., senior vice president, said in a telephone interview that most drivers feel comfortable with as low as an eighth of a tank of gas and fill their tanks once a week. If they all decided on the day war broke out to fill their tanks immediately, demand would rise sevenfold, he said.
The result, he said, would be to drain some stations and create gas lines. This did not happen when Iraq took over Kuwait because few motorists realized immediately that a crisis had begun, experts say.
On the oil futures market, where companies try to lock in prices of oil for future delivery, there are clear signs that traders expect oil prices to fall in future months. On Friday, oil for delivery in February closed at $27.29 a barrel, and oil for delivery in August was $5 less, at $22.38.
Such pricing has been the case for weeks, demonstrating that traders believe that whatever happens in the near term, the long-term threat is less.
But even this optimism would not stop a short-term spike in prices, with customers and speculators rushing to buy whatever supplies are available.
"We're not being held hostage by Saddam Hussein, but by those blue suede shoes on the floor of the New York Mercantile Exchange," said Douglas G. Elmets, a spokesman for the Atlantic Richfield Company, referring to oil traders.
A price spike, he said, would reflect the traders' "reacting emotionally rather than rationally."
The anticipated reduction in Saudi exports reflects the expectation that the Saudis will shut wells, gathering stations and terminals in a war.
Experts said the first wells shut would be those off the coast of the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. On-shore wells in the Neutral Zone were shut in August, but the offshore wells have continued to produce about 250,000 barrels a day.
Next, the experts said, would be the gulf wells slightly south, off the Saudi coast, where the Safaniya, Zuluf and Marjan fields together produce at least two million barrels a day.
In the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, offshore platforms were the only oil operations conclusively knocked out, because they tower over the water, are easy to locate and hard to defend.
Other candidates for closing are the Saudis' two Persian Gulf loading terminals, at Ras Tannurah and Jubail. But experts note that these sites are 200 miles from Kuwait City, and even further from Iraq, a long way for attack planes to penetrate.
A third major terminal is at Yanbu, on the Red Sea, and is supplied with oil from eastern Saudi Arabia by a pipeline called the Petroline, with a capacity of 3.2 million barrels.
A parallel pipeline, IPSA 2, was built to carry up to 1.6 million barrels a day of Iraqi oil to the Red Sea. Western experts are not sure whether that pipeline has junctions that allow it to be filled within Saudi Arabia, but those could be added, they say.
 
$80 Price Is Seen
 ROME, Jan. 13 (REUTERS) -- A six- to nine-month Persian Gulf war could push oil prices above $80 a barrel, the head of Italy's state-owned energy company contends.
Gabriele Cagliari, chairman of the Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi, told the Socialist Party newspaper Avanti that such a price jump would lead to a fall in demand of 2.5 million barrels a day for the first three months of a war and of 3 million for the next three months.
A war lasting between one and two months, he said in an interview published today, could push the oil price to $60 a barrel initially for psychological reasons, even before any damage to oil fields. Since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2, oil prices have soared to as high as $41 a barrel before easing to a current range of $25 to $28.

HEADLINE: SOVIET CRACKDOWN;
Bush Deplores Soviet Crackdown But Takes No Steps in Response

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
President Bush today condemned the Soviet Union's military action in Lithuania, saying there was "no justification for the use of force" in the breakaway Soviet republic. But the President refrained from taking immediate steps to punish Moscow for its actions.
Mr. Bush and some of his senior aides also expressed growing concern about the turmoil in the Soviet Union, and one of those aides, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, said the Lithuania crisis could herald the end of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's efforts at political and economic reform. 
 In a brief news conference this afternoon on the South Lawn of the White House, Mr. Bush read from a statement warning that events in the Baltic states "threaten to set back, or perhaps even reverse, the process of reform" that Mr. Gorbachev undertook when he came to power in 1985.
 "We condemn these acts which could not help but affect our relationship," he said. "At this hour, the United States in the West will redouble our efforts to strengthen and encourage peaceful change in the Soviet Union." [Text of statement, page A7.]
The President called the Soviet actions "a great tragedy" for the people of Lithuania and added: "The brave people and the leaders of the Baltic states have, indeed, acted with dignity and restraint."
Coming on the heels of the vote in Congress authorizing the use of force against Iraq in the Persian Gulf, the events in Lithuania have vastly complicated the questions of diplomacy, strategy and politics facing the President. [News Analysis, page A7.]
 Mr. Bush refused to say whether the crackdown would cause him to cancel a scheduled summit meeting with Mr. Gorbachev next month, saying such an action was "hypothetical." Questions had previously arisen over whether the talks would go ahead because of the prospect of war in the Persian Gulf.
Other officials also suggested that for the time being the Administration would stand by its decision last month to ease restrictions on trade with the Soviet Union imposed by Congress in 1975.
Mr. Bush's statement did not attack Mr. Gorbachev by name, calling instead on "Soviet leaders" to renounce violence and to resume negotiations with the separatist leaders in the Baltic republics.
 
Gorbachev's Role Undetermined
 In a question-and-answer session after he read his statement, Mr. Bush said he did not know whether Mr. Gorbachev was responsible for the assault in Lithuania's capital, Vilnius, which left at least 13 people dead, or whether military or internal security officials acted without his blessing.
"I cannot answer that question. I just don't know the facts on it," the President said.
Mr. Bush said he was concerned about the growing turmoil in the Soviet Union, and that Mr. Gorbachev had told him recently that he is "very much concerned" as well.
Mr. Bush did not say when that exchange took place, but he last spoke with the Soviet leader on Friday morning. Administration officials have said that Mr. Bush raised his concerns about the Baltic republics in guarded terms at that time, but that Mr. Gorbachev was reluctant to discuss the issue.
 
Concern Among Officials
 Other senior Government officials here and abroad reacted with growing concern but restrained anger to Moscow's military action.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, in a statement issued in Ankara, Turkey, called the Soviet moves "deeply disturbing" and fundamentally opposed to Mr. Gorbachev's policies of economic and political reform.
"Soviet interests above all else require the reform process to go forward. Only with continued reform will progress and hope for the Soviet Union be possible," his statement said. "In the end, enduring U.S.-Soviet cooperation, indeed partnerships, depend on continued reforms."
A senior official aboard Mr. Baker's plane, speaking on condition of anonymity, later said that the Administration had been concerned about Soviet action in the Baltics for several months, and had repeatedly urged Moscow to negotiate a peaceful settlement there.
 
'The Wrong Direction'
 The official called the crackdown "tragic," saying it was moving United States-Soviet relations "in the wrong direction." But he added that the Administration had not decided yet to take retaliatory measures.
In the most recent comparable crackdown on internal dissent, the killing of student protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in June 1989, the Bush Administration suspended military sales to China, broke off high-level government contacts, and supported a suspension of World Bank development loans. Those actions were widely regarded as modest.
In the case of the Soviet Union, the senior official said, "Let me say that there are still, in my opinion, areas where it is to the mutual advantage of the two countries to continue to try to work things out."
 
Agenda for Summit Talks
 Among other major unresolved items on the superpower agenda are the carrying out of the treaty limiting conventional armed forces in Europe -- now embroiled in charges that the Soviet military is cheating on the terms of the pact -- and the signing of the treaty reducing long-range nuclear weapons, scheduled for the February summit meeting.
That official said the summit talks remain on schedule. But in Washington, the White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, said the future of the talks "depends on what happens in the next few hours, the next few days, and I think that that's certainly under discussion" now. Mr. Sununu was interviewed on the CBS News program "Face the Nation."
Mr. Cheney, appearing on the ABC News program "This Week," said the Soviet crackdown may well signal that Mr. Gorbachev's program of economic and political reform has failed.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
As Deadline Nears, America Speaks of Fear and Resolve

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
On what many Americans see as the eve of war in the Persian Gulf, the mood of the nation yesterday was somber, divided, apprehensive: a people caught between a desire for peace and the burden of what Woodrow Wilson called the right more precious than peace.
The months of futile diplomacy had apparently come down to a final day. The President had issued his strongest warning. The troops and aircraft carriers were in place. Congress had given its speeches and its assent. Time was running out -- but still the haunting uncertainties lingered.
 
An Odd, Unreal Quality
 In New York and Chicago and San Francisco, in cities and small towns across the nation, the January weekend had an odd, unreal quality, as visits with scores of Americans showed. Weddings were held, football games were played, families sat down to dinner and ordinary people went about their customary lives. 
 But in houses of worship, prayers and sermons were offered against war. In Los Angeles, 4,000 people went to an antiwar protest out of the Vietnam War era. In Atlanta and Houston and St. Louis and Detroit, people spoke with profound emotion of their fears for loved ones and for the future of the country.
And everywhere lurked undercurrents that were not easy to define -- a sense that the crisis was moving inexorably out of control, that one's own voice had been lost in the rush of events, that America was poised for better or worse on the threshold of a historic day, one that might prove proud or tragic in the months or years to come.
 
Dramatic Evidence of Division
 With tomorrow's United Nations deadline looming and no sign that Saddam Hussein will withdraw his forces from Kuwait, Americans were still grappling with their feelings. A New York Times/CBS News Poll conducted Jan. 5-7 reflected the ambivalence, showing almost the same support for attacking Iraq as for giving economic sanctions more time.
And interviews with scores of people across the country provided dramatic evidence that the United States was a nation divided.
"The price of democracy is high," Ellis Casden, of Stamford, Conn., said outside Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., before the playoff game yesterday between the Giants and the Chicago Bears. "We have been the guardians of peace. We can't let this go without doing something about it. The Middle East is a powder keg, and it's not going to go away."
But Mr. Casden's son, Greg, a 20-year-old student at Green Mountain College in Vermont, said the war, if it came, would be a fight over oil rather than democratic principles. "I think it's pretty obscene," he declared.
At St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan, John Cardinal O'Connor, the Archbishop of New York, said he believed in the sincerity of the Bush Administration and Congress, but he declared: "Our Government can err in its deliberations and its decisions."
The Cardinal urged Americans not to accept that war is unavoidable, and said everyone had a moral obligation to raise questions up to and beyond tomorrow's deadline. "It is the highest form of loyalty to ask whether what we are doing is right," he said.
On a sunlit afternoon in St. Louis, Debbie Swallow, 39 years old, took her infant daughter, Danielle, to watch Big Bird cavort on stage in "Sesame Street Live." Waiting in line for tickets, she said: "I'd hate to see another Vietnam."
In a nation that has not experienced real war in well over a decade, the Persian Gulf crisis seemed surreal to Gale Orem, 47, a legal secretary in Houston. "I don't think our society knows much of war," she said. "It's like a horror movie we can turn off if we want to. In America, we live on a yellow brick road of sorts -- and that may be our undoing."

GRAPHIC: Photos: David Fisher, left, a camp counselor, and Steve Herz, a law student in Chicago, both watched Congressional hearings on TV. "At least in Vietnam we were trying to stop the spread of Communism; here, there is no such high or noble cause," Mr. Herz said. (Jonathan Kirn for The New York Times); "It's not a democracy we're trying to defend. And it's nothing but poor people who have to fight it," said Claude Walton, a deacon at Chicago's First Baptist Congregational Church. (Jonathan Kirn for The New York Times); "I pray about it, mostly for the troops there, the young people, and I've been praying more as it gets closer," said Mia Hawkins of Atlanta. (Alan S. Weiner for The New York Times) (pg. A12)

HEADLINE: Management of T.V.A. Is Cut Into Three Parts

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: KNOXVILLE, Tenn., Jan. 13

 BODY:
The Tennessee Valley Authority, the nation's largest power agency, has reorganized its management in an effort to improve service.
The reorganization, which took effect last week, divides the management of the Federal agency into three operating groups, in charge of power generation, customer services, and resources and economic development.
"Now that our costs are under better control, it's time to challenge ourselves with new goals that put customer service at the top of our priority list and at the top of our organization," the chairman, Marvin T. Runyon, said Tuesday.
The plan did not include any layoffs of the agency's 26,000 employees. A reorganization three years ago cost 8,000 employees their jobs. "No significant reductions are expected at all," said a spokesman, John Moulton.
The power generation group, headed by Oliver Kingsley Jr., the agency's former nuclear chief, will manage and operate all of T.V.A.'s fossil fuel, hydroelectric and nuclear power operations.
Mary Sharpe Hayes, the former vice president of marketing and strategic planning, is president of the customer group, which will oversee service to industrial customers and power distributors like municipal or citizen-owned utilities.
The resource group offers natural resource and economic development programs to residents of the seven-state T.V.A. region. Bill Willis, the authority's former senior executive officer, is president.
The T.V.A. It operates in Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF: Congress in Step;
After the Vote, Margins Are Ignored, But Potential Divisions Are Serious

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 13

 BODY:
A Congress that had seemed loath to deal with the Persian Gulf finally went ahead when its leaders despaired of getting President Bush to promise to ask formally for their support before attacking Iraq, some members of Congress and highly placed aides said today.
 And a President who had previously told the leaders that he wanted action only if they could assure him the result would be overwhelming then went ahead and asked, and lobbied hard but won only a bare five-vote victory in the Senate. 
 Today no one was talking about the margins, or the history. President Bush said: "We went to Congress. Both houses of Congress affirmed the policy of this Government." The House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, said, "It is clear that the Congress has spoken, and the exact size of the vote is irrelevant."
The Democratic leaders who had fought so hard for resolutions demanding continued reliance on economic sanctions had been quick to say, even before they lost the Saturday votes, that they would stand behind American troops if President Bush took them into battle, insisting that there would be no moves to cut off funds after Saturday's definitive vote.
 
Potential Divisions
 But even so, the voting patterns showed serious potential divisions. The partisan ones were obvious; 70 percent of the Democratic senators and representatives who voted Saturday opposed force and 98 percent of the Republicans favored it.
But the regional divisions were almost as sharp. Southern lawmakers voted 86 to 32 for force, and their senators in particular provided the Democratic votes that were essential to Mr. Bush's victory. Lawmakers from the Southwest favored force by 35 to 13. Mountain state lawmakers went 16 to 8 in favor of force.
But New Englanders, including a unanimous Massachusetts delegation, opposed force by 23 to 13. Midwesterners were narrowly opposed, 74 to 63, and lawmakers from the Middle Atlantic region favored force but only by 51 to 45. Pacific Coast lawmakers were almost evenly split, with 38 favoring force and 35 opposed.
Those differences, if there is war and it is not short, may divide the country more seriously than the party splits, for the Democrats on the losing side have been earnestly seeking to close ranks with the victors.
If there was a nearly universal area of agreement today, it was among lawmakers who felt proud that Congress had faced the issue and decided it, reasserting its prerogatives after decades of going along with Presidents who acted first and consulted later.
 
Message Is Restraint
 But institutional concerns were also a factor in its taking as long as it did to speak. Last fall, after Mr. Bush announced a doubling of troop strength to provide offensive capacity in the gulf, there were many calls from both Republicans and Democrats for Congress to return in special session. The leaders resisted, noting that there would be 49 new lawmakers in just two months. Instead, they held hearings from which one clear message was restraint.
Two other arguments were offered today. Mr. Foley said on the NBC News program "Meet the Press" that a vote even as recently as a month ago would have been seen by many members and outsiders as no more than "another quiver in the diplomatic armory." He said that if Congress was going to vote what he called "a real, practical equivalent of a declaration of war," then it should do so in absolutely clear focus, with no one in doubt about what the vote implied.
A complementary explanation for delay came from well-placed Congressional strategists. They said that the other possibility late last fall was a Congressional vote, with more Democrats than were with their leaders on Saturday calling for a reversal of the troop buildup. But with no prospect of a majority big enough to override a veto, that course would only have made the dispute ineradicably partisan.
As it happened, the vote was more partisan than the atmosphere. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, occasionally discerned party motives among Democrats opposed to force. But few other Bush supporters did so, and it is rare for Congress to work so late into the night in as good a humor as was maintained late Friday and early Saturday.
 
How the Action Unfolded
 Even in the new Congress, action came more quickly than the leaders had expected. On Jan. 3, the first day of the 102d Congress, Mr. Foley and Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic majority leader, each promised Congressional action on the war issue, but each was vague about just when would be the appropriate time.
Liberal critics of Mr. Bush's policy demanded a vote before the Jan. 15 deadline, angrily on the Senate floor and more quietly in meetings in the House.
The leaders said they had hoped for a Presidential request for Congressional action before any conflict, but eventually gave up on it. On Friday, Jan. 4, Mr. Mitchell said the Senate would act before the deadline, and on Sunday, Jan. 6, Mr. Foley promised House action, and also predicted that Mr. Bush's side would win. Then, with his irons in the fire, Mr. Bush made the request and got busy lobbying.
And Monday, according to Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, he will sign the joint resolution authorizing him to go to war.

HEADLINE: SOVIET CRACKDOWN;
For Lithuanian-Americans, the News About Home Seems Terrible Indeed

BYLINE: By ARI L. GOLDMAN

 BODY:
Alina and Edward Staknys of Jamaica, Queens, are preoccupied by the news these days. They pore over newspapers, listen to reports by two radio stations at once and wait anxiously for television news broadcasts.
Their fascination with the news has nothing to do with the threat of war in the Persian Gulf region, but with the Communist crackdown in the country where they both grew up, Lithuania. 
 "We were beginning to believe in Mikhail Gorbachev," said Mr. Staknys, a retired electrical engineer. "But this has set us back 50 years."
 
'Does Anyone Care?'
 Alina Staknys, a former high school teacher, said: "We were never crushed so cruelly. And the world's attention is diverted. Does anyone care?"
For thousands of Americans of Lithuanian descent, these are days of pain coupled with the sense of having been abandoned.
According to the Lithuanian Information Center, in the East New York section of Brooklyn, there are 750,000 people who identify themselves as being of Lithuanian descent in the United States, 15,000 of them in the New York metropolitan area. The largest Lithuanian community is in Chicago, which has 100,000 people; other cities with sizable Lithuanian populations are Cleveland, Detroit, Los Angeles and Boston.
Adjacent to the information office is the Lithuanian Cultural Center, a modern building that serves as a social center.
Lithuanian-Americans gathered at the building yesterday for the latest bit of news from their homeland. The information center, through electronic links with parliament, has been providing direct accounts of the crackdown and of how the government is coping during the crisis.
The people who gathered at the center mourned for the 13 civilians killed by Soviet troops and they spoke of the heroism of those who had stood in resistance.
 
Wearing Lithuanian Colors
 Comparisons with the situation in the gulf and the crackdown on the democracy movement in China came quickly to their lips.
"Why is Saddam Hussein not allowed to go into Kuwait while Gorbachev is allowed to march into Lithuania, a democratic country?" asked Aleksandras Sepkus, an artist and recent emigre from Vilnius.
"Is it because there is no oil in Lithuania? Is it because Saddam Hussein talks like a madman and Gorbachev won the Nobel Peace Prize?" he asked.
Mrs. Staknys said that one woman who stood in resistance in Vilnius had been crushed by an advancing tank. "Even the Chinese didn't do that," she said. "We all saw the picture of how a tank stopped because one man stood in the way. But the Russians didn't stop."
The Rev. Casimir Pugevicius said that when the regular Sunday service at Annunciation church in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn was finished, he led the congregation in half an hour more of prayers and hymns for peace in Lithuania.
"The people wanted it and needed it," he said.
 
Appeal to U.S. on Aid to Moscow
 CHICAGO, Jan. 13 (Special to The New York Times) -- Lithuanian-Americans sent hundreds of telegrams to President Bush and members of Congress today, urging a cutoff of United States aid to the Soviet Union and a formal recognition for an independent government in Lithuania.
About 1,500 people, members of the nation's largest Lithuanian community, demonstrated here on Saturday and today in Philadelphia and Los Angeles.
Hundreds of people throughout the Midwest placed calls today to the Lithuanian Hotline, an information network based in the Lithuanian World Center in Le Motte, Ill., a center for Lithuanian immigrants, officials of the center said. Vytatuas Januskis, a real estate developer who helped start the hotline last March, said 3,000 to 4,000 telegrams had been sent to the White House and Congress by this evening.
Mr. Januskis, who attended a conference on economic development in Vilnius last fall, said, "I left there extremely optimistic, so now this is a real damper."

HEADLINE: Art Center for Newark Receives $3 Million

 BODY:
An ambitious proposal to build a performing-arts center in Newark got a lift yesterday with the announcement of a $3 million donation from the Samuel I. Newhouse Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Advance Publications , which publishes The Star-Ledger of Newark.
The gift, the largest ever made by the Newhouse Foundation in New Jersey, brings the amount pledged by New Jersey's businesses for construction of the center to $33 million. The Prudential Insurance Company has committed $3 million, and the Federal Government has committed $1.2 million for planning and design. 
 In addition, New Jersey has committed $20 million through the Economic Development Authority, which is to issue bonds in the spring to pay for site work and the acquisition of a 12-acre parcel of land in downtown Newark.
 
Like Lincoln Center
 In November, Barton Myers, a 56-year-old Los Angeles architect, was commissioned to design a $70-million 2,700-seat multi-use concert hall, which would be the first building of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, a Lincoln Center-like complex near the central business district in Newark.
The hall would be a home for music, dance and theater. It would also house the New Jersey Symphony and would include rehearsal spaces, restaurants and cafes.
In addition to $70 million for the concert hall, another $70 million will be required for site work to complete the first phase of the arts center plan.
 
Of Resurgence
 The proposal envisions the arts as a magnet to attract suburbanites to Newark. "Newark's future and the success of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center are closely linked," said Donald E. Newhouse, vice president of the Newhouse Foundation. "We have seen similar situations across the country wherein a city's resurgence is accelerated by the creation of a center for the performing arts."
Lawrence P. Goldman, the president of the arts center, said that a master plan for the center had been completed and that it would be announced in the next few weeks.

HEADLINE: Shoal Creek Decision Puts Golf on a New Course

BYLINE: By JAIME DIAZ

 BODY:
IT'S still debatable whether what has come to be known simply as "Shoal Creek" sounded the death knell for the nation's exclusionary private golf clubs or was merely an annoying wake-up alarm that has left most of America's privileged reaching for the snooze button.
 When the Shoal Creek Country Club, an all-white club near Birmingham, Ala., gave a black man an honorary membership last July as part of an agreement to head off picketing of the P.G.A. Championship by civil rights groups, Arthur Ashe, whose recent three-volume work charts the progress of the black athlete in America, called it a major breakthrough. 
 "What happened at Shoal Creek is only 20 percent about sports," Ashe said. "It's about society, commerce and culture. It's the upper echelon of white society finally being forced to say, 'All right, it's time.' "
Ashe predicted: "We are going to see a veritable flood of quiet, muted but very significant invitations to blacks to join previously all-white clubs. In two or three years, it's going to be completely different."
Six months later, a lot has happened, and some things are indeed different. Because of Shoal Creek, major professional golf will almost surely never again be played at clubs with exclusionary membership practices. Several prestigious clubs that hold tournaments, most notably Augusta National, now have a black member or are in the process of admitting one or more.
Increased attention has been focused on public figures and their relationship with these clubs. When Tom Watson resigned from the Kansas City Country Club recently because it refused membership to the Jewish businessman Henry Bloch, it was news. (The club later reversed its decision, but Watson did not re-join.) And it was news when Vice President Dan Quayle recently played Cypress Point, the highly exclusive club on the Monterey Peninsula that terminated its association with the PGA Tour rather than conform to a new anti-discrimination policy.
But a large question remains: How much has Shoal Creek actually changed the attitudes fundamental to the perpetuation of exclusionary or all-white golf clubs?
So far, this is still a matter of opinion. Many observers say six months is too short of a time to reverse or even measure a mind-set that has existed since private golf clubs were founded in America in the 1890's.
"It's going to take more time," said Ron Townsend, a television executive who is the first black member at the Augusta National. "I think some attitudes have been affected, but it's going to be awhile before we see if that will be put into practice."
Skeptics can point to Shoal Creek itself. When the club agreed to accept the black businessman Louis Willie Jr. as an honorary member, it also gave assurances that it would begin processing a regular membership for a second black. The prospective member was unidentified,, and no specific timetable beyond a few months was given for how long the processing would take. But as of last week, there was no evidence that the matter has been addressed.
"At the time, there was another man considered," explained the club's president, Tom Rast. "I don't know the status of that right now. The membership committee could have decided that he was not qualified or it could still be in the mill. I don't know. Beyond that, we would rather stay mum on it."
William Bell, the black Birmingham city councilman who in June objected to $1,500 in city funds being used to buy space in the P.G.A. Championship program, said: "I would not be surprised if they never had anyone in mind. The reality is you can't change institutions overnight. In people's hearts and minds, nothing has really changed."
On the other hand, there are those who believe they have seen evidence that Ashe's prediction is coming true.
"I've been getting calls from all over the country from blacks who have been asked to join clubs," said Darwin Davis, a senior vice president at Equitable's Manhattan office, who last year accepted an invitation to join St. Andrew's Country Club in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. "People want to know things like what the interview is like, how people treat you at the club. It's a different climate."
Davis is one of five black members at St. Andrew's, which makes this club, which is generally regarded as the birthplace of American golf, the one with the most black members among the highly exclusive clubs in Westchester County.
"Since I joined, no one has even alluded to race, it's been a total non-event," said Davis, who testified last June before a United States Senate Judiciary Committee hearing regarding club membership practices. "I believe wholeheartedly that while there are some, America is not made up of a whole bunch of bigots who don't like black people. Since Shoal Creek, I think a lot of people who never really thought a lot about the issue are embarrassed, and they're saying, 'Let's open the doors.' "
The most tangible change brought about by Shoal Creek has come in professional golf. When IBM, fearing it could be perceived as associating with bigotry, withdrew its advertising from the telecast of the P.G.A. Championship, several companies followed. The exodus showed golf's ruling bodies that their multimillion-dollar television deals, and the image of the game, were in jeopardy.
Since then, the PGA Tour, the Professional Golfers' Association of America, and the United States Golf Association have adopted policies prohibiting host clubs from having membership practices that discriminate on the basis of race, religion or sex. The five clubs that chose to drop their spot on the PGA Tour rather than conform include Cypress Point and Butler National. The P.G.A. of America lost Aronimink Country Club as the site of the 1993 P.G.A. Championship when the club said its seven-year waiting list for membership could not be altered to expedite a minority-group member.
And the U.S.G.A. lost the St. Louis Country Club as the site of the 1992 Women's Amateur. The all-white club gave poorly conditioned greens as its official reason for withdrawing.
The PGA Tour last week completed contracts that allow it to monitor the membership practices of the private clubs that make up approximately half of the 118 host sites it uses for the regular, Senior and Ben Hogan tours. Not all the clubs have a member who is female, black or from another minority group, but with the incentive of holding a tournament, all have made contractual assurances they will not conduct exclusionary membership practices.
"We were overnight faced with a set of circumstances that we had literally never thought about," said Tim Finchem, deputy commissioner of the PGA Tour. "We changed the process by which we choose our courses because we were faced with the prospect of having our tour associated with exclusionary practices. It was fundamentally clear that to fool around with the possibility that our image could be tarnished was not in our long-term interest."
But private clubs that hold professional tournaments make up only a miniscule percentage of the more than 5,000 private clubs in the United States. It has been estimated by a highly placed U.S.G.A. official that at least three out of four private clubs do not have black members. If Shoal Creek is to have a real effect, it has to be manifested in the membership of a significant number of these clubs.
The pressures to effect change appear to be more internal than external. Several factors make it relatively easy for exclusionary clubs to stay that way. First and foremost, the Constitution guarantees the right of free association.
"There is a fundamental conflict in our society between the rights people can exercise regarding with whom they choose to socialize and the reality that discrimination is invidious and exclusionary," said Frank (Sandy) Tatum, an attorney and a former president of the U.S.G.A. "Those are two things this country was built on."
The only laws that apply economic pressure to private clubs are state measures that threaten the favorable tax status many clubs enjoy by being designated open space or "green-belt" areas. The tax pressure looks like it will intensify. In 1990, legislators from 14 states proposed laws aimed at ending discriminatory practices at private clubs.
No clubs, even the most homogenous, are known to have written bylaws stopping membership on the basis of race or religion. The uproar over Shoal Creek's all-white membership would never have been heard if the club's founder, Hall Thompson, had not said publicly what had long been privately held: "We don't discriminate in every other area except the blacks."
It is also a fact that blacks make up less than 3 percent of all golfers, and that blacks as a group have a lower per-capita income than whites. It is simple, and sometimes accurate, for clubs to say they cannot find black people who both play golf and can afford the expense.
Tatum is a member at both Cypress Point and San Francisco Golf Club, both of which do not have black members. Although he believes the effects of Shoal Creek have been good for golf, he has not suffered a crisis of conscience by belonging to clubs that do not have blacks.
"These are social clubs, not political entities, organized for the purpose of getting together to play golf," Tatum said. "In that situation, I think I have an obligation not to foul up the reason for the setting. We live in a complex society, and it doesn't always go the way we want it to go, particularly in regard to discrimination. But the fact is, a club is entitled to arbitrarily decide who is chosen to be a member. There is a clear right to discriminate in that sense."
But some feel that social pressure is becoming more intense as the idea of exclusionary clubs becomes more out of step with society as a whole.
"One motivation to stop discrimination at clubs is enlightened self interest," said Stuart Lewengrub, southeastern regional director of the Anti-Defamation League. "No corporation wants to be even remotely associated with anything that is tainted with bigotry."
So far, corporate America has not been refusing to pay memberships for its executives, or asking them to resign. But Charles S. Mechem Jr., the new commissioner of the Ladies Professional Golf Association who was a chief executive officer at Great American Broadcasting, believes that Shoal Creek has raised awareness among the business elite.
"Most corporate heads that I know are very sympathetic to the issue to begin with," Mechem said. "They are saying, 'Yes, this is something we do all the time in our business world, and something we need to change in our nonbusiness world.' I think the awareness level by them will accelerate the whole trend toward righting some wrongs."
Al Washington, vice president of human resources at Time-Warner Communications and one of the black members at St. Andrew's, agrees.
"Shoal Creek has heightened the awareness of everyone," Washington said. "People are looking to make accommodations for minorities and women to play this sport. It's simply a matter of having the desire and the goal."

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF: Atlanta;
Vague Possibility Now a Step Away

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Jan. 13

 BODY:
For Liz Doyle, as for so many others, what even a week ago seemed a vague, unlikely possibility now seems only a horrifying step away.
"I went to a friend's birthday party today, and the very first thing we talked about was how it did not seem real until Secretary Baker said, 'regrettably,' and then you start seeing pictures of men and women on TV and you realize they might not come back," said Ms. Doyle, a 34-year-old who works in tourism marketing. 
 "Nothing seems to be more important now than the fact we're going to war, the economy, everything. It's a very helpless feeling."
The certitude that conflict is impending may not have been unanimous, but it was close.
In Atlanta, which likes to think of itself as a place on a winning streak exemplified by its successful bid for the 1996 summer Olympics, there is a widespread sense that the nation is poised at the edge of a fateful precipice with no clear idea of what lurks below.
"I pray about it, mostly for the troops there, the young people, and I've been praying more as it gets closer," said Mia Hawkins, a 25-year-old accountant, who was interviewed Saturday at Lenox Square, a huge mall in the affluent Buckhead section that comes as close as anything to being Atlanta's Main Street.
 
Talk of Biblical Prophecies
 On the surface the area's shop-till-you-drop ethic seems intact, but it is not hard to find the anxious undercurrents.
Shane Quarels, a 33-year-old director of advertising for an Atlanta firm, said she was planning to get two kittens from the humane society. That led a friend from Savannah to tell her that so many soldiers from Fort Stewart there had to give up their pets, residents had organized a campaign to adopt the pets until the soldiers return.
"Being in the Bible Belt, there's so much talk about the biblical prophecies that there will be a war in the Middle East that will be so horrendous it will be the end of the world," she said.
Most people raise fears that are less apocalyptic, but still worrisome.
Bob Hayslip, a 40-year-old office equipment salesman, is worried enough about the possibility of terrorism that he has advised his 18-year-old daughter to drive on her class trip to Miami in May rather than fly.
 
Learning From the Crisis
 Ms. Quarels's friend, 31-year-old Nichola Coe of Savannah, fears that the war will make the current recession more severe. And living in a military community, what she fears most is the toll a war would bring.
"I find myself thinking about it about 70 percent of the time," she said. "So many families have people over there. I think about what it's like now and can't help thinking what it will be like if some of them come back in body bags."
Along with the anxiety many people find a sense of clarity: the Gulf crisis is telling Americans things about themselves that they did not know.
A mental health counselor, who declined to give his name, said that along with its sobering aspects, the crisis had revealed something rather appealing about Americans.
"I'm struck by how reluctant the American people are to go to war," he said. "In that sense it's something of a blessing. It shows we're not as sadistic or malevolent a people as we sometimes think."
 
Concern About the Draft
 A group of young men discussing the war at the Five Paces Inn, a small hangout about a mile down Peachtree Street from Lenox Square, have their own reasons for worry.
"If it's a long war, more than six months, I figure they'll reinstate the draft," said 24-year-old Matt Jarinda.
But for him the crisis is also a reminder how quickly and frighteningly the world situation can change. "You have all those R.O.T.C. students who thought they were getting a free ride through college," he said. "No one in their wildest dreams ever thought they'd be over in Saudi Arabia."

"At least in Vietnam we were trying to stop the spread of Communism; here, there is no such high or noble cause," Mr. Herz said.

And it's nothing but poor people who have to fight it," said Claude Walton, a deacon at Chicago's First Baptist Congregational Church. (Jonathan Kirn for The New York Times); "I pray about it, mostly for the troops there, the young people, and I've been praying more as it gets closer," said Mia Hawkins of Atlanta. (Alan S.

HEADLINE: Capital Gains Relief

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A Dec. 25 editorial opposes capital gains tax relief. But "tax equality for all forms of income" is not the issue because capital gains or losses are not income. Investors' net capital gains are the result of risk taking over time to achieve a reward for increasing the value of private property. This has been the driving force of the United States economy since its founding. Capital gains should not be taxed at all because they are most often entrepreneurially achieved from wages and savings already taxed.

A White Liberal Finds Old Foes Are Now Allies

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Jan. 13

 BODY:
When President F. W. de Klerk asked Harry SchwarzHarry Schwarz to become South Africa's next ambassador to the United States, it was as if President Bush, in looking for a diplomatic troubleshooter to sell his policies abroad, had settled upon Senator Edward M. Kennedy.
Mr. Schwarz's opposition to the ruling National Party now led by Mr. de Klerk dates to the 1950's, when he helped found the Torch Commando, an organization of World War II veterans who took to the streets to demonstrate against the Government's move to disfranchise voters of mixed race. 
 Mr. Schwarz had served as a bomber navigator in the Royal Air Force and the South African Air Force in the Mediterranean theater during the war.
Since 1974, he has been a member of Parliament for the Progressive Federal Party and its successor, the Democratic Party, assailing the National Party for mismanaging the economy in its preoccupation with apartheid.
 
A Crucial Assignment
 But Mr. Schwarz, who is 66 years old, consented to leave Parliament and a prosperous Johannesburg law practice for Pretoria's most crucial diplomatic posting because, he said, what he has fought for is coming to pass. He arrives in Washington next month.
His decision illustrates the extent to which Mr. de Klerk's policies of change are supported by white liberals who hold no brief for the National Party. The Democratic Party pulled 21 percent of the white vote in the Parliamentary elections in September 1989, but has found it increasingly hard to define how it differs from President de Klerk.
An immigrant son of German Jews who emigrated to South Africa with the rise of Hitler, Mr. Schwarz has little in common with the Afrikaans-speaking establishment that dominates the National Party and the Government. But his reputation as an outsider without apartheid's baggage prompted President de Klerk to choose Mr. Schwarz to convince Americans that the changes underway are permanent.
As part of the arrangement, Mr. de Klerk agreed that the National Party would not try to win the parliamentary seat vacated by Mr. Schwarz in Yeoville, a Johannesburg suburb.
 
Views Are Unchanged
 "He hasn't asked me to change my political convictions," said Mr. Schwarz, speaking of Mr. de Klerk. "He knows that I'm implacably opposed to apartheid. Otherwise, there's no logic in asking me to do this job." Nor, Mr. Schwarz added, was he bound for Washington to represent South Africa's five million whites.
"I've made it clear that I want to be ambassador for 37 million people," Mr. Schwarz said during an interview at his law firm's spacious office in downtown Johannesburg.
"Even though 37 million haven't chosen me, I'm going to look after them."
In going to Washington, Mr. Schwarz said, he wants to tell Americans that they are responsible for seeing the dismantling of apartheid through to a democratic conclusion.
"Americans have, I think quite correctly, taken a moral stance against apartheid. They decided to translate this moral stance into action through sanctions," he said.
 
'A Moral Obligation'
 But once apartheid goes, Mr. Schwarz said, "Do you then walk away from the South African situation? I say you shouldn't, and morally you're not entitled to do it. I think you've got a moral obligation to see that the system that follows is quite consistent with American values, and that those values are political and economic."
South Africans deserve the same rights under a new constitution that Americans exercise under the United States Constitution, Mr. Schwarz said, including a separation of executive, legislative and judicial powers and a Supreme Court to enforce civil rights.
"I think the Americans are a little shy abut marketing that," he said.
And American concern, he said, should extend to economic assistance for reconstruction of a non-racial South Africa.
"I believe that freedom isn't complete when you are living in poverty and degradation," Mr. Schwarz said. If a post-apartheid economy stopped generating wealth, he said, inability to meet popular aspirations could tempt even a democratic government to resort to autocratic measures.
 
'Desire for Quick Fixes'
 "What concerns me is the desire for quick fixes. If you apply quick fixes in South Africa, it may take 15 to 25 years to overcome the price that has to be paid for a quick fix and I don't think we have time to make mistakes."
Like his former parliamentary comrade Helen Suzman, Mr. Schwarz takes a dim view of sanctions, which he says hurt the wrong people through joblessness and hunger. He believes that sanctions should be lifted now that Mr. de Klerk is moving to scrap apartheid.
"Once you accept the inevitability of the process, I think the need to suffer falls away," Mr. Schwarz said. It would be impossible, he said, to resegregate public facilities or close down black labor unions.
Mr. Schwarz's views open him to criticism from more radical opponents of apartheid, but his antipathy toward racism stems from childhood. A dozen years before the National Party came to power, Hendrick Verwoerd, who was later to become Prime Minister, led a campaign to bar Jewish refugees from South Africa. As a 12-year-old, Mr. Schwarz watched his grandfather and grandmother booed as they arrived on the last German ship in 1936.
 
'Grandparents Were Jeered'
 "I can't ever forget what happened at the dockside when people were protesting when my grandparents were coming off the boat," he said. It taught him, Mr. Schwarz said, that "if you're a racist in respect of one group of people, you're a racist -- full stop."
To argue his case, Mr. Schwarz must open Congressional doors on Capitol Hill that have been closed to South African envoys.
"I think I've got a fairly difficult job and I'm not the person that can convince people overnight," Mr. Schwarz said. "What I ask is that people be prepared to listen to me."
He recalled having lunch here in November with Joe Slovo, an African National Congress official who is also general secretary of the South African Communist Party. Mr. Schwarz earlier published an open letter to Mr. Slovo proposing that they debate the meaning of democracy.
"If I can sit down and have lunch with a leadership figure in the Communist Party, why should I not be able to do that with an American politician? " Mr. Schwarz said.

Church's Bane: Madonna and Other Temptations

BYLINE: By GABRIELLE GLASER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WARSAW, Jan. 14

 BODY:
Only a few sounds are audible at the main office of the seminary here: the swishing of cassocks as priests glide across the marble floor, and the chirping of swallows that inhabit the lush inner courtyards, thick with ferns and poinsettias.
For decades, the daily routine of priests here has borne little resemblance to the difficulties and uncertainties of life elsewhere in the country. Poland is one of five nations where the number of seminary students has steadily risen in the last decade. 
 Roman Catholic officials say the new democratic Poland, which many of them struggled to achieve, poses problems for the church. Many express concern that the growing influence of the West will help deter young men from the priesthood.
 
'A Great Test'
 "The coming years will be a great test for us," said the Rev. Jan Palyga, editor of a Catholic youth magazine here. "We predicted as our economic situation improves, the living standard will follow and the influence of the West will loom even larger than it does today."
Not so long ago in Poland things Western were pleasures only to be enjoyed in secret. Now, the records and videos of Madonna, whose illusions to Catholicism last year were criticized by the church as blasphemous, are best sellers, and sex shops and pornography are turning up in all the tiny villages.
While the West faces a chronic dearth of priests, the number in Poland rose to 24,678 in 1989, from 20,234 in 1980, the Polish episcopate office said. That leaves one priest for every 1,280 church members, compared with 1,650 church members per priest in the United States. Burundi, Ruwanda, Zaire and India are the only other countries to record an increase of priests in recent years, Vatican statistics show.
The number of women in Poland ordained as nuns has risen too. In 1980, there were 915; in 1989, the figure was 1,427, the episcopate office said.
Poland is one of the few countries that has priests in sufficient numbers to send abroad, and many go to Brazil and Central Africa. Until the mid-1980's, Poles had difficulty obtaining passports to travel outside the East bloc. But the priesthood afforded almost unrestricted travel.
 
Following Favorite Son
 Church officials list a number of reasons why young men are attracted to the priesthood. Most obvious in this nation where more than 90 percent of the population considers itself Roman Catholic is a desire to follow the path of the nation's favorite son, Pope John Paul II. His photograph can be seen above almost every shop door, on placards dangling from rearview mirrors and on tiny rectangular keychains.
"John Paul is beloved everywhere, but especially here," said the Rev. Szymon Stefanowicz, a priest at the Jasna Gora Monastery in Czestochowa. "Is it any wonder why young men want to be like him? He is such a good force in the world."
The priesthood is also prestigious in this country, and a son's enrollment in a seminary is as much a cause for celebration for Polish parents as an American child's acceptance into law or medical school.
Some say the reasons are more complex. Many cite the compulsion to answer the call of God, while others say the attraction is more practical.
 
Security and Freedom
 For the last 45 years, young Polish couples have been obliged to wait decades for apartments, telephones and cars, and until economic changes were introduced a year ago, hours for essentials like milk and eggs. The seminary, on the other hand, has offered secure housing, freedom for intellectual pursuit and the chance to travel outside the country.
"In the West, children are born with everything -- television, computers and cars," said Brother Marian Laskowski, a 24-year-old monk from Elblag in northern Poland who plans to become a priest. "In Poland, we are born with very little."
Brother Laskowski said he joined the seminary because he was drawn to God but acknowledged he sometimes challenged the wisdom of his decision.
"I see people coming in here wearing jeans, and I am spending the best years of my life behind these cold marble walls," Brother Laskowski, dressed in a heavy brown robe, said as he minded a stand selling icons at St. John's Cathedral in Warsaw.
 
Flourished Amid Repression
 Despite four and a half decades of Communist rule, Poland managed to move freely to the rhythms of the Catholic Church. Unlike the Soviet Union, where open worshipers faced persecution and the Orthodox Church was controlled by the authorities, the church in Poland withstood its period of repression and flourished independently, becoming a rival center of power to the Government.
Even during the martial-law period in the early 1980's, the pulpit was often a bastion of dissent. The Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, the outspoken critic of Communism who was killed by the secret police in 1984, is revered as a martyr across the country.
Last September, voluntary religious education classes returned to public schools after 34 years, a move largely prompted by the church. And while construction of religious buildings in many Catholic countries has all but halted in recent decades, new foundations are laid almost weekly for them in Poland. Almost 1,000 churches and other religious buildings have been built in Poland since 1985.
Father Stefanowicz said Poles paid more attention to the church than Catholics in the West because they regarded it as an extended family. "This feeling has disappeared from rich countries like France and America, where everyone has his own apartment," he said.
"In Poland, we have the Pope as our Holy Father, the Virgin as our Holy Mother, and the rest as brothers and sisters. The church was always something we could count on, and young men have always wanted to be a part of it. But now, no one can say what will happen."

HEADLINE: Careers;
Colleges Help Alumni Who Lose Jobs

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
UNIVERSITIES are facing a troubling question: How much help can and should they give their alumni who lose middle-management jobs?
The growing problem comes at a time of ever-tightening budgets, and yet the universities count on alumni heavily for financial support -- and that means deciding how to handle the situation is not easy. 
 "I don't use adjectives easily, and I don't have any numbers, but the increase in alumni contacting us for help has been dramatic," Thomas C. Devlin, director of Cornell University's career center, said last week.
At Purdue University, Dennis J. Weidenaar, dean of the Krannert School of Management, reports a sharp increase in the number of jobless alumni seeking help to find work. "It is running about double a year ago," he said.
Vicki Lynn, director of the career development center at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, said last week that there had been a 65 percent increase in late fall in the number of alumni seeking help, compared with the period a year ago. Graduates of Rensselaer mostly are engineers or scientists, many of whom had little trouble finding jobs when they left school in recent years.
Mr. Devlin said that undergraduates were so worried about the job market that increasing numbers were applying to professional schools. At the same time, he said, the alumni were not going to professional schools as often. "Their problem is primarily economic -- mortgages, children in school at a time they are out of work or expect to lose their jobs," he said, adding that "the uncertainty in the world" was another problem.
Mr. Devlin's center gives the jobless alumni the names of fellow alumni with high-stature jobs "who are receptive to phone calls."
Most alumni reaching his office have been about "three months out of work" and they are realistic about taking more time to find jobs, he said.
At Purdue's management school, the alumni are "looking for places to send their resumes." The career center is also hearing increasingly from alumni who want career counseling either by telephone or in person, Dr. Weidenaar said.
"I did a little research and we found an interesting breakdown," he said. "Two groups predominate: One group tends to be four years out of college and the other large group has been out 13 to 15 years," he said. They tend to be in three areas -- human resources, marketing and operations.
He said that some companies, like Eli Lilly, which is based in Indianapolis, are still recruiting as heavily on campus as in past years, but that the auto companies have cut recruiting. These might be two hints for job-seeking alumni, he said -- health-care companies might have openings, but auto companies are probably still laying workers off. These are the kinds of clues that career offices can provide.
Mrs. Lynn of Rensselaer explained that her career center regularly "publishes profiles of alumni backgrounds and sends them to 160 companies, like General Electric, Raytheon and Corning, to name a few.
"The alumni who contact me are not interested in the registry," she said. "They want counseling. They want to know where they went wrong, what strategies to use, and how to package themselves." They come back to campus for face-to-face interviews with her and her assistants.
"We start with the resume because many don't have a clue about that," Mrs Lynn said. "They prepare it as if it was an employment application. So we start from scratch. We charge $50 for counseling, up from $25 last year."
For the time spent, she said, the alumni would have to pay $1,000 to $2,000 at an outside counseling firm.
Ten years ago, she recalled, the career center consisted of her and an assistant. Today, it has a staff of 15. "Not all of them do counseling," she said, explaining that the center's role has increased in other ways.
On Jan. 26, Mrs. Lynn is holding an all-day crash course called "Careerathalon" to teach business etiquette, something she has long felt most prospective young managers needed. The need is evidently understood on campus. Although she expected only 100 to attend, 340 undergraduates have already signed up for it, along with about 50 faculty members.
"It's like a finishing school," she said.

The New Surge In Self-Employed

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
THE late 20th century has left quite a mark on the American labor force. The very image of the worker has switched from blue-collar factory hand to white-collar sales clerk. Women have become almost as visible as men at work. And now, it turns out, the self-employed are making a comeback -- mainly because so many women are choosing to work for themselves.
The big question is whether this new surge in self-employment, evident in Labor Department data since 1987, represents an improvement for those in their own businesses. Researchers do not know yet, but one bit of evidence is striking. Women on their own, whatever their skills, education or race, earn less per hour on average than women drawing wages. Self-employed men, in contrast, earn more than their job-holding male peers. 
 That nugget of information came to light in new research by Theresa J. Devine, a labor economist at Pennsylvania State University, who sifted through Labor Department data to pinpoint the self-employment trend. Her findings and other calculations show that self-employment, after increasing smartly in the 1970's, leveled off in the mid-1980's, and started to rise again in 1987.
"We were a nation of small shopkeepers and farmers in the 19th century and then people felt that to get ahead they had to take jobs in factories and big companies," said Rona Feit, senior fellow at the Corporation for Enterprise Development. "Now we're starting small businesses again."
Ms. Devine, Ms. Feit and other experts say they can only guess at the reasons why men and women, and particularly women, are going out on their own in growing numbers. Roughly 7 percent of all employed women are self-employed today, up from 5.9 percent in 1986, while for men the rise has been to about 12.5 percent, from 11.8 percent in 1986. In most cases, the new proprietors do most of the work themselves, hiring few people to help.
Why do they do it? The speculation covers a variety of reasons.
On the positive side, many women apparently start their own businesses so they can work at home or near it, on flexible schedules, while raising children. Or they try to achieve an independence not possible in a corporate job. Such conclusions are suggested in Ms. Devine's findings.
Three out of every four self-employed women, for example, are married and can risk self-employment because they have the security of health insurance from their husbands' jobs, Ms. Devine speculates. Many self-employed women are also college educated, which means they could probably get regular jobs but prefer the freedom and challenge of running their own enterprises.
Finally, self-employed women tend to work part time, perhaps to accommodate child-rearing, Ms.Devine says. In contrast, self-employed men usually work full time, investing more energy in their enterprises, which might help to explain why the women do not earn as much per hour on average as women who work for wages, while men do better than their male peers holding jobs.
On a more troubling note, self-employment spurted upward during the 1981-82 recession and is likely to do so in the current recession. The unemployed, unable to find new jobs, try to start their own businesses. "There is definitely a recession component in self-employment," said Richard Boden of the Small Business Administration.
Other special factors also drive the trend. Asian immigrants, for example, are well represented in the new wave of self-employed, Ms. Devine found. So are Hispanic people. Self-employment is clearly a way up for the nation's new wave of immigrants. But blacks are underrepresented as small proprietors, perhaps, economists say, because they have more difficulty than other groups in getting start-up loans and they run into more discrimination in trying to sell products or services.
Then there is the baby-boom factor: Millions of baby boomers competed for jobs just as companies cut back to be more competitive. The squeeze prompted thousands to try self-employment as an alternative, often by starting retail operations, says William Dunkelberg, chief economist at the National Federation of Independent Business.
The federation sponsors a long-term study of 13,000 small businesses formed in 1985. "Most of these start-ups were in retail -- boutiques, small food establishments and the like -- where entry was easy but the failure rate after three years has been high," Mr. Dunkelberg said.
Now that fewer young workers are entering the labor force, will self-employment continue to rise? During the current recession it will, economists say. And perhaps afterward as well, if immigration remains at a high level and women continue to view self-employment as a road to their goals.

HEADLINE: United Church of Christ Urges Fight Against Rising Racism

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14

 BODY:
The United Church of Christ has issued a pastoral letter warning that racism is a deepening problem in America.
More than three decades after the start of the civil rights movement, the letter said, poverty is worse for nonwhite Americans and racially motivated violence has increased. 
 It said that racist attitudes "permeate most of our institutions" and that racism underlies economic and social disparities between whites and nonwhites.
"As a result of racial discrimination," the letter said, "all over the United States there are 'quiet riots' in the form of unemployment, poverty, social disorganization, family disintegration, housing and school deterioration, and crime."
On Sunday, a day before the Federal holiday honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., church leaders will read the letter to more than 6,000 congregations of the United Church of Christ, a 1.7-million-member Protestant denomination.
 
'Sound a National Alarm'
 While the letter carries both theological and social meaning for church members, it is intended to draw wider attention to the issue of racism, said the Rev. Benjamin Chavis Jr., a veteran civil rights leader and a church official.
"We are trying to sound a national alarm," Mr. Chavis said in a recent interview. "We believe the leadership of our nation has focused so much on the world situation that we're losing sight of the domestic, the internal deterioration of our society. We should have made much more progress toward racial harmony."
The church is urging its followers to recognize racism as a sin and to become active in the political process on behalf of equality.
The pastoral letter is only the third in the history of the United Church of Christ, said Mr. Chavis, who is executive director of the church's Commission for Racial Justice.
The letter expressed alarmed at the increasing frequency of violent acts against members of minority groups. The violence cannot be dismissed as isolated acts of fringe groups and extremists, it said.
The attacks are "visible consequences of racist attitudes" throughout society, the letter said, and reflect a growing climate of racial intolerance and hostility.
An accompanying background paper cited Federal statistics showing increasing inequities in living standards for whites and nonwhites.
 
'Virtually No Progress'
 A small percentage of nonwhite Americans made some socioeconomic gains in the 1970's and 1980's, the church said, but the quality of life for most Americans of racial minority is worse today than it was in the 1960's.
"Virtually no progress toward social and economic equality for African Americans has been made since the early 1970's," it said. In addition, racism is a daily problem for Hispanic Americans, Indians, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, the letter said.
Citing President Bush's veto of a civil rights bill last year, Mr. Chavis said the Federal Government "has become the obstacle" to racial justice.
Unless there was a change, Mr. Chavis said, he feared that American society "could explode from within" in ways worse than the urban riots of the 1960's.

HEADLINE: Funds Shift By Taiwan

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan, Jan. 14

 BODY:
Taiwan, which controls one of the world's largest foreign exchange reserves, has pulled tens of billions of dollars out of United States commercial banks, which it fears could fail in an economic recession prolonged by a Persian Gulf war.
Officials of Taiwan's central bank said today that Taiwan had moved most of its United States dollar holdings to the Federal Reserve and to banks in Europe, Japan and Australia.
The officials said that about $35 billion -- 58 percent of the county's currency reserves -- had been moved out of United States commercial banks since late 1990.
They said about $20 billion had been placed in the Federal Reserve, with the rest going to European, Japanese and Australian banks. A smaller amount was also deposited in overseas branches of Taiwanese banks, they said.
"The shift is mainly to protect our reserves as we face more risks by depositing our money in U.S. banks," a senior bank official told reporters.
Taiwan's booming economy, built on exports to the United States, has generated foreign exchange reserves of about $73 billion, competing with Japan's as the largest in the world.

HEADLINE: Nicaragua Sinks Further as Chamorro's Magic Fails

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Despite expectations of a quick economic turnaround after the inauguration of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro last April, the Nicaraguan economy has not recovered and is now deteriorating amid large deficits and continued high military spending, economists and diplomats say.
The flood of new private investment that Mrs. Chamorro's election was predicted to release has been reduced to a trickle by investors' fears of new civil unrest. Foreign aid has been held up by concerns about Government disarray and free spending that has forced Mrs. Chamorro to draw down the country's scarce reserves by roughly $50 million in the last two months alone. 
 In Managua, traffic has become sprinkled with the shiny vehicles of visiting exiles weighing whether to return. But there has been little new long-term investment to help reverse a decade of economic decline.
On the rutted streets of the capital, beggars have begun to go door to door in search of handouts, and currency changers wave thick stacks of local bills that lose up to half their value each month due to five-digit inflation.
"A worker, a carpenter, a tailor can't even afford a pound of meat a week for his family," said Alfredo Vega Mendoza, a 50-year-old clothing salesman, carrying a small bag of rice and other purchases from a Managua market. "There hasn't been any kind of change -- that's all a lie."
 
High Cost of Concessions
 Mrs. Chamorro's aides staked the economy's future on her ability to win commitments of aid from the international community, and credits from international institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which American sanctions effectively made unavailable to Nicaragua under the Sandinistas.
But the arrival of a mission from the I.M.F., World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank this month is also certain to focus hard international scrutiny on the admitted disarray of the Chamorro Government's economic policies. And it is expected to highlight the high economic cost that the Government has paid for its policy of cushioning its transition to power with salary concessions and slow reductions in Nicaragua's armed forces.
"The concern is that the policies will not measure up, and instead of opening the door to new credit, the visit will only make things harder by confirming the worst impression that donor countries have about this Government," said a European diplomat whose country has been approached for aid.
The Government's economic problems have weakened the effect of the outside aid that is already coming in, including $300 million in emergency American aid approved last year, and they have effectively delayed other major foreign commitments.
Part of the American aid is the key to benchmarks of economic progress the Government has been unable to meet. Other important donors, like Japan, which has tentatively committed large amounts of aid, have dragged their feet, waiting for signs that the Government can make effective use of the money.
 
Production Shrinks
 Once expected to hold steady or even increase by the end of 1990, the economy's overall production shrank by as much as 5 percent -- even more than the relative loss suffered in the final year of Sandinista rule -- and is continuing to fall, Government analysts say.
The deteriorating production has been accompanied by a resurgence of the hyperinflation that stripped the value of local currency for several years in a row. The Nicaraguan cordoba, which was reissued in February 1988 by the Sandinista Government at an exchange rate of 10 to the American dollar, now trades at roughly 3.2 million to the dollar. The Government's plan to introduce a new dollar equivalent currency, the gold cordoba, has been frozen by a lack of reserves to back it.
Diplomats and independent economists here attribute much of the economy's trouble to the Government's inability to control social and military spending.
Under a plan developed by Francisco Mayorga Balladares, a Yale-educated economist and key member of Mrs. Chamorro's campaign circle, the Government's monthly deficit fell from more than $30 million in the month after the President's inauguration to roughly $8 million in September. Mr. Mayorga also succeeded in obtaining large foreign aid commitments at a June conference of potential aid donors in Rome.
 
Tight Restraint Abandoned
 But after worsening clashes with Mrs. Chamorro's family advisers, Mr. Mayorga was forced to resign in October. And the tight budgetary restraint he imposed was gradually abandoned, first in generous settlements of nationwide Sandinista strikes in May and July, and later in broader employment and salary concessions that formed part of a national pact signed with unions and business leaders on Oct. 26.
As part of its policy of avoiding confrontation with the Sandinista-dominated military, the Government has also made a series of secret payments to the army that have amounted to as much as several million dollars a month above its formal budget, said diplomats and Government officials who have witnessed the payments.
Signs of economic crisis have grown more urgent. The Government's monthly deficit has risen to at least $35 million, and inflation has surged again to roughly 50 percent a month.
Early in December, Mrs. Chamorro's son-in-law and chief strategist, Antonio Lacayo Oyanguren, led the Nicaraguan delegation to another donor's conference in Paris. But the delegation came away empty-handed after presenting a report that aid officials said made little attempt to justify the Government's deepening deficit.
"The Rome document found acceptance among almost everyone; the Paris document found acceptance among almost no one," said another independent foreign expert. "The difference between was politics."

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Group Told Recession May Be Short

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
Two economists told the annual convention of the National Retail Federation in New York yesterday that the recession would be of relatively short duration and would be followed by a gradual improvement as the year progressed. But both speakers took pains to hedge their forecasts.
"I expect the economy to experience only a mild contraction so that consumer spending should not be severely impacted," Rosalind Wells, chief economist for the federation, the nation's largest retail trade association, told an audience of more than 600 at the New York Hilton Hotel. 
 Ms. Wells forecast that real spending would increase one-quarter percent this year, compared with 1 percent last year. But she added: "Once again, durables will be hardest hit, falling 3 1/2 percent. Nondurables will decline 1/2 percent, while services will expand by 2 percent." Durable goods -- merchandise like refrigerators and furniture and electronics items, expected to last more than three years -- rose a weak 3 percent in 1990.
W. Lee Hoskins, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, told the retailers: "At the moment, the data we are seeing are consistent with the idea that the decline will be brief and, indeed, may be largely behind us." He added that the buildup in business inventories had been slight compared with previous recessions. And, he said, "Capital goods and export markets may continue to provide the economy with a much-needed lift."
But Mr. Hoskins also described the current business activity decline as "serious." He said that while much of the recent softness had been centered in the coastal states and was predominantly in the construction, automotive and retail industries, "we cannot dismiss the possibility that weakness will become more pervasive." He added, "As is always the case, it is impossible to foretell with precision either when the decline will end or what shape the ensuing recovery will be."
The retail group's 80th annual convention, which includes a trade exhibit on management information systems, anti-theft devices and warehouse equipment at the Sheraton Centre down the street from the Hilton , opened Sunday for a four-day run. The retail industry is in considerable turmoil because of erratic sales, widespread consolidations and a continued concern about the Mideast crisis and its impact on consumer spending.
 
Unpredictable Retail Sales
 Since August, when Iraq invaded Kuwait, retail sales have become even more unpredictable than they were throughout an already difficult year. But in speeches and hallway interviews, retailers said they thought a peaceful resolution of the Mideast confrontation could bring a groundswell of consumer confidence that could invigorate retail sales.
Yet the recent disappointing Christmas season was not forgotten as a noon-hour speaker at the Sheraton looked around at an audience of 500 and remarked, "I didn't see this many people in our stores during the entire month of December."
Forecasting 1991 results for general merchandise, apparel and home furnishings, Ms. Wells said that she expected the retail category to increase 3 3/4 percent, or 1 1/2 percent after inflation, against a 3 1/2 percent rise, or 1 percent after inflation, in 1990.
In more specific terms, she said apparel sales should be up 5 percent during the year, with women's wear again outpacing men's and children's apparel. "The pattern of weaker durables and better growth in more decorative, less expensive home merchandise is likely to continue this year since housing is not expected to experience a strong demand," she said.
But Ms. Wells added: "In spite of the modest overall numbers, this year's quarterly general merchandise sales pattern will be much more favorable for retailers than 1990. But my outlook for the first half of the year remains subdued. I think stores will continue to struggle for sales gains." If the economy picks up in the second half, however, she said that 1991 Christmas business could jump 6 to 7 percent above last year's.

HEADLINE: Mitchell and Dole Set Senate Legislative Agendas

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14

 BODY:
Emerging briefly from the shadow of the Persian Gulf crisis, the Senate Democratic and Republican leaders introduced bills today setting out their legislative priorities for the 102d Congress.
"As important as the gulf crisis is, we cannot turn our backs on the other business of this nation," said George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Senate Democratic leader. "We are elected to put our own house in order, not only to seek a new world order." 
 The one area where Mr. Mitchell and Bob Dole, the Senate Republican leader, both introduced measures was on revamping the financing of Congressional campaigns. While the proposals differ sharply, their introduction reflects a new urgency on the issue as the Senate Ethics Committee prepares for deliberations over the conduct of five Senators accused of doing favors for a major donor.
Although the five bills introduced by each leader dealt primarily with domestic matters, they also included measures related to the military presence in the gulf. In a gesture to veterans, Mr. Mitchell designated as Senate Bill No. 1 a proposal to provide cost-of-living increases to disabled veterans and survivors of veterans.
 
Strong Nod for the Veteran
 Noting that Federal retirees, Social Security recipients and others collecting Federal benefits got cost-of-living increases last year, Mr. Mitchell said, "The least we can do for those now standing ready to serve is to show promptly that their nation will honor its commitments for that service."
In a similar gesture, Mr. Dole proposed a bill to give the Internal Revenue Service authority to extend tax filing deadlines to those in the military deployed in the gulf.
Mr. Mitchell's introduction of specific domestic proposals was a marked contrast to when he first took over as majority leader at the opening session two years ago and was criticized for not laying out his major objectives for the session. Instead, he spoke in broad terms about establishing a "new social contract" between the Government and the people.
The second bill he introduced today was to establish a council that would issue an annual progress report on national education goals. The intention, he said, was "a bill that makes our progress measurable" in addressing issues like illiteracy and teacher training.
Another bill is intended to ease the overburdened foster care and child welfare services. Among other provisions, it would insure that every child under 6 years of age could stay on Medicaid for six months after becoming eligible.
 
Medical Leave Measure
 Mr. Mitchell also introduced a bill that was vetoed last year by President Bush: it would provide unpaid family and medical leave for working people for reasons like a baby's birth or the illness of a child or parent.
The Senate did not follow the House in immediately reintroducing the civil rights bill that Mr. Bush vetoed last year. But Mr. Mitchell said such a measure was "the most significant" of the legislation that was not officially proposed today.
Other priorities, Mr. Mitchell said, would include measures to conserve energy, repair the nation's roads and bridges, overhaul the bank insurance deposit system and ease a recession.
Measures introduced by Mr. Dole included a proposal that the United States give direct aid to democratically elected governments that have a Communist-ruling majority. Another bill would replace a governmental system that limits older worker's Social Security earnings.
Both the Senate and House passed campaign finance measures last year, but the legislation never made it to conference committee, with both chambers divided over key provisions.
 
Campaign Reform Pressed
 The measure introduced today by Mr. Mitchell is virtually identical to the one the Senate passed last year. Among other things, campaigns that limit their overall spending would get vouchers for discounts in buying broadcast time for television commercials. The bill would also ban political action committees from donating to candidates for Federal office.
The bill does not go as far as calling for public financing of Congressional campaigns as a way to limit spending, but Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said he planned to introduce such a measure again.
Mr. Dole's bill would also ban political action committee contributions, but does not call for limiting overall spending.
Taking aim at the five Senators in the "Keating Five" case -- four of whom are Democrats -- Mr. Dole also proposed requiring the "public disclosure of all Congressional contacts with Federal agencies concerning enforcement matters." He added that lawmakers should be comfortable about reading about their intervention on the front page of the newspaper.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Sharp Gyrations Mark Trading

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Talk of war and peace in the Middle East led to sharp gyrations in the credit markets yesterday, but by late in the session prices of Treasury securities were little changed.
Most activity was in the short-term Treasury bill market. Demand at the weekly auction of three-month bills was so high that the average discount rate fell to its lowest level in three years. 
 The failure of Javier Perez de Cuellar, the Secretary General of the United Nations, to advance negotiations for a peaceful Iraqi withdrawl from Kuwait during his weekend mission to Baghdad pushed prices of notes and bonds down sharply during overnight trading, and the lower prices held most of the day.
 
Price Declines Evaporate
 But the price declines evaporated rapidly after Cable News Network reported at 3:15 P.M. yesterday that Iraq was willing to withdraw from Kuwait but was not willing to do so under the dictates of a deadline.
Fifteen minutes later, Bernard Shaw, CNN's reporter in Baghdad, quoting an unnamed Iraqi official, re-emphasized that in Iraq's view the central problem with pulling the troops out of Kuwait was the idea of dealing with a deadline.
The report and subsequent statement did not seem to represent any real change in Iraq's position. But the initial report had the effect of persuading nervous market participants to buy back securities they had sold earlier.
"Until the market knows whether or not we are going to war and how the war itself is likely to go, wild swings based on whatever rumor is swirling around will be the standard," said Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon National Bank in Pittsburgh. "All of this on top of a very shaky economy is a very vicious brew."
Befitting an extremely nervous, uncertain market, the volatile price movements came on very thin trading.
Because of the gulf crisis, "most participants have not wanted to do anything at all since the start of the year," said Maria Fiorini Ramirez, president of Ramirez Capital Consultants Inc. "It just doesn't pay to be involved."
 
Focus on Short Term
 Investors who were willing to do some buying were focusing on securities with maturities of a year or less, like short-term Treasury bills.
Buying in the secondary market for Treasury bills and at the weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills was strong throughout the session.
"The only place we are seeing any liquidity is in bills," said Steven A. Wood, director of financial markets research at the Bank of America. "At this point, taking a position any further out the maturity spectrum is a gamble that is not worth taking. It's a little like going swimming in the ocean when there is a major hurricane watch out."
At the weekly auction, the only sale of new Treasury securities scheduled to be held this week, three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 6.12 percent, down sharply from the 6.52 percent average rate at last week's sale. It is the lowest rate on a three-month bill since April 1988.
Meanwhile, six-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 6.21 percent, compared with an average rate of 6.51 percent a week ago.
Noncompetitive bids at the auctions, a good proxy of demand from individual investors, set records for both the three-month and six-month bills. More than $2 billion worth of noncompetitive bids were submitted for the three-month bills. Noncompetitive bids for the six-month bills totaled $1.5 billion.
 
Benchmark Issue Unchanged
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 104 1/4 late yesterday, to yield 8.35 percent, unchanged on the day. Before the CNN report, the benchmark issue had fallen by about 3/4 point.
Among note issues, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 102 6/ 32, down 2/32, to yield 8.16 percent. And the 7 1/2 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 7/32, down 1/32, to yield 7.12 percent.
The CNN report erased much of what had earlier been a big drop in interest rates on Treasury bills outstanding.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 6.11 percent, down four basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell one basis point, to a late offered rate of 6.20 percent.
Despite volatile market conditions, the Florida Turnpike Authority offered $333 million of securities in the tax-exempt municipal bond market.
 
Insured by Ambac
 The issue, which consists of serial and term bonds, is fully insured by the Ambac Indemnity Corporation.
Maturities on the serial bonds range from 1995 through 2007, with yields from 6 percent in 1995 to 7.15 percent in 2007.
The term bonds were offered with a maximum yield of 7.28 percent on securities maturing in 2018.
Prudential-Bache Securities acted as lead manager for the negotiated offering. The issue is rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Participants in the secondary market for municipal bonds said prices of most widely quoted issues dipped by about 1/4 point in very light trading.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said that prices of most issues rose by about 1/8 point.
No new corporate issues were priced yesterday.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF: PUBLIC OPINION;
Americans Don't Expect Short War

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
A majority of Americans say they are satisfied that President Bush has done everything he should to prevent war in the Persian Gulf. But the country remains deeply divided over whether fighting Iraq is the right policy, and most people do not expect the short war with relatively low casualties that Mr. Bush and his officials have talked about, the latest New York Times/CBS News poll shows.
While the poll suggests that Mr. Bush has been able to maintain public approval for his handling of the crisis, with 58 percent saying they approve and 33 percent saying they disapprove, it also shows where his political vulnerabilities may lie. And it provides the most detailed view to date of Americans' gloomy expectations about what a war in the gulf would be like. 
 Most of the 1,512 people who were questioned from Friday through Sunday said they expected the war to last several months to more than a year, to require heavy combat on the ground, produce thousands of American deaths and make a major attack by Iraqi agents within the United States likely.
 
Fear of Another Vietnam
 In the end, the greatest political threat to Mr. Bush could come from precisely what he has tried to counter in his public statements: the fear of many Americans, as expressed in follow-up interviews conducted after the survey was completed, that war in the gulf could bring about a repetition of the United States' bitter experience in Vietnam.
"Basically, I guess we're hoping that it's not a Vietnam, not going in nudging and pushing, but going full force and getting it over with minimal loss of lives," said Drew A. Collins, an Ohio banker.
Even among those who say Mr. Bush should give economic sanction more time, four out of ten said they would consider a short war with low casualties worth fighting. But at the same time, the poll showed that nearly half of those who said Mr. Bush should act now expressed the view that the price for getting Iraq out of Kuwait would not be worth paying if a war dragged on with heavy casualties.
The nationwide telephone survey, which carried a possible sampling error of three percentage points one way or the other, was conducted after the failure of the Iraqi-American talks in Geneva last Wednesday and while Congress debated and then voted for a resolution authorizing Mr. Bush to use force in the gulf.
 
Fight Now or Wait?
 A solid majority, 66 percent, said they expected that the country would end up in a war, an increase of nine percentage points from a poll conducted a week earlier. But they were evenly split on whether Mr. Bush should immediately begin hostilities or wait to give economic sanctions more time.
The follow-up interviews suggested that some of those who called for action soon were expressing a desire to get it over with rather than registering enthusiastic support for Mr. Bush's position.
"We should be real sure we're going to get this thing done or not do it at all," said Robert T. Grindle, a 58-year-old Korean War veteran from Blue Hill, Me. "Bush opened his mouth and we have to back him up. We appointed him President and have to back him but Bush -- he said too much, got himself in trouble."
 
Majorities for Conflicting Views
 Fifty-five percent of Americans said Mr. Bush had done "everything he should to avoid war." But 59 percent continued to say that Mr. Bush should seek a meeting with President Saddam Hussein before midnight tonight, the United Nations deadline for Iraq to leave Kuwait or face the use of force.
Although Mr. Bush has said he rules out any negotiation or compromise with Iraq, a majority of Americans -- 56 percent -- said it would be acceptable for the United States to first agree to an international conference on Arab-Israeli problems if Iraq would then withdraw from Kuwait. Forty-seven percent said it would be acceptable to them if the ousted leadership of Kuwait offered to trade a piece of the country's territory in return for Iraq's withdrawal from most of Kuwait.
Although the Bush Administration has devoted much attention in recent weeks to its attempts to explain the reasons for sending troops to Saudi Arabia, Americans remained divided on why those forces are there.
 
Oil or Morality?
 Forty-two percent said it was mainly to stop Iraq from attacking its neighbors, 29 percent said it was mainly to protect oil supplies, and 11 percent said it was mainly to restore the leadership of Kuwait.
But when it came to deciding whether those reasons were "good enough to go to war," the poll showed an even split overall. Only among those who said American troops were sent to stop attacks by Iraq did a majority say that was a good enough reason for a war.
The groups most polarized by the gulf crisis were blacks and whites and men and women. By margins of 15 percentage points or more, blacks and women were more opposed to early action, more disapproving of Mr. Bush and his handling of the gulf crisis, and more inclined to say that a war of any duration was not worth fighting.

Gold Closes Day at $400.10, Highest in Over 3 Months

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Precious metal prices surged yesterday on fears that war in the Persian Gulf is becoming inevitable as the deadline for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait approaches.
Gold closed at its highest level in more than three months. In New York, gold's contract for immediate delivery broke $400 a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange, increasing $8.50 a troy ounce to close at $400.10, in reaction to the failure by the United Nations Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, to secure a peaceful solution to the crisis. 
 The last time the immediate contract for gold surpassed $400 was on Oct. 8.
Analysts said the failure of Mr. Perez de Cuellar to secure peace before the Jan. 15 deadline helped support gold prices in early trading.
Once gold futures reached their highs, prices fluctuated in a narrow range, responding to the strength in the crude oil market, said Bette Raptopoulos, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. Crude oil rose $3.49 a barrel, to $30.78.
Silver futures traded higher in league with gold, Ms. Raptopoulos said. But platinum prices were lower on belief a war would result in reduced demand for the metal, used in auto catalytic converters.
Gold settled $8.80 to $8.50 higher, with the active contract for delivery in February up $8.30, to $401.60 a troy ounce. Silver was 9.2 cents to 8.2 cents higher, with March at $4.230 a troy ounce. And platinum was 90 cents lower, with January at $417.70 a troy ounce.
On other markets, grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The market received some strength from beliefs that in the short term, prices would receive help from a conflict in the Persian Gulf, said Dan Cekander, an analyst with Rodman & Renshaw Inc.
Mr. Cekander said, however, that increased oil prices caused by a war would result in a recession if the war was a long one. That would cause reduced demand for grains, he said.
Soybean futures were weaker following Friday's United States Agriculture Department crop report that forecast stocks larger than traders had expected.
Wheat futures were also under pressure from the Agriculture Department report, which placed winter wheat seedings at 51.018 million acres.
Corn futures were higher because the report showed strong feed use.
Wheat was 3 3/4 cents to 5 cents lower, with March at $2.48 3/4 a bushel; corn was 1 1/4 cent to 3 1/4 cents higher, with March at $2.33 1/2 a bushel; oats were 1/4 cent to 3/4 cent higher, with March at $1.11 1/4 a bushel; soybeans were 2 1/2 cents to 4 3/4 cents lower, with January at $5.51 1/4 a bushel.
Frozen concentrated orange juice futures soared on New York's Cotton Exchange in reaction to the unexpectedly low 1990-91 orange crop estimate.
The Agriculture Department revised downward its forecast for the California crop from 63 million boxes to 25 million. The reduction was a result of a severe freeze in the state in December.
The department also reduced its forecast for the Florida crop from 165 million boxes to 151 million. The Agriculture Department also reduced the overall yield estimates.

UAL's Unions Prepared To Renew Buyout Effort

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 14

 BODY:
United Airlines' union workers are ready to renew their efforts to buy the company once the economy improves, the head of the pilots union said. "The union employees at United are fully prepared and economically capable of maintaining their role as major players in any acquisition efforts at our company," Frederick C. Dubinsky, chairman of the United chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association, said.
Mr. Dubinsky and the union organized last year's employee bid to buy United's parent, the UAL Corporation, for $4.4 billion. The attempt failed for lack of financing after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait sent financial markets reeling. Mr. Dubinksy told a meeting of O'Hare International Airport employees and business workers that "the possibility of employee ownership, at least at United, should not be regarded as permanently over."

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF: THE KUWAITIS;
Kuwaiti Threatens Attack on Iraqi Civilian Targets

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Jan. 14

 BODY:
The Crown Prince of Kuwait says the multinational coalition against Iraq would strike deep inside the country at civilian as well as military targets if Iraq bombed Kuwait City after allied forces retake it.
"If he bombs Kuwait, we'll do the same to Iraqi cities," Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, Kuwait's Crown Prince and Prime Minister, warned in an interview in Jidda on Sunday. 
 The Crown Prince refused to say who would strike nonmilitary targets in Iraq, though the Kuwaiti Air Force, most of which escaped the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion, is capable of such attacks. He also declined to say whether Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d had sanctioned such strikes when he met in Taif, Saudi Arabia, on Friday with the Emir of Kuwait and other senior officials of the Kuwaiti Government-in-exile, including the Crown Prince.
The Crown Prince confirmed that Kuwait had agreed to increase payments for the support of American forces in the region, though he declined to say by how much. Other Kuwaiti officials said they had already pledged about $2.5 billion for the American military deployment here and had provided about $4 billion to Arab allies.
 
Sanctions Said to Fail
 Based on reports from Iraq to the Kuwaiti Government-in-exile, he said he had concluded that sanctions had failed and would continue to fail to force Iraq out of Kuwait. "He has gotten what he needs, perhaps not in the quantities he wants, but enough," Sheik Saad asserted. "What we know is that sanctions have not forced him out in five months, and that they will not work six months from now."
He spoke in a private room inside the Conference Palace, a Saudi Government conference center in Jidda where the Kuwaiti Government-in-exile has been holding meetings with Islamic delegations and with Kuwaiti opposition groups.
Kuwaiti officials met throughout the day Sunday with a members of a committee established in October to monitor a commitment by the Emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, to open the Government to greater participation when the country is liberated. Several members of the committee described the discussions as "frank and very loud at times." One participant said that the ruling Sabah family was still resisting demands from some committee members that a new and more representative government be created when Kuwaitis return to their country.
The Crown Prince reiterated the Emir's commitment to carry out Kuwait's Constitution, which calls for a Parliament, free elections and a free press. But he refused to discuss specific demands by reformist groups or to go beyond the rather vague commitment to change the Government once Kuwait is liberated.
 
Sabah Dominance Doubted
 But other Government officials said most Kuwaitis agreed that a decline in the Sabahs' dominance of key posts was inevitable. "Given what's happened and the sentiment of those who have remained in Kuwait, we cannot return to the status quo ante," said Sulaiman al-Mutawa, Minister of Planning and one of the few Cabinet members who is not a member of the Sabah family.
"We're insisting on a real Kuwaiti partnership," said Abdulaziz al-Sagr, the head of Kuwait's Chamber of Commerce. "We're all in the same boat now."
The Crown Prince rejected suggestions that Iraq and Kuwait should sit down together after an Iraqi withdrawal and settle outstanding territorial and economic differences, as several Arab leaders and the United Nations Security Council have recommended. "We sat down with them before August 2d," he said. "It did not work, and we won't do it again. If they still have grievances, they can be discussed before the Arab League."
When asked how the Arab League could mediate anything since it had been shattered by the Persian Gulf crisis, the Crown Prince simply smiled and said, "Yes, it's very sad."

HEADLINE: DINKINS ABANDONS PROPOSAL TO CLOSE 41 FIRE COMPANIES

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
After intense pressure from the public and the city's firefighter unions, Mayor David N. Dinkins said yesterday that he had abandoned the idea of closing 41 more fire companies across New York City.
But at the same time, city officials raised the specter of deep school cuts by announcing that the city was going ahead with plans to cut $429 million, or more than 6 percent, from the total school budget next year. 
 The changes are part of hundreds of individual decisions, from raising taxes to cutting as many as 20,000 jobs, that have been reached as Mayor Dinkins prepared a financial plan showing how he would close a $2.1 billion budget gap in the fiscal year beginning July 1. The plan, to be released tomorrow, is the first step in the budget process and is likely to be altered to deal with changing economic conditions and various political pressures.
 
Relief From Cuomo?
 City officials who attended budget briefings said that despite some painful reductions the need for extreme cuts in the Fire Department and other basic city services has been reduced by decisions to raise taxes by up to $600 million and to use often criticized one-time savings from bond refinancings.
The plan included political wrinkles, intended in part to prod Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the State Legislature to provide budget relief for the city, despite the state's own looming budget gap. This included, the officials said, the implicit threat of the layoffs of thousands of teachers next fall if the state did not increase state aid.
The announcement of the school cuts came as the Board of Education and the teachers' union yesterday closed in on an agreement to defer several days' wages into the future as a means of averting thousands of layoffs Feb. 1, but yesterday they were still apart on precisely how many paydays to put off.
 
3 Fire Companies Closed
 The Fire Department was slated for a $57 million cut next year, a cut that the department argued would require the closing of 41 fire companies, in addition to three companies already closed. Each closing would save a little more than $1 million.
But after the fire company closings touched off community demonstrations -- and after firefighter unions blamed the closing for the death of two men in a fire in Richmond Hill, Queens, only blocks from one of the closed companies, Engine 294 -- the administration backed off from closing further fire companies, apparently concluding the small savings was not worth the political or social cost.
It did this even though some fiscal analysts have long argued that the Fire Department was too large and unwieldy -- with too many fire companies in some neighborhoods and not enough in others -- especially since the number of fires had fallen sharply since the 1970's.
"The Mayor made the judgment that this is the level of pain that he would be willing to deal with," one top Dinkins aide said. "If conditions worsen in the future, there could be more pain."
By last night, city officials said they had identified only $6 million in cuts in the Fire Department, as opposed to the $57 million in cuts originally sought.
 
'If I May Be Heard'
 The emotion created by the fire company issue was evident again last night in Springfield Gardens, Queens, at the first town meeting of the Dinkins administration. Many in the crowd of at least 1,000 people yelled, "No fire cuts, no fire cuts." The chant became so loud that at one point, the Mayor said; "If I may be heard, you may hear something you like. There will be no further closings." He said the closing of Engine 294 should not be blamed for the two deaths.
The Mayor's remarks drew huge applause. even though he added, "I cannot say what will happen in the future, if the state hits us with huge budget cuts."
The cuts, outlined in briefings in the last few days, will include the following:
*The elimination of the "clean team," 300 sanitation workers who pushed brooms to clean up business districts, and a delay in the expansion of the city's current recycling program. Nearly 1,000 sanitation jobs would be cut, including up to 260 or so through layoffs.
*The elimination of the city's "Giant Step program," which provided intensive pre-kindergarten classes for 3,300 youngsters. The officials said the city would try to get more money for Federal Head Start slots to replace the program. Closing Giant Step, a showcase of the Koch administration, will save $10 million, the officials said.
*Deep cuts in the Parks Department, including a delay in the opening of pools and lifeguard protection at beaches, both until July 4. The petting zoo section of the Central Park Zoo would be closed to save $140,000 over the next 18 months. In all 350 jobs would be cut, 200 through layoffs.
*The replacement of 6,000 burned-out street lights would be delayed; many traffic agents would write tickets rather than direct traffic; parking meters charges would rise, and the Staten Island Ferry would be raised from 50 cents to $1, under the plan.
*A delay in the expansion of the bridge maintenance program.
The plan called for up to $600 million in tax increases, including $300 million in property-tax increases -- or $60 a year -- with the balance made up through an increase in the personal income tax rate.
Carol O'Cleireacain, the city's finance commissioner, said that when combined with other increases and changes in property-tax rules -- including a pending $25 increase to pay for Mr. Dinkins's pending anti-crime package, taxes would go up $263 a year for the typical homeowner.
City officials said the nature of the cuts was similiar to recent reductions in many private companies, focusing on middle-level managers at the headquarters of city agencies in order to reduce cuts in the field.
It was clear that the administration was able to spare some agencies the worst of the pain.
The city's Human Resources Administration, for example, was required to make $88 million in cuts in the next fiscal year, but was spared $40 million of that, when the agency argued it could obtain increased Federal aid. Of $72 million in cuts at the city's Health and Hospital Corporation, $42 million was to be offset by revenue increases produced by the hospitals from patients and insurers.
Given Mr. Dinkins's decision to spare some agencies the worst of the cuts, some city officials were startled at the huge cuts sought from the Board of Education, which, under the city's worst case scenario, would mean eliminating more than 7,000 jobs in the next year.
But City Hall aides said that the $429 million cut represented a fair measure of political bluster, as part of a campaign to wrench as much school aid as possible from the State Legislature.
School officials had been bracing for a $245 million cut, a figure that assumed a $184 million increase in state aid, mainly an increase to cover the cost of inflation. But late last week, city officials decided to take it out of the budget, because of the state's uncertain fiscal situation, and then raised the amount of the cuts.
Stanley Litow, deputy chancellor for operations, called the higher level of cuts "distressing," but he said that he expected the Legislature to increase education aid because of political pressure from school districts around the state.
The financial plan to be released tomorrow will outline how the city expects to close a $500 million gap in the current fiscal year, which ends June 30, as well as the $2.1 billion in the next fiscal year.
The teacher negotiations, which took place at City Hall and the midtown headquarters of the United Federation of Teachers, mean that an initial plan for a payless furlough that would shut school for three days in February has been given a secondary status for now.

HEADLINE: Tax Value Off For Property In New York

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
In a report that provides the first government confirmation that New York City's real-estate market has tumbled sharply, the City Finance Department estimated yesterday that the taxable value of all property in the city fell by 7 percent in the last year.
The decline -- the first in a decade -- reflected market forces that real-estate professionals have noted for many months. The economic retrenchment, combined with the building boom of the 1980's, has produced widespread vacancies in office buildings, a steep drop in the price of apartments and houses and even a reduction of apartment rents in many neighborhoods.
 
Based on Assessors' Estimates
 The Finance Department, in releasing its annual assessment report, tentatively set the taxable value of all property at $85 billion, compared with $91.5 billion last year. The figure is based on city assessors' estimates of the value of each of the 938,004 properties in the city. Each property is supposed to be reassessed every year. 
 In many ways, the city report understates the severity of the decline in many parts of the real-estate market. The city's estimate of a property's taxable value -- its assessment -- is limited by state laws and generally does not reflect full market values. The assessments on some properties, including apartment and office buildings, are about 45 percent of market value.
Assessments on one-, two- and three-family houses are limited to about 8 percent of their market value. State law limits any rise in assessments on such houses to a maximum of 6 percent a year.
As a result, during the real-estate surge of the last decade, a huge gap arose between market values and assessments on such houses. Thus, a drop in their assessments may mask a much sharper decline in market value.
Prices on Manhattan cooperative and condominium apartments -- perhaps the most overheated segment of New York City's market during the 1980's -- have fallen as much as 25 to 50 percent in the last three years, said Clark P. Halstead, managing partner of the Halstead Property Company, a major Manhattan brokerage concern. In recent months other brokers have put the price decline at 20 to 30 percent.
"The last six months," Mr. Halstead said, "have been a kind of free fall."
By law, though, the city's assessments on co-op and condo buildings have no relation to market values of individual apartments. The assessments must be computed as if the cooperative or condominium were a rental building, with its value based on the building's potential rental income. "I'm not sure we can take any particular guidance from assessed values," Mr. Halstead said. "It's an abstraction."
On commercial properties and most apartment buildings, the city phases in assessment increases over five years. As a result, even though the overall assessments declined, the billable assessments -- the basis of the actual tax bills, which includes the phase-in of previous increases -- actually went up. The Finance Department set the billable assessment total at $79 billion, $3 billion more than last year.
Owners have about two months to appeal the tentative assessments. Deadlines vary with the type of property.
Assessed values of about 80 percent of the apartment buildings and commercial properties fell or stayed the same, said Martha E. Stark, a special assistant for property-tax reform to Finance Commissioner Carol O'Cleireacain. But the assessed value of two-thirds of the one-, two- and three-family houses rose. That is because of the large gap between market values and assessments for such property.
The state limit on assessment increases for houses led to many being assessed in recent years at 4 or 5 percent of market value. So while the market value of a house may have declined in the last year, its assessment could still increase without breaching the 8 percent level.
The typical single-family homeowner is paying a property-tax bill of $1,356 during the current city fiscal year, which began last July. Based on the new tentative assessments, the typical homeowner would pay a property-tax bill of $1,577 during the next fiscal year, Ms. Stark said.
The increase reflects both the rise in assessments for one-, two- and three-family houses and technical adjustments in the share of the property-tax burden paid for each category of property. It also includes a projected rise of $400 million in property taxes. The city's tax rate is now $9.84 for each $100 in assessed value for houses. If property taxes are raised by a total of more than $400 million, the cost to the typical homeowner would be about $20 more for every additional $100 million.
Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, a trade group, said he was particularly pleased that the decreases were most pronounced for commercial property and apartment buildings, which he said had long borne an unfair tax burden. "I think this indicates the Finance Department is on top of the market values and it demonstrates that they are moving in the right direction," he said.

HEADLINE: SOVIET CRACKDOWN: WASHINGTON;
White House Sticks to Its Subdued Reaction to Baltic Crackdown

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14

 BODY:
Moving cautiously in response to the Soviet military action in Lithuania, Bush Administration officials said today that the White House was reluctant to take stringent economic or political measures against Moscow.
Instead, officials said the Administration was weighing some mild punitive actions, like temporarily suspending technical exchanges. 
 The officials' comments were an indication that despite pressure from some members of Congress and Baltic-American groups, the Administration was loath to take any actions that would disrupt the coalition arrayed against Iraq or undermine the relationship between President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
Marlin Fitzwater, the President's spokesman, said that "we don't really know at this point" exactly what role Mr. Gorbachev played in the Soviet Army action in Vilnius in which 14 people were killed. Mr. Gorbachev said today in Moscow that he found out about the assault only after it happened, but he did not disavow the action or say it was unjustified. His comments left unclear whether he had approved a crackdown that led to the violent events of Sunday.
Mr. Fitzwater said the United States Ambassador to Moscow, Jack Matlock, had received high-level assurances from the Kremlin that Mr. Gorbachev continues to seek a peaceful solution to the Baltic crisis.
Mr. Bush and his advisers were focused on the Kuwait crisis today, but they also devoted some time to analyzing the events in the Soviet Union.
Administration officials said they did not want to do anything to disturb the balance in the coalition arrayed against President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, but the officials were also worried about the angry reaction of many Americans, in Congress and elsewhere, who accused the Bush Administration of selling out Lithuania.
"It would be a sad irony if the price of Soviet support for freeing Kuwait was American acquiescence in Soviet aggression against another illegally annexed country," Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, said on the NBC program "Today" this morning.
At a briefing for Congressional leaders this afternoon, some lawmakers told Mr. Bush that if the Administration did not go far enough in punishing Moscow, they might try to push through legislation that would prohibit export credits to the Soviet Union.
 
Aid Being Abused, Dole Says
 The Senate minority leader, Robert Dole of Kansas, called on the United States to suspend all remaining agricultural export credits for the Soviets because of the events in Lithuania.
"I believe that unless Gorbachev puts an immediate end to the threats, blackmail and aggression, the United States should not deal with him in a business-as-usual manner," Mr. Dole said in a statement.
Mr. Dole said that the Prime Minister of the Soviet republic of Moldavia told him last week that the 15 republics would receive food aid from the central Government only if they signed a union treaty with Moscow.
"Gorbachev is trying to use our grain credits," Mr. Dole said, "to blackmail Moldavia, the Baltic republics and any other republic that doesn't agree to sign the union treaty. Gorbachev has offered the people of these republics two options: sign or starve."
 
Warning by Kennedy
 Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts warned Mr. Gorbachev that Soviet actions could "lead to a cutoff of the substantial assistance we are now providing."
Mr. Fitzwater said in his White House briefing today that the Soviet Union has already tapped $800 million of the $1 billion in emergency food credits extended to them by the United States last month.
Mr. Fitzwater suggested that if the relationship between the superpowers sours, economic sanctions might be imposed because "the only real tools we have are the economic opportunities that have been granted as a result of that improving relationship."
The spokesman also said that the Soviet-American summit meeting planned for next month may be cancelled, because of the turmoil in the Middle East and in the Baltics.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF: THE U.N.;
France and 3 Arab States Issue an Appeal to Hussein

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 14

 BODY:
France and three Arab countries issued 11th-hour appeals tonight urging President Saddam Hussein to announce Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait before midnight Tuesday to avoid a war with the United States and its allies.
France's Foreign Minister, Roland Dumas, was considering a visit to Baghdad on Tuesday for further discussions if the Iraqi leadership shows any interest in the proposal being presented in Iraq by Arab leaders, diplomats say. 
 In return for such a commitment to withdraw, they want the United Nations Security Council to promise Iraq it will not be attacked and to mount a new drive to resolve the dispute over Palestine between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
But American and other Western diplomats were pessimistic about the chances of resolving the crisis peacefully on the basis of the 11th-hour proposals.
"We are taking an intransigent Saddam Hussein and giving him more and more, shaving away the proposals of the Security Council," Thomas R. Pickering, the United States representative, told reporters tonight. Mr. Pickering said he did not expect the Security Council to back the French plan. "We do not believe it is an appropriate time or appropriate circumstances for such a statement," he said.
 
Accord on Plan Unlikely
 This hostile American stance appeared to rule out any chance of the Security Council agreeing to the French plan tonight. This is because France wants Zaire, which currently holds the council's rotating presidency, to make the offer in the form a statement.
But such a move would require the support of all 15 council members, giving the United States an effective veto.
The French initiative and a similar one put forth jointly by Algeria, Yemen and Libya came the evening before the deadline of midnight Tuesday, New York time, when under the terms of a United Nations resolution, the United States and its allies are authorized to attack Iraq if it continues to occupy and claim Kuwait.
The last-ditch initiatives followed on the heels of an unsuccessful peace mission to Baghdad by United Nations Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar who returned here today after failing to secure any concessions from the Iraqi leader.
Arriving back in New York this morning, the Secretary General told reporters that his meeting with Mr. Hussein had been "polite but, unfortunately, unsuccessful."
 
Secretary General Snubbed
 "No, he didn't express any desire to withdraw from Kuwait," the Secretary General added. "I have not been offered anything from the Iraqi authorities which I consider a step towards peace."
Officials say the Iraqis deliberately snubbed the Secretary General during his brief visit to Baghdad, keeping him waiting for more than six hours while President Hussein met with groups of parliamentarians and peace campaigners.
Diplomats said tonight that the the Iraqi President had asked the Secretary General to make proposals for a settlement, but Mr. Perez de Cuellar declined, saying he was bound by the decisions of the Security Council.
The six-point French initiative, which was circulated here, called for a meeting of the Security Council to issue "a last appeal" to the Iraqi leader to agree to surrender Kuwait before the United Nations deadline, announce a timetable for completing the withdrawal and begin "a rapid and massive retreat."
Under the proposal the Council would tell Baghdad that the United Nations is ready to send in a military peacekeeping force to verify the withdrawal and maintain order. It would also offer Iraq guarantees that the countries with forces in the gulf would not attack.
Iraq would then be offered a chance to negotiate a peaceful settlement of its differences with Kuwait. And the Council would finally say that it was ready to make "an active contribution" to a settlement of the Palestinian issue by convening "at the appropriate moment" an international conference to assure "the security, stability and development of this region of the world."
 
Arab Plan Similar
 The six-point Arab plan, put forward by Yemen, Algeria and Libya, closely resembles the French proposal. It also called for Iraq to agree to give up Kuwait in return for a promise that it would not be attacked, for the removal of economic sanctions and for a Security Council committment to resolve the Palestinian issue.
A Yemeni delegation, including the country's Prime Minister, Foreign Minister and the president of its Parliament, was in Baghdad today pressing the proposal along with the the Prime Minister of Libya. The President and Foreign Minister of Algeria are expected there shortly to add their voices to the appeal.
Meanwhile, diplomats here say Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d has told allied leaders during his current visit to Canada that he is dissappointed with the failure of the Secretary General's mission, which he had hoped might show Iraq to be more flexible than it had been during his negotiations with Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz in Geneva last week.
The diplomats also said Mr. Baker told allied leaders that he believes Saddam Hussein has what he described as a "Nasser complex."
Mr. Baker was said to mean that the Iraqi leader may be planning to let the United States and its allies start an aerial bombardment of his forces before he sues for peace in a manner reminiscent of what the late Egyptian leader, Gamal Abdel Nasser, did during the war with Israel in 1967. When Nasser encountered defeat and offered to resign, he succeeded in generating great waves of popular enthusiasm for his leadership among the Arab masses.

HEADLINE: New Surveys Of the Universe Confound Theorists

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD

 BODY:
ASTRONOMERS' increasing power of observation is exposing awkward weaknesses in cosmology's cherished theories and imposing ever-narrowing limits on the imaginations of scientists engaged in the audacious vocation of figuring out the origin, evolution and ultimate fate of the universe.
Recent surveys of the heavens by telescopes and spacecraft have astonished scientists with the discovery of enormous conglomerations of galaxies that cannot be accounted for in current theory. Such large structures, and associated voids, imply gravitational forces from unseen matter that must represent at least 90 percent of the mass in the universe. 
 The nature of this hidden mass is the most confounding problem in cosmology, astrophysicists say, perhaps in all of physical science. And one of the favorite explanations, which posits the existence of invisible exotic particles known as cold dark matter, has just suffered a serious setback from an analysis of infrared galactic observations reported this month.
Until scientists can determine the nature and amount of the cosmic mass, they will not be able to resolve the issue of whether there is enough material for gravitational forces to keep the universe expanding but at a decreasing rate. Too much mass, and the universe would contract and collapse on itself. Too little, and it expands forever virtually to a vanishing point.
"These are confused times," said Dr. P. J. E. Peebles, an astrophysicist at Princeton University.
Dr. Margaret J. Geller of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics said: "Something fundamental is missing in our models. "We clearly do not know how to make large structure in the context of the Big Bang."
But nothing has been learned, cosmologists insist, to question the foundation on which they seek to erect their theoretical edifices. For the last 25 years, nearly all astrophysicists have agreed that the universe -- time and space, everything -- began in an explosive instant, the Big Bang, and it has been expanding in all directions ever since.
"The basic Big Bang model has withstood the test of observations and experiments amazingly well," said Dr. David N. Schramm, an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago. "Just because you can't understand the physics of predicting tornadoes or earthquakes, you don't question the assumption of the round earth."
Indeed, new findings by astronomy and particle physics have strengthened scientists' faith in the Big Bang cosmology. Powerful accelerators have recently produced elementary particles of a kind predicted to have been created by the Big Bang. An American spacecraft, the Cosmic Background Explorer, or COBE, has found the temperature (a cool 2.7 degrees above absolute zero) and other properties of the background microwave radiation in the universe, the presumed afterglow of the Big Bang, to accord precisely with theory.
At a meeting of the American Astronomical Society yesterday in Philadelphia, Dr. John C. Mather, the chief COBE scientist, said: "We have confirmed the Big Bang theory very well. But the theory is sufficiently broad in possibilities to allow for many variations that are still open to question."
 
From Smooth to Lumpy
 The faint radiation pervading the cosmos was discovered in 1965, and it is considered the best evidence that the universe began with an explosion. But some of the same new observations seem to undermine concepts of what has happened in the 10 billion to 20 billion years since the Big Bang.
In its measurements last year, the COBE spacecraft failed to find any local variations in the radiation's intensity. Nowhere could the craft's infrared detectors see any point brighter than its surroundings by even one part in 25,000. The early universe was an incredibly smooth and homogeneous mix of energy and matter, as would be expected after the Big Bang.
Cosmologists are thus at a loss to understand how a smooth universe evolved to its present clumpy texture. They have recognized and grappled with this question for more than a decade, but never more so than in the last couple years. Technological advances, including electronic devices improving the light-collecting efficiency of telescopes, have enabled astronomers to see more of the universe's shape and dynamics.
"This is the first age in which we can really map the universe," Dr. Geller said.
 One surprise has followed another. Not only is the universe composed of billions of galaxies of stars but by clusters of galaxies and superclusters linked together gravitationally in patterns like the "great wall" observed two years ago. Its discoverers, Dr. Geller and Dr. John P. Huchra, estimate the wall stretches across the heavens for more than half a billion light-years.
In between dense galactic structures Dr. Thomas J. Broadhurst of the University of London found gaping voids of comparable magnitude. Other astronomers have reported that the Milky Way and neighboring galaxies seem to be falling toward some enormous but unseen mass, known as the "great attractor."
Cosmology's turmoil is compounded by other observations of extremely distant quasars, sources of intense radiation assumed to be at the cores of galaxies. More than two dozen quasars have been detected out toward the edge of the universe, hence close to the beginning of time. If these distances are confirmed, it means that stars were clustering in galaxies much earlier than had been thought possible in Big Bang theory.
 
Hunt for Missing Mass
 All of which lends urgency to the search for the hidden mass that is supposed to hold together the universe and create its galactic tapestry.
Scientists began in earnest to invent solutions to the missing mass a decade ago. That was when Dr. Alan Guth, now a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, proposed the inflation theory that has become a widely accepted elaboration of Big Bang cosmology. A rapid expansion of the universe at the moment of creation could explain the initially smooth conditions and even the "seeds" for galaxy formation.
The inflation theory predicted that the universe should contain 100 times the matter visible in stars; otherwise it is difficult to explain its expansion rate and why it was not, in effect, stillborn. Some of the missing mass can be inferred from the observed gravitational effects on the dynamics of galaxies. But, according to studies of light elements produced in the Big Bang, no more than 10 percent of the mass should be ordinary matter like that in stars and planets.
 Some 90 percent of the assumed mass is thus believed to be made of something scientists cannot see or imagine. The leading candidate has been cold dark matter, which is theorized to be an assortment of exotic and as yet undetected tiny particles that are considered "cold" because they move relatively slowly and "dark" because they do not absorb or radiate light. Physicists sometimes call them WIMP's, for weakly interacting, yet massive particles.
Though no one has detected such particles, cold dark matter won strong support because it successfully accounted for structure on the scale of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. But it ran into trouble with the discovery of the "great wall" and other structures that seemed to be five times larger than anything possible with cold dark matter.
In an analysis of surveys by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, British and Canadian scientists wrote this month in the journal Nature, "There is more structure on large scales than is predicted by the standard cold dark matter theory of galaxy formation."
 
Conclusions Called Remarkable
 Dr. David Lindley, associate editor of the journal, commented that the conclusions were "all the more remarkable for coming from a group of authors that includes some of the theory's longtime supporters."
Two of the authors were Dr. Carlos Frenk of the University of Durham in England and Dr. George Efstathiou of the University of Oxford. They and Dr. Marc Davis of the University of California at Berkeley and Dr. Simon D. M. White of the University of Arizona performed the computer simulations that established cold dark matter as a plausible explanation of galaxy formation.
Dr. Frenk said in an interview that the Nature editors misrepresented the report's conclusions. He said three of the four basic elements of the theory were unaffected by the findings. "It must be emphasized," Dr. Frenk said, "that the discrepancy between the standard model and the new data, although highly significant, is relatively small."
But other astrophysicists, who had already become skeptical, said the cold dark matter theory was in serious trouble because of the universe's observed large structure. "It's not dead, but it's on the ropes," Dr. Schramm said.
So it is back to the drawing boards for theoreticians, either to revive cold dark matter in modified form or re-examine alternative proposals -- or think of something entirely new. Any number of alternative concepts -- cosmic strings or texture, stellar explosions, even hot dark matter -- have been examined in the past to explain how galaxies were formed. All have been found wanting, but not entirely discarded.
Dr. Peebles said new attention would be directed toward "hot matter," higher-energy particles that could account for the dark matter. Experiments by Soviet and American scientists last year determined that some forms of tiny invisible particles called neutrinos do have some slight mass. This could revive interest in neutrinos as dark-matter candidates.
In recent months, scientists have expressed interest in the discarded Einstein concept of the cosmological constant. This suggests that empty space, though a vacuum, possesses an energy density creating an outward pressure on space counteracting the inward pull of gravity. Dr. Efstathiou proposed last month that the energy densities of the cosmological constant could explain how large-scale structures were formed within the standard cold dark matter model.
Despite the confusion over dark matter, theorists came away from a symposium last month at Brighton, England, excited and encouraged by new observations of galactic velocities and volumes that they think yield evidence seeming to confirm one important part of Big Bang cosmology. "Observers are beginning to see that omega is creeping up, approaching unity," Dr. Schramm said.
Translated, that means that measurements of the average density of the universe are getting closer to the critical density, which has been estimated to be at present about six hydrogen atoms per cubic meter. If the actual average density is found to equal this critical density, a state referred to as omega one, it would indicate that the universe is poised precisely between an endless expansion and an ultimate collapse.
"This is an even more interesting result than all the clumping," Dr. Frenk said. "This tells us the future of the universe. And critical density, in the mind of most cosmologists, means dark matter, in all likelihood cold dark matter."
Other astrophysicists are not so sure about either the new density measurements or the reality of cold dark matter. They are worried, as Dr. Geller said, that all their models are "vaguely unsatisfying" and in need of constant repair and renovation to accord with new observations.
Looking at the bright side, cosmologists say they welcome the new observations because they put their work on a more scientific footing.
 
Collapse of Ptolemy's Theory
 But more than one scientist, pondering the ferment of observational surprises and repeated revisions of theories, has been reminded of Ptolemy's epicycles. The theory of an Earth-centered universe survived more than 1,000 years, but only fashioning circles within circles of planetary motions in reponse to awkward observations. Finally, it fell of its own complexity and in the 16th-century was replaced by the simpler and more accurate Copernican theory.
The thought makes cosmologists uncomfortable. For all the problems in trying to understand what the universe is made of and what holds it together, they emphasize that it does not follow that the Big Bang theory is in danger of collapsing.
So far, Dr. Geller said, interpretations of cosmic structure on the basis of current mapping of the heavens are far from definitive -- more like trying to picture the whole world from a survey of Rhode Island. "Someday," she said, "we may find that we haven't been putting the pieces together in the right way, and when we do, it will seem so obvious that we'll wonder why we hadn't thought of it much sooner."

HEADLINE: DIALOGUE: NEXT STEP IN THE GULF - IT'S ALMOST MIDNIGHT;
Restraint, Mr. Bush

BYLINE: By Daniel Patrick Moynihan; Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
As we wait to see what will happen now in the Persian Gulf, it may be useful to record what was supposed to happen but did not. We were supposed to see the emergence of a "new world order" in the course of the first crisis of the post-cold-war era. For a period, it looked as if we might just; then, in an instant, we relapsed into the cold war mode.
The Iraqi invasion caught us unprepared as to the identity of friend and foe. We had been backing Iraq. A week before the invasion, the State Department stoutly opposed the Iraq International Law Compliance Act, as reported from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, cutting off agricultural subsidies until they stopped using poison gas. 
 By contrast, we had endured Kuwait, a none too pretty principality much given at international conferences to pronouncements concerning "the Zionist entity" receiving "economic, technological and political assistance from the United States." How then to respond to an invasion that threatened, among other things, Saudia Arabia.
We turned to international law, a code of conduct neutral as to the parties' prior posturings. In one news conference in August, President Bush used the term six times. We turned to the U.N. For the first time ever in such a situation, the permanent members were in accord.
Pursuant to Security Council resolutions, we dispatched forces to defend and to deter, and to uphold economic sanctions. Something very like a world police action commenced to take shape. Then, of a sudden, on Nov. 8 the body rejected the transplant. We lapsed back into the cold war mode of massive mililtary deployment.
War plans were drawn. The public was informed that intelligence findings -- necessarily secret -- pointed to the inevitabililty of hostilities. Terror alerts were sounded. The F.B.I. began checking on yet another ethnic group. At the turn of the year, the President would state on TV: "Standing up against this aggression -- no price is too heavy to pay for it."
This, of course, is the language John F. Kennedy used 30 years ago next Sunday, at the height of the cold war: "pay any price, bear any burden." Many thought the Soviet Union had opened a lead in ICBM's, the ultimate weapon of destruction. World Communism was at its apogee, its progress declared irreversible: the next and final stage of history.
How could such terms come to be applied to the depredations of a third world thug? Any price? A million Arab civilian casualities? Of course not. Some price, to be sure. But a proportionate price. Our share. Curiously, this is more a possibility now than any time since November. Thanks to last week's debate and Saturday's vote in Congress. And thanks also to that Soviet tank in Vilnius crushing a human before our eyes.
Saturday's vote authorizes the President to go to war. He asked for this authority and got it. For a moment, there he was asserting, in the cold war mode, that he didn't need it. The Constitution took something of a beating during the cold war. How could it not have in the course of 30 to 40 years in which Presidents knew they would have 10 minutes at most to decide whether to launch a thermonuclear second strike?
All right; that was then. Now a certain normality reappears. Which is to say a sense of proportion. Why should this not now phase over into a sense of proportion about what is at stake in the gulf? Important principles, yes. Ultimate issues, no. Nothing worth the war now being contemplated. Time is on our side. Were Mr. Bush to show, in Dwight Eisenhower's phrase, "the courage of patience" he could end up with Mr. Eisenhower's stature as a military strategist.
Just as importantly, we have got to pay attention to the breakup of the Soviet Union. And to the fact that through half a century of the cold war our vast intelligence system learned everything there was to know about the Soviet Union except that it was breaking up. We could be returning to the chaos of 1919 in that vast wretchedly governed, wretchedly unhappy land. The 75 year struggle against totalitarianism has reached its endgame, but the final outcome remains, of course, uncertain. This is a state that still possesses 10,000 nuclear warheads, and civil war inches closer by the day. That for certain is a war the world does not need -- which needs to be uppermost in our mind.

HEADLINE: Murder Trial Focusing On Battered-Wife Issue

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES

 BODY:
The facts are not in dispute: On the night of May 23, 1989, Sarah Smith, a 43-year-old social worker, shot her sleeping husband once in the head with a .25-caliber pistol that she had taken from his pocket.
She wrapped his hulking 6-foot-3-inch body in two blankets, hoisted it onto a dolly and wheeled it to a car, and put it in the trunk. She then drove to Yonkers and left his body in a schoolyard. A week later, she turned herself in to an officer she knew at her local police station, in the 40th Precinct in the South Bronx. 
 Twenty months later, Sarah Smith stands trial in State Supreme Court in the Bronx, in a case that has called up all the turbulent issues about battered women. Mrs. Smith, who supported her unemployed husband, Owen Smith, 31, throughout their seven-year marriage, describes him as an abusive alcoholic and cocaine addict who terrorized her and threatened to kill her the night of his death.
Mrs. Smith's lawyer is Michael G. Dowd, who has successfully defended other battered wives, including Karen Straw, a 29-year-old Queens woman who stabbed her estranged husband to death in 1987 during an argument, and was acquitted. The case gained national attention and was hailed by womens' rights groups as a victory for all abused wives, many of whom had been imprisoned for fighting back under similar circumstances.
 
Last Case Before Suspension
 For Mr. Dowd, who is donating his services, this is his last case before beginning a five-year suspension for making kickbacks on a contract to collect overdue fines for the New York City Parking Violations Bureau. He made the payments at the direction of the late Donald R. Manes, then the Queens Borough President. He is allowed to finish this trial, and said he expected it to last no more than two weeks.
"If I had to choose my last case, this would be it," Mr. Dowd said. "I can't think of a more worthwhile case."
Mr. Dowd calls his client the "classic profile of the battered woman." But unlike Mrs. Straw, Mrs. Smith neither called the police when her husband abused her nor asked the courts for an order of protection -- primarily, Mr. Dowd said, because she had read several news stories about women killed by their husbands after seeking such help. But the prosecution questions why she had not felt the same way about her first husband, whom she left after he had abused her.
 
Quietly Sobbing in Chair
 Mr. Smith, a Jamaican who was an illegal immigrant when he met his wife, was allowed to stay once they married. He was 11 years younger than Mrs. Smith and liked to go out at night and drink, smoke marijuana and use cocaine, said her lawyer. Mrs. Smith would stay home with her daughters. The older is now a 26-year-old nurse; the younger, now 20 and in college, is Mrs. Smith's foster daughter, whom she took in when the girl was 8 after finding out the child was being abused.
During opening arguments on Friday, Mrs. Smith sat in the defendant's chair, quietly sobbing as Mr. Dowd detailed threats and abuse during the last three years of the couple's seven-year marriage.
He told the jury that Mr. Smith began to change for the worse after he obtained his green card, or legalization papers, in 1986. Mr. Dowd said that Mr. Smith repeatedly raped her, refusing to let her see her two daughters under the threat of harming them. He choked her during arguments, the lawyer said, and called her office, a few blocks from their apartment, several times a day to check her whereabouts.
Mr. Dowd also said that during Mr. Smith's rages, he would point one of his several guns out the window or at the walls of the couple's apartment and shoot. Mr. Smith had been arrested five times on charges including selling and possessing drugs and assaulting an officer. Mr. Dowd added that Mr. Smith effectively threatened his wife by persuading her that he would escape prosecution for killing her, as he had for the other offenses.
He described Mrs. Smith as a striver who overcame years of abuse by her father and her first husband. For four years, Mrs. Smith studied at night for a degree from the College of New Rochelle while working full time at a welfare office. She graduated in 1982.
Mr. Dowd portrayed Mrs. Smith as a loving wife who had believed she could help her husband overcome his addictions and curb his violent episodes.
"But on the night of May, 23, 1989, around 10 P.M.," Mr. Dowd said, "Owen Smith told her that this would be the night he would kill her."
The prosecution, headed by Assistant District Attorney Elisa Koenderman, argued that as a bright woman with a college education, Mrs. Smith knew her options and chose the wrong one. Ms. Koenderman said that during their marriage, Mrs. Smith began to resent her husband more and more. The prosecutor said that if threatened, Mrs. Smith could have walked out the door instead of shooting her husband in the brain while he slept.
Mrs. Smith spent a month and a half in jail before being released on her own recognizance.
The District Attorney had offered to recommend a prison term of 4 to 12 years if she pleaded guilty to manslaughter. Now, if convicted of both second-degree murder and criminal weapon possession, she could face a minimum sentence of 15 years to life in prison.
On Friday, Ms. Koenderman called three witnesses, the man who found Mr. Smith's body and a police officer and a detective from the Yonkers Police Department who were later called to the scene. She also showed the jury two photographs of the body, and submitted in evidence the bloodied blankets Mrs. Smith wrapped Mr. Smith in.
The prosecution is to continue its case today.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 29, 1991, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Jan. 15 about the trial of Sarah Smith, a Bronx woman who killed her husband, misstated an element of her defense. Mrs. Smith contended that her husband was awake when she shot him; she did not accept the prosecution contention that he was asleep. The error was cited yesterday by a judge who overturned Mrs. Smith's murder conviction. An article about the case appears today on page B1.

Dataquest Losing Chief To Gartner, Its Rival

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
Manny A. FernandezManny A. Fernandez, chief executive of Dataquest Inc., is leaving to become president and chief operating officer of the rival Gartner Group Inc., Gartner said yesterday. Both companies provide research on companies in the computer and other technological industries.
Mr. Fernandez, 44 years old, will join Gartner, based in Stamford, Conn., on Monday, said Gideon I. Gartner, 55, the founder and head of the research firm. Mr. Fernandez will also become chief executive April 1, the company said. Mr. Gartner said he would remain as chairman and, after April 1, would focus on strategy and the company's research processes. 
 Mr. Gartner founded the company 11 years ago after a career at the International Business Machines Corporation and as a technology analyst on Wall Street. His firm, which became known for the quality of its I.B.M.-watching, went public in 1986 and two years later was purchased by Saatchi & Saatchi P.L.C., the London-based advertising company, for $94 million, Mr. Gartner said.
But the marriage did not last. Saatchi, running into financial problems, began to divest itself of its consulting and research businesses. After early attempts to sell the company fell through, Mr. Gartner and a Boston-based investors group called Information Partners bought the company back in October.
Mr. Gartner said Saatchi had put the sale price at $63.5 million. "But that price had all sorts of adjustments," Mr. Gartner added. "In fact it was significantly lower." But he did not say by how much.
Dataquest, based in San Jose, Calif., is "twice as old as we are but we are growing a lot faster," Mr. Gartner said yesterday. "We are doing just under $100 million in revenue and they are in the low 60's," he added.
"I've been looking for a successor for a long time," Mr. Gartner said, adding that Saatchi had not allowed him to bring one in for cost reasons.
Mr. Fernandez said he was an old friend and competitor of Mr. Gartner. "This is an incredible opportunity," he said. Gartner "has all the excitement and potential of a small entrepreneurial company and at the same time is a company that is profitable and has a great franchise in the market," he added.
Mr. Fernandez headed Dataquest, which is a subsidiary of Dun & Bradstreet, for six and a half years. Earlier he was president and chief executive of the Gavilan Computer Corporation. At Dataquest, he will be succeeded by the company's chief operating officer, Glen Haney.

HEADLINE: Roger W. Tubby, 80, Publisher; Promoted the Adirondack Region

BYLINE: By GLENN FOWLER

 BODY:
Roger W. Tubby, a newspaperman and Government official who briefly served as press secretary to President Harry S. Truman in 1952, died yesterday at his home in Saranac Lake, N.Y. He was 80 years old.
He died of cancer, his family said. 
 For the last 35 years, with time out in the 1960's for service as press spokesman for the State Department and for an ambassadorial post in Geneva, Mr. Tubby had been a resident and indefatigable promoter of the Adirondack region of New York State.
In 1954, shortly after he became co-publisher of The Adirondack Daily Enterprise in Saranac Lake, he founded the Adirondack Park Association, now the 14-county Adirondack North Country Association. Until his death he remained a major advocate of economic aid for the region and preservation of its scenic and historic attractions.
His efforts were reflected in his chairmanship of the New York State Tourism Advisory Council from 1985 until his retirement in 1988.
 
Government Service in Wartime
 Mr. Tubby went to Washington in World War II as an information officer on foreign trade and became press officer in the State Department after the war. In 1950 he joined the White House press staff and was press secretary in the last three months of the Truman Presidency.
In 1961 he returned to the State Department as Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs. Later he spent seven years as United States representative to United Nations agencies in Geneva, holding the rank of ambassador, and three years as dean of academic relations at the Foreign Relations Institute in Washington.
His love of the Adirondacks absorbed most of his energies in later life. In September1988, shortly before Mr. Tubby stepped down as head of the Tourism Advisory Council, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo cited his "hands-on administration, good counsel and wisdom" as "a bulwark of the state's tourism industry for decades."
 
Native of Connecticut
 A native of Greenwich, Conn., and a graduate of Choate School and Yale University, Mr. Tubby did postgraduate study at the London School of Economics. His first newspaper job was reporting for The Bennington Banner in Vermont in 1938. Two years later he became the paper's managing editor.
In 1942 he began his Government service on the staff of the Board of Economic Warfare in Washington. He moved to the Foreign Economic Administration as director of information in 1944 and later held a similar post in the Commerce Department's Office of International Trade.
From 1945 to 1949 Mr. Tubby was press officer for the State Department, and in 1950 he was named assistant press secretary at the White House. He moved up to acting press secretary in the fall of 1952 and to the post of chief spokesman that December.
 
Stevenson Aide in 1956
 In 1956 he was an aide to Adlai E. Stevenson in Mr. Stevenson's unsuccessful campaign for President against Dwight D. Eisenhower. By that time he had bought, with James Loeb Jr., The Adirondack Daily Enterprise. He was active in its management until 1970 and remained a columnist until his final illness.
In 1974 he ran unsuccessfully for the House of Representatives as a Democrat. The next year he was appointed New York State's Deputy Commissioner of Parks and Recreation in charge of operations and planning, a post he held for two years.
He is survived by his wife, the former Anne Williams ; his mother, Frances Olitsky of Greenwich, Conn.; three daughters, Suzanne Batra of Greenbelt, Md., Jean Prentiss Sherwood of Rockville, Md., and Brenda Chandler of Portland, Me.; a son, Peter, of Adamstown, Md.; a sister, Ruth Rubinstein of London and nine grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Sir Robert Jackson Is Dead at 79; A Former Major Official at U.N.

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE

 BODY:
Sir Robert Jackson, a former Under Secretary General of the United Nations, died of a stroke on Saturday morning in the apartment of his son in London, the United Nations Secretariat said yesterday. He was 79 years old.
Sir Robert, an Australian, lived in Manhattan and was visiting his son, Robert Jr., at the time of his death. He was knighted in 1956 and named a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1962. 
 An international administrator and consultant, Sir Robert served the United Nations -- and the Governments of Australia, India, Pakistan and other countries -- in many capacities over the years. As an Under Secretary from 1972 until his retirement in 1987, he was one of the highest officials in the United Nations system.
He was particularly known for his work in relief and humanitarian activities in Bangladesh, Cambodia and elsewhere and in economic development in more than 60 developing countries. He was also the guiding spirit of a 1970 document, called the Jackson report, that led to changes in the United Nations system of providing economic aid to developing countries.
 
Called a Founding Father
 Luis Maria Gomez, an Argentinian who is the Associate Administrator of the United Nations Development Program, said yesterday that Sir Robert "was one of the founding fathers of the U.N. system and a profound reformer of its technical operations mechanism."
Another former Under Secretary General, Sir Brian Urquhart, a Briton, wrote in his memoirs, published in 1987, that Sir Robert's "capacity to work at full pressure, taking into account a large variety of economic, political, logistical, financial and natural factors and making them into a coherent operational plan, was a marvelous thing to see."
Sir Robert oversaw reconstruction efforts for the United Nations in the early 1970's in Bangladesh after the Pakistani civil war. These efforts included putting the inland transportation system back into operation.
His main collaborator on the Jackson report -- an 18-month team effort -- was Margaret Joan Anstee, who was then an employee of the United Nations Development Program and is now herself an Under Secretary General.
 
Major Innovations
 Sarah Timpson, a member of the program's Senior Policy Group, said yesterday that the report had led to such majr innovations as a system for fostering "consensus between the northern, donor nations and the southern, recipient nations, which has been the basis for the U.N.D.P.'s way of operating ever since."
Robert Gillman Allen Jackson was born Nov. 8, 1911, in Melbourne, Australia. He entered the Australian Navy in 1929 and switched to Britain's Royal Navy in 1937. During World War II he served largely in staff posts, in Malta and elsewhere, and then returned to civilian life.
From 1945 to 1947 he was Senior Deputy Director General of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and oversaw activities of that agency in Europe and other places where World War II had caused destruction.
He held various British and Australian honors in addition to his knighthoods.
In 1950 Sir Robert was married to Barbara Ward, the British economist and author who in 1976 was made a life peer with the title of Baroness Jackson of Lodsworth. They were separated at the time of her death in 1981.
He is survived by his son, a grandson and a granddaughter.
Burial is to be Jan. 21 in London. Arrangements for a memorial service in Manhattan are being made by officials of the United Nations Development Program.

HEADLINE: Gift to Barnard Honors Iphigene Sulzberger

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
The late Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, central figure in the family that has published The New York Times since 1896, was honored yesterday with a $5 million contribution from her family to her alma mater, Barnard College.
Barnard's president, Ellen V. Futter, announced that Centennial Hall, the college's newest dormitory, would be renamed for Mrs. Sulzberger, who died last February at the age of 97. 
 "Barnard College is the institution to which our mother was most devoted throughout her life," said her son, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the publisher of The Times. "It speaks to her concerns for education, for New York City and for women. We are delighted to honor our mother by making this gift to the college that she loved."
His sisters, Marian S. Heiskell, Ruth S. Holmberg and Dr. Judith P. Sulzberger, joined him in the donation to the Campaign for Barnard, a $100 million capital fund campaign that will go toward retaining and recruiting faculty, improving the physical structures on the campus and raising financial aid.
 
Over the Halfway Mark
 The first phase of the campaign, which will end in 1994, seeks to raise $60 million. The $5 million contribution from Mrs. Sulzberger's family puts it over the halfway mark less than one year after the campaign began.
Mrs. Sulzberger graduated in 1914 from Barnard, where she studied economics and American and modern European history. She was the daughter of Adolph S. Ochs, who acquired The Times in 1896. Her husband, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, was the publisher of The Times from 1935 to 1961.
While at Barnard, she was attracted to journalism as a career and in her senior year took a course at the School of Journalism at Columbia University. Although her father decided that a newspaper office was no place for women, Mrs. Sulzberger played a critical though unobtrusive role in shaping The Times throughout the century.
"Mrs. Sulzberger has a special place in Barnard's history and in our hearts," Ms. Futter said. "For over three-quarters of a century, Iphigene Sulzberger was unwavering in her dedication to the college."
Mrs. Sulzberger was on Barnard's board from 1937 to 1968, when she became a trustee emeritus. She spearheaded the effort to raise funds for a library at the college, the Adele Lehman Hall-Wollman Library, which cost $2.15 million and was dedicated in 1960.
The 17-story, 400-bed dormitory to be renamed for Mrs. Sulzberger, which was designed by James Stewart Polshek & Partners, has received several architectural awards, including the New York State Association for Architects-American Institute of Architects Award for Design Excellence and the New York City Chapter of the American Institute of Architects Award for Distinguished Architecture.
The dormitory, on the campus between 116th and 117th Streets, facing Broadway, was completed two years ago. It is the first to be built by the college in 20 years and will transform Barnard into a fully residential college for the first time in its history.
"We are now able to offer a room to every student if they want it," said a Barnard spokeswoman, Gail Zarr. "People living on campus have different needs and give the campus a different social flavor."

HEADLINE: India's Violence Damaging Tourist Industry

BYLINE: By SANJOY HAZARIKA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Jan. 15

 BODY:
Political uncertainity and thousands of deaths in sectarian and caste violence last year have led to widespread tourist cancellations and jeopardized plans by the Indian Government, which has billed 1991 as "Visit India Year," to generate funds from tourism.
The designation of India as an unsafe destination by Western countries, including the United States and Japan, has also led to a drop in visitors. 
 "The tourism and travel industry in India is facing the worst crisis in the last 30 years," said O. P. Ahuja, president of the Indian Association of Tour Operators. Based on initial figures from officials and tour organizers, Mr. Ahuja said tourist arrivals were "tending to slide to minus growth" rather than the increase of about 9 percent over 1989 that had been projected.
The problem is aggravated by what is widely seen as a lack of planning and policy. The new Minister for Tourism is Deputy Prime Minister Devi Lal, who is 75 and has rarely traveled abroad. Mr. Lal is a strong supporter of rural life and at one point had proclaimed his opposition to luxury hotels. His views on ways to develop tourism are not known.Mr. Lal recently created ripples of concern and amusement when he announced that farmers wearing turbans and dhotis -- or the long pieces of cloth that are wrapped around the legs in India -- will be entitled to a 50 percent discount when they stay at Government-run luxury hotels. "Eighty percent of India's population is rural and they are afraid of entering a five-star hotel," Mr. Lal said in an interview with The Sunday Times of India. "I want to change this."
Ghulam Naqsbandh, a vice president of Sita Travels, a leading tour organizer, said: "In most countries, if you were planning for a 'Visit Year,' you'dplan and upgrade your facilities and work on it for years. Here we've had hardly one year and where are the new hotels, the better rooms, transport, connections that we need?"
Tour agencies, airline officials, government policy makers and others blamed political factors for the widespread tourist cancellations that followed. These included last year's political crisis that led to the collapse of the minority Government of V. P. Singh and its replacement by another minority Government led by Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar. Also cited were the extremist violence that engulfed Kashmir, one of the most popular travel destinations in South Asia, and the Hindu-Muslim riots in Agra, site of the Taj Mahal, which shut the city down for several days.
Official figures show no growth inlast year's tourist arrivals over those for 1989. According to these statistics, about 1.3 million tourists visited India in 1990. But hotel executives and tour operators said they were faced with major cancellations after August when riots began in Northern India over reservations in jobs for backward Hindu castes.
Sectarian rioting fueled by a dispute over a mosque that Hindus say is a Hindu shrine has damaged towns, villages and cities in a nearly 1,000-mile belt stretching from the popular northwestern state of Rajasthan, famed for its ethnic fairs and fabrics, palaces and forts, maharajahs as hoteliers and gracious hosts, to the backward state of Bihar in the east.
The countries that have notified their nationals that India is unsafe because of the violence -- the worst since thepartition riots of 1947 that accompanied independence from Britain -- include the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Germany and Japan. In addition, because of an economic crunch, the Soviet Union has canceled all organized tours to India for the next 3 months, causing a further drop of about 25,000 visitors.
A gasoline crunch in October and November, followed by a Government decision to increase oil prices after the Persian Gulf crisis, led to the cancellation of many organized bus tours and a 25 percent rise in domestic air fares.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
No Accounting For Bad Banks

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
WHICH banks should be counted as the walking dead, doomed to follow the Bank of New England into Federal receivership? Regulators are not telling -- and could not, even if they were so inclined. For the accounting methods currently used by banks, argues Lawrence White, an economist at New York University's business school, offer only the haziest clues to their net worth.
Mr. White should know: As one of three members of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, he watched with chagrin as the savings and loan cowboys ran out of excuses in the late 1980's and left Uncle Sam to pay the bill. His book, "The S & L Scandal," to be published next month by Oxford University Press, reflects on what went wrong and what could be done to prevent a repeat performance. 
 The key to successful bank regulation, Mr. White believes, is knowing what banks are really worth. Traditional accounting methods gave hundreds of bankrupt savings and loans the wiggle room to evade closure in the late 1980's. And without a change to so-called market-value accounting, he argues, even the cleverest schemes for keeping banks on the straight and narrow path are likely to go awry.
When a car is wrecked, the insurance company's liability is reduced by the amount of the deductible. When a bank is wrecked, the deposit insurance fund's liability is reduced by the amount of capital the bank stockholders leave on the table. That is one good reason why Washington sets minimum capital standards for banks -- and why, in theory, regulators ought to be able to figure out that banksare heading south long before depositors or the insurance fund are in danger of getting stiffed.
The catch is that the regulators are dependent on the numbers. And the calculation of a bank's legally defined net worth is more a ritual than a true accounting, one bearing about as much relationship to the real world as a performance of kabuki.
The price of a corporate bond listed on a public exchange fluctuates with interest rates and credit ratings; any investor who cares to know what his holding is worth need only call a broker. By contrast, the value of a home mortgage or a business loan on a bank's books is usually whatever the bank shelled out.
Such cost-based accounting may have provided all the information regulators needed when loan defaults were rare and banks were virtually assured a fat spread between the interest they paid on deposits and the interest they received on loans. But since the late 1960's, this cozy arrangement has failed, and with it the ability of regulators to bite before they are bitten.
Financial deregulation left banks vulnerable torising deposit rates. Meanwhile, increasing competition narrowed margins on blue-chip loans, driving banks into higher-risk assets, like i.o.u.'s backed by the full faith and credit of the Government of Zaire. And the go-go types who invaded the industry soon discovered that traditional accounting was an invitation to creativity: Losing assets could be carried at cost, while winners could be sold and the profits added to net worth.
Some reformers want to link deposit insurance premiums to the size of a bank's capital cushion; safe drivers pay less -- why not give a break to safe bankers? Others want to narrow the regulators' room for manuever, forcing them to close a failing bank before members of Congress can persuade them to forbear. But in Mr. White's view, no plan for reducing banks' incentive to take big risks or to spare taxpayers the consequences of bank errors can be any better than the accounting system on which it rests.
What is needed, he argues, is a system in which banks' assets and liabilities are "marked to market" every month or every quarter, much the way a mutual fund recomputes the total value of the stocks it owns at the end of each trading day. In fact, Mr. White would go further and add a "dynamic accounting" requirement: Banks would be asked to project the likely impact of changes in interest rates or exchange rates on their net worth.
Critics of market-based accounting say it probably cannot be done well because the values of some bank assets are elusive: Boston office buildings without tenants are, after all, a lot harder to appraise than shares of I.B.M. stock. And even if it could be done, they say, it should not be done: Rapid fluctuations in estimated net worth would spook both depositors and regulators.
Mr. White is not impressed. If accurate market-based assessments of net worth are not possible or desirable, he asks, why bother with inaccurate and often misleading assessments based on acquisition costs? Why, indeed?

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF: Jordan;
Seeing War Near, King Hussein Vows to Protect Jordan's Land and Sky

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Jan. 15

 BODY:
King Hussein of Jordan, evidently abandoning all hope for Western or Arab diplomacy in the Persian Gulf crisis, sought tonight to ready his people for embroilment in war and said the Middle East stood on the verge of imminent catastrophe.
"We are now hearing the drums of war, which are threatening all of us with the most dangerous consequences," he said in a television address to his nation of three million people. 
 "Our region is now on the verge of an abyss as the gulf crisis evolves into an imminent catastrophe," he said.
In what seemed a message to both Israel and Iraq, the King said that his armed forces -- outgunned by both of Jordan's militarily powerful neighbors -- would "protect the land and skies of our country and prevent anyone from crossing in one direction or the other."
Iraq has said it will attack Israel if the United States-dominated forces massed in the Persian Gulf and Saudi Arabia go on the offensive to reverse Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
 
Potentially Acute Problem
 The threat of conflict has confronted Jordan with a potentially acute problem since both Iraqi missiles or aircraft and Israeli warplanes would need to cross Jordanian airspace if the two opposed powers fought each other. Military specialists here say it is far from clear how Jordan would confront intrusions into its air space.
Since the eruption of the gulf crisis, King Hussein, traditionally pro-Western, has faced difficult choices. More than half of the population he rules is of Palestinian descent and has shown widespread support for Iraq. But by acknowledging Palestinian sentiments in his foreign policies, he has cut himself off from crucial sources of economic assistance from the gulf Arabs allied with Washington against Baghdad.
The Jordanian King has sought, thus, to promote what he terms an Arab solution to the crisis - a notion rejected by the United States. In a display of affinity with the Islamic sentiment that has deepened in his country since the start of the crisis, the King appeared on television tonight with a full-grown beard - generally taken in the Muslim world as a sign of piety.
As the leader of a land which, Western diplomats say, stands to lose much from the crisis, whatever its outcome, the King seemed somber and strained.
 
'The Ghost of War'
 "The doors of reason and negotiation have been shut, leaving the ghost of war hovering over the Arab people and the Arab nation," he said.
"We stand with a clear conscience since I have done all I possibly can do to achieve a political settlement to the gulf crisis," he said.
The 15-minute address sought to stress national unity, reflecting the King's concern that conflict in the Persian Gulf, spreading into a wider war, would strain the frail assemblage of Palestinians and Jordanians that forms his country.
Jordan, the King said, had placed its armed forces on the highest state of alert. According to diplomats, the army has deployed to defensive positions overlooking the Jordan Valley facing Israel.
 
Makes No Direct Appeal
 The King made no direct appeal to President Saddam Hussein or to President George Bush to soften their policies.
"If forced to fight, we will fight fiercely," he said. "Our banners will remain high. Our country will remain secure. Our land and our honor will not be touched while we live."
The address was apparently intended to solidify the support the King has gained both by permitting a degree of democracy in his domestic politics and by tilting toward Iraq in his foreign policy.
The speech was evidently designed, too, to bring home to many people the gravity of the crisis. "We are now in the highest state of preparedness to face any situation," the King said.

Bluntly Put, Graft Is Rife: U.S. Envoy Speaks Out

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Jan. 15

 BODY:
The official corruption that is routine dinner-table talk in Argentina, but generally cannot be proved, has been thrust into banner headlines by a blunt accusation from the normally polite and circumspect American Ambassador.
In a letter made public last week, the Ambassador, Terence A. Todman, said Government officials had asked for "substantial payments" from Swift-Armour of Argentina to permit the company to import the machinery needed to build a $115 million meat processing plant. 
 Mr. Todman did not use the word bribe, but everyone knew that was what he was talking about.
President Carlos Saul Menem and his Government reacted with a mixture of anger and chagrin.
On the one hand, there were those who wondered privately why the puritanical gringos had to bring all of this out so directly instead of handling it quietly, in what is said to be the Japanese or European style.
 
Corruption 'Highly Developed'
 On the other hand, Foreign Minister Domingo Cavallo recognized in an interview published recently that corruption is "too highly developed in all of Argentine society." He said the Menem administration was committed to ending it in the Government but was hindered by unclear rules of the economic game, poor state organization, imprecise legislation and too much discretionary power in the hands of officials.
The Argentine press jumped on the story with gusto, first pointing the finger at one of the President's brothers-in-law, Emir Yoma, as the man who had withdrawn the Swift-Armour file from the Economy Ministry and was, therefore, in possession of the information necessary to offer to resolve the three-year-old request and demand a payment. Mr. Yoma denied the charge and threatened to sue for infamy.
Newspapers and magazines also began to focus on Mr. Menem's own flamboyant and expensive way of life and raised questions about the propriety of it.
The newspaper Pagina 12, which Mr. Menem accused of "journalistic delinquency" when it first broke the news of the Todman complaint, later reported that the red Ferrari 348 the President received in November as the gift of Italian businessmen friends was linked to ventures planned by those friends in Argentina, including four luxury hotels.
When the car was first noticed at the presidential palace in November the rumor went around that the President intended to donate it to a children's hospital, but when a television talk-show host asked Mr. Menem about that he denied such plans.
"It's mine, mine," he said. "They gave it to me. Why should I give it away?"
 
Envoy Not Usually Critical
 Ambassador Todman, a diplomat of long experience at high levels, including a stint as an Assistant Secretary of State, has normally been very supportive and optimistic toward the Menem administration in his year and a half in Argentina, particularly toward the effort to create a free-market economic system.
Even in background sessions with American journalists, he has seldom been critical of the Government, presenting an upbeat, protective attitude that differed from the style of his immediate predecessors and of American ambassadors in most other South American countries.
The fact that he went public with the reported bribe request to Swift-Armour and seven cases of reported bureaucratic roadblocks against American investments apparently reflected a growing frustration with the absence of response or action through other channels.
His letter to Economy Minister Erman Gonzalez, with "very urgent" written at the top, was dated Dec. 10, but no written response had yet been received when Pagina 12 carried the first report on it on Jan. 6.
A few days later, the Economy Minister issued a written response, which led the newspaper La Nacion to comment that Mr. Todman might have "a notion about time that is not very well understood here."
 
Good Relations With Embassy
 Pagina 12 never said how it obtained the original information on the complaint, which Mr. Todman later backed up with public statements. But despite its sometimes leftist tint, the irreverent tabloid is known to have good relations with the American Embassy staff, which appreciates the reputation for honesty and hard work of Pagina 12's reporters and the newspaper's tendency to back up its stories with lots of detail.
Swift-Armour's Argentine executives have been the most silent in the whole episode. After scheduling a news conference on Jan. 9, they canceled it and issued a statement saying their company had "not been the object of any Government pressure."
La Nacion characterized this as a decision "not to make waves." Mr. Gonzalez, the Economy Minister, said the Swift-Armour import request had, in fact, been approved, presumably after Mr. Todman's letter.
The other issues raised in Mr. Todman's letter -- involving a Ford subsidiary, Federal Express Corporation, Firestone, Goodyear and other companies -- did not allude specifically to bribes but generally complained of red tape and other hindrances.
Mr. Gonzalez, in his reply, denied any discrimination against American companies and said Mr. Todman's "legitimate interest" in supporting them "could lead to an indiscriminate belief in the reasonableness of all of the requests they make to the Argentine state."

HEADLINE: Loss of a Job Doesn't Keep Some From Aiding the Neediest

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ

 BODY:
Linda Winston, an unemployed New York City teacher, has been contributing to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund since her childhood, and her lack of a job this year was not going to change that.
In the midst of sending out resumes and looking into possible new careers, the 57-year-old reading and writing specialist, who has a doctorate in anthropology, sent $150 to the fund. 
 "If I had been working it would have been 10 times as large," she said in an interview yesterday. "I had decided that I was going to give even before The Times started running stories about the Neediest."
 
First Contribution Recalled
 Ms. Winston said that she had lived in Greenwich, Conn., for the last 20 years and that anyone who visited the city often could see how much worse things had become. She conceded that the times were trying for her right now, but said she would pull through.
"I just remember how thrilling my first contribution was years ago," she said. "It felt like being part of family -- it was as though I had sent a check to my grandfather to give money to poor people in the neighborhood. It's still very important to me."
The 79th annual appeal for the Neediest Cases opened in November and runs through February. The New York Times pays for the campaign's overhead, and the proceeds are distributed to seven charities to help the sick and the poor. More than 11,000 people and organizations have already contributed to this year's drive.
Many contributors mention their concerns about the recession, and some talk about how it has had a personal impact on their lives. Many contributions are accompanied by notes that mention salary cuts, layoffs and closed businesses.
 
Hurting but Grateful
 "Though one of the two of us is unemployed, we are neither homeless, hungry or loveless, and wish to contribute," wrote Betsy Lampl of Riverdale, the Bronx. She enclosed a check for $25.
Laura and William Ortiz of Mount Vernon, N.Y., wrote that they were having a "lean Christmas" this year because one of them was unemployed. But they considered themselves fortunate for having health, youth and confidence, and sent $15 to the fund in a "spirit of hope so that others may be benefited."
Another donor, Toby Spitz, has seen the income from her business, an executive recruiting concern, drop by 50 percent in the last two years, but she increased her donation $50 from last year. She gave $200 to the fund.
Mrs. Spitz said in an interview yesterday that she considered her circumstances quite good, compared with some of the lawyers for whom her company is trying to find work.
"Some of these people were earning salaries of more than $100,000," she said. "They'll eventually find a job, but it's still a very sudden change in circumstances and they've taken a very large dive."

HEADLINE: Recession Forces Sharp School Cuts

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

 BODY:
Squeezed by the tough financial times, the Gloria Floyd Elementary School in Dade County, Fla., has enlisted parents' help in a way it had never before done. The school asked them to contribute toilet paper, tissues and paper towels.
"Every little thing helps," said Andrea Rosenblatt, the principal. The school had already cut $50,000 from its budget this school year as part of districtwide reductions, keeping Ms. Rosenblatt from filling a vacancy for a kindergarten teacher. 
 As the recession has deepened, so have the fiscal worries for the nation's largest urban school systems. Projected tax revenue from a variety of sources is falling short of expectations. From New York to Houston to Los Angeles, schools are slashing already lean budgets and administrative staffs.
Others are trimming activities like music, art and athletics, scuttling overdue renovations or building programs and leaving teaching positions unfilled. In the worst cases, teachers have been cut. In Boston, 300 to 350 teachers were not rehired at the start of the school year.
 
Philadelphia Turns Down Heat
 "It's been absolutely devastating," said Constance Clayton, the School Superintendent in Philadelphia, where the school district started the year with a $25 million deficit. In one cost-cutting measure, the temperature was turned down to 68 degrees from 76 degrees in some schools, she said, a move that is expected to save about $3 million in the school year.
The recession has affected all schools, whether they are private or public, suburban or urban. But the largest urban systems have been hit more severely because of an array of costly programs for their disproportionately higher enrollments of poor, minority and immigrant children. Often such programs are required by the Federal or state government, which may provide some of the financing.
School systems have also been bedeviled by higher fuel and heating costs as a result of the Persian Gulf crisis, as well as the timing of the recession. By striking in midyear, the recession has put schools in the difficult spot of cutting services and programs while they are in operation.
"The problem is, these are not well-financed systems in the best of times," said Michael Casserly, assistant director of the Council of Great City Schools, an association of the nation's 47 largest school systems. "When they run into financial problems, they are having to cut well into the bone."
 
More Stability in Midwest
 Amid the financial calamity are some pockets of equilibrium. Chicago schools, for example, have not been forced to make any budget cuts this year. A spokeswoman said the Midwestern economy had not declined as sharply as the economies on both coasts, and added that Chicago schools were already operating in an austere fiscal environment.
In other places, the stepped-up support of businesses and parent groups has helped with a variety of assistance programs, including money, supplies, services and even personnel. In Los Angeles, parents have been recruited by some schools to serve as volunteer teacher aides.
But even these efforts cannot ease the fiscal stresses on the largest school systems. New York City's system, the nation's largest with 948,000 students, has had to trim $160 million from its $6.5 billion budget this year and is now looking at ways to cut another $90 million.
 
Administrative Cuts First
 Previous cuts have centered in the central office bureaucracy, where the 4,040-person staff will have been reduced to 3,600 by the end of the school year, said Jim Vlasto, a spokesman for the school board.
But the current $90 million in cuts ordered by the city, which finances the school system, has been hotly debated. Unless agreements on furloughs or delayed wage increases are reached with the school system's unions, the layoff of 4,000 teachers is likely, school officials say. Another consideration is the reduction of a $4.3 billion school construction and renovation program by 20 percent.
The situation is similarly grim in Dade County, which includes Miami and is the nation's fourth largest school system with 295,000 students. To offset declining state aid, the Dade County school system cut $16.7 million from its $1.6 billion budget last fall, and this winter it trimmed another $3.6 million.
The cuts were achieved by forcing schools to return part of their allocations from the district, inducing school personnel to take early retirement, instituting a hiring freeze and banning overtime.
"This has been the tightest budget crunch that I have had to face in the 12 years that I have been a principal," said Bonnie Wheatley, principal of the Pinecrest Elementary School, who expects to run out of copier paper and trash bags before the end of the school year. "I'm on a bare-bones budget this year."
 
Moving to Keep Teachers
 To keep her teaching staff intact, Mrs. Wheatley asked her Parent-Teacher Association to donate more proceeds from its fund-raising efforts. Revenue from a school supplies store run by the P.T.A., which had been used to buy teaching aids like computer programs, is now going into a special fund for recession emergencies.
"We are very anxious that she keep the academic staff intact," said Bobette Reeder, the Pinecrest P.T.A. president. "Our parents will do anything to keep that from happening."
With the combination of parental support and the consolidation or cuts of non-education personnel, districts have protected most classrooms and educational programs from budget cuts so far. In Philadelphia, administrators reduced their $25 million deficit by about 50 percent at midyear by cutting their administrative staff through attrition and consolidation.
But the longer the economic recession lasts -- and there is widespread disagreement in forecasting the slump's severity and duration -- the more likely it is that classrooms and teachers will be affected.
Philadelphia is already projecting a deficit of $22 million to $25 million for next year's school budget. "We'll make every effort to achieve non-direct classroom cuts," said Irvin Davis, managing director of the Philadelphia system, but he added, "I can't say today that I can accomplish that."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Biggest Quarterly Loss Is Expected at UAL

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 15

 BODY:
The UAL Corporation, parent of United Airlines and one of the nation's strongest carriers, said today that it expected to post the largest quarterly operating loss in its history.
UAL's chairman, Stephen M. Wolf, projected the loss in a letter to employees last week. He called the 1991 outlook "even more troubling," a company spokeswoman said. 
 UAL's 1990 fourth-quarter and year-end results are to be reported on Jan. 31.
UAL's largest previous loss was of $192 million in the second quarter of 1985. Analysts said that on an operating basis, the carrier is likely to lose $200 million to $250 million in the fourth quarter of 1990.
By informing employees of the expected loss, UAL is "trying to set the stage that times are tough," Paul Karos, an analyst at the First Boston Corporation, said. "It's going to get tough for everyone," he added.
Like other air carriers, United has been suffering from reduced traffic because of the weak economy while paying sharply higher fuel prices because of the conflict in the Persian Gulf.
Analysts have been predicting fourth-quarter losses for nearly all United States carriers except the Southwest Airlines Company and perhaps Alaska Air Group Inc. The fourth quarter is traditionally one of the industry's weakest because there is little vacation travel.
Over all, the industry is expected to lose an additional $1 billion in the first quarter of 1991, after a $2 billion hemorrhage for all of 1990. The 1990 red ink was more than twice as much as the industry had ever lost previously.
Despite the dismal fourth-quarter expectations, analysts said UAL would be profitable for 1990 as a whole, earning about $3 a share. UAL earned about $15 a share for all of 1989. UAL's stock slipped 75 cents today, to $113.25, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Thanks to a strong balance sheet and lucrative Pacific routes, United should weather 1991 better than other carriers, analysts said. They attributed that comparative strength mostly to the UAL's Pacific routes, which were augmented recently by the inauguration of a Chicago-Tokyo route. UAL said today that Japan has granted it the right to operate the new route until March 2. Last week, a cargo carrier dispute over slots at Narita Airport in Tokyo threatened to stall the flights.
But labor problems linger at United. Negotiations on the pilots' international agreement with the airline broke off Saturday without a resolution. Arbitration is scheduled to begin on Jan. 21.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Precious Metals End Lower In Light, Uncertain Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Precious metals prices moved in a narrow range yesterday before settling lower in light trading on New York's Commodity Exchange.
The market moved back and forth, said Peter Cardillo of Jesup, Josephthal & Company, on word of peace initiatives by the French and calls by Britain and the Soviet Union for a final appeal to the Iraqis to withdraw. 
 "The market is now in a wait-and-see attitude," Mr. Cardillo said.
Gold was $1.30 to $3.60 lower, with the active February contract down $1.40, to $400.20 an ounce; the January contract fell back below $400, to $398.80, off $1.30 from Monday's close.
Silver was 3.4 cents to 3.5 cents lower, with March at $4.222 an ounce.
Copper prices plunged on the Comex as threatened strikes in South America failed to occur, Mr. Cardillo said.
Also hurting copper was the faltering economy, particularly declining sales of new cars and a drop in new housing construction.
Copper was 1.50 cents to 3.75 cents lower, with January at $1.0865 a pound.
Frozen concentrated orange juice futures continued to rally following the release on Friday of the United States Agriculture Department's crop report. The department drastically reduced its estimate of the size of the California and Florida orange crops.
An analyst said expectations of a smaller Brazilian crop had given the market additional strength.
Frozen concentrated orange juice was 3.85 cents to 4.90 cents higher, with January at $1.250 a pound.
Grain and soybean futures were mostly higher in light trading on the Chicago Board of Trade.
"The funds had no choice but to trade," said William Biedermann, an analyst with Allendale Inc. in Chicago. "The general public was off to the side. They did not want to be involved at this time" in the market.
Soybean futures received help on ideas that they could serve as a hedge against the inflation that would result if war broke out, Mr. Biedermann said.
Wheat was 1/2 cent to 2 1/2 cents lower, with March at $2.46 1/4 a bushel; corn was 1 1/4 cents to 2 cents higher, with March at $2.34 3/4 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1 1/4 cents higher, with March at $1.12 1/2 a bushel; soybeans were 4 1/4 cents to 8 1/2 cents higher, with January at $5.56 1/2 a bushel.
Livestock futures were mixed and pork futures higher on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Live cattle were 0.40 cent lower to 0.05 cent higher, with February at 75.30 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 0.45 cent lower to 0.05 cent higher, with January at 87.22 cents a pound; hogs were 0.15 cent to 0.48 cent higher, with February at 51.10 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 0.85 cent to 1.18 cents higher, with February at 69.25 cents a pound.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Steady in a Slow Day As Traders Await Deadline

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was little changed in quiet trading yesterday as traders sat on the sidelines before the midnight war deadline, limiting their reactions to the most dramatic of Persian Gulf developments.
Currency traders shed their traditional hopes for a strengthening dollar in the nervous quiet that descended on markets. Several participants said they would prefer to see the dollar open lower today if it meant war had not broken out. 
 "Basically, people are afraid to take positions ahead of signs of war," said Thomas Palladino, currency trader for Oesterreichische Landerbank in New York. "There could be a big swing one way or the other."
Analysts said the one Middle East event that seemed to nudge the dollar higher was the failure of France's last-minute initiative to prevent war in the gulf. "There is a fatal moment where one must act," Prime Minister Michel Rocard told French lawmakers. "This moment has, alas, arrived -- after we have done everything to avoid it."
Traders said the dollar was slightly undermined by hopes that a last-minute diplomatic initiative was secretly taking place. The dollar, like gold, is considered a safe-harbor investment and generally increases in value during international turmoil.
Traders said they brushed aside several Persian Gulf developments that had they occurred last week might have prompted marked dollar swings. For example, the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, told reporters that a decision on starting an attack against Iraq was likely to come "sooner rather than later" after the midnight deadline. "That usually would make people buy," Mr. Palladino said.
 
Mark Strengthened
 But analysts said news that the German central bank would hold a meeting tomorrow strengthened the mark because of heightened prospects of higher German interest rates.
The dollar fell slightly against the mark in New York, closing at 1.5420 marks compared with late Monday's 1.5457.
"Clearly, the economic fundamentals are weighing against the dollar, but the background of war is superseding anything," said Ronald Holzer, chief dealer for the Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.9045 yesterday from $1.9050 late Monday. In New York, sterling fetched $1.9095, up from late Monday's $1.9035.
Tokyo markets were closed for a national holiday. In London, the dollar was quoted at 135.85 yen, while in New York it bought 135.73 yen, more than Monday's 135.15.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates, were: 1.2845 Swiss francs, up from 1.2823; 5.2420 French francs, up from 5.2390; 1,160.00 Italian lire, down from 1,161.25, and 1.1471 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1487.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Notes and Bonds Decline in Price

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The looming reality of war enveloped the credit markets yesterday, as prices of Treasury notes and bonds dipped after a report this afternoon that France had abandoned all hope that a peaceful resolution to the Persian Gulf crisis could be reached before midnight.
A new French peace initiative had been mentioned on Monday and again yesterday morning. However, at around 2:30 yesterday afternoon news service reports informed market participants that those efforts had been abandoned. That caused bond prices to dip by about 3/8 point. 
 The move into Treasury bills, meanwhile, continued yesterday, as interest rates on the short-term securities fell further.
Trading remained extremely light, as the United Nation's midnight deadline approached for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
"You can't do anything in a situation like this," said Joseph Liro, a senior vice president and money market economist at S.G. Warburg & Company. "You aren't talking about dealing with risk here; you are talking about absolute uncertainty."
 
Retail Sales Report
 Traders basically ignored a report showing that retail sales fell four-tenths of a percentage point in December, another number that confirmed the economy was very weak in the fourth quarter.
Reports expected today on industrial production and consumer prices will probably be summarily dismissed, traders and analysts said.
"As an economist, I will be interested to see the industrial production figures," said Nancy Kimelman, chief economist at Technical Data in Boston. "But this is such a politically driven market that not many other people will pay much attention."
A government bond trader said that "all we are doing is waiting," adding, "We are held hostage to the political situation, and there is nothing you can do about it."
Yesterday morning President Bush met for 30 minutes with his top economic advisers, including Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, to discuss what might happen in the economy in the event of war.
"They could have been discussing what would be least disruptive for the financial markets," the bond trader said.
Mr. Liro and others said the markets would be up to the challenge of an outbreak in hostilities.
"We are looking for a lot less reaction to the beginning of war than what happened in October of 1987," Mr. Liro said. "They were fast markets back then, but that is what you are here for. I would think the bond market is up to the task of maintaining an orderly situation."
 
30-Year Bond Offering

By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 103 7/8, down 11/32, to yield 8.39 percent, compared to 8.35 percent late Monday.
Among note issues, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 102, down 6/32, to yield 8.19 percent. And the 7 1/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 7/32, unchanged on the day, to yield 7.12 percent.
Demand continued strong in the short-term market, however.
In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 6.05 percent, down six basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates dipped by five basis points, to a late offered rate of 6.14 percent.
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, the City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power offered $150 million worth of securities at competitive bid.
A bid from an investor group led by Merrill Lynch & Company won the issue, which consists of serial bonds maturing from 1997 to 2011 and a term bond that matures in 2031.
The serial bonds were reoffered at yields from 6 percent in 1997 to 7 percent in 2011. The term bond was reoffered at a price to yield 7.23 percent.
The securities are rated AA by both Moody's Investors Service and by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In the secondary market for municipal bonds, traders said prices of most widely quoted issues dipped by 1/8 point to 1/4 point.
Participants in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds said that prices of most issues were unchanged in very light trading.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF: Changes at Home;
Amid the Grief and Worry, Life Will Go On as Before

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 15

 BODY:
Beyond casualty lists and the concern and disquietude that war inevitably brings, what would an outbreak of fighting in the Persian Gulf mean for the day-to-day routine of Americans on the home front?
While Government and business officials do not minimize the impact of war on the nation's psyche, they say that unless fighting in the gulf drags on for several months, most Americans will encounter little or no disruption. 
 During the first hours of conflict, the officials say, there may be a brief surge in demand for petroleum by concerned drivers and homeowners, some telephone lines may be jammed beyond capacity by panicky callers, unease could disrupt financial markets and delays could be long as airports step up anti-terrorist efforts.
But barring a war that drags on for months, which many military experts consider unlikely, there is little expectation that the home front will experience the kind of massive disruptions that occurred during World War II, or for that matter the considerably lesser disruptions of the Korean and Vietnam Wars.
 
Military Draft and Rationing
 "Things have gone very smoothly so far and we expect them to continue that way if all goes as planned," said Larry Wilson, a spokesman for the Defense Logistics Agency, the supply procurement arm of the Defense Department and a major player in the gulf buildup.
Government officials say they do not foresee a gulf conflict that would require resumption of the draft to replace fallen troops or to expand the armed forces, now made up entirely of volunteers. They also say no consideration is being given to rationing or price controls because war stockpiles are plentiful and there is enough flexibility in the country's industrial base to meet replenishment demands.
Since World War I, rationing and price controls have been major factors on the home front only in World War II. There were some economic restrictions during the Korean and Vietnam wars, but they had far less impact on the home front, especially during the Vietnam era, when the military buildup occurred gradually over a long period.
The military buildup in the gulf is the most rapid dispatch of a massive armed force this country, or any other country, has ever undertaken.
"And it's been done with almost no disruption anywhere on the civilian front," said Mr. Wilson. "We had a lot of stuff stockpiled that requires a long time to acquire from manufacturers and the country's economy has easily absorbed the demands we have otherwise been forced to make upon it. We don't foresee any shortages down the road unless something happens we haven't anticipated."
Should military shortages begin to occur, the Defense Department has the authority, under a Presidential order, to demand that manufacturers and other businesses meet military needs first and forgo filling contracts in the civilian sector. That power has not been exercised thus far in the Gulf crisis.
As for manpower, Federal officials say they could resume the draft, which ended in 1973, on a few days' notice because all men 18 years old and older are required by law to be registered with the Selective Service. But they say they expect no such notice, because they do not foresee losses of a magnitude that would create a need for involuntary inductions.
"We haven't even gotten an exploratory phone call from anybody at the Pentagon," said Lew Brodsky, an assistant director of the Selective Service. "More to the point, we haven't heard from anybody in Congress, and that's where approval would have to come from to resume any callups."
At the White House, officials say no thought has been given to imposing rationing or price controls.
 
Seeing No Need for Concern
 "Nobody around here thinks there is any need to think about such things at this point," said one economic specialist in the Bush Administration. "The only possible shortage might be oil, mainly if people panic and start stockpiling, and, anyway, if a real crunch comes we can always fall back on the strategic reserve we've stored away. Otherwise there's plenty of everything and enough slack in the economy to quickly replace whatever we use up. If you don't have shortages, you don't have rationing or price controls."
When the Pentagon decided to speed the flow of food to troops in the gulf by purchasing some standard brand supermarket items, among them microwaveable meals, manufacturers responded immediately by by stepping up production, averting shortages among civilians.
"We just put on an extra shift of people to get the job done," said Allan Krejci, an official for the Hormel Company, a major food processor. "If they want more, we'll provide it. There's plenty of production capacity."
Similarly, the nation's major airlines have been able to supply the Pentagon with all the wide-body planes it needs to ferry troops to the gulf. Officials say a few domestic flights have been canceled or delayed as a result, but they insist that enough planes have been available, and will be available in the future, to answer passenger demands, not only on the home front but also on the war front.

500 at Wang Face Layoffs

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOWELL, Mass., Jan. 15

 BODY:
In the latest item of bad news for New England's high-technology industry, Wang Laboratories Inc., said yesterday that it would be laying off 500 workers in the next three weeks.
 Richard W. Miller, Wang's president and chief executive, informed employees of the layoffs in a memo. He said that despite significant progress in fixing internal business affairs "to the point of achieving a modest profit in the Sept. 30 fiscal quarter" and the repayment of a $575 million bank group debt, "severe new external challenges have emerged in the form of an economic recession and threats to world peace."
 Since June 30, 1989, Wang has laid off more than 10,000 workers and now has a worldwide employee total of 19,000. Under Mr. Miller, the company has concentrated on cutting costs and on the emerging area of image processing. It reported a profit in the first quarter of the 1991 fiscal year. Second-quarter results are due out next week.
A Wang spokeswoman said that the cost of the layoffs would be charged against income in the third quarter.
 Wang's class B shares were unchanged today at $2.375 on the American Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Panel Is Asked to Punish 3 Senators

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 15

 BODY:
Declaring to the Senate Ethics Committee that the "political heart and soul of this country" was at stake, the panel's special counsel made an impassioned case today that three Senators should be punished for their dealings with the savings and loan executive Charles H. Keating Jr.
In his closing arguments at the longest public hearings into the conduct of members of Congress, the counsel, Robert S. Bennett, portrayed Senators Alan Cranston and Dennis DeConcini as crass politicians who had done favors for Mr. Keating's savings and loan association because he was a big contributor to their political efforts. 
And several times he bluntly suggested that Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr. had perjured himself before the committee, which he characterized as the lawmaker's most striking impropriety.
Mr. Bennett depicted the two other Senators in the case, John McCain and John Glenn, as admirably breaking off their ties with Mr. Keating when it became clear that his own conduct was in doubt.
The counsel had been instructed by the panel to set out no conclusions about how the members should act. But he left no doubt that he believed Senators Cranston, DeConcini and Riegle should be punished and that Senators McCain and Glenn should be cleared.
 
Options for the Committee
 Besides clearing any of the lawmakers, the panel could vote to send them letters of reprimand criticizing their behavior. Or it could take the more serious step of recommending that the full Senate vote to condemn the Senators' actions. It could also advise the Senate to expel any of the members, but that is considered the least likely outcome.
On the eve of a possible war in the Persian Gulf, Mr. Bennett appealed to the committee not to lose sight of the case's significance. "We're talking about ethics when our nation could be at war, literally, in a matter of hours," he declared late this afternoon.
Reciting the possiblility of war, a recession and other troubles facing the nation, Mr. Bennett looked directly at members of the panel and said: "In comparison to these crises, some may say that ethics is unimportant. But I say to you: To accept this conclusion would be a terrible mistake, because with an economy in trouble and war hanging over our heads, it is all the more important that the American people have confidence in you and your ability to judge your peers and reach an honorable and definite decision."
Peppering his summation with highlights of 25 days of testimony, Mr. Bennett outlined his case that three Senators violated clear standards of conduct in intervening with Federal regulators on behalf of Mr. Keating. Mr. Bennett rejected earlier arguments from the five Senators that they had violated no specific rules because there were none that addressed such actions as contacting Federal regulators on behalf of Mr. Keating's failing Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif.
 
Keating Facing Charges
 The counsel argued, for instance, that Senator McCain, an Arizona Republican, and Senator Glenn, an Ohio Democrat, followed appropriate standards in knowing when to cut off contacts. "Mr. Keating called Mr. McCain a wimp," Mr. Bennett said, because he did not follow "the Keating agenda to get the bank board off his back."
Lincoln was seized by the Federal Government in 1989 at a loss of more than $2 billion to taxpayers. Mr. Keating is facing fraud charges in California. He or his associates had donated a total of $1.3 million to the five Senators or their causes.
Since the hearing's opening on Nov. 15, the five Senators or their lawyers repeatedly argued that they were treating Mr. Keating as they would have any other constituent, and they denied they were rewarding him for his contributions.
Closing arguments for the five Senators are scheduled before the committee on Wednesday. Then the panel of three Republicans and three Democrats will deliberate in closed session, possibly for several days, on the fate of their peers.
Mr. Glenn was the only of the five Senators who sat in the cavernous Senate Hart Office Building's hearing room to hear Mr. Bennett, and he stayed mostly to hear the summation of his involvment.
In a calm, measured voice, Mr. Bennett offered example after example of how the Senators acted behind the scenes to help Mr. Keating. He said the case of Mr. Cranston, a California Democrat, stood out because of the striking relationship between donations from Mr. Keating and efforts by the Senator to help him.
 
Contributions and Requests
 "This pattern of coupling large contributions from Mr. Keating with requests for action was repeated on four occasions," Mr. Bennett said. Even after he learned that the regulators were recommending that the Justice Department investigate Lincoln for criminal misconduct, the counsel asserted, Mr. Cranston personally contacted Federal regulators at least 12 times on behalf of Lincoln.
Mr. Bennett said that Mr. DeConcini, an Arizona Democrat, also pressed regulators to help Lincoln long after he was told of the criminal referral. He described how Mr. DeConcini took a leading role in advocating Lincoln's case in two meetings between the Senators and Federal regulators in April 1987.
The counsel suggested that Mr. DeConcini "ignored all the red flags" in continuing to help Lincoln.
And in his most pointed comments about Mr. Riegle, a Michigan Democrat, Mr. Bennett strongly suggested that the lawmaker perjured himself before the committee more than once. He cited other witnesses who contradicted Mr. Riegle's testimony that he had no role in arranging the first meeting with regulators, and who also disputed his contention that meetings with Mr. Keating during a trip to Phoenix had anything to do with raising money.
"If you were to determine that Senator Riegle was not honest with you, was intentionally not honest with you," he told the committee, "then I think this committee has to act on that." Mr. Bennett made clear that he was as troubled with the Senator's performance before the committee as he was with his dealings with Mr. Keating.
 
Facing Responsibility
 While he told committee members that he knew of the pressures they faced in judging their fellow Senators, he implored them to step up to their responsibility.
"A case like this breaks the rhythm of the Senate," he said. "You're really uncomfortable with this, as you should be."
Still, Mr. Bennett reminded the lawmakers: "You are holding in your collective hands the heart, the political heart and soul of this country. And whatever decision you make, this institution is going to be stronger or weaker."
Urging them to think about the American public, not just their fellow Senators, Mr. Bennett said: "These are your friends, you know each others families, you legislate with each other, you need each other, you raise funds for each other, you help each other in their campaigns." He went on to remind them that after they act, "The American people are going to either have more or less respect for this institution."
 
Bitter Exchange Between Lawyers
 As evidence of what may lie ahead as the committee deliberates, Mr. Bennett earlier today engaged in a bitter, personal exchange with James Hamilton, Mr. DeConcini's lawyer. Mr. Hamilton sought to introduce affidavits from two former United States Attorneys who questioned whether Mr. Bennett was acting too much like a prosecutor.
The committee voted not to accept the documents, saying they were not germane to the case. Once that happened, Mr. Hamilton told the panel, "If this matter goes to the floor, Mr. Bennett's conduct is going to be an issue."
Mr. Bennett angrily shot back that "the not-so-subtle threat to this committee is an outrage." He told committee members: "You should be offended by it. Senator DeConcini is simply trying to burn the messenger, to discredit me, and it will not work. I will not be intimidated by such obvious tactics."
Senator Jesse Helms, a North Carlina Republican, and one of the panel members defended Mr. Bennett, said to Mr. Hamilton: "Special counsel Bennett will not be a villain in this piece. If you want to take it to the floor and you can, we'll see you on the floor of the United States Senate."

HEADLINE: New Boom Hits Suburbs: Evictions and Foreclosures

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 15

 BODY:
Evictions for nonpayment of rent and mortgage foreclosures are increasing rapidly in New Jersey, Connecticut and New York. More middle-class tenants and homeowners, pressed by rising unemployment and large mortgages, are joining low- and moderate-income families for whom finding affordable shelter has long been a struggle.
The largest increases have been in New Jersey, which had the biggest housing boom in the 1980's in the New York metropolitan region. Economists say that even during the recession years a decade ago, building permits were being issued at a rate 25 percent above the national average. This, they say, led to overselling to some underqualified buyers, who are now unable to make their payments. 
 Sue McElroy, a state field worker in affluent Bergen County who counsels families worried about becoming homeless, sees a new population at risk. "I had my first two Ph.D.'s the other day," she said. "These are people who never expected to be in this position, and they're reticent about seeking help from government," she said. The number of eviction actions filed in New Jersey last year was 163,994, a 25.8 percent increase from 130,383 in 1986, according to the Administrative Office of the Courts. Mortgage foreclosures more than doubled in two years, reaching 17,715 last year, up from 11,816 in 1989 and 8,812 in 1988.
 
Even in Bedroom Communities
 Some of the biggest percentage increases in landlord-tenant disputes over the last five years have occurred in affluent bedroom counties like Monmouth, with a 42 percent increase, and Bergen, with 31 percent.
While the large urban counties still have the largest number of eviction cases, the rates of increase in court activity are smaller. Essex has had a 24 percent increase; Hudson, 14 percent, and Camden, 11 percent.
In Bergen County, where housing costs are 8 to 10 percent higher than in the rest of the state, Ms. McElroy said some potential clients were living in $1,200-a-month apartments that they could no longer afford because one or more family members had lost a job or were earning less money.
"We try to find them an apartment for $700 to $800, but we also recommend they immediately seek financial counseling," said Ms. McElroy, who works for the state's Homelessness Prevention Program. "They have to realize they can no longer afford that $300-a-month car payment, dinners out in restaurants or that Visa card.
"It is this downturn in their life style that causes the most distress, the most emotional upset and the greatest anxiety. They just can't believe it."
Eviction notices went to 8,132 tenants in Bergen last year, compared with 6,278 in 1988 and 6,228 in 1986. Foreclosures rose to 772 in 1989, compared with 518 the year before.
Through the first nine months of 1990 the foreclosure rate in New Jersey stood at 1.11 percent of the outstanding mortgages in the state, compared with 0.80 percent in 1989, according to the American Bankers Association.
In Connecticut the 1990 rate was 0.71 percent, compared with 0.27 in 1989, and in New York it was 0.69 percent, compared with 0.54 the previous year.
The only Northeastern state with a higher rate was Pennsylvania, with a rate of 1.21 percent for the first nine months of 1990.
 
'Traced Back to the Good Times'
 "That's really quite high," Rae D. Rosen, vice president of the Federal Home Loan Bank, said of the New Jersey figures.
"It can probably be traced back to the good times in the mid-1980's when employment was high and more women were entering the work force," she said. "Couples bought homes and were fully mortgaged up to their two-income level. When one of them lost a job they were unable to make the payments."
Myron Weinstein, chief of the Office of Foreclosure for the New Jersey courts, said, "Even in the recession years of 1981 and '82 the volume of mortgage foreclosures was half of what it is now, and at that time the mortgage rate on loans was 18 percent."
Interest rates are lower today, but because of the soaring cost of housing in the middle 1980's, monthly mortgage payments for new buyers are often far larger than a decade ago.
 
Harder to Find Buyers
 Ms. Rosen said another problem was the adjustable-rate mortgages popular in the mid-1980's, which allowed buyers to qualify for mortgages with artifically low first-year payments. When rates rose the next year, many families were already fully extended.
Families trying to sell a house they can no longer afford are also running into a tight lending market for buyers. If potential buyers have trouble getting mortgages, families in trouble have a harder time selling and staving off foreclosure.
Homes lost through foreclosure are offered through sheriffs' sales in the 21 counties. In Monmouth County where sales are scheduled every Monday, the Sheriff's office sold 258 homes in 1990, compared with 117 the year before.
Lately, however, the sales have been producing little revenue. "There aren't any bidders," said Sheriff William M. Lanzaro. "People used to make a living buying homes at sheriff's sales and re-selling them, but banks have stopped lending money, so everyone's scared and nobody's taking a chance."
 
Holding On in Monmouth
 With its shore resorts and farmland, Monmouth became one of the fastest-growing counties in New Jersey starting in the late 1950's. People who moved in during the height of the 1980's boom are finding it difficult to hold on to their homes and life styles.
There were 1,005 mortgage foreclosures in Monmouth in 1989, up from 533 in 1988. The number of eviction actions in 1990 was 7,899, compared with 6,755 in 1988 and 5,566 in 1986.
Dorothy Hartman, the liaison between the courts and the Monmouth County Board of Social Services, said, "My desk is a good indication of the state's economy." Mrs. Hartman's telephone number is on every eviction notice, and when her workload piles up the economy is in trouble, she said.
On Fridays, Mrs. Hartman and her assistant, Sally Waters, each wearing yellow outfits, walk the hall outside the landlord-tenant court in Freehold. "We're known as the Ladies in Yellow," she said. "It's an easy way for the tenants to spot us."
 
Deals in the Corridor
 During the time Judge Lawrence M. Lawson gives tenants and landlords to try to settle their disputes in the corridor, Mrs. Hartman and Mrs. Waters go to work. They identify tenants who may be eligible for public assistance, food stamps or rent subsidies. They try to make deals. Often a landlord agrees to an extension, even if only for a few days, to let Mrs. Hartman try to find some money for the tenant.
On a recent day, she was able to help Theresa Clark, a 21-year-old mother of two small children, who takes home $828 a month from her job in a bank's credit department and pays $525 for an apartment in Asbury Park. "I had to buy some things for the kids and couldn't make the rent payment," she said. Mrs. Hartman found that she was eligible for $1,000 in food stamps.
"The landlord was good," Mrs. Hartman said. "He agreed to accept a voucher for the back rent."
While Ms. Clark was helped, James Sheridan of Middletown, a 34-year-old father of five, was not. Mr. Sheridan, who received a medical discharge from the Navy, lost his job as a movie theater manager in October.
The loss of income added such stress to his marriage, he said, that he and his wife have separated. In December he could not meet his $1,000 rent. Because of a legal dispute over his marital problems, Mr. Sheridan said he could not receive any public assistance.
"I don't want my family out on the street, even though I'm no longer living there," he said.

HEADLINE: Bergen's Budget Plan Calls for 317 Layoffs

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HACKENSACK, N.J., Jan. 15

 BODY:
Bergen County's newly elected Executive, William Schuber, today proposed a $338.3 million budget that calls for dismissal of 317 of the county's 5,175 workers and a half-cent increase in the county property-tax rate.
The budget represents a 3.9 percent spending increase, the smallest since Bergen adopted the executive style of government in 1986. Property-tax revenue would be $206.5 million, up from $195.6 million in 1990, Mr. Schuber said. He proposed a county tax rate of 24.3 cents per $100 of assessed valuation, up from 23.8 cents last year. 
 The layoffs come on top of a loss of 260 county jobs through attrition.
Other proposed economies included reduction of the county's car fleet, 15 percent cuts in county grants to nonprofit and community-based groups, and program trims in the Departments of Human Services, Health and Public Works. He also proposed raising $1 million by increasing fees by $4 at golf courses run by the county, charging admission for the first time at the county zoo and increasing tuition at a school for licensed practical nurses at the county's hospital, Bergen Pines.
At the same time, Mr. Schuber proposed a 30.3 percent spending increase, to $747,073, for his office.

HEADLINE: SOVIET CRACKDOWN: The Kremlin;
MOSCOW APPOINTS FOREIGN MINISTER

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 15

 BODY:
Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh, the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, succeeded Eduard A. Shevardnadze as Foreign Minister today and pledged to maintain good relations and cooperate with the West despite the crackdown in Lithuania.
Mr. Bessmertnykh, a 57-year-old career diplomat and longtime American expert who has spent much of his career in Washington, is well known to senior American officials and to President Bush. Mr. Bush has not yet said whether he would postpone a Feb. 11-13 summit meeting in Moscow with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev because of the crises in the Baltic republics and the Persian Gulf, but the Soviet side clearly wants it to go ahead. 
 By submitting his nomination to the standing Soviet legislature today, Mr. Gorbachev was apparently signaling a desire for continued cooperation with both the United States and Western Europe despite the Soviet leadership's turn to the military and a hard line in the Baltic republics.
"The latest events in the Baltics will inevitably affect our policy," Mr. Bessmertnykh said at a brief news conference after winning an overwhelming vote of confirmation. "We must work out ways to prevent and avoid such things, having in mind their foreign policy aspects as well," he said. But he added, "Statesmen, especially in major countries, should pursue a considered policy."
 
Prospect of War Assessed
Speaking of the prospect of war in the gulf, Mr. Bessmertnykh said, "I don't think that the chances for a peaceful solution of the problem have been lost finally." But a Foreign Ministry spokesman later said there was "not much solid reason for hope." The Soviet Union has withdrawn all but 235 of its citizens from Iraq.
The Soviet Union has supported the United States in the gulf crisis, endorsing the use of force if necessary to get Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, but has placed more emphasis than the United States on the need to exhaust every opportunity for a political solution first.
An interview today in Komsomolskaya Pravda, Yevgeny M. Primakov, an adviser to Mr. Gorbachev thought to have been in the running for the Foreign Ministry post, suggested that the Soviet policy might come under strain if the United States goes to war. Mr. Primakov said that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq had told him that he knew he would have to withdraw someday, but that he needed to save face.
A statement by the Foreign Ministry blamed Iraq's "stubborness" and "failure to comply with the norms of international behavior" for the crisis, and said the Soviet Union would support "any constructive steps aimed at preventing armed conflict in the Persian Gulf," possibly including a French initiative at the United Nations today.
The crisis caused by Iraq's refusal to withdraw from Kuwait by today, the deadline set by the United Nations Security Council in November, was also discussed by Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Belonogov and the United States Ambassador, Jack F. Matlock, on Tuesday, Mr. Churkin said.
 
U.S. Opposes Linkage
The United States opposes linkage in the French proposal between the crisis in the gulf and the Palestinian problem. Mr. Primakov, who tried unsuccessfully last year to persuade Mr. Hussein to withdraw, said that linkage was unavoidable and that the Iraqi leader knew that the Soviet Union's attitude was not identical with that of the United States.
Mr. Bessmertnykh told the Soviet legislators that Mr. Shevardnadze's surprise resignation last month in protest against what he called approaching dictatorship had allayed his pleasure in being nominated for the job.
Mr. Gorbachev also renominated Boris Pugo, the Minister of the Interior who justified the crackdown in Lithuania on Monday, to the equivalent post in his new presidential cabinet, and got the legislature's swift approval.
A Soviet Communist Party official said last week that Mr. Gorbachev had turned to the police and the army for political support because his policy of economic reform was in danger of collapsing in the general disorder.
 
Praise From Gorbachev
 Nominating Mr. Bessmertnykh, Mr. Gorbachev described him as a "great professional, a person of broad views, refined culture and modesty," and said he had great respect for him.
Mr. Shevardnadze, until his resignation, was a soulmate from the earliest days of Mr. Gorbachev's struggle to set the Soviet Union on a new course, and he implied in his resignation speech that he thought his leader was backsliding.
Mr. Shevardnadze will try to continue to influence Soviet foreign policy outside official channels, the ministry's spokesman said, and a diplomat close to him here said he had a Western-style think tank in mind.
Mr. Gorbachev's evident turn to the Soviet internal police and the army and the wide latitude he apparently gave them to act in the Baltic republics have raised questions about how much influence the Foreign Ministry has, and indeed whether the President is fully in charge of his domestic policy.
Soviet troops rolled into Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, on Sunday morning at the request of a Communist-dominated Committee of National Salvation that was to have taken over power from the separatist elected Parliament, according to messages broadcast with the army's help throughout Vilnius that day, but since the deaths of 15 people in the crackdown, the republic's Parliament has neither been dissolved nor occupied by the army.
Following Mr. Gorbachev's lead Monday, the Foreign Ministry's spokesman, Vitaly Churkin, said today, "We need law and order," but he added that the Soviet leadership was intent on finding a political settlement to the dispute over Baltic independence.
"In political life there are sometimes moments we face where we have to choose not between good and bad, but between bad and worse," Mr. Churkin said, offering this as his personal opinion, not an official one.
But he referred detailed questions as to why the troops had opened fire to the Interior Ministry or the military.
Mr. Churkin also said today that foreign correspondents accredited to the ministry remained free to travel to Lithuania and the other Baltic republics, as long as they followed prescribed procedures.

HEADLINE: Demand Soars For Gold Coins

 BODY:
The United States Mint said yesterday that sales of its American Eagle bullion gold coin had skyrocketed yesterday and Monday. Analysts say fears about the possibility of war in the Middle East had caused demand to soar.
Laura Johnston, a spokeswoman for the Mint, said 31,000 ounces of the gold coins were sold between Monday afternoon and yesterday afternoon. By comparison, 33,000 ounces were sold in all of December. So far this month, 48,000 ounces of the bullion coins have been sold, Ms. Johnston said.
Demand for the coins, which trade at a small premium over the market price for bullion itself, has been falling in recent years. And sales remained sluggish last year until the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
"We have seen in the last week a really dramatic increase in gold Eagle sales as a direct result of the activities in the Middle East," said Rick D. Lawson, vice president of the Rhode Island Hospital Trust National Bank, a commercial bank subsidiary of the Bank of Boston, an authorized distributor of the American Eagle gold and silver coins.
He added, "Gold is seen as a safe haven in times of economic or political upheaval."

HEADLINE: Sales of U.S.-Made Vehicles Down 31.4% in Early January

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 15

 BODY:
Paralyzed by consumers' uncertainties about a weak economy and the prospect of war, sales of cars and trucks made in the United States were mired at recessionary levels in early January.
Sales of all types of vehicles for the Jan. 1 through Jan. 10 period fell 31.4 percent compared with early January of last year. Both periods contained eight selling days. 
 The current figures look especially dismal because they compare with a period last year when auto makers were slashing prices to clear backlogs of unsold vehicles and sales were very strong.
The 10 manufacturers with United States plants sold approximately 110,500 cars in the period this year, down 30.4 percent from last year's sales of 158,800 in early January. On a seasonally adjusted basis, cars sold at an annual rate of 5.8 million, compared with 8.5 million during the same period last year. The rate for December was 6.7 million; for the last 60 days, it was 6.5 million.
Sales of light trucks -- pickup trucks, mini-vans and four-wheel-drive vehicles -- which account for about one-third of all vehicles sold in the United States, fell 33 percent, to 67,987.
The approach of the Jan. 15 deadline for a possible military confrontation in the Persian Gulf had a withering effect on consumer confidence, dealers reported.
"As this day has drawn near, people have been reluctant to even visit car showrooms," said Jack Simmons, general manager of Orange Buick in Orlando, Fla. While used-car sales have been excellent, Mr. Simmons said, sales of new cars have fallen 10 to 15 percent since November.
Some industry analysts suggested that an outbreak of hostilities in the Persian Gulf might have a salutary effect on vehicle sales by removing some of the uncertainty that hangs over prospective buyers.
"We feel consumer psychology is as much of a factor as the consumer's pocketbook," said Tom Webb, an economist for the National Automobile Dealers' Association in McLean, Va. "Even the outbreak of war might improve the situation slightly, if it appeared the war was going to be short and there was an end in sight."
Others were less sanguine. "It's all a big mystery when the market will improve," said Joel Pitcoff, a market analyst for the Ford Motor Company. "We've got our fingers crossed."
The sales totals for the 1991 period include an estimate of the number of vehicles sold by the Chrysler Corporation -- 13,200 domestically produced cars, down 35.2 percent, and 12,540 light trucks, a drop of 53.5 percent. Chrysler reports sales only at the end of each month. The estimate was provided by Ward's Automotive Reports, an industry newsletter.
 
Sales of Imports
 Several auto makers also reported their sales in the United States of imported vehicles. The Toyota Motor Corporation sold 6,103 imported cars in early January, down 2.5 percent, and 4,144 imported light trucks, up 22.2 percent. The Honda Motor Company's sales of imported cars rose 17.4 percent, to 5,853 cars.
The General Motors Corporation sold 2,448 imported cars, down 42.7 percent, while Ford's import sales fell 45.4 percent, to 1,030 cars.
Japanese car makers reported a collective decline of 1.8 percent in sales of cars produced at their United States plants. Sales of light trucks made at the so-called transplants more than doubled during the period.
The Big Three American auto makers posted an overall decline of 32.9 percent in sales of domestically produced cars and a drop of 34.7 percent in sales of light trucks.
General Motors sold 55,182 domestically produced cars in early January, a decline of 27.8 percent. G.M.'s light-truck sales fell 26 percent, to 30,145 units.
Ford's car sales fell 39.9 percent, to 29,680. Ford sold 23,059 light trucks during the period, a decline of 29.8 percent.
Honda sold 5,674 cars made at its plant in Marysville, Ohio, an increase of 2.6 percent over the period last year.
Toyota's sales of cars made at United States factories fell 35.4 percent, to 2,663 cars.
The Nissan Motor Company sold 1,770 cars, nearly double the number it sold last year, and 1,924 light trucks, more than double last year's level. Both vehicles are manufactured at Nissan's assembly plant in Smyrna, Tenn.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Already in Position for War

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
On the day of the deadline for Iraq to leave Kuwait, traders, dealers and fund managers in markets from equities to foreign exchange said they hoped they were ready for war, which most of them now expected.
Currency positions were hedged. Warrants and puts were bought to protect postions in the stock market. Mutual funds that considered cash a haven had sold stocks. And bond investors who wanted to be conservative had already moved to shorter maturities. 
 "I do think it would have been a pretty sleepy investor to not be aware of the possibility of a war," said Alistair Ross Goobey, chief international strategist at James Capel Ltd. in London. "Most of the people we talk too have taken their positions."
But through all the war talk, these same traders, fund managers and analysts generally adhered to their longer-term views of how to invest this spring and later in the year. They tried to look beyond a war, which they hope is quick.
 
A Short-Term Situation
 "We could have sold all our bonds and gone to cash if we thought the world was coming to an end," said Gordon Johns, managing director of Kemper Investment Management Company Ltd. in London. "But we still have a view of bonds that is long-term bullish. What we have at the moment is a short-term technical situation. From an investment point of view that is what it is."
Wall Street people tended to agree with Mr. Johns on how to play the eve of war.
"The best thing you can do today in this atmosphere is do nothing," he said. After a war begins there are some who will jump in for bargains and others who will wait, not willing to take the risk in what could be very volatile markets.
What many investors and fund managers sought right now was a position that would protect them if the onset of hostilities shook the markets. This means, for example, protection through hedges against a quick rally in the dollar. Or this could mean a move to bonds with shorter maturities, which should be less volatile in the confusion that the war will immediately generate.
 
Demand for T-Bills Soars
 Many investors apparently made such a move on Monday. The demand for three-month Treasury bills at the weekly auction was so heavy that the average discount rate of 6.12 percent fell to its lowest level in almost three years. The demand was also high for six-month Treasury bills.,
Richard E. Witten, partner for foreign exchange at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said Goldman's trading lately had not been to take positions but to manage risk. It was intended to protect the firm against wide swings in currency values. With a war, the dollar, which has fallen sharply in the last seven months, could rise sharply.
Some managers think the beginning of war will end the uncertainity that has dominated financial markets for months. But Mr. Witten said that the war will "just create other uncertainities."
But many investors and fund managers also want to be positioned to exploit a rally in markets around the world if a war is quick and successful. The markets will likely move so fast, this strategy requires having cash ready. And it also means being willing to buy stocks or bonds if the market falls sharply at the first shots in the Middle East.
 
A Risk on the Upside
 Mr. Ross Goobey is ready for this second strategy. "If there is not a prolonged war, the risk in the stock markets is more on the upside," he said.
Nimrod Fachler, managing director at Mitchell Hutchins, said he would do nothing if war began. He said he would move only when he was able to conclude "that the war will be successful -- then I am going to buy stocks selectively in Euorpe and lengthen the bond maturities."
In the oil market, Peter C. Beutel, energy director at Pegasus Econometric Group in New Jersey, said he was recommending that his clients just basically hedge their positions so they can stay out of the market just after a war begins. "At this time our biggest concern is to play defense," he said.
Only in the gold market yesterday did there seem to be some last-minute postioning for the likelihood of a war in the Persian Gulf. Ian C. MacDonald, manager of precious metals at Credit Suisse in New York, said there was "fresh demand from the Middle East." Gold breached the $400 level yesterday but closed at $398.80, which still leaves it about $25 below where it was about a year ago.
He said that given the false starts in the last year with gold rallies, he would be cautious about buying. He said that heavy sellng by gold producers, which he has been seeing, could limit the gains for gold, which could also fall sharply if a quick victory against Iraq was won.

HEADLINE: MARKET PLACE;
Initial Days of a War May Not Hurt Stocks

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
The initiation of wars has caused some of the most dramatic plunges in stock market history. Unexpected events often shock markets, and wars have been among the most surprising.
But a Middle East war, if it does occur soon, could provoke little reaction initially, simply because it is so widely expected. However, if the war goes badly, as happened in the early months of World War II, initial complacency could be replaced by panic. 
 While many wars have begun with quick selloffs in stocks, the pattern has not been uniform. For example, recent American invasions, of Grenada in 1983 and of Panama in 1989, both ended quickly and had little market impact. There was some surprise at the beginnings of the invasions, especially in Grenada, but neither conflict seemed likely to be important in the long run.
But if it is the long-term impact of a war that is most important to investors, figuring out what that will be can be very difficult. At the beginning of both World War I and the 1973 Middle East conflict, investors badly misread the market implications.
"When there is a reaction in the stock market, it is often wrong," Laszlo Birinyi, a market analyst at Birinyi Associates, said after looking at past market reactions to invasions. "It proves again what Mr. Keynes said, that there is nothing more difficult than a rational investment policy in an irrational world."
A classic case of investor confusion was seen at the start of World War I in 1914. After the Dow Jones industrial average fell 9.67 percent in two trading days following the first declaration of war on July 28, the New York Stock Exchange was closed from Aug. 1 until Dec. 12. But the initial part of the war proved a boon to American business, and prices soared in 1915.
Prices plunged in 1917, however, after Germany began attacking American shipping, presaging American involvement in the war. The actual American declaration of war on April 6, 1917 was anticipated and had only a brief effect on the market.
By the time World War II began with Germany's invasion of Poland on Sept. 1, 1939, American investors had sniffed profits, and within a week, the Dow was up 11.63 percent. By the next spring, however, the Dow fell 15.5 percent in a week as German troops swept through France. Not until the stock market crash in 1987 were investors to suffer a larger percentage drop in one week.
There was another selloff after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, when the Dow lost 5.03 percent in the week following the attack on Dec. 7, 1941.
The Korean War also served as a shock to investors, and Dow stocks lost 4.65 percent of their value in the week following the news of the invasion of South Korea by North Korea on June 25, 1950. But the effect was short-lived, and by September the Dow had recovered all its losses.
 In Mideast confrontations, the market reactions have moved every way. There was little reaction to the Suez crisis in 1956, when France and Britain tried to keep Egypt from controlling the Suez Canal. After the start of the Arab-Israeli war on June 5, 1967, the Dow dropped 1.81 percent on the first day of trading. But almost all of that loss was made up the next day, and the war proved to be a non-event for the stock market in the long term.
With that history in mind, investors reacted with equanimity to the next Arab-Israeli war, which began on Oct. 6, 1973. The Dow actually rose the next session. In that case, however, the confidence was misplaced: The war led to the Arab oil embargo, to sharply higher oil prices, and to a severe recession that sent stock prices plunging. Dow stocks lost 39.81 percent of their value in the year after the conflict began.
 It was that experience that colored the market's reaction to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, and the rise in oil prices that followed it. The Dow is down 14.1 percent since the invasion on Aug. 2, 1990, with a 5.3 percent drop so far this month, as the United Nations deadline of Jan. 15 for President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to order a withdrawal from Kuwait approached. Much of the recent decline came on extraordinarily low volume, as investors reacted by taking positions and then waiting
"There is a fair amount of defensive posturing among investors, assuming the worst," Robert Farrell, Merrill Lynch's chief market analyst, said yesterday. "It seems to me that if a shooting war starts, the market could rally, not because it is good news, but because it is an uncertainty resolved. If there is the unexpected, where Saddam Hussein agrees to pull out, then I think you also get a rally, and maybe a bigger one."
But while a war may have been anticipated and discounted by investors, it is likely that most investors expect any war to be short and end in a decisive American victory. Signs of a prolonged war, or word of Iraqi battlefield victories, could send prices reeling.
The Vietnam War was probably more important than the Korean War in terms of long-term impact on the nation and on the stock market. President Lyndon B. Johnson's unwillingness to pay for the war by cutting social programs helped set off inflation and bring on the 1970 recession.
But Vietnam was a war that had little in the way of immediate market impact, as it grew without any obvious beginning. Neither the Tonkin Gulf incident on Aug. 2, 1964, in which North Vietnam was said to have attacked American ships, nor the Tet offensive the began on Jan. 30, 1968, in which Communist troops attacked Saigon, had much impact on the market, although each event dominated the news at the time.
The long-term impact of this war, if it comes, will be similarly hard to evaluate. Already, it is exacerbating a budget deficit that was severe, and it could lead to a significant change in America's role in the world. But it is unlikely that the start of the war will lead to sharp changes in investor perceptions.
"Back last fall, when war was a possibility but not deemed imminent, we hazarded the guess that if war broke out in the gulf, there would be an immediate 200-point drop on the Dow," said William LeFevre, a market strategist at Advest Inc. "It is now our view that 1991's Dow decline has discounted much of that supposed 200-point shock to stocks, should war develop."
What may not have been discounted, of course, is how the war will develop, or what effect it will have on the recession that has already begun. As investors draw conclusions in these areas, a war could have a major effect on the stock market.

HEADLINE: Liquidation Fears Rise For Eastern

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Eastern Airlines, which last November fought off an attempt by its creditors to shut down the carrier, may stop flying within days and be liquidated because it is short of cash and cannot find more, a person familiar with the airline's finances said yesterday.
If Eastern is forced to liquidate, there may be little left for its creditors because the process can be expensive and would probably deplete much of the carrier's escrow accounts, which now total about $500 million. Among Eastern's biggest unsecured creditors are Airbus Industrie, Boeing, General Electric and Pratt & Whitney. Its secured creditors are mostly bondholders.
 
Still Seeking Partners
 Martin R. Shugrue Jr., the court-appointed trustee who is running Eastern, said the airline was still seeking investment partners to keep flying and reorganize with a new business plan under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. He said yesterday that the carrier was talking with two potential investors, but he would not name them. Even after a shutdown, Eastern could again begin operating with an infusion from an outside investor. 
 Ticket holders are expected to be reimbursed if the carrier stops flying. The Federal Bankruptcy Court has set aside $50 million for that purpose.
The carrier's condition was disclosed last Thursday in a meeting in the chambers of Burton R. Lifland, the chief judge of the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, who is overseeing Eastern's attempt to reorganize.
Mr. Shugrue said at the meeting that Eastern's cash was rapidly running out, a person familiar with the meeting said. The person did not want to be identified.
The person said Mr. Shugrue was preparing the airline for a shutdown and liquidation while also seeking other alternatives.
The Wall Street Journal had reported yesterday that Eastern could face a shutdown as early as next week. Mr. Shugrue, who spoke at the International Aviation Club in Washington yesterday, said in response to the report that it was accurate "in that we have indeed scoured the industry for purchasers and partners."
He added, "In fact, as we speak today, we are in discussions with two such potential partners whose investment interest in Eastern is real." One analyst, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, said, however, that he believed there was little chance of finding a savior for Eastern.
 
Reorganization Plan
 Mr. Shugrue said that Eastern had just completed a reorganization plan that would greatly change the economics and operations of the airline and allow Eastern to come out of bankruptcy.
"Despite the underlying strength of this business plan, with the turmoil in the industry today Eastern admittedly faces an uphill struggle and would benefit greatly from an investment partner to help the airline implement this new business plan," he said.
Mr. Shugrue did not name the potential partners. Northwest Airlines has expressed interest in Eastern's Atlanta hub, while most other big United States carriers have expressed interest in pieces of the airline, A Northwest representative could not be reached yesterday for comment.
Eastern's condition is a huge disappointment for Mr. Shugrue. Last November, he and Eastern's lawyers opposed a motion by the airline's unsecured creditors to liquidate the carrier because it could not stem its losses. Mr. Shugrue persuaded Judge Lifland to release $135 million from escrow to enable him to try to win back business fliers: Eastern allowed them to fly first class on a full-coach fare.
Mr. Shugrue predicted that the carrier would break even by March and would no longer need cash infusions from the creditors.
 
Concerns About Safety
 But Mr. Shugrue was trying to win back business travelers as the recession was cutting into business travel.Concerns about Eastern's safety also continued to be raised in the press and in a grand jury investigation of Eastern employees suspected of signing off on repairs and maintenance that had not been performed.
Like other big carriers, Eastern has also seen its fuel bills soar because of the Persian Gulf crisis. And competitors that at first had not matched Eastern's lower fares, became more aggressive in their pricing.
Even without the higher fuel prices and the recession, Mr. Shugrue would have faced a struggle. There was the legacy of years of labor strife and a long strike that crippled the carrier's operations for a while and forced it into bankruptcy protection in March 1989.

HEADLINE: Lack of Day Care Cited in Benefits Appeal

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ST. PAUL, Jan. 15

 BODY:
A woman who was dismissed from her job because she regularly missed work to care for her sick infant is appealing her denial of unemployment benefits to the Minnesota Court of Appeals.
The 32-year-old woman, Diane McCourtney, was absent from her job as an accounts clerk with a Minnetonka computer company, Seagate Technology, about half the time from January through April of last year. She said she had to stay home because she could not find affordable day care for her ill son, James, now 15 months old.
She was dismissed May 1 for excessive absenteeism. Her claim for jobless benefits totaling $5,486 was contested by Seagate and denied by the state Jobs and Training Department. She appealed twice to the agency and lost.
Ms. McCourtney, who is still out of work, is pregnant with twins and has applied for a child-care license.
James, who had frequently been stricken with respiratory ailments, is now healthy. Ms. McCourtney's husband, Larry Olson, who was disabled by a back injury in early 1990 and could not lift the boy, now earns $25,000 a year as a salesman.

HEADLINE: Oil Traders Are Calm At Deadline

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The oil market stared war in the face yesterday, and barely moved.
In a market that has been gyrating with every whisper of Persian Gulf news, trading was notably contained as the midnight deadline for Iraq to pull out of Kuwait approached. Experts said the lack of news to change expectations on prices -- which jumped on Monday to over $30 a barrel -- appeared to dominate trading. 
 For now, "basically, all the bad news is out, and all the good news is out, too," said John H. Lichtblau of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, explaining the tepid trading on what was very likely the eve of a confrontation the market had feared for months.
 
Everyone Talks War
 Everyone is talking war, he said, but global oil supplies are high and Saudi Arabia seems to be heavily defended.
Crude oil for February delivery closed down 71 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange, at $30.07, having wandered over the relatively small range of $1.50 in the course of the day.
Stocks, facing the same uncertainty, stumbled up and down. At the close the Dow was at 2,490.59, up 6.68. Treasury notes and bonds dipped in light trading, the dollar was little changed and gold fell slightly.
With a deadline for war near, some oil users might have been tempted to buy extra supplies, but Mr. Lichtblau pointed out, "You take a risk if you buy oil at $35 or $40; if there is a war, it could be short-lived, or it may not affect supplies."
 
Saudi Oilfield Security
 In either case, a buyer could find his inventory worth much less in a few days. Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist and senior managing director at Bear, Stearns & Company, said yesterday, "The Iraqi Air Force threat to the Saudi oilfields is the key threat that has been hanging up the market for weeks." If the United States and its allies achieve quick air superiority, he said, oil will tumble. Stocks, he added, would follow with a "multi-hundred-point rally."
Shahrokh Nikkhah, a vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., had another theory for why oil went lower yesterday. "I think the market's trying to tell us that there is not going to be a war," he said. President Saddam Hussein, he said, might feel after the deadline passes that his pride and face had been maintained, and that diplomacy was now possible.
Among the oil companies, however, there were signs that a rough stretch lies ahead. Mobil and Phillips Petroleum announced steps to limit hoarding.
Mobil said it had asked its bulk customers if they would restrict their purchases of gasoline and heating oil to 100 percent of the volume for which they had contracted, which, the company noted, was more oil than most of them generally buy.
The company said that some of its terminals "have been hit by withdrawals greatly in excess of local demand," but that "there is no industry shortage of petroleum products, and industry inventories are adequate to meet normal demand."
Phillips said customers who buy in a single day more than 1/30th of their monthly contract volume of gasoline or distillates would be charged an additional 10 cents a gallon for excess gallons. Distillates are primarily heating oil and diesel oil.
 
Speculators Liquidate
 While some distributors may be stocking up, the only hectic trading in the pits on the futures exchange was at the end of the day, when "locals," or speculators who buy and sell on their own account, without ever taking delivery, decided to liquidate their positions rather than go home last night holding fixed-price obligations that could wipe them out.
"People are not willing to be wrong," said Tom Blakeslee, an analyst at Pegasus Econometric Group, of Hoboken, N.J.
Early in the day, locals had guessed that prices would rise, and bought contracts that obligated them to buy oil at a future date, according to market-watchers. If war fears rose, the value of these contracts would rise.
"But we got near the end of the day," said Thomas R. Sparico, managing director of Geldermann Energy, a brokerage house, "and the phones never lit up with the rest of the world coming to buy." So the locals liquidated their positions, and the price sank.
 
Heating Oil Also Falls
 Heating oil also fell, by 4.28 cents, to 84.7 cents a gallon. Unleaded gasoline was down by 5.22 cents to 77.04 cents a gallon.
Most experts still expect a price spike if shooting breaks out, but are beginning to doubt it will be very big.
On the eve of the United Nations deadline for Iraq to get out of Kuwait, the American Petroleum Institute reported that crude oil stocks for the week ending Jan. 11 rose to 323 million barrels, from 321.7 million the previous week. The figure compares to 345.1 million barrels last year.
Stocks of heating oil and other distillates were in a normal seasonal decline, said the institute, the industry's main trade association. Gasoline stocks were off from the previous week but ahead of last year. Crude imports, however, were way down: 5.4 million barrels a day, the same as the earlier week, compared with 6.2 million barrels last year.

HEADLINE: Insuring 'War Risks' at Lloyd's

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Jan. 15

 BODY:
It is 11:50 A.M., and as war clouds gather over the Persian Gulf, a line of insurance brokers forms at the second-floor desk of Christopher W. Rome in the Lloyd's of London building on Lime Street.
The first broker to approach Mr. Rome, the head of one of Lloyd's 400 underwriting syndicates, is seeking $8 million in insurance for a small Saudi Arabian tanker bound for the Saudi gulf port of Jubail, where the vessel plans to load a cargo of fuel oil later this week. His customer wants coverage for the two days the ship will be within the likely war zone. 
 "That's right in the thick of it," Mr. Rome said of Jubail, about 130 miles from Kuwait. "And fuel oil burns very nicely. That is not true of crude oil, which is very difficult to set fire to," he added, noting that some crude-oil tankers received direct hits in the Iran-Iraq war and did not catch fire.
 
Painful Losses
 There were $1 billion in claims from that war and several Lloyd's syndicates, , including Mr. Rome's, suffered painful losses.
He offers to accept 20 percent of the requested coverage, a substantial portion since splitting the risk among the syndicates is the rule rather than the exception. His rate is 3 percent of the value of the ship and 2 percent of the value of the cargo because the ship is at risk longer than the cargo.
That rate, which comes to $38,000, is good only for today. On Wednesday, if shooting starts, it will be another story: Rates might easily triple or quadruple, hitting the 10 to 15 percent levels to which they soared at the height of the Iran-Iraq war. And Mr. Rome wants the premium paid within 30 days.
Mr. Rome is head of one of the half-dozen or so underwriting syndicates in the Lloyd's insurance market that "leads" or makes the first quote on insurance for ships and planes against damage or seizure in war.
For a ship traveling to a safe port like New York from London, the insurance rate yearly, not just for a few days, is 0.0275 percent of the value of the cargo and 0.05 percent of the value of the ship. And customers might be given three months to pay.
Gulf-related business -- or war risks, as they are called in the trade -- has been coming in spurts, said Mr. Rome, who at 53 has been in the business for 35 years.
There are now about 100 merchant ships in the Persian Gulf bound for or docked at the main Saudi ports of Jubail and Ras Tanura, about 160 miles south of Kuwait, and there are 33 in the Red Sea near or at the Jordanian port of Aqaba, according to shipping industry estimates. Stephen Merrett, chairman of the Lloyd's marine underwriters association, said there were several hundred merchant ships in the gulf, including those carrying supplies for the United Nations military forces.
The next broker is shopping for insurance for the charterer of a large Brazilian tanker destined for Kharg Island, the Iranian oil terminal in the gulf opposite Kuwait. The charterer wants coverage to protect his commission.
Plans call for the ship to go through the Straits of Hormuz and enter the Persian Gulf at 7 A.M., Greenwich mean time, on Wednesday. The United States deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait or risk war is 5 A.M., G.M.T., Mr. Rome notes. "The ship would almost certainly hug the Iranian coast," he said. "It'd probably take a week to get into the gulf and out again." He quotes a rate of 5 percent of the commission.
The next request is for insurance for an oil-drilling platform that is laid up in Dubai. Since the United Arab Emirates is not expected to be a battlefield, "terrorism is possibly the greatest risk," Mr. Rome said. "It's inevitable there will be a lot of terrorism."
He offers a rate of 0.5 percent of the platform's value for 14 days of coverage. Three months ago, he might have insured it for 0.1 percent.
Then there is a pause in gulf-related business. There are requests for insurance for a $184 million satellite before it is launched, for the revenues a company would lose if four small cruise ships it has on order were delivered late and for a shipowner's liability if helicopters he plans to carry from New York to South Korea are damaged in transit.
Then Mr. Rome's attention is back on the gulf and an Indian general cargo ship that is bound from India to the Black Sea via the Suez Canal. The Turkish charterer wants coverage against the canal being shut during a war. The ship could be stranded in the canal or have to travel around the Cape of Good Hope, which would add 30 to 33 days to its journey, Mr. Rome said. He recalls that the canal was shut in the 1967 and 1973 Arab-Israeli wars and offers a rate of 7.5 percent of the amount insured.
 
Helping to Offset Claims
 Why is the rate higher than the rate for protection against damage or seizure? Not all ships insured for damage or seizure will suffer from either problem if there is a war. That means the overall risks to Mr. Rome's syndicate are lower because the premiums earned from the unaffected ships will help offset the claims. But if the canal is closed, every shipowner or operator with canal-closure insurance will make a claim.
And he thinks there is a significant chance that the canal will be closed, especially if the Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, carries out his vow to attack Israel if the American-led forces attack him. "His main card is the Israeli card to bring the other Arabs to his side," Mr. Rome said.
Some governments typically offer war-risk coverage for most or all of the value of their flag ships.
The United States Government insures at its own expense merchant ships of any flag that are have been contracted by the Defense Department to carry military cargo. It can also offer war-risk insurance at a rate below that available from the commercial market for merchant ships of any flag that are serving the economic or defensive interests of the United States. So far, the Maritime Administration has had about a half-dozen requests for such insurance but has not yet acted on them or decided what premium to charge, a spokesman said in a telephone interview from Washington.
But Lloyd's insurers will continue to offer coverage for those who need it. Lloyd's is even prepared to stay open weekends if there is a war.
The last time Lloyd's operated on a Saturday was in 1965, after Hurricane Betsy devastated portions of the United States. And in its 303 years, Lloyd's has never been open on a Sunday.
"At the moment," Mr. Rome said, "it looks like I could be working this weekend."

HEADLINE: Poor Holiday Season Pushed Retail Sales Down by 0.4%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 15

 BODY:
Retail sales fell four-tenths of 1 percent in December, largely because of declining automobile sales and a poor Christmas shopping season, the Commerce Department reported today.
For all of last year, sales grew a weak 3.8 percent as consumers spent at the slowest annual pace since the last recession eight years ago, the report showed. 
 Sales actually dropped from October through December, and analysts said the report reflected a fourth-quarter decline in the economy. They forecast continuing weakness in the months to follow.
The Commerce Department said sales fell one-tenth of 1 percent in November, while rising a barely perceptible one-tenth of 1 percent in October.
 
'Extremely Weak'
 "It's an extremely weak report indicative of the current recessionary environment," said Mark M. Zandi, an economist with Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa. "The decline in the fourth quarter is consistent with a 4 percent drop" in the gross national product.
David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a New York government securities dealer, said, "I think it's a symptom of more things to come."
The Bush Administration and most private economists agree that the economy has slipped into a recession, which is generally defined as two or more quarterly declines in the gross national product, the nation's total output of goods and services.
Retail sales represent about half of total consumer spending, which itself accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
The Commerce Department said sales in 1990 totaled $1.8 trillion, up from $1.71 trillion a year earlier but the smallest advance since a 3 percent increase in 1982.
Sales in December fell to a seasonally adjusted $151.1 billion, down from $151.6 billion in November. The November total represented the first decline since a similar drop last May.
 
Auto Sales Down 1.4%
 The weakness in December sales was led by the drop in auto sales and the poor holiday buying, but it was widespread. Only furniture stores, groceries and drugstores posted gains.
Auto sales fell 1.4 percent after growing six-tenths of 1 percent in November -- a gain analysts attributed mostly to fleet sales rather than to individual consumers. Excluding autos, sales were down one-tenth of 1 percent.
Department store sales fell nine-tenths of 1 percent, confirming the disappointing holiday shopping season reported earlier by many retailers.
Sales of durable goods -- items like autos and appliances expected to last more than three years -- dropped eight-tenths of 1 percent, continuing a three-month slide. Nondurable sales like food and clothing fell one-tenth of 1 percent.
Sales of building materials, which were unchanged in November, plunged 2.7 percent. But purchases of furniture and other home furnishings rose nine-tenths of 1 percent after falling seven-tenths of 1 percent a month earlier.
Grocery store sales were up four-tenths of 1 percent following a gain of two-tenths of 1 percent in November. Drugstore sales rose 1.9 percent after increasing 1 percent a month earlier.
But other nondurable categories fell. Gasoline station sales plunged 3.1 percent as prices fell after gaining 2 percent in November.
Apparel sales were off 2 percent following a decline of three-tenths of 1 percent a month earlier. Restaurant and bar sales were down three-tenths of 1 percent, erasing a gain of three-tenths of 1 percent the previous month.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF: News Analysis;
Stake for Bush: Presidency and Politics

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Wednesday, Jan. 16

 BODY:
The decision President Bush is confronting could change the face of domestic politics, the map of the Middle East, the realities of big-power relationships and the world economy for years or decades to come.
 Just as the New Deal and World War II solidified the Democrats' position as the stronger party in the United States for nearly a quarter-century, reshaped the continent of Europe and produced the Western alliance that has formed the framework of American foreign policy for half a century, so a war in the Persian Gulf would have many repercussions that can be foreseen and many that cannot. 
 Marine skirmishes have been commonplace in American history, forgotten relatively quickly. But the nine American wars, from the Revolution through the War of 1812 and the Mexican War to the Civil War, from the Spanish-American War through two World Wars to Korea and Vietnam, have been great events that marked the generations that fought them for their rest of their lives. So would a 10th, toward which the nation has moved for five months.
Nothing a President does so affects his reputation as his conduct of war. Few Presidents have had to face the decision to put the United States through "the fiery trial' of warfare; the phrase is that of Abraham Lincoln, one of those who did so.
By December 1941, Franklin D. Roosevelt convinced his countrymen that he had acted wisely, and enhanced his reputation. Americans concluded that Woodrow Wilson had taken up arms on behalf of woolly minded ideals and turned against him. They soured on Harry S. Truman and the Korean War, and decided that Lyndon B. Johnson had erred so badly that they drove him from seeking re-election in 1968.
The decision of Mr. Bush, who was a naval pilot in World War II, is likely to make or break his Presidency as well.
"At times of crisis, the Commander in Chief represents the best or the worst in us," said Edmund Morris, biographer of Theodore Roosevelt and biographer-to-be of Ronald Reagan. "If the war goes badly, so does the President. On the other hand, the Presidents we consider the greatest -- Washington, Lincoln, F.D.R. -- were all warrior Presidents."
"If the war is over in two or three weeks, he will be made, his re-election insured," said Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., historian and biographer of Franklin D. Roosevelt. "If the fighting lasts five or six months, casualties are high, terrorists roam the world, he's finished, in my view."
In a sense, the President had decided before the deadline. The process started when he pledged that the invasion of Kuwait "will not stand" soon after it took place. That implied that he would push the Iraqis out if he had to, as did his decision to send tens of thousands of ground troops instead of relying on air and naval power alone.
When he doubled the size of the American force in and around Saudi Arabia, converting it from a defensive to an offensive force, when he persuaded the United Nations to set a date for President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, when he won the approval of Congress for military action, Mr. Bush was trying to bring irresistible pressure on Baghdad -- but he also knew that if that pressure failed, he would have little recourse but to take the country into battle.
As diplomatic efforts proved fruitless, the President's room for maneuver narrowed and then vanished. To do nothing would wreck his credibility and damage that of his country.
"He thought he could overpower Saddam psychologically, but it hasn't worked," said James MacGregor Burns, a leading historian of the Presidency. "Now he may have misgivings, like many Presidents on the eve of war, but he's left himself no exit."
 
Shades of Wilsonian Idealism
 Mr. Bush hopes that an allied victory over Iraq would solidify the "new world order" that he hopes to build in the wake of the cold war. He hopes that a defeat of Iraq would deter other would-be aggressors, especially in the third world, and make the world a better, freer place -- an idea not so very different from Wilson's campaign to make the world safe for democracy.
He hopes to secure the gulf's vast oil reserves for the industrial world, and eventually to promote a general settlement of the outstanding problems in the Middle East, including the intractable Palestinian question.
Few if any military analysts doubt that the United States would "win" a war against Iraq, though many doubt that it will be as short and relatively painless as some of the President's advisers have suggested it will be.
But many diplomats, many scholars and much of the foreign-policy establishment (with the notable exception of Henry A. Kissinger) think that Washington has failed to think the thing through adequately. They paint a much more baleful picture. They foresee the destablization rather than the stabilization of the Mideast, with anti-Americanism rampant, Mr. Hussein a hero or a martyr to ordinary Arabs all across the region, and world oil supplies more tenuous than ever.
The future of United States relations with the Soviet Union, clouded at the moment by the crackdown in the Baltic states, may also be affected by the course of events in the gulf.
With the passing of the Security Council deadline, the President had the backing of the American people -- but not their passionate backing, not a deep-seated commitment.
For all the attempted demonization of Mr. Hussein, through the constant comparisons to Hitler and other ogres, Mr. Bush has not yet succeeded in making most ordinary citizens of this country feel that they are embarking upon a crusade, which is what Americans like their wars to be.
There is a sense that the electorate is telling Washington, "O.K., fight if you must, but not with my son" -- or daughter, or husband, or wife.
And that is not a very firm underpinning for war or national unity.

HEADLINE: Bad Loans Take Toll At Banks

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Three large New York banking companies -- Citicorp, Manufacturers Hanover and Chemical -- announced poor quarterly results yesterday, reflecting losses on loans for real estate projects and some corporate takeovers. The losses overshadowed the benefits of falling interest rates and cuts in their work forces. Manufacturers Hanover also said it was cutting its dividend.
In California, Wells Fargo said its profits fell slightly from a year ago, because of the costs of acquiring failed savings associations, and an increase in troubled real estate loans. Security Pacific announced a large loss for the quarter, while First Interstate posted a profit. 
 "As the quality of bank loans continues to deteriorate, the theme for large banks has been to sharply increase the reserves for loan losses," said Thomas H. Hanley, a banking analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. He said bankers were hoping that reserves set aside in 1990 would be enough to handle losses realized this year and next.
Following are details of the companies' results:
 
CITICORP
Citicorp, the nation's largest banking company, said it had lost $382 million in the fourth quarter, as it set aside $450 million in reserves for bad loans, up from $94 million the previous quarter. In 1989, Citicorp lost $784 million in the quarter, when it added $1 billion to its reserves for losses on loans to developing countries.
Despite the loss, Citicorp earned $458 million, or 99 cents a share, last year, down by 8 percent from $498 million, or $1.16 a share, in 1989. Consumer banking, one of Citicorp's strongest businesses in recent years, earned more than $979 million in 1990, despite a 25.7 percent decline in fourth-quarter profits, to $150 million, from $202 million a year earlier.
Citicorp's results were in line with the estimates it issued a month ago, when it also said it would cut its dividend to 25 cents, from 44.5 cents, starting early this year.
In an unusual but increasingly common adjustment for large banking companies, Citicorp reduced its assets to $217 million at the end of last year, from $231 million a year ago.
On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Citicorp's shares added 12.5 cents each to close at $12.25.
 
MANUFACTURERS HANOVER
The most surprising weakness among the large New York companies was at the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation, which until the last several weeks appeared to have avoided the worst of the real estate problems affecting other banks.
But in announcing a quarterly loss of $67 million yesterday, the company said it was cutting its dividend payment to 47 cents a quarter, from 82 cents. In the 1989 period, Manufacturers posted a net income of $62 million.
"The weak economy put pressure on our portfolio," said John F. McGillicuddy, the chairman. He noted that the reduced dividend would add about $100 million in capital a year and added that he expected the company to return to profitability in 1991.
Big problems for the company included $181 million in loans to the Best Products Company, a Richmond-based operator of catalogue showrooms that filed for bankruptcy on Jan. 4, and an undisclosed amount it had loaned to a partnership led by a unit of the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States for a Manhattan office building.
The loans, plus a foreign real estate loan that was not identified by the company yesterday, accounted for more than $400 million of the $532 million increase in delinquent or seriously troubled loans at Manufacturers since Sept. 30. Such loans totaled $1.46 billion at the end of last year.
With problem loans rising, Manufacturers set aside $353 million in its reserve for loan losses, up from $172 million a year ago. For the year, it earned $139 million, or $1.27 a share, up from a 1989 loss of $588 million, when it set aside $1.1 billion for losses on loans to developing countries.
Manufacturers stock fell 50 cents a share, to $18.375, on the Big Board.
 
CHEMICAL
The Chemical Banking Corporation earned $70.1 million, or 55 cents a share, down by 26.9 percent from $95.9 million, or $1.04 a share, a year ago.
For the year, it earned $291.2 million, or $2.38 a share, up 39.6 percent from a loss in 1989 of $482.2 million, when it set aside $600 million to cover losses on loans to less-developed countries.
Chemical, like many other banks, benefited from a decline in the cost of the funds it borrowed relative to the interest it charged borrowers. It also benefited from a 6.2 percent decline in salaries and employee benefits.
Because of growing problems with bad loans, Chemical set aside $135 million in its reserves, up from $66.2 million a year ago. Its delinquent and other troubled loans, excluding those to developing nations, totaled $1.88 billion at the end of the year, up by $178 million since Sept. 30, and up by $473 million from a year earlier.
Chemical's stock added 25 cents a share yesterday, to $10.875, in New York Stock Exchange trading.
 
WELLS FARGO
Wells Fargo & Company, one of the most active bank lenders for commercial real estate in recent years, yesterday announced an increase in bad loans, though its problems remained less severe than at many other large banks.
In the quarter, Wells Fargo earned $156.7 million, down by 1.1 percent from $158.5 million, or $2.95 a share.
For the year, the company earned $711.5 million, or $13.39 a share, up by 18.3 percent from $601.1 million, or $11.02 a share.
Wells Fargo said its delinquent and troubled loans, as well as real estate acquired from foreclosure, totaled $1.43 billion, up by 18.1 percent since Sept. 30. Federal regulators completed a special examination of its real estate lending during the fourth quarter, the company added.
Wells Fargo's stock fell $2.50, to $49.75, on the Big Board.
First Interstate
First Interstate Bancorp said it had earned $91 million, or $1.32 a share, in the quarter, and $468.7 million, or $7.30 a share, for the year. The results compared with losses of $344.2 million in 1989 quarter and of $124.5 million for the year.
The company's stock rose 25 cents, to $20.75, on the Big Board.
 
SECURITY PACIFIC
The Security Pacific Corporation, which said last month that it would post a large loss, said it had lost $357.6 million in the quarter, compared with a profit of $191.7 million. For the year, the company earned $161.3 million, down by 78.2 percent from $740.6 million in 1989.
The loss resulted from the setting aside in the quarter of $624.6 million in loan-loss reserves, up from $210.2 million set aside in the 1989 period.
Security Pacific's shares dropped 25 cents each, to $17.875, in Big Board trading.

 BODY:
President Bush reviewed the state of the economy today with his top economic advisers and the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan. Afterward, the Administration again voiced a belief that the recession would be short.
"We in the Administration feel that the recession will be relatively short-lived, but nevertheless we are going to be in a significant slowdown for a number of months," the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said.
 
Budget Office Report
 That was supported by reports today that the Congressional Budget Office is projecting the economy will shrink for two straight quarters, the generally accepted definition of a recession, but that it will turn up after that. 
 Besides reviewing the health of the economy, the discussion at the meeting with the President covered the problems facing the nation's banking system, Mr. Fitzwater said.
He acknowledged that the banking system was "feeling a number of strains," including a slowdown in lending as bankers grow more cautious because of increased regulatory oversight in the wake of the savings and loan crisis.
But Mr. Fitzwater did say the Administration believed the banking system was basically strong.
The meeting with Mr. Bush was also attended by the Comptroller of the Currency, Robert L. Clarke; the Treasury Secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, and the chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, Michael J. Boskin.
The Congressional Budget Office is expected to announce Thursday that the economy contracted by 2.3 percent in the final quarter of 1990 and would shrink by another 1.8 percent in the first three months of this year, said an official who asked to not be identified.
Other officials also said the office had projected two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth, but said they were uncertain what the final figures would be.
But agreeing with many economists' projections that the recession will be short, the Congressional agency predicted the economy would rebound quickly. According to the agency's projection, the economy will grow by eight-tenths of a percent in the second quarter and by more thereafter, the official said.
The projection also gives the Congress and President Bush a chance to decide whether to suspend spending constraints enacted in last fall's five-year budget deal.
The budget agreement specified that if the budget office projects two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth, the Senate must consider -- and the House may consider -- a measure to nullify the constraints.
But officials said Democratic and Republican leaders and the White House oppose suspending the law so soon after it was enacted and while the economy, though weak, does not appear in deep trouble.
The Administration plans to announce its forecast of economic growth when it releases its budget on Feb. 4. Officials say the White House's figures will be similar to those of the budget office.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Court Decision on Desegregation

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 15

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the Supreme Court's 5-to-3 decision today on conditions for ending Federal court supervision of formerly segregated school districts.
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion, joined by Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy. Justice Thurgood Marshall's dissenting opinion was joined by Justices Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens. Justice David H. Souter took no part in the case.
 
FROM THE OPINION
 
By Chief Justice Rehnquist
Petitioner Board of Education of Oklahoma City sought dissolution of a decree entered by the District Court imposing a school desegregation plan. The District Court granted relief over the objection of respondents Robert L. Dowell, et al, black students and their parents. The Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit reversed, holding that the board would be entitled to such relief only upon " '[n]othing less than a clear showing of grievous wrong evoked by new and unforeseen conditions. . . .' " We hold that the Court of Appeals test is more stringent than is required either by our cases dealing with injunctions or by the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.
 
History of the Litigation
 This school desegregation litigation began almost 30 years ago. In 1961, respondents, black students and their parents, sued petitioners, the Board of Education of Oklahoma City (Board), to end de jure segregation in the public schools. In 1963, the District Court found that Oklahoma City had intentionally segregated both schools and housing in the past, and that Oklahoma City was operating a "dual" school system -- one that was intentionally segregated by race.
In 1965, the District Court found that the School Board's attempt to desegregate by using neighborhood zoning failed to remedy past segregation because residential segregation resulted in one-race schools. Residential segregation had once been state imposed, and it lingered due to discrimination by some realtors and financial institutions. The District Court found that school segregation had caused some housing segregation.
In 1972, finding that previous efforts had not been successful at eliminating state-imposed segregation, the District Court ordered the Board to adopt the "Finger Plan," under which kindergarteners would be assigned to neighborhood schools unless their parents opted otherwise; children in grades 1-4 would attend formerly all-white schools, and thus black children would be bused to those schools; children in grade 5 would attend formerly all-black schools, and thus white children would be bused to those schools; students in the upper grades would be bused to various areas to maintain integrated schools, and in integrated neighborhoods there would be stand-alone schools for all grades.
 
Compliance for Five Years
 In 1977, after complying with the desegregation decree for five years, the board made a "Motion to Close Case." The District Court held in its "Order Terminating Case":
"The court has concluded that [the Finger Plan] worked and that substantial compliance with the constitutional requirements has been achieved. . . .
This unpublished order was not appealed.
In 1984, the School Board faced demographic changes that led to greater burdens on young black children. As more and more neighborhoods became integrated, more stand-alone schools were established and young black students had to be bused farther from their inner-city homes to outlying white areas.
In an effort to alleviate this burden and to increase parental involvement, the Board adopted the Student Reassignment Plan (SRP), which relied on neighborhood assignments for students in grade 1-4 beginning in the 1985-1986 school year. Busing continued for students in grades 5-12. . . .
In 1985, respondents filed a "Motion to Reopen the Case," contending that the School District had not achieved "unitary" status and that the SRP was a return to segregation. Under the SRP, 11 of 64 elementary schools would be greater than 90 percent black, 22 would be greater than 90 percent white plus other minorities, and 31 would be racially mixed. . . .
. ..
The District Court found that present residential segregation was the result of private decision making and economics, and that it was too attenuated to be a vestige of former school segregation. It also found that the district had maintained its unitary status and that the neighborhood assignment plan was not designed with discriminatory intent. The court concluded that the previous injunctive decree should be vacated and the School District returned to local control.
 
1932 Court Decision Cited
 The Court of Appeals again reversed. . . . Relying on United States v. Swift & Co. (1932), it held that a desegregation decree remains in effect until a school district can show "grievous wrong evoked by new and unforseen conditions," and "dramatic changes in conditions unforseen at the time of the decree that . . . impose extreme and unexpectedly oppressive hardships on the obligor." Given that a number of schools under the SRP, circumstances in Oklahoma City had not changed enough to justify modification of the decree. . . .
We now reverse the Court of Appeals.
. . .
In Milliken v. Bradley (Milliken II) (1977), we said: "[F]ederal Court decrees must directly address and relate to the constitutional violation itself. Because of this inherent limitation upon Federal judicial authority, Federal Court decrees exceed appropriate limits if they are aimed at eliminating a condition that does not violate the Constitution or does not flow from such a violation. . . ."
From the very first, Federal supervision of local school systems was intended as a temporary measure to remedy past discrimination. Brown considered the "complexities arising from the transition to a system of public education freed of racial discrimination" in holding that the implementation of desegregation was to proceed "with all deliberate speed."
Considerations based on the allocation of powers within our Federal system, we think, support our view that quoted language from Swift does not provide the proper standard to apply to injunctions entered in school desegregation cases. Such decrees, unlike the one in Swift, are not intended to operate in perpetuity. Local control over the education of children allows citizens to participate in decision making, and allows innovation so that school programs can fit local needs.
 
A Reasonable Period of Time
 The legal justification for displacement of local authority by an injunctive decree in a school desegregation case is a violation of the Constitution by the local authorities. Dissolving a desegregation decree after the local authorities have operated in compliance with it for a reasonable period of time properly recognizes that "necessary concern for the important values of local control of public school systems dictates that a Federal Court's regulatory control of such systems not extend beyond the time required to remedy the effects of past intentional discrimination. . . ."
. . .
A District Court need not accept at face value the profession of a School Board which has intentionally discriminated that it will cease to do so in the future. But in deciding whether to modify or dissolve a desegregation decree, a School Board's compliance with previous court orders is obviously relevant. In this case the original finding of de jure segregation was entered in 1961, the injunctive decree from which the Board seeks relief was entered in 1972, and the Board complied with the decree in good faith until 1985.
Not only do the personnel of school boards change over time, but the same passage of time enables the District Court to observe the good faith of the School Board in complying with the decree. The test espoused by the Court of Appeals would condemn a school district, once governed by a board which intentionally discriminated, to judicial tutelage for the indefinite future. Neither the principles governing the entry and dissolution of injunctive decrees nor the commands of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment require any such Draconian result.
 
Case Sent to District Court
 Petitioners urge that we reinstate the decision of the District Court terminating the injunction, but we think that the preferable course is to remand the case to that court so that it may decide, in accordance with this opinion, whether the Board made a sufficient showing of constitutional compliance as of 1985, when the SRP was adopted, to allow the injunction to be dissolved. . . . The District Court should address itself to whether the Board had complied in good faith with the desegregation decree since it was entered, and whether the vestiges of past discrimination had been eliminated. . . .
In considering whether the vestiges of de jure segregation had been eliminated as far as practicable, the District Court should look not only at student assignments, but "to every facet of school operations -- faculty, staff, transportation extra-curricular activities and facilities. . . ."
After the District Court decides whether the Board was entitled to have the decree terminated, it should proceed to decide respondent's challenge to the SRP. A school district which has been released from an injunction imposing a desegregation plan no longer requires court authorization for the promulgation of policies and rules regulating matters such as assignment of students and the like, but it of course remains subject to the mandate of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. If the Board was entitled to have the decree terminated as of 1985, the District Court should then evaluate the Board's decision to implement the SRP under appropriate equal protection principles.
 
FROM THE DISSENT
 
By Justice Marshall
The majority today suggests that 13 years of desegregation was enough. The Court remands the case for further evaluation of whether the purposes of the injunctive decree were achieved sufficient to justify the decree's dissolution. However, the inquiry it commends to the District Court fails to recognize explicitly the threatened re-emergence of one-race schools as a relevant "vestige" of de jure segregation.
In my view, the standard for dissolution of a school desegregation decree must reflect the central aim of our school desegregation precedents. In Brown v. Board of Education, (1954) (Brown I), a unanimous Court declared that racially "[s]eparate educational facilities are inherently unequal." This holding rested on the Court's recognition that state-sponsored segregation conveys a message of "inferiority as to th[e] state [of Afro-American school children] in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone." Remedying this evil and preventing its recurrence were the motivations animating our requirement that formerly de jure segregated school districts take all feasible steps to eliminate racially identifiable schools.
I believe a desegregation decree cannot be lifted so long as conditions likely to inflict the stigmatic injury condemned in Brown I persist and there remain feasible methods of eliminating such conditions. Because the record here shows, and the Court of Appeals found, that feasible steps could be taken to avoid one-race schools, it is clear that the purposes of the decree have not yet been achieved and the Court of Appeals' reinstatement of the decree should be affirmed. I therefore dissent.
. . .
I agree with the majority that the proper standard for determining whether a school desegregation decree should be dissolved is whether the purposes of the desegregation litigation, as incorporated in the decree, have been fully achieved. . . . I strongly disagree with the majority, however, on what must be shown to demonstrate that a decree's purposes have been fully realized. In my view, a standard for dissolution of a desegregation decree must take into account the unique harm associated with a system of racially identifiable schools and must expressly demand the elimination of such schools.
. . .
Just as it is central to the standard for evaluating the formation of a desegregation decree, so should the stigmatic injury associated with segregated schools be central to the standard for dissolving a decree. The Court has indicated that "the ultimate end to be brought about" by a desegregation remedy is "a unitary, nonracial system of public education."
 
The Message of Inferiority
 We have suggested that this aim is realized once school officials have "eliminate[d] from the public schools all vestiges of state-imposed segregation," whether they inhere in the school's "faculty, staff, transportation, extracurricular activities and facilities," or even in "the community and administration['s] attitudes toward [a] school."
Although the Court has never explicitly defined what constitutes a "vestige" of state-enforced segregation, the function that this concept has performed in our jurisprudence suggests that it extends to any condition that is likely to convey the message of inferiority implicit in a policy of segregation. So long as such conditions persist, the purposes of the decree cannot be deemed to have been achieved.
The majority suggests a more vague and, I fear, milder standard. . . .
By focusing heavily on present and future compliance with the Equal Protection Clause, the majority's standard ignores how the stigmatic harm identified in Brown I can persist even after the state ceases actively to enforce segregation. . . .
In sum, our school desegregation jurisprudence establishes that the effects of past discrimination remain chargeable to the school district regardless of its lack of continued enforcement of segregation, and the remedial decree is required until those effects have been finally eliminated.
Applying the standard I have outlined, I would affirm the Court of Appeals decision ordering the District Court to restore the desegregation decree. For it is clear on this record that the removal of the decree will result in a significant number of racially identifiable schools that could be eliminated.
. . .
Against the background of former state sponsorship of one-race schools, the persistence of racial identifiable schools perpetuates the message of racial inferiority associated with segregation. Therefore, such schools must be eliminated whenever feasible.
. ..
Consistent with the mandate of Brown I, our cases have imposed on school districts an unconditional duty to eliminate any condition that perpetuates the message of racial inferiority inherent in the policy of state-sponsored segregation. The racial identifiability of a district's schools is such a condition. Whether this "vestige" of state-sponsored segregation will persist cannot simply be ignored at the point where a District Court is contemplating the dissolution of a desegregation decree. In a district with a history of state-sponsored school segregation, racial separation, in my view, remains inherently unequal.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF: The Overview;
U.S. WEIGHS TIMING OF ATTACK AGAINST IRAQ AS DEADLINE PASSES AND DIPLOMACY FAILS

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Wednesday, Jan. 16

 BODY:
The deadline for Saddam Hussein to withdraw his forces from Kuwait passed at midnight Tuesday with the Iraqi Army still in place and the Bush Administration poised at the "point of decision" to unleash an American attack.
After the failure of last-minute peace initiatives, the White House appeared to hold little hope for further progress, although there was a sense that the Iraqi President might have another day or two, or perhaps a little longer, to acquiesce. 
 At midnight, the official hour of the deadline set by the United Nations Security Council, the White House marked the moment with a brief statement.
 
Not a Deadline for Attack
 "Jan. 15 was a deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait," a White House spokeswoman said soon after midnight. "It was not a deadline for U.N. action. The choice for peace remains with Saddam Hussein."
On Tuesday, the final hopes for a diplomatic breakthrough vanished when the Administration led an effort at the United Nations to quash an 11th-hour peace proposal by France.
At that time, France abandoned its effort at conciliation, saying Iraq had shown no interest in its plan to tie an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait to an international conference on the Middle East. The French Prime Minister, Michel Rocard, said on Tuesday night in Paris that "there is a fatal moment when one must act. This moment has, alas, arrived."
The United Nations Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, coupled a call for Iraq to leave Kuwait with another attempt to raise the prospect of a Middle East peace conference, as Iraq has demanded, without making it a condition of an Iraqi withdrawal.
 
Wider Mideast Talks
 "I have every assurance from the highest levels of government," he said, "that with the resolution of the present crisis every effort will be made to address in a comprehensive manner the Arab-Israeli conflict, including the Palestinian question." [Page A13.]
But as Mr. Perez de Cuellar made one last appeal on Tuesday evening for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, President Hussein visited his troops there. In Baghdad, hundreds of thousands of Iraqi men and women, waving AK-47 rifles, pitchforks and swords, marched through the streets shouting, "Victory to Saddam!"
Bush Administration officials who spent the day studying military intelligence reports said that far from showing any sign of withdrawing, Iraq was reinforcing troops on the border between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
American military officials said there were 680,000 troops from the international coalition, including 415,000 Americans, ranged against 545,000 Iraqi troops dug into Kuwait and southern Iraq. A total of 1,350 American warplanes and 108 Navy vessels, including six aircraft carriers and two battleships, were deployed in the region with several hundred warplanes and about 20 ships from other coalition members.
As the United Nations deadline neared, the White House took pains to present a picture of a President who was somber but resolute. But spokesmen provided few details of the President's activities or thinking.
"I would say that the President is at peace with himself, ready to make tough decisions," said the White House press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater.
 
'A Point of Decision'
 Asked about the timing of a conflict, Mr. Fitzwater said there was "a general feeling" that if it happened, it would happen swiftly. "As we reach this deadline, we reach a point of decision," he said. "And sooner rather than later is probably a ready description."
Mr. Fitzwater said that after talking by telephone to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d at 6:30 A.M. Tuesday, Mr. Bush had taken a solitary early morning walk on the south lawn of the White House, "just to reflect on the day."
Like other Government buildings in Washington, the White House was protected by an extra contingent of uniformed officers and Secret Service agents, guarding against the threat of terrorist attack.
Until Tuesday, the President and his advisers said there had been no decision on whether to go to war. Then, the White House stopped saying that and simply refused to talk about the President's decision on the grounds that it might jeopardize military security.
But for those who have talked to the President in the last two days, it was clear that Mr. Bush wanted to give the impression that he had, in essence, made the final decision.
At a meeting at the White House with the Congressional leadership on Monday afternoon, "everyone in the room had the feeling that the line had been crossed," said Representative Les Aspin, the Wisconsin Democrat who is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. "There certainly was not any glimmer of hope."
Democrats and Republicans who shared lunch on Tuesday with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Vice President Dan Quayle reported a similar feeling of sober inevitability on the use of force.
Mr. Bush seemed to take no notice of the growing ranks of protesters outside the White House on Tuesday. The police arrested dozens of demonstrators, and one group toted a banner reading, "How Many Bodies Per Gallon, Mr. Bush?"
Thousands of anti-war demonstrators gathered in cities from New York to San Francisco and from Raleigh, N.C., to Portland, Ore. Hundreds were arrested as they formed a human chain outside a Federal building in San Francisco and blocked traffic outside the United Nations in New York.
 
White House Flooded With Calls
 The White House was flooded with calls from citizens wanting to register their opinions. Mr. Fitzwater said that the local phone company had told the White House that 188,000 callers had failed to get through over the weekend. The White House, which often characterizes the preferences of callers when they favor Administration policy, refused to say what proportion of calls were opposed to military action.
"Most of them are probably negative," said one senior official. "They usually are about the use of force."
The head of Mr. Bush's own church, Bishop Edmond Browning of the American Episcopal Church, led a candlelight vigil outside the White House on Monday evening.
Bishop Browning was one of two ministers whom the President called on Tuesday morning. He told the Bishop and the Rev. Richard C. Halverson, the Senate chaplain, that he had been praying for the nation and asked them to pray as well.
 
Closeted With Key Advisers
 As he has done in other moments of crisis, Mr. Bush spent most of Tuesday closeted in the Oval Office with a tight band of trusted advisers, even as he tried to keep up an appearance of business as usual.
He held a session with economic advisers, met with the United States Ambassador to New Zealand, posed for some photographs with departing low-level staff members and filmed some messages to the families of troops in the Persian Gulf to be broadcast at halftime of the Super Bowl on Jan. 27.
But one senior aide said the President and his war council, who met for two hours on Tuesday morning, were consumed by a deepening sense of resignation about "the realities of Iraqi intransigence."
White House officials said Mr. Bush had left the Oval Office at 6:27 Tuesday night and gone to the residential part of the White House, where he had eaten dinner and watched television news. A White House spokesman said at 11:30 P.M. that the President had gone to sleep. There were about 2,500 anti-war demonstrators outside the White House, perhaps two-thirds of them on the sidewalk on Pennsylvania Avenue directly in front of the executive mansion and the others in Lafayette Park across the street as the midnight deadline came and went. Many held candles and chanted. No disturbances were reported.

HEADLINE: New York Studies Regulating Art Sales Like Commodities

BYLINE: By GRACE GLUECK

 BODY:
Should the art market be regulated like the stock market? A hearing to explore that possibility will be held in Manhattan on Jan. 30 by the New York State Assembly's committees on investigations and on tourism, sports and the arts. The hearing is based on a wide-ranging memorandum and draft legislation prepared by Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, Democrat of Westchester.
"I think it's fair at this time to characterize the art market as a sort of commodities market," Mr. Brodsky said in a telephone interview. "Art-market practices are no longer merely of concern to a privileged few, but to the general public, and it's time for the art community to take a hard look at itself." 
 His explorations were sparked by Sotheby's controversial financing of Vincent van Gogh's "Irises," the painting that the house sold at auction in 1987 for $53.9 million. Mr. Brodsky attributes what he calls "the inflated price" of "Irises" to the $27 million loan Sotheby's made toward its purchase by the Australian businessman Alan Bond.
Discussions held by Mr. Brodsky and members of his staff over the last year and a half have involved major participants in the art market centered in New York City. Meetings have also been held with city, state and Federal officials, including the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Brodsky said the public hearing would serve as a basis for "deciding what action the legislature could take, if there's any to take."
 
Sorting Out the Issues
 Among the museum and art-market representatives interviewed by Mr. Brodsky and his staff were Christopher Burge, president of Christie's ; Diana D. Brooks, president of Sotheby's North America; William Acquavella, president of Acquavella Galleries; William Woodside, former president of the Whitney Museum of American Art; Ashton Hawkins, executive vice president and counsel to the trustees of the Metropolitan Museum, and Gilbert Edelson, administrative vice president and counsel of the Art Dealers Association of America. Out of these interviews and other research has come the draft memorandum that serves as the basis for the hearing.
These are among the issues to be raised:
*Guarantees, agreed-upon minimum prices paid by the auction house to the seller. If the artwork is not sold, it becomes the property of the auction house.
*Secret reserves, in which the auction house does not disclose a minimum price it has agreed on with the seller.
*"Chandelier bids," false bids used by auctioneers to increase genuine bidding at sales.
*The financing of art purchases by auction houses.
*The effect of museums' deaccessioning (removing works from their collections, often to sell them) on public access to art.
*The possible protection of art transactions by securities or commodities regulations.
 
Neutrality and Confidence
 The ways dealers and auction houses have moved into financing presents some problems, Mr. Brodsky said. Such financing can consist of lending money to consignors on art they intend to sell; equity financing (lending money on art not intended for sale), and loans for purchases secured by the very art to be bought -- as the purchase of "Irises" was handled.
These practices could cause prices to be "overestimated, overpublicized and/or inflationary," Mr. Brodsky asserts in the draft memorandum. Further, an auction house could lose its neutrality because of its interest in works it has financed. And in a depressed market like the present one, practices like financing, guarantees and negotiated commissions could cause a loss of public confidence, Mr. Brodsky asserts.
But Sotheby executives say the house has changed its financing policies so that it will no longer make a loan -- as in the case of "Irises" -- with the collateral being an object purchased at Sotheby's within 90 days of the date the loan is issued. Alan Bond, the original purchaser of "Irises," which is now owned by the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., was lent $27 million toward purchase of the work but later defaulted on the payments.
In a letter to Mr. Brodsky, Marjorie E. Stone, general counsel and senior vice president of Sotheby's, said that before her meeting with Mr. Brodsky's staff, the auction house had already implemented other changes. Among them were "more expansive definitions" in its catalogues of the terms "owned property," "guaranteed property" and "other property in which Sotheby's has an equity interest."
In its catalogues Sotheby's also now highlights a notice advising when guaranteed property is included in a sale.
Ms. Stone also said that, although New York City law now permits a reserve set at a price less than or equal to the high presale estimate of an item, Sotheby's had decided that "a reserve should not exceed the low presale estimate."
 
From Public to Private View
 With reference to deaccessioning, Mr. Brodsky pointed out that because a museum requires a high price when selling an artwork, the work may end up in the hands of a private collector, "thus depriving the public of future viewing."
Among factors suggested as contributing to deaccessioning were upward price pressures, "in part caused by auction house practices," and the 1986 change in Federal tax laws that limits tax benefits on donations to museums. The Federal Government has partly restored these benefits for the year 1991, but the memorandum suggests that they be fully restored and that state laws be enacted to give tax benefits to people and corporations donating money or artworks.
In the area of regulating art transactions, the memorandum suggests that "prospective art investors are or may be entitled to the protection of securities or commodities regulations."
 
Rules of Conduct
 The conduct of auction houses and art dealers could be subject to regulation under existing state and Federal laws, the memorandum suggests. As one example, it poses the question of whether the "Irises" transaction should have been registered "pursuant to Federal securities laws." It also raises as one possibility that transactions by auction houses and dealers should come under the provisions of the Martin Act, a New York State law that requires significant disclosure of information on a wide range of securities investments, including those in the theater. Mr. Brodsky said that in 1984, the bill was changed at the last minute to give auction houses a statutory exemption from the Martin Act.
Those testifying at the daylong hearing, which is open to the public, at 270 Broadway, at Chambers Street, are to include the New York City art dealers Richard L. Feigen and David P. Tunick, Gilbert Edelson of the Art Dealers Association of America, and representatives from the city's Department of Consumer Affairs, the auction houses Sotheby's and Christie's, the Appraisers' Association of America and the New York State Association of Museums.

Why Happiness for All Is a Fool's Goal

BYLINE: By HERBERT MITGANG

 BODY:
The True and Only Heaven
Progress and Its Critics
By Christopher Lasch
591 pages. W. W. Norton . $25.
Having seen the United States evolve in the last half-century from the Roosevelt era of social concern for the have-nots to the Reagan era of privilege for the have-mores, Christopher Lasch thinks it's time to brake the motor pulling in the direction of a better life for everybody. In "The True and Only Heaven," he seems to be saying, let's forget the pursuit of happiness for all by government because it's not possible. 
 Mr. Lasch, who teaches history at the University of Rochester, appears consistently negative in his new book. Eleven years ago in "The Culture of Narcissism," he found the personal conduct of many Americans crass and their ambitions superficial. Now he's annoyed by liberal reformers, whom he admired 25 years ago in what is still his most useful book, "The New Radicalism in America, 1889-1963." By contrast, he offers a kinder, gentler treatment of the Reagan Administration's flag bearers.
In a large sense, Mr. Lasch is challenging the reader to take a hard look at the social compact of Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau -- whose ideas of equality and progress are at the core of modern liberal governments -- and see if that unwritten compact is still relevant in the last decade of this century. Of course, all social progress and bets are off when any nation puts its energies and resources into a theater of war, a factor not taken into account in "The True and Only Heaven."
"The assumption that our standard of living (in the broadest meaning of that term) will undergo a steady improvement colors our view of the past as well as our view of the future," the author writes. "It gives rise to a nostalgic yearning for bygone simplicity -- the other side of the ideology of progress. Nostalgia, not to be equated simply with the remembrance of things past, is better understood as an abdication of memory."
Mr. Lasch is anything but nostalgic. He makes the startling assumption that the middle class has ceased to exist. Citing a study by the United Auto Workers, he says a middle-class income (between $20,000 and $60,000 a year in 1985 dollars, as defined by the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics) allows a family to buy a 2-year-old car and keep it for 4 years, to buy a vacuum cleaner that would have to last for 14 years and a toaster for 33 years, to go to the movies once every 3 months and to save nothing at all. He says that more than half of American households now owe more than they are worth.
Yet as Michael Harrington pointed out three decades ago in "The Other America," poverty is a relative condition; there is indeed a distinction between the truly poor and the middle class, even with its car payments, mortgages and unbalanced checkbooks. Undoubtedly, the struggling unemployed would gladly trade places with such a supposedly nonexistent middle class.
There's a certain contrary attitude -- expressed in the subtitle "Progress and Its Critics" -- that runs through the book. Mr. Lasch has a remarkable ability to admire and deplore in the same breath. For example, on a broad class of Americans:
"I have no intention of minimizing the narrowness and provincialism of lower-middle-class culture; nor do I deny that it has produced racism, nativism, anti-intellectualism and all the other evils so often cited by liberal critics. But liberals have lost sight of what is valuable in lower-middle-class culture in their eagerness to condemn what is objectionable. Their attack on 'Middle America,' which eventually gave rise to a counterattack against liberalism -- the main ingredient in the rise of the new right -- has blinded them to the positive features of petty-bourgeois culture: its moral realism, its understanding that everything has its price, its respect for limits, its skepticism about progress." But can racism, nativism and anti-intellectualism be confined to only one American class?
Of the Reagan legacy, Mr. Lasch says it included "economic conservatism and cultural liberalism." It's hard to imagine what cultural liberalism existed in the anti-libertarian 1980's. The author writes that what Mr. Reagan really cared about was "the revival of the unregulated capitalism of the 20's: the repeal of the New Deal." He adds that Mr. Reagan made himself the champion of "traditional values," before he mounted his horse and rode off into the California sunset.
In his synthesis of American political and personal life in "The True and Only Heaven," Mr. Lasch turns to the writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson, William James, Thomas Carlyle, Reinhold Niebuhr and others. These are the most appealing sections of the book. He also touches upon his own changing values as a former leftist who, he admits, once found Marxism indispensable. The old-fashioned values that appeal to the author now may be discerned from the epigraph that provides his book with its fancy title. It's from "The Celestial Railroad," by Nathaniel Hawthorne:
"Many passengers stop to take their pleasure or make their profit in (Vanity) Fair, instead of going onward to the Celestial City. Indeed, such are the charms of the place that people often affirm it to be the true and only heaven; stoutly contending that there is no other, that those who seek further are mere dreamers, and that, if the fabled brightness of the Celestial City lay but a bare mile beyond the gates of vanity, they would not be fools enough to go thither."
In his vision of "The True and Only Heaven" for America in the 1990's, Mr. Lasch seems to play it safely down the middle of the last century.

Bill Moyers on Saving the Children

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
In reporting tonight on what he calls "small but crucial victories," Bill Moyers brings home the dimensions of the nation's failure to save tens of thousands of teen-agers from the streets, the jails, the shadows of despair. "All Our Children With Bill Moyers," at 8 on Channels 13, 31 and 49 and at 9 on Channel 21, is a 90-minute visit to three cities that are trying in similar ways to rescue adolescents who seemed beyond the help of regular schools.
Whether in Columbus, Ind., San Antonio or Cambridge, Mass., the youths' backgrounds are only too familiar: broken homes, physical abuse, teen-age pregnancy, truancy, drugs, crime. By the time they come into the special programs, many have given up hope and are a burden or a threat to the community. 
 In Columbus, Mr. Moyers talks to administrators and to a few of the 60 teen-agers in the Joy Howe Program, which, with the cooperation of City Hall and local banks, hospitals and individuals, is able to give one-on-one instruction and assistance. The schooling here includes such basics as getting to class on time, wearing neckties on "dress up" day, removing tattoos and practicing for job interviews.
Joy Howe costs about $2,000 more for each student than a regular school each year, but if what it seems to be doing for 16-year-old Jake is at all typical, it's a bargain. After a childhood of divorced parents, foster homes, moves from school to school, drug use and involvement with a Satanic cult, the surprisingly well-spoken and reflective young man has found that he has a gift for tutoring younger children. With them he seems to be finding the respect he has never had. "I like people to look up to me," he says.
You may be left with a hunch that Mr. Moyers was introduced to the most promising students, but he keeps his feet on the ground. Once, teen-agers could count on getting unskilled jobs in industries in and around Columbus, but the economy has not been kind to the town, and now school dropouts find themselves adrift.
In San Antonio, too, without at least a high school diploma, the likely future for a teen-ager is a minimum-wage job in a restaurant or hotel. Here, most of the dropouts are Hispanic youths. In a city that leads the country in births among girls under 15, Mr. Moyers reports on the help young mothers are getting in learning to care for their babies and themselves as they work toward degrees. One such program costs $100,000 a year for about 40 mothers; generations on welfare cost much more.
In Cambridge, as in the other cities, schools are compelled to play roles once left to the family, as they try to put some order and hope into confused young lives. The Cambridge high school that Mr. Moyers visits -- about half the students are black or Hispanic -- has reduced the dropout rate from 25 percent to less than 5 percent in the last 10 years.
Sympathetic teachers and administrators tell of the severe problems at home that can easily wear down a teen-ager, and you can't help rooting for the young man and woman focused on here, both of whom seem to be on their way to college.
The future for even the most successful of the unlucky teen-agers who are lucky enough to be in one of these programs, however, is still hard. Although winning a diploma and the sense of self-regard that goes with it mean a lot to the individual, it may not count for all that much in a society in recession. Perhaps matters of that sort will be raised in the live hourlong discussion that follows "All Our Children."

HEADLINE: Metropolitan Diary

BYLINE: By Ron Alexander

 BODY:
A FRIEND writes:
Growing up on Long Island, I longed for an apartment of my own in Greenwich Village. Not the Village as it was then (this was the 1950's) but as it had been in the 30's and 40's, an era of coffeehouses, checkered tablecloths, candles dripping in Chianti bottles, glamour. Symbolizing the Village for me most of all was the Village Vanguard on Seventh Avenue South, home of jazz musicians and smart sophisticated on-their-way-to-fame entertainers like Betty Comden, Adolph Green and Judy Holliday, who were part of a group called the Revuers, performing smart 1940's sophisticated songs and patter. Oh, to perform there. Oh, to write smart 1940's sophisticated songs and patter.
Flash-forward 20 years or so: I move to the Village, and wonder of wonders, my apartment is across the avenue from the Vanguard. Bracketed now between a pizza parlor and a Chicken Lickin', the canopied building is still an exciting symbol of bohemia.
Which brings us to a week or so ago. On my way to the bank my paycheck slipped out of my jacket pocket. Payment was stopped; still, it was an unsettling experience. Late that afternoon my phone rang. "Hello," a friendly voice said. "This is Mrs. Gordon of the Village Vanguard." Fame at last, I thought. "We found your paycheck," she said. Well, that was good news, too. The check, with my address on it, had blown across the avenue and landed in front of the Vanguard. "We like to watch out for our neighbors," Mrs. Gordon said, "and we're glad you're one of them."
I'd never have dared dream that.
A woman we know, recently unemployed, was filling out assorted forms at a midtown temp agency when she overheard the conversation of two clerk-receptionists who were going through a steep stack of applications.
Woman One: Oh, look. Another urban planner!
Woman Two: Yeah. Yesterday I had one with a doctorate.
Woman One: I had one with a doctorate in philosophy. What could she have been thinking?

Dear Diary:
It was the day after the season's first big snowfall, and people were doing their best to skirt or hop over the inevitable pools of slush. I had broad-jumped onto the southwest corner of Third Avenue and 86th Street and was waiting to cross uptown when a woman of a certain age suddenly appeared at my side and held out her hand. She stared straight ahead, a cigarette clenched in her lips, her expression impatient yet dignified.
Instinctively, I took her hand and as the light changed began to escort her across the slush. I helped her traverse the puddle; she held my hand tightly until we reached the other side. There she thanked me and went on her way.
I walked a bit up Third before glancing back over my shoulder. She had crossed to another corner and was waiting to cross yet again. I wondered: had I been no more than the latest gallant young man that day to accompany her around those slushy streets? -- LINCOLN ANDERSON
 
Dear Diary:
The recent brouhaha over Frank Sinatra's 75th birthday -- concerts, TV special, etc., etc. -- reminded me of the time, several years back, when walking down Madison Avenue I overheard a male and female wondering aloud exactly who it was Diahann Carroll had married.
She: It was a singer.
He: Robert Frost.
She: No. He's a poet. She married a singer.
He: I meant David Frost.
She: No, not him. She married a singer.
Me, interrupting: Excuse me. She married Vic Damone.
She: That's who! Vic Damone!
He: Imagine. A question about a singer and the answer isn't Frank Sinatra.

 BUNNY MULLINS ON LIFE

 Disease, crime, the boring shmattes
 The stores are showing.
 The loss of the rain forest.
 Ozone, which is bad at ground level
 But good for us in the atmosphere,
 And of all things to affect my life,
 Trade deficits: And drugs
 Turn out to be good for you,
 Even Valium if you're dependent,
 And it's so much work
 To fall in love these days.
 When did life stop being fun?

Mr. Bush's War Strategy

BYLINE: By Leslie H. Gelb; Tom Wicker is ill.

 BODY:
With the irrevocable default of diplomacy to the will of Saddam Hussein and George Bush, the brave and frightened now begin to settle accounts. There is a hush, a reverence, an emptiness as leaders bow to the inevitability of their decisions.
 For the moment, the wisdom or folly of those decisions is beyond useful analysis and argument. 
 Possibly still within reach are matters of how the war will be fought. War strategy is of overriding importance because its conduct will profoundly affect the balance of power in the Mideast and U.S. relations with the Arab world.
 There are always grounds for concern here as political leaders and generals inescapably refight their last war, and often draw the wrong lessons.
 Almost from the day President Bush committed U.S. forces to the Persian Gulf, he pledged to avoid the mistakes of Vietnam. To him and his military advisers, the central strategic mistake of that war was gradualism. The theory there was to apply force incrementally in order to avoid a larger war with China or the Soviet Union and to give North Vietnam an incentive to negotiate.
 Military experts have good reasons to quarrel with that strategy. But the question at hand is whether the virtually opposite approach makes sense for warfare in the gulf.
 From the outset, Mr. Bush has promised massive force for a quick and decisive victory. As fighting begins, he can still look hard at exactly what that goal might mean.
 Does massive mean, for example, that U.S. bombers can attack any target in Iraq? If so, the repercussions would be grave. It is one thing to launch precision missiles against command centers in Baghdad. It is another to strike at chemical factories where the debris could be lethal to thousands of civilians. America's long-run interests are to spare the Iraqi people and economy, even if some military targets are left standing.
 What exactly does "quick" mean? Does it mean that if Iraqi forces in Kuwait do not surrender after one or two weeks, or three months for that matter, the U.S. will launch land attacks? It is difficult to see the need in that course. If supply lines between Iraq and Kuwait are as vulnerable as the Pentagon says, they can be sliced day and night, leaving Iraqi troops in Kuwait stranded and waiting to run out of water and ammunition.
 The U.S. has no strategic interest in quick victory in Kuwait if quick means high American casualties. If others like Egypt and Saudi Arabia want to make a bloody land attack to free Kuwait, the U.S. should offer all available air and artillery support, and nothing else.
 The meaning of "decisive" is not self-evident either. Clearly the U.S. needs to destroy Iraq's nuclear and chemical weapons and ability to strike from the air. But America has no strategic interest in devastating Iraqi ground forces. Without air power, Iraq cannot easily threaten any of its neighbors except Kuwait. But without sizable ground forces, Iraq would become easy prey later for Syria or Iran.
 It is also of vital political importance that our key allies participate visibly and officially in air attacks against Iraq itself. Thus Riyadh's decision to join in the bombing of Iraq was critical to not leaving the U.S. and the British alone to bear subsequent Arab hostility.
 Even with the war under way, we can still have a strategy with the following objectives:
* Rapid destruction of Iraq's will to fight and launch attacks. The key to victory lies in Baghdad, not Kuwait.
* Concentration on quickly demolishing Iraq's offensive military power -- aircraft, missiles, headquarters and stockpiles -- while avoiding targets that would entail high loss of civilian life. The present threat comes from the Iraqi regime and its striking power; future threat, from Arabs enraged by needless violence.
* Liberation of Kuwait, consistent with our fundamental interests in minimizing American casualties and maintaining credible Iraqi ground forces after the war. The aim is to destroy Iraq's ability to attack its neighbors, not its capacity for self-defense.
 President Bush, not the Pentagon bureaucracy, is Commander in Chief. With war under way, it is his responsibility to insure attention to strategic and political interests as well as pure military requirements. But however fought, there should be no doubt that Saddam Hussein -- first and last -- bears the core moral responsibility for the war.

HEADLINE: No Merchants of Death

 BODY:
Amid all the terrifying prospects over war in the Persian Gulf, one fear can be safely dismissed: The U.S. economy can withstand such a war, even a prolonged one.
The costs, in any foreseeable circumstances, would amount to only a tiny fraction of the nation's total output. And the usual economic threat posed by a war -- of overheating the economy and sparking an inflationary spiral -- does not apply in the present climate of recession. 
 Figures from the Defense Department and the Congressional Budget Office suggest that Operation Desert Shield will, assuming no war, cost the U.S. about $30 billion this year. Contributions from the allies might cover half that and some can be made up with cuts elsewhere in the military budget. The net cost to the U.S. should be about $12 billion.
That amount could build a lot of schools, bridges and laboratories. But it represents less than 0.2 percent of the nation's output of goods and services, in a $5.5 trillion economy.
If war comes, costs would skyrocket. Gordon Adams of the Defense Budget Project estimates spending might rise to between $500 million and $1 billion per day. In three months that could mean an economic jolt in excess of $45 billion. But even figures like that, while not trivial, would be far from ruinous.
The extra spending will add to the deficit, but that's not of primary importance either. What threatens the economy, and what Congress targeted in last year's budget bill, are permanent sources of deficit. Over time, they divert savings from private capital formation. Temporary deficits, resulting from war and recession, pose no such threat. Indeed, during recession Federal borrowing does not crowd out private investment because corporations aren't borrowing very much.
Ordinarily, wars require huge increases of military hardware. Not this time. The end of the cold war means that Congress won't have to replace all the lost equipment. There are cynics who contend that America's militance in the gulf has an economic undertone -- that arms merchants stand to profit. But this war would be fought from inventories built up to counter an ominous Soviet threat that no longer exists. War profits will be slim, exposing the cynics for what they really are: demagogues.
The need for ammunition, missiles, boots and other consumable equipment will spur the economies of Florida, California and a few other states. But the overall impact on the economy will be barely noticeable.
There's no more certainty in predicting the economic outcome of war than the military outcome. Surprises are the rule. Consumers and investors could become scared and hold back, worsening the recession. Or the extra burst of military spending could give the economy a small boost. But unless a war turned into a quagmire, most of these effects would be temporary and modest.
In short, the U.S. can decide to fight, postpone or avoid a gulf war depending on which strategy best protects the nation's security. Economic considerations are secondary, and small.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Economists Start to Fret Again About Population" (Science Times, Dec. 18), you write of the economist Julian Simon, "he noted that population growth could also stimulate productivity." And, "More people, he speculated, would mean more heads to invent good ideas for improving technology." Mr. Simon errs through inattention to Malthusian logic. The problems caused by more people arise from interactions that increase exponentially relative to the number of people; but the number of heads increases (count them!) linearly with population growth. Thus, human problems continually outstrip the capacity of human brains to cope with them.

John Hancock Preview Of Changes at the Top

BYLINE: By Daniel F. Cuff

 BODY:
John Hancock Financial Services, the nation's ninth-largest insurer, announced changes at the top yesterday that will take place a year from now.
Stephen L. Brown, 54 years old, will become chairman and chief executive, succeeding E. James Morton, who will retire at age 65 after five years as chairman and 42 years with the company. Mr. Brown, now president and chief operations officer, will be succeeded in that position by William L. Boyan, 57. 
 "We generally do things pretty far in advance around here," Mr. Morton said yesterday, referring to the early announcement of the changes, "although this might be a record." He added that the company wanted to announce the change before scheduled meetings of salespeople.
One of those businesses, the John Hancock Freedom Securities Corporation, had an announcement of its own yesterday. It named George V. McGough the chairman and chief executive of its broker-dealer unit, Sutro & Company in San Francisco, and its parent, the Sutro Group. Mr. McGough, 50, is a longtime executive of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
The official name of the Boston-based company is the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, but that is relegated to small print on the company's stationery. "We call ourselves John Hancock Financial Services because we're in so many businesses," Mr. Morton said.
John Hancock, unlike some companies in the insurance industry, has not yet shown any cracks in its financial underpinnings. It is a mutual company, owned by policyholders, as is the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, which has said it will go public to raise needed capital.
"We weren't as aggressive as the Equitable was," Mr. Morton said. "We have had in 1989, and it appears also in 1990, the two best years in our history in terms of improved balance sheet and earnings.
"But I don't care to predict the future. We probably have an above-average holding of real estate. A lot of people worry about that. We've had a low rate of default and delinquencies, but we do wonder what the future will hold, and certainly if there is a long recession, we will take some hits also."
Mr. Morton has taken some maverick positions on industry issues. He advocates pro-competitive legislation that would, for example, allow banks in insurance, not a popular industry position. But he protested yesterday that what he really wanted was to allow insurance companies to own banks as the quid pro quo. "Our position has been for rational reform for many years now," he said, adding that he did not quite understand the iconoclast tag affixed to him.
Mr. Morton is a Yale graduate who joined the company in 1949 as an actuarial trainee. His successor, Mr. Brown, also advanced through the actuarial department after joining Hancock in 1958.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Maze of Troubles Posing Challenges To Power and Popularity of Dinkins

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
As he confronts the fiscal problems that may be the biggest challenge of his career, Mayor David N. Dinkins faces cracks in his political coalition, malaise among his staff, aspersions on his integrity and the acknowledged prospect that "things may worsen before they improve."
In preparing the preliminary city budget that he is to present today, Mr. Dinkins's closest aides say, the Mayor showed both moments of despair and more optimism than most of them feel. Yet events and his own dogged responses to them have combined to keep him on the defensive for months, undermining his popularity and probably his power. 
 At times, even Mr. Dinkins, whose cautious rise through clubhouse politics led few to foresee his fate, seems almost unable to believe the peculiar burdens that have befallen him.
"I've fought this fight my entire life," he said last week, trying to reassure a coalition of social-service organizations, whose representatives were protesting his budget cuts, that he would not forsake them. "Indeed, I didn't start out to become mayor of this city. It happened along the way."
 
Some Deep Doubts
 So serious are the economic problems -- a budget gap of $2 billion, spending cuts of nearly $1 billion and more than $500 million in proposed new or higher taxes -- and so deep are the doubts about how they can be resolved that Mr. Dinkins finds few champions these days.
At a meeting Monday night in Springfield Gardens, Queens, the most rock-solid turf in his election, he received a friendly but flat reception from worried residents. At a sodden breakfast meeting with business leaders in Manhattan yesterday, he had to prompt them to applaud, even when he announced a droplet of good news: he will begin reducing, by one-quarter of a percentage point a year, the 6 percent commercial rent tax that has been anathema to them.
On Saturday, the Mayor interrupted an all-day budget meeting at Gracie Mansion to visit the Rev. Al Sharpton in a Brooklyn hospital after he had been stabbed in Bensonhurst. As he returned, the Mayor briefly held his head in his hands. "I thought, 'Oh, boy,' " one senior adviser said.
On top of everything else, a report last week from an independent city investigation into a stock transaction between Mr. Dinkins and his son found evidence that cast doubt on the Mayor's account of events. While not recommending any further legal action, the chief investigator took the unusual step of saying that he had not cleared the Mayor, either.
Amid such stress, his aides say, Mr. Dinkins is acutely conscious and proud of his special role as the city's first black mayor -- especially to the children he cites as his most precious constituents. The aides say he is privately defiant and determined not only to endure but also to prevail.
But as the Mayor struggles, there are complaints from commissioners, the City Council and state officials that he does not meet with them often enough. Last week, after Transportation Commissioner Lucius J. Riccio dismissed a deputy who had warned about dangers on the Manhattan Bridge, it developed that the Mayor had not met one on one with Mr. Riccio in his entire tenure, instead communicating through deputy mayors.
For a Mayor often faulted as lacking decisiveness, every decision has its pitfalls. In ruling, for the moment, against closing any more fire companies after a fatal fire blocks from the site of a recently closed engine company in Queens, Mr. Dinkins insisted on Monday that the move was not related to assertions by firefighters that the deaths might have been avoided if the fire company had been open -- claims that the administration disputes.
The Mayor may have wisely weighed the political risks in further closings, but he also risked planting deeper worry in the public mind that such closings are devoutly to be feared, and this might make it even more difficult for him to close more fire companies later if he must to balance the budget, as he says he might.
 
Too Full a Plate?
 His aides insist such choices are ultimately the Mayor's alone, but they suggest that his plate may sometimes get too full. "He tends to put the same kind of energy into a smaller issue as into one that is major," one aide said. "He doesn't not pay attention to the big stuff, but it's disarming."
Another senior adviser said the Mayor had gone over and over the budget decisions and details to assure that he knew them back and forth. "It's not something that people are ever going to place in front of him and prompt him," the aide said.
On the other hand, senior aides acknowleged that Mr. Dinkins did not have adequate control of his time. Plans are in the works for staff changes intended to better organize his team.
The most significant speculation has centered on his chief political aide and former campaign manager, Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch, who 10 days ago was widely reported by several of his friends to be on the verge of leaving, until the Mayor implored him to stay. Mr. Lynch has denied such speculation, but not discouraged it. While saying he had no immediate plans to leave, he conceded in a recent interview that it has been a troubled time for him.
"Yes, my soul is bleeding, for the Mayor and this trying year," said Mr. Lynch. "When there's a mistake or a miscue, or we don't do something, it ends up at his feet."
Mr. Lynch said he blames himself for much of the criticism the Mayor received for his handling of a bitter black-led boycott of Korean-American grocery stores in Brooklyn, and the difficulties in lobbying the City Council and the Legislature that have delayed passage of Mr. Dinkins's proposed anti-crime package.
But Mr. Lynch also bore major responsibility for some of the administration's biggest successes: the Mayor's speech on racial harmony at a tense moment last spring, drawing the 1992 Democratic National Convention to New York and playing host to Nelson Mandela.
 
Some Changes Ahead
 As budget problems have dominated the agenda, First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel, always pre-eminent on the organizational charts but new to the Mayor's inner circle, has moved more and more to the fore. Senior officials say they expect that John Flateau, a former campaign aide, will come to City Hall as the Mayor's chief of staff, in charge of his schedule and taking over functions once assigned to Ken Sunshine, a Lynch protege shifted to other duties.
Mr. Steisel dismisses suggestions of a rift with Mr. Lynch but has said privately that peristent reports of one make his job difficult. In a sign of the difference between them, the low-key Mr. Lynch once told Mr. Steisel that while he was a good "leader of men," he hoped to make him into a "leader of leaders," less concerned about dominating his colleagues.
Despite such occasional sniping, some senior mayoral aides said they believed the Mayor's circle was working better together than it had. But keeping that up may be tough if finances continue to shrink.
"Nobody likes to feel that their back's against the wall," one senior aide said.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF: Iraq;
Gamble for Hussein: Power or Oblivion

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Jan. 15

 BODY:
President Saddam Hussein goes to the brink of war with the United States and its allies today because, many analysts say they believe, the Iraqi leader is trying to get -- up until the last possible instant -- the thing he most desires: recognition from the West and a protected role as the region's pre-eminent power.
The colossal willpower, stubbornness, ego or megalomania of the 54-year-old Arab leader, whatever the psychoanalysts of history eventually call it, has been one of the most remarkable phenomena of the Persian Gulf crisis that has carried this country of 17 million to the precipice of destructive national combat. 
 Today tens of thousands of Iraqis took to the streets to show that they are prepared to march off the cliff with their leader in defiance of the same ill-defined Western "arrogance" of which the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini so often complained.
 
From Disaster to Advantage
 What is the injury, real or perceived, that has driven Mr. Hussein and the ever-active, ever-organizing Baath party machine he created toward the collision with the daunting military alliance that awaits its orders in the Arabian desert?
After scores of interviews and conversations with Iraqis and foreign diplomats in this capital over the last six weeks and running up to the United Nations deadline, the most coherent conclusion is also the most simple and obvious. Nothing has been going Mr. Hussein's way since the end of the Iran-Iraq War and, under rising economic pressure, he abandoned the veneer of Arab statesman that he tried to burnish after the war and threw his military power angrily at Kuwait in a plunderous gamble that has failed.
Mr. Hussein may have been provoked, as many Arab leaders concede, but the path of violence and retribution he chose against the small emirate that faithfully fueled and financed his military engine during eight years of war with Iran have indelibly marked him as a dangerous and unreliable neighbor for the custodians of the world's oil wealth in the Persian Gulf.
Yet Mr. Hussein, ever determined to turn disaster to advantage, has sought to dig out of the trap Kuwait has proved to be by threatening to pull down the already shaky pillars of Middle Eastern stability unless he get what he wants: a secure role in the region and protection from the neighbors, particularly Israel, which he has so alarmed by his post-war militarism.
"Palestine" and "Holy War" may be the rallying cries of Mr. Hussein's crusade under an Iraqi flag newly inscribed in Arabic with "God Is Great," but politically he is relentlessly pursuing a program of damage control, survival and a new modus vivendi with Washington that would guarantee his future and a role for Iraq in the scales of regional power.
 
Capitulation or War
 As one member of Mr. Hussein's governing Arab Baath Socialist Party recently intimated, Iraq's decision to invade Kuwait may look horrible in retrospect, but Mr. Hussein is determined to make the best deal he can coming out of it, even at the risk of going down in flames and taking, perhaps, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis with him.
Most Iraqis close to the circle of power around Mr. Hussein agree that he has remained sharply focused in the final weeks of brinkmanship on one goal: getting the American Secretary of State, James A. Baker 3d, to come to Baghdad for the kind of Middle Eastern negotiation that would have tested the Bush Administration's diplomatic skill and political endurance.
The fact that Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker denied the Iraqi leader that forum for Iraqi recognition, which Mr. Hussein was carefully preparing as a summit of "mutual respect" among "equals," has forced him to face the most unpleasant of choices: abject capitulation or war.
The penultimate meeting between Mr. Baker and Iraq's Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, was doomed to fail because, Iraqi specialists say, only Mr. Hussein, the tribal leader of a xenophobic political regime, can make concessions from his position of absolute power.
When Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker decided against walking into Mr. Hussein's political den, the Iraqi leader's face-saving choices in the crisis critically narrowed.
Mr. Hussein had already conceded to the Soviet envoy, Yevgeny M. Primakov, that Iraq would lose a war with the gulf alliance, but his retort to the Soviet official was one that may still echo through the presidential palace here until the bombs begin falling.
"If my choice is surrender or fight, I am inclined to fight," Mr. Hussein said, according to a diplomat briefed on the conversation. That is a dangerous choice for a man who gambles as Mr. Hussein does, and there is no shortage of Western, European and Asian diplomats in Baghdad who argue that it is too dangerous.
Partly out of that instinctive fear of Mr. Hussein's violent nature and his willingness to gamble everything to win, many of Washington's friends in Europe and the Middle East have urged the Bush Administration to meet with Mr. Hussein personally and construct the new security regime for the region that would have to recognize his role while providing the face-saving compromise on the Palestinian question to allow for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait.
That is a formula that was not attempted under the no-reward-for-aggression countercrusade by Mr. Bush, and there is no guarantee that such a formula would have worked, many analysts concede. After all, they said, if Mr. Hussein thought he could persuade the Bush Administration to accept that minimum deal to avert war, who can say that Mr. Hussein would not have been inspired to reach for more?

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Finding a Haven In Nestle Stock

BYLINE: By Steven Greenhouse

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
SOME analysts regard Nestle S.A., the world's largest food company, as a haven for investors during this period of geopolitical tension and economic slowdown, even though it has been hurt by the weak dollar and tough competition in the United States.
The way these analysts see it, if recession grips the world and despite the war in the Middle East, everyone will continue to need food. This means millions of people will continue to buy Nestle products, which include Nestle infant formula, Taster's Choice coffee and Stouffer frozen foods. 
 "If there is a worldwide recession, even food manufacturers will come under some pressure, but nothing like some other industries," said Deborah Rees, an analyst with Kleinwort Benson, a London-based brokerage.
Ms. Rees sees Nestle as a good "defensive" stock, one that will be less volatile than many other stocks should the war drive down the markets.
John L. Parker, an analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd, also has a "buy" recommendation for Nestle. "The key to Nestle's short-term performance is the degree to which the markets want to be in a safe haven situation," he said. "Beyond that, over the longer term, there is a pretty positive earnings story in Nestle."
Over the last year, however, Nestle, with $38 billion in 1989 revenues, has not seemed like much of a haven. The company has been bruised and beaten by the strong performance of the Swiss franc and the plunge of the dollar. One-fourth of Nestle's sales are in North America, so the company, based in Vevey, Switzerland, has been hit hard when its American sales are translated into Swiss francs.
A year ago, management was dreaming of a double-digit earnings increase for 1990, but now manyanalysts expect an earnings drop of more than 5 percent. Profits are expected to slide, notwithstanding a 3 percent increase in sales volume last year. The main reason for the drop in earnings is the Swiss franc's 15 percent rise against most currencies last year. Nestle has also been hurt by Brazil's economic crisis and by soaring fuel bills.
Michael Oertli, a Zurich-based analyst with UBS Phillips & Drew, changed his "buy" recommendation to "hold" last November when Nestle announced that its revenues were down almost 6 percent for the first 10 months of 1990 and that its net profits would probably fall for the year. Mr. Oertli is keeping Nestle on "hold," because "the whole situation of the stock market is that you don't have to buy Nestle because Nestle will not outperform the market." While Nestle might have less downward vulnerability than some other stocks, Mr. Oertli does not see huge near-term upward potential.
He forecasts that earnings per share dropped 11 percent drop for 1990, to 585 Swiss francs, or about $455, but he sees earnings per share climbing 8 percent this year, to 631 Swiss francs. Many analysts say Nestle's profits will snap back if the Swiss franc does not continue rising.
"For the long-term investor, we have always said, 'Don't sell Nestle,' " Mr. Oertli said. In yesterday's trading in Zurich, Nestle shares closed at 7,010 Swiss francs, down 50 francs on the day.
Despite the currency fluctuations, many analysts, including Ms. Rees and Mr. Parker, say Nestle's chief executive, Helmut Maucher, has put the company on a solid course. The company's revenues rose 21 percent, to 48 billion Swiss francs in 1989, and its profits rose 17.2 percent, or 656 francs a share, to 2.41 billion Swiss francs. Theseincreases were helped by a 12 percent drop in the Swiss franc in 1989 and a 4 percent jump in sales volume.
In 1988, Nestle bought Buitoni, the pasta maker, and Rowntree, Britain's largest chocolate maker. Nestle is integrating both into its worldwide network, hoping to realize economies of scale and growth. To challenge Kellogg's dominance in ready-to-eat cereals, Nestle set up a joint venture a year ago with General Mills to produce and market cereals in Europe. Then in December it set up a joint venture with Coca-Cola to cooperate in bottling and distributing Nestea iced tea and Nescafe iced coffee in cans. Analysts say both joint ventures have great promise.
Last November Nestle announced it would consolidate its American operations -- Carnation, Stouffer and Ohio-based Nestle Enterprises -- in the hope of achieving efficiencies and making its operations more responsive to the market. At the moment, Nestle's biggest headaches are coming from the United States, which has moved into a recession, while Nestle's other important markets, Asia and Europe, continue to grow. Nestle's pet food and frozen food businesses are coming under pressure as shoppers turn to less expensive alternatives and competitors turn up the pressure. Stouffer used to have 50 percent of the American market for frozen meals, but its market share and margins have been slashed because of tough competition from other frozen entrees, like Weight Watchers and Conagra's Healthy Choice.
"The high margins businesses, those with convenience, are getting hit the most right now," said Bertrand Facon, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, the London-based investment bank.
Mr. Facon's recommendation for Nestle is "hold." He is not pessimistic about Nestle's chances, but since he expects world stock markets to rebound, he says: "People may turn to more cyclical stocks. People who used Nestle in terms of protection could go back to stocks that have more upside potential."
The lesson: If you see the glass half empty, you might buy Nestle. If you see it half full, you might look for more promising, cyclical stocks.

HEADLINE: Romania Seeks to Reduce Abortions

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUCHAREST, Romania

 BODY:
The scarcity and high cost of contraceptives here as well as a lack of easily available information about birth control have left abortion as the primary means of family planning, slowing the country's recovery from the harsh population building policies of its former Communist dictator, health officials here said.
In his eagerness to swell the population of Romania from its present level of 23 million, Nicolae Ceaucescu had made the possession of any birth-control device a crime while outlawing abortions. All aspects of that policy were reversed after his overthrow and execution. But in the absence of other means, there has been an increase in the number of abortions. 
 "It is an emergency," said Alin Stanescu, director of the Romanian Health Ministry's mother and child protection division. "We agree that abortion is not good. But we have no choice for the time being."
In 1990, Romanian physicians performed about a million abortions on about 600,000 women, said Dr. Sorin Puia, director of Bucharest's Sirbu obstetric clinic and president of a family-planning organization.
 
A Legacy of Ceaucescu
 Some women underwent as many as three or four abortions, Mr. Stanescu said.
Romania, which has 5.5 million women of child-bearing age, now records about three abortions for every live birth, about the opposite of the ratio in the United States and most Western European countries, said Julia Plotnick, an American nurse working with Romania's Health Ministry on a family-planning program.
"What is for certain is that education about the use of contraceptives is necessary," said Mr. Stanescu as he explained why so many were resorting to the low-cost abortions. "A large part of the population doesn't know about birth control."
The problems facing the family-planning effort are in some ways a legacy of the Ceaucescu' regime's 1966 decision to outlaw all abortion and contraception as a result of the dictator's conviction that maximum population growth would pave Romania's way to economic prosperity.
 
The Human Consequences
 "He wanted everything to be the biggest, the biggest plan, the biggest house, the biggest birth rate," Mr. Stanescu said. "He did not consider the human consequences."
"Medical personnel, teachers, everyone was instructed to advocate a high birth rate," he said, adding that the secret police kept doctors and pregnant women under surveillance. Those suspected of interrupting or preventing pregnancies faced prosecution and often went to jail.
According to experts like Mr. Stanescu, that situation led many, perhaps even millions of women, to turn to quack abortionists.
Some women used sharp instruments in efforts to bring on miscarriages; others douched with water and salt or soap, antibiotics, an anti-coagulant and other drugs, shaving cream, linden tea and other folk-medicine concoctions, said Dr. Puia adding that such methods exacted a heavy toll.
 
Cervical Inflammation
 In the first half of 1989, the last year of Mr. Ceaucescu's rule, 626 women died as a direct result of back-room abortions, Dr. Puia said. About 400,000 women were hospitalized in 1989 for bleeding and other abortion-related complications.
About 40 percent of the 100,000 women that Sirbu clinic treats suffer chronic cervical inflammation as a result of back-room abortions, while 10 percent suffer inflammation of other parts of their reproductive systems, he said, adding that those figures are probably representative of the entire female population.
Dr. Puia said the widespread injuries caused by back-room abortions had produced an abnormally high incidence of premature births and made it imperative for specialists to examine women before prescribing even some of the safest contraceptives.
Three days after the December 1989 revolution that overthrew Mr. Ceausescu, Romania's provisional Government decreed Europe's most liberal abortion law. An abortion in Romania today costs about the same as a beer, far less expensive than a regular supply contraceptives, which are very hard to find regardless of price.
 
'Lack of Trust' in System
 The Government is afraid of raising the price of legal abortions because it might drive poor people back to quack abortionists, Mr. Stanescu said.
Romania's Health Ministry has made sex education, implementation of a family-planning program and initiation of domestic contraception production top priorities to cutdown on abortions, Mr. Stanescu said. Romania must now use scarce hard currency to import all its birth-control devices.
The problem is to educate people and medical personnel about contraceptives and develop a domestic industry that will be able to produce inexpensive birth-control devices, Ms. Plotnick said. But unlike children's homes in Romania, whose miserable conditions attracted substantial Western assistance after the revolution, obtaining foreign aid for family planning is a serious problem.
"The big play here is for the children in the institutions, not family planning," she said, explaining that $500,000 would be enough to implement a family-planning program.
"The Romanians have good ideas but no money," she said. "They could do it in a year with some funding and technology from the outside."
"As a professional I would rather spend my time delivering children than performing abortions," Dr. Puia said, expressing hope that 1991 would see the number of abortions drop. "It is an obligation to be optimistic."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Decline Slightly

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Although war fears remained pervasive in the credit markets yesterday, comments about the economy by the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, were the major cause of a slight drop in the prices of Treasury securities.
Despite the decline in the price of bonds and notes, short-term Treasury bill rates continued to move lower. 
 Much of the very limited activity in yesterday's market, which closed before hostilities began in the Midde East, was in reaction to a report in The Washington Post that Mr. Greenspan had told a luncheon meeting on Tuesday that the economy seemed to have bottomed out in the fourth quarter. He made the remarks following a morning meeting with President Bush, the article said.
"The Greenspan comments hurt the front end pretty badly," one government bond trader said. "But to me, it seems to be part of a concerted effort to build up the confidence of businessmen. I don't think it indicates anything adverse for monetary policy."
 
Troublesome Data
 In addition, analysts said that economic data released yesterday did not necessarily bear out Mr. Greenspan's analysis.
Specifically, analysts said they were troubled by the six-tenths of 1 percent decline in industrial output for December, a figure the Fed released yesterday. The decline, the third consecutive monthly drop, was much larger than most analysts had been anticipating.
"The production numbers were dramatically weaker than expected," said Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J.
But with war anticipated, credit market participants shrugged off the industrial production figures as well as a report that the consumer price index had risen by three-tenths of 1 percent last month, slightly higher than expected.
 
Bond Yield Unchanged
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 103 27/32 late yesterday, down 1/ 32, to yield 8.39 percent, unchanged from late Tuesday.
Among note issues, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 101 29/ 32, down 3/32, to yield 8.21 percent. And the 7 1/4 percent two-year notes dipped by 3/32, to a price of 100 1/8, to yield 7.17 percent.
Late yesterday, the Treasury announced it would sell $12.5 billion worth of new two-year notes on Wednesday and $9 billion of new five-year notes on Jan. 24.
Following the announcement, the two-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 7.17 percent. The five-year notes were offered at a price to yield 7.82 percent.
Interest rates on short-term Treasury bills were unchanged to down slightly. By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 6.03 percent, down 2 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates were unchanged, at a discount rate of 6.14 percent.
 
Port Authority Issue
 In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey sold $100 million of securities at competitive bid.
A bid from a group led by Lehman Brothers won the issue, which consists of serial bonds with maturities from 1992 through 1996 and from 2006 through 2012, and a term bond that matures in 2026.
The term bond, which represents more than 60 percent of the issue, was reoffered at a price to yield 7.08 percent.
The issue is rated A-1 by Moody's Investors Service and AA- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In the secondary market for municipal bonds, traders said that prices of most widely quoted issues were unchanged on the day.
Corporate bond traders said that prices of most issues in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds were unchanged to up about 1/8 point.

HEADLINE: National Tests Urged for Public Schools

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16

 BODY:
A Presidential advisory group recommended to President Bush today the creation for the first time of national examinations for elementary and high school students.
The President's Education Policy Advisory Committee, a diverse group of 25 educators and business leaders, met with Mr. Bush for 50 minutes to discuss their recommendations and to call on him to "regain the crown" as the education President that he has said he wishes to be. The recommendations, which are not yet in final form, carry no legal weight, and it remains to be seen what Mr. Bush can or will do with them. 
 A White House spokesman said the meeting gave the President the opportunity to hear from a number of leaders. "He hasn't offered any position yet," the official said. "It's clear in the past that we do need to measure progress. But he hasn't made up his mind. This wasn't a decision meeting."
A Department of Education background paper released last August said the Administration was willing to support some form of national testing as long as the Federal Government's role was limited.
 
Monitoring Report Urged
 The recommendations urge Mr. Bush to create and issue "a regular report on the tests" so school officials and parents would know how the various tests reflected whatever national standards the White House and the nation's governors develop.
The establishment of national examinations would be politically sensitive. In Japan, Germany and most other industrial nations, student performance is driven by national examinations, but there has been longstanding resistance to such tests in the United States.
Some states fear showing poorly compared to other states; others argue that such tests could lead to a national, standardized curriculum, perhaps in many subjects, and remove control of curriculum from state and local jurisdiction. Still others fear that such examinations could determine a person's educational and career future.
"Teachers would teach to these standards," said Paul H. O'Neill, chief executive officer of the Aluminum Company of America and chairman of the advisory group. Without giving a breakdown of the vote, he said "the majority view of the committee" was to support such standards.
 
Strong Dissenting Voice
 At least one panel member disagreed. Joe Nathan, senior fellow at the Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota, has argued that American students are already tested too much. He feels that the panel should be investigating new ways of motivating students.
"The Federal Government can't just wave its hand and tell legislatures, 'Don't have your testing program' or tell local districts, 'Don't have your tests'," Mr. Nathan said. "Given the experience we've had with testing, a national test will end up stifling the most effective, the most creative and the finest teachers we have. I would find it ironic that an Administration that came in saying that it wanted to reduce the number of rules and regulations ended up imposing an extremely disruptive and negative set of tests on the country."
But Mr. O'Neill and other members of the advisory group argue that national tests are the only way to reach the national education goals for the year 2000 set by the President and the governors last March.
"The reason to have a national standard is to make sure we change," Mr. O'Neill said.
William T. Brock, former Secretary of Labor, said that giving parents the right to choose the schools their children would attend, a policy favored by the Administration, required establishing national standards so parents would be able to determine where their children would get the best education.
 
Testing for Job Skills
 The National Center on Education and the Economy, a nonprofit group, has also been considering plans to create a national examination to certify that young people have attained the skills and knowledge necessary for either further education or the job market. The Commisssion on the Skills of the American Workforce, a group of education and labor leaders, last June proposed that all 16-year-olds take a test to gain a certificate that employers could require as a job credential.
The only current Federal examination program is the National Assessment of Educational Progress, widely known as NAEP. The program conducts tests in various subjects like mathematics, reading, writing and science at the fourth-, eighth- and 12th-grade levels, reporting what students know but making no judgments about what they ought to know.
As a first step toward those judgments, NAEP is preparing to set national standards for its mathematics tests that would rank student achievement in fourth, eighth and 12th grades as "basic," "proficient" or "advanced," based on what a pupil should be able to do at those levels.
Some have argued that these standards should be the basis of any future national test, but NAEP is having difficulty getting broad agreement within its ranks on what should constitute each achievement level.

HEADLINE: Cutbacks Bring Loss At GlenFed

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LEV, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 16

 BODY:
GlenFed Inc., parent of the nation's fourth-largest savings and loan association, said today that it would add to loan-loss reserves, sell some assets, freeze management salaries and suspend its dividend. The company also said it would eliminate 600 jobs in the next quarter through attrition, but layoffs were not ruled out.
GlenFed said the moves, which it called "necessary and prudent," would result in a $140.8 million loss for the quarter. 
 On the New York Stock Exchange, GlenFed's shares dropped 87.5 cents each, to $4.625. The 15.9 percent decline was among the biggest of the day on the Big Board. In addition, the Standard & Poor's Corporation lowered its credit rating to speculative grade on some debt of the Glendale Federal Bank, the company's banking subsidiary.
 
New Capital Rules
 GlenFed, which has $24.4 billion in assets and operates 235 branches of Glendale Federal in California, Washington and Florida, said it wanted to protect itself better from the effects of continued recession, as well as to insure that it stays in compliance with strict new capital requirements intended to keep the industry solvent.
"This positions the company on a pre-emptive basis to continue to meet the capital guidelines," said Keith P. Russell Jr., GlenFed's president.
Analysts said they had expected Glenfed's moves, which follow similar changes at banks and several other large California savings and loans.
In lowering the credit rating, Standard's & Poor's noted that the quarterly loss would cut into the bank's capital levels. S.& P. also said GlenFed's "moderately high exposure" in commercial real estate markets in Calfifornia could leave it vulnerable. But it added that today's moves might ultimately improve GlenFed's earnings power.
 
Reserves Are Increased
 GlenFed said it would add $141.8 million to its loan-loss reserves and reduce the value of some loans and real estate assets by about $75 million. Money was also set aside to cover the sale of the North American Title Company subsidiary to management.
GlenFed said it would carry out cost-cutting measures to save more than $160 million a year beginning within 18 months. The moves include cutting jobs and freezing management salaries for 18 months.
The company's board voted not to declare a quarterly dividend and probably will not resume payments for at least one year.
The quarterly loss compares with net earnings of $39.9 million, or $1.30 a share, in the period a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Drop of 0.6% in U.S. Output Erodes Hopes on Recession

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16

 BODY:
A new Government report today showed a surprisingly big decline in industrial output that analysts said eroded confidence in the widely held, though far from unanimous, view that the recession would be brief and mild.
The decline of six-tenths of 1 percent was the third straight drop in production by the nation's factories, mines and utilities and brought the drop for the final quarter of 1990 to an annual rate of nearly 8 percent below that of the July-September period. 
 The drop in output, which many economists had expected would be negligible, showed the economy was still sinking rapidly last month when many analysts believed the decline had lost momentum, said David W. Berson, chief economist for the Federal National Mortgage Association, a relative optimist himself. "There's no solace in these numbers for those who think the recession will be short."
 
Diminished Prospects
 The general view remained, however, that while the gross national product would contract during the current quarter, the decline would be less than the 2 to 4 percent that probably occurred in the fourth quarter. If so, this would support the Bush Administration and others in their contention that the worst of the recession is already past, but today's figures did seem to reduce the prospects that a turnaround would come soon. The report on the fourth-quarter G.N.P. is due Jan. 25.
"These output numbers are very weak," said Daniel Friel, an economist at the NCNB Corporation, in Charlotte, N.C.. He added that he found in them none of the signs of stability referred to this week by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, in an article today in The Washington Post.
 
Factory Use Slumps
 In related data, the Federal Reserve also found that utilization of industrial capacity slumped six-tenths of a point, to 80.4 percent, last month, and that utilization in manufacturing slumped nine-tenths of a point, to 79.3 percent.
In other Government reports today, the Labor Department calculated that consumer prices climbed three-tenths of 1 percent last month, slightly more than anticipated, while the Commerce Department disclosed that business inventories rose while sales fell in November. The widely followed ratio of inventories to sales now stands at 1.50, up from 1.48, meaning it would take one and a half months to use up stocks at that the November sales pace. [Page D8.]
The December decline in industrial output, while only one-third as large as the precipitous 1.8 percent drop in November, was still considered sizable. Many analysts had based expectations for little change on a previously reported lengthening of the December workweek, a figure that a Labor Department official had found puzzling.
One possible explanation offered today by economists was that companies have been quicker than usual in this recession to lay off workers and were then forced to use those that remained for longer periods. Another explanation was that Government statisticians use hours worked for gauging many forms of output but that for automobile assembly, which accounted for much of the December decline, they use the actual number of units built.
The decline was disappointing not only in its magnitude but also in its scope. No major market groups posted increases, and much of the 1.9 percent advance in output by utilities was because of colder weather.
If automobiles and trucks are excluded, the Industrial Production Index fell four-tenths of 1 percent; if motor vehicles and parts as well are excluded, the decline was three-tenths of 1 percent, the Fed reported.
Production of consumer goods was unchanged, but business equipment fell nine-tenths of 1 percent and construction supplies fell 1.5 percent to a level 6 percent below that of July. Output of materials fell 1 percent, mainly reflecting parts for motor vehicles.
 
Mines and Utilities Up
 By industry, factory output dropped nine-tenths of 1 percent, half the November plunge, while mining rose six-tenths of 1 percent. The hefty increase for utilities still recovered barely half the ground lost in November.
The utilization rate for primary processing industries tumbled 1.4 percentage points, compared with a seven-tenths of a point decline for advanced processing. "The drop in primary processing industries reflected significant output cutbacks at industries that supply the auto industry, like primary metals, fabricated metals products, rubber and plastics products and textiles," the Fed said.
The Industrial Production Index, at 107.1 percent of its 1987 average, now stands 1.4 percent below its level of December 1989.
Today's report also showed that the Fed reduced its estimate of November output to a decline of 1.8 percent instead of the 1.7 percent initially estimated. At the same time, however, it reduced the October decline to seven-tenths of 1 percent, from the nine-tenths of 1 percent previously estimated.

HEADLINE: A Short War Will Test Recession Assumptions

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
A brief Persian Gulf war would test one of the great assumptions about the national recession: that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait precipitated the recession and an American military victory will make the economy rebound. But evidence is accumulating that the recession has taken on a life of its own and will probably endure.
The phenomenon that links the gulf crisis and the economy, in the minds of many economists, is public confidence, which deteriorated sharply after the invasion on Aug. 2. Those who measure public confidence -- the Conference Board and the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center -- at first said the gulf crisis had precipitated the deterioration, in part because of rising oil prices. Now they argue that other factors are unnerving Americans, inhibiting the spending that invigorates the economy. 
 "When the crisis in the gulf is over, we might have a moment or two of euphoria -- a somewhat more positive consumer," said Fabian Linden, who directs the Conference Board's monthly consumer surveys. "But the euphoria will soon wear off if we don't resolve the basic issues confronting Americans."
 
Large Military Stockpiles
 Unlike past American wars, a prolonged war would not stimulate the economy through stepped-up production of war materiel. Equipment stockpiled in the last decade is reportedly sufficient to carry the United States forces for an extended period.
But the Bush Administration is hoping that the war will be short. It has argued that after a brief conflict the economy will rebound -- a contention that the consumer-confidence surveys do not seem to support. Mr. Linden and Richard T. Curtin, the University of Michigan's director of consumer research, list rising unemployment in recent months as the chief public concern dampening confidence, war or no war. Other blows to confidence, they said, have come from the collapse in real estate prices; the growing number of bank failures, particularly in New England in recent weeks, and a sharp decline in industrial production since October.
The Bush Administration has attributed the recession mainly to the Persian Gulf crisis, arguing in effect that if the war ends in a quick military victory, then a strengthening economy will stimulate hiring and resolve the unemployment problem. Mr. Bush's top economic advisers restated this message at a meeting with the President on Tuesday.
Similarly, the Federal Reserve has invoked the gulf crisis as a justification for its reluctance to cut interest rates more quickly than it has. While lower rates might help to stimulate the economy, Fed officials say, they might also encourage too much spending and investment once the Persian Gulf conflict ends and public confidence returns. Such exuberant outlays could cause shortages that drive up prices.
But if a resolution of the gulf crisis may not rescue the economy from recession, several weeks or months of fighting in the Persian Gulf can prolong it. Aside from the fresh blow to public confidence, economists say, oil prices will probably rise well above their present level of about $30 a barrel. That would greatly discourage spending as both consumers and businesses diverted funds and reduced profits to cover energy costs.
 
Cost of Oilfield Damage
"If the war is prolonged and there is damage to oilfields, that adds to the economic problems that already existed before August," said Joseph Minarik, senior economist on Congress's Joint Economic Committee.
In addition to this danger, military spending will fail to give the economy a boost because of the large military stockpiles. During the first four months of the Persian Gulf deployment, for example, the Defense Personnel Support Center disbursed $1.4 billion in equipment and food, or only $230 million more than in an average four-month period before the crisis.
"Whether they're eating in Saudi Arabia or they're eating in Houston, Tex., they're still eating the same amount of food," said William H. Ernst Jr., a Support Center spokesman.
Similarly, American troops in the Saudi Arabian desert are using tents from storage. "They never wear out; you roll them up, put them in preservative containers and store them," said Jack L. Allen, a spokesman for the Defense Construction Supply Center in Columbus, Ohio. "Some of this stuff dates back to Korea and Vietnam."
 
Spending on Fuel
 Perhaps the biggest materiel cost has been for fuel, to transport troops to the gulf and for operations there. Some $410 million in extra fuel contracts were awarded during the first four months, the Defense Department reports. In addition, numerous contracts have been awarded to ferry troops to Saudi Arabia and provide other services.
But these expenditures do not provide the boost to the economy that comes through war production. World War II is the classic example of a conflict that helped pull the nation out of a slump through such production. But even smaller-scale conflicts also lifted the American economy. The Korean War required a big increase in the production of weapons and other materiel, and this new industrial output in the early 1950's helped to end a recession. Production during the Vietnam War also made the economy boom in the late 1960's.
 
Decline Since the Spring
 The departure from precedent makes the nation's economic predicament hard to anticipate. The economy has been in decline since last spring, because of too much home and office construction, huge corporate debts built up in the 1980's, the weakness among the nation's banks resulting from unpaid real estate loans, and a reluctance among the banks to make new loans that also might fail. Cuts in lending dampen economic activity.
The upshot was that the Persian Gulf crisis accelerated a downturn already in progress, producing what Robert Gordon, a Northwestern University economist, calls "a long decline exacerbated by a sharp drop in August."
"The unwinding of the 80's got entangled with Kuwait and they are now so mixed up that even a positive, short-term resolution in the Persian Gulf would not solve the recession," Mr. Gordon said. "The damage to confidence and to business activity has been done."
 
Wall St. Optimism
 Mr. Gordon and some other economists, among them Paul Samuelson, the Nobel laureate in economic science, argue that even without the gulf crisis, the economy would have tipped into recession in late summer. But among economic forecasters, particularly those employed on Wall Street and in the banking industry, a more optimistic view reigns, according to the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, which is a monthly survey of 50 well-known forecasters.
"Three out of four of them believe that the trigger for the recession was the gulf crisis, and if it ends soon, the economy will begin to recover in the third quarter," said Robert J. Eggert, Blue Chip's president. "They don't think it would be a spectacular recovery, but the economy would begin to come back."
Stephen S. Roach, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company, makes a case for an economic revival after a brief gulf war. The key to his argument is real disposable personal income -- the money available for spending, adjusted for inflation. This income growth slowed last year, but was still positive in the third quarter and only went into sharp decline after the gulf crisis had driven up oil prices and the inflation rate.
By driving down oil prices, a quick victory will bolster purchasing power despite the numerous layoffs, bankruptcies and plant closings in recent months, Mr. Roach says.
"Initially, consumer confidence would improve," Mr. Roach said. "Businesses that had cut back in preparation for the worst would relax. Production would grow again and there would be some rehiring, and out of that process would come renewed income growth."

HEADLINE: For News, 3 Options

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
By declaring yesterday that the newspaper cannot continue to operate as it is, The Daily News narrowed its options to three: settling promptly with its striking unions, negotiating a sale or closing the paper.
 Certainly, there are formidable obstacles to both a sale and a negotiated settlement of the 12-week-old strike. 
 There are three principal issues to be resolved in the negotiations: the status of replacement workers, outstanding lawsuits filed by both unions and management, and The News's determination to win a contract that includes "management rights," which is shorthand for greatly increased control of the workplace.
 
800 Replacement Workers
 Since the strike began on Oct. 25, The News's strategy has been to publish and deliver the paper by using a combination of nonunion employees, union members who crossed the picket line and about 800 replacement workers.
The News has repeatedly characterized the new workers as "permanent replacements," suggesting that they would keep their jobs even after a settlement. But at least some of the "permanent replacements" signed a document agreeing that The News was free to dismiss them at any time.
Since the strike began, The News has been operating with far fewer workers and presumably, in the event of a settlement, the paper would not need any more workers than it already has.
The unions have insisted that all 2,300 striking workers be rehired and given seniority ahead of the permanent replacements so that, in a layoff that would almost inevitably come as part of any new contract, the remaining jobs would belong to union members.
 
Potential Lawsuit
 The News has said the status of the permanent replacements is subject to negotiation, which suggests to union leaders that they can be removed.
But in removing a whole category of workers because they were not in the union, company officals concede that they may be inviting a lawsuit for discrimination as well as a public relations problem. Many of the replacement workers are women and minority-group members, while many of those they replaced are white men.
Still, if the replacement workers remain, the incentive for unions to settle is nonexistent; there would be virtually no jobs for strikers to take.
Union leaders said that if a contract agreement was reached, they think the issue of lawsuits could be resolved relatively easily by both sides dropping all suits except those involving things like throwing bricks through windshields.
But neither unions nor News management have exhibited any inclination to make significant changes in their fundamental stances on a contract. The News has insisted on management rights that would leave staffing, overtime and other key issues to management's discretion. Unions have said such open-ended authority would effectively break the unions.
 
Dimmer Prospect of Sale
 Union leaders have said from the strike's outset that they wanted the Chicago-based Tribune Company -- which owns The News -- to sell it, something that until yesterday the company has been unwilling to consider.
But while there was some interest in buying The News before the strike, when it had circulation of 1.1 million and a steady flow of advertising revenue, the prospects are now much dimmer. The paper has lost at least half its circulation and almost all of its advertising.
"There are no prospects, in my opinion," said W. Dean Singleton, chief executive officer of Media News Group Inc., who said union leaders had approached him earlier about buying the paper.
Sam S. McKeel, president of The Sun-Times Company, another prime prospect in earlier months, said yesterday that he was not interested.
But Patrick A. Flanagan, managing director of The Fidelis Group, a Boston investment banking firm that has been trying to broker a sale through the unions, said that interest was still high because of the paper's position in the market and its prospects for recovering what has been lost. And a spokesman for Robert Maxwell, the British printing and publishing magnate, said he was investigating the situation.
 
Concessions Needed
 One major concern to any prospective buyer would be the approximately $100 million in job guarantees that go with the paper's ownership. Unions also estimate there is a $25 million liability in underfunded pension benefits and a similar amount in severance liability should the paper be closed. Even if the Tribune Company gave the paper to someone, these liabilities would represent a major potential expense to a buyer.
Any prospective buyer must get concessions from unions that would be similar to those sought by the Tribune Company, perhaps in exchange for a stake in the new ownership.
A new owner would also have to foot the bill during a rebuilding process that might or might not restore The News to former circulation and advertising levels and do so during the worst advertising recession in recent memory. Eventually, a new owner would have to assume that a major investment in new presses would be unavoidable, which would mean risking a great deal of capital.
And as part of the deal, a new owner would probably ask union members to give up their severance pay guarantees, which some union leaders have said could be worth $25 million and which union members would be reluctant to lose. Last year, many members of the Newspaper Guild were prepared to vote against a contract that would save The New York Post until severance packages were guaranteed.
Should a sale prove impossible, The News would probably make one final offer to unions. In the face of an abyss and a deadline, union members might be willing to accept what they have thus far spurned.
And should that ultimatum fail, The News will almost certainly close its doors.

HEADLINE: THE DINKINS BUDGET;
Dinkins Offers $29 Billion Budget With Cutbacks and Layoffs

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins presented a $29.3 billion preliminary budget for New York City yesterday whose mix of pain and uncertainty prompted the City Council and some fiscal watchdogs to suggest that he had not gone far enough in making cuts and led others to complain about how far he went.
The Mayor's plan, the first step in a long political dance before the budget is to be adopted in June, was narrowly balanced with thousands of layoffs -- most of them in the Board of Education -- service cuts and a range of proposed taxes and unpopular fees, even as the city's Budget Director, Philip R. Michael, warned that "the problem's going to get worse." 
 Striving to maintain the balanced city budget required by law, Mr. Dinkins announced plans to reduce hiring sharply, eliminating through layoffs or attrition nearly 25,000 full- and part-time city jobs that had been planned. That would leave about 8,500 fewer full-time workers on the city payroll by June than the 247,000 there were last November, the first annual decline in nearly a decade.
 
Property Tax Increase
 To help close a projected gap between revenues and expenditures of $2.2 billion for the fiscal year that starts July 1, Mr. Dinkins proposed $580 million in new or higher taxes, including a property tax increase that would mean a $60-a-year rise for a typical homeowner and an increase in the personal income tax that would cost an average resident $75.
The Mayor also proposed a new 1 percent tax on the value of motor vehicles to replace the current flat $15 annual automobile use tax. It would vary according to the age and worth of a car, ranging from $216 for a new $30,000 luxury sedan to $58 for a new $8,000 subcompact car.
"It is my hope that while no one is going to be happy with this budget, everyone is going to be impacted to some degree," Mr. Dinkins told a news conference at City Hall.
In an indication of the inextricable link between city and state finances, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo issued a statement saying the Mayor's plan "represents many difficult choices" but warning that "it is also clear that the city and state are in a worsening economy, which could cause further erosion in our financial plans."
State Comptroller Edward V. Regan questioned whether the Mayor's cuts went deep enough. Mr. Regan also announced yesterday that state tax collections in December fell $268 million below projections.
Officials in both the Legislature and Cuomo administration said the gap in the state budget for its coming fiscal year, which starts April 1, could be close to $5 billion, or $1 billion higher than previous estimates, while the gap for the current fiscal year could be more than $800 million, farhigher than previous estimates.
Mr. Cuomo, who amid his own deep troubles has expressed skepticism about the city's resolve to keep its fiscal house in order and has warned city officials to expect little help, received the plan as chairman of the State Financial Control Board. The watchdog agency, set up in the city fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's, could reassume binding powers over the city's budget if it fell out of balance. Leaders of the City Council, whose approval is needed for Mr. Dinkins's budget and whose assent is required for new taxes, acknowledged that there would be some more taxes but did not commit their members, who are facing a special election this year, to any specifics. The Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, questioned whether the budget was still growing too much, saying, "We will seek to eliminate waste and duplication before one dollar of new taxes is raised."
Spokesmen for legislative leaders in Albany, whose approval is needed for all but the property tax proposal, said it was premature to discuss the Mayor's plan until Mr. Cuomo presents his own budget in two weeks and the Mayor and City Council reach a consensus. They voiced skepticism about the auto tax and dismissed a smattering of other proposed taxes, including a 5-cent city gasoline tax, that have repeatedly failed to win approval in the past.
 
No Warm Reception
 "Any new taxes for the city at this point will not be warmly received in our house," said John E. McArdle, a spokesman for the Republican State Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino of Oyster Bay, L.I.
Because the effects on the city of the state's own enormous budget problems are not yet known, Mr. Dinkins was hamstrung in saying just how many cuts might really be needed and which ones were floated as red flags to prod as much help as possible from the state, like the warning of as many as 6,500 layoffs in the school system.
City officials said they hoped negotiations with the state on delaying cuts in education aid until this summer and with unions representing the teachers and other school employees about deferring pay or taking unpaid furloughs could reduce the need for many such layoffs.
While the plan assumes no increase in state aid, it does not account for a potential decrease. "We're very leery about the state budget gap," Mr. Michael said.
Speaking of the future, Mr. Dinkins said, "We have to continue to regroup as we go."
 
Detailed but Tentative
 Because of the rapidly changing condition of city and state finances, the Mayor's plan was both more complex and detailed and more tentative than usual, and reaction from the fiscal monitors and public officials who began sorting it out yesterday was mixed.
Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a private watchdog group financed by businesses, praised the Mayor's commitment to keeping the budget balanced but said he had not gone far enough. "Despite the fact that the local economy has turned around, the Mayor hasn't gotten the ship of state turned around yet," he said.
Allen J. Proctor, executive director of the Financial Control Board, said: "It's premature to draw a lot of conclusions that he did or didn't make the tough choices. Clearly, he's eliminating a lot of jobs, so one can't say he's not responding to the difficult circumstances.
 
No Deep Cuts for Police
 In the Dinkins plan, the cuts in services ranged widely, though not evenly, among city agencies. The Police Department -- which along with the Board of Education is among the agencies where cuts can most quickly be made -- was spared the deep cuts that most other departments were forced to make, having its spending cut by 2.2 percent, compared with more than 17 percent in some other agencies.
After a string of highly publicized crimes last summer, Mr. Dinkins proposed last fall a special $450 million tax package to finance the hiring of thousands of new police officers. With delicate negotiations on that still under way in the Legislature, he had little choice but to turn to the schools as a source of cuts.
Of more than 16,000 potential layoffs of full-time and part-time city workers outlined in the plan, more than 10,000 would come in the Board of Education, a total that Mr. Vallone and other officials said would never be tolerated.
But Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez, who has previously resisted cuts, said: "Even the most cynical or jaded budgeteers know that cuts of this magnitude are tantamount to mortgaging our children's future."
Mr. Dinkins proposed cuts in other areas dear to the hearts of his liberal constituency, planning to reduce contracts for family planning services by 70 percent, increasing caseloads for social workers assigned to AIDS sufferers, delaying expansion of drug treatment programs, elminating city hospital pharmacy services for outpatients.
 
Delay for Recycling
 The Mayor's plan would also delay expansion of garbage recycling until next year, which critics said made it more likely that Mr. Dinkins would have to support trash incineration, and that could compromise a campaign promise.
Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan said, "Where many cuts represented a choice not between bone and fat but between bone and bone, the Mayor has for the most part done a thoughtful job." But, she said, the budget does "come at a great cost."
Besides all the cuts and taxes, the plan would raise a host of fees, installing 1,000 parking meters in the theater district to charge 75 cents an hour for evening parking that is now free, cutting in half the time a coin will buy in 18,000 other meters, doubling the Staten Island ferry fare for the second time in two years, to $1, and doubling the price for ballfield permits in the parks, to $8.
Meanwhile, negotiations broke down yesterday afternoon between the city, the Board of Education and the United Federation of Teachers on a proposal for school employees to defer three to six days of wages as a way to prevent the layoffs of up to 4,000 workers.
Teachers' union officials said the stumbling block was the city's refusal to guarantee that there would be no layoffs if the proposal was accepted. The union has opposed another cost-cutting proposal to furlough school employees for several days.
 
Major Elements of The Dinkins Plan
 
Increase taxes to raise $580 million.
 
Cut 25,000 jobs through layoffs or attrition.
 
Eliminate 400 office positions and reduce other areas of the Health and Hospitals Corporation, saving $28 million.
 
Eliminate outpatient pharmacy services for insured patients.
 
Delay expanding drug-treatment programs.
 
Delay recycling programs. Eliminate the Sanitation Department's "Clean Team."
 
Double the fare on the Staten Island Ferry to $1.

HEADLINE: Transit Agency Plans Improvements

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
Electronic turnstiles that deter fare beaters. A subway tracking system that tells passengers waiting on the platform when the next train will arrive. Emergency call boxes in each subway car that allow passengers to talk to the conductor.
These are just a few things that New York City transit officials proposed yesterday as part of a $7.3 billion five-year plan to continue rebuilding the region's transit system and to make the city's subways and buses safer and more convenient for passengers. 
 Under the program, officials would continue to buy new subway cars and buses, lay new track, replace signals and other obsolete equipment, and rebuild maintenance and storage yards but they also plan to rehabilitate subway stations and make them safer by installing new lighting, signage, and public-address systems.
 
A Chain of Rebuilding Programs
 But money for the capital-improvement program, which is financed by the city, state, and Federal governments, is uncertain. The program requires the approval of the State Legislature, which is scrambling to close mounting budget deficits in the wake of declining tax revenues.
Transit officials presented the plan yesterday to the board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Transit Authority's parent agency. The plan is an extension of a $16 billion 10-year program that ends this year and a link in a chain of rebuilding programs that officials say might stretch into the next century.
M.T.A. officials will review the plan over the next month and present it along with other rebuilding proposals for the region's commuter railroads to the state in March.
Some state legislators have expressed their desire to finance another M.T.A. capital program, but the lawmakers have also said that in these tight economic times, they may limit such financing to necessities such as keeping the mechanics of the system in good working order. If the state's financial picture does not improve, the lawmakers said, many of the "customer oriented" items in the plan may not receive financing.
 
New Fans in the Subways
 In their presentation before the M.T.A. board, Transit Authority officials said that the new capital money would allow them to respond much faster to emergencies like the subway tunnel fire that killed two people last month.
The officials said that a new capital program would allow them to replace ventilation fans in subway tunnels and install state-of-the-art subway tracking and radio systems.
The current system for tracking and radioing trains is outdated and contributed to the agency's delay in responding to the subway fire, offiials admit. Many of the tunnel ventilation fans, including those nearest to the fire, have not been working for years.
"The automated tracking system that we seek in this plan will appreciably cut down on the time needed to locate trains and reroute them in emergencies," said Tom Prendergast, the authority's senior vice president for operations.
Alan F. Kiepper, the authority's president, used an old analogy to describe the importance of the proposed capital program: "Rebuilding the subway system is like eating an elephant. You have to eat it one bite at a time. We have already taken two big bites and we want take another one."
Some mass-transit advocacy groups said that the capital plan was ambitious and expressed doubt that the authority would receive all the money that it was seeking.
"It's a very ambitious program and I am concerned that they won't be able to accomplish it," said Beverly Dolinsky, executive director of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee, a consumer transit advocacy group.
About $4.8 billion or 66 percent of the capital program money will be used to replace equipment and structures -- like fans, tunnel lighting, signals, communications systems, track, power lines, stations, and yards.
To reduce crime, transit officials propose spending about $569 million to install new station lighting, public-address systems, signs, police communications, passenger call boxes on platforms, and intercoms in each subway car. The officials also plan to eliminate some cul-de-sac areas in stations that have high levels of crime.
To increase ridership, the officials plan to spend $1.1 billion to replace escalators and elevators, install electronic turnstiles throughout the entire system, connect the 63d Street Tunnel to Queens Boulevard, and develop centers where bus and subway lines merge, among other measures.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: THE PRESIDENT;
Transcript of the Comments by Bush on the Air Strikes Against the Iraqis

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of President Bush's remarks in the Oval Office last night about the Persian Gulf action, as recorded by The New York Times:
Just two hours ago, allied air forces began an attack on military targets in Iraq and Kuwait. These attacks continue as I speak. Ground forces are not engaged. 
 This conflict started Aug. 2, when the dictator of Iraq invaded a small and helpless neighbor. Kuwait, a member of the Arab League and a member of the United Nations, was crushed, its people brutalized. Five months ago, Saddam Hussein started this cruel war against Kuwait; tonight, the battle has been joined.
This military action, taken in accord with United Nations resolutions and with the consent of the United States Congress, follows months of constant and virtually endless diplomatic activity on the part of the United Nations, the United States and many, many other countries.
Arab leaders sought what became known as an Arab solution, only to conclude that Saddam Hussein was unwilling to leave Kuwait. Others traveled to Baghdad in a variety of efforts to restore peace and justice. Our Secretary of State, James Baker, held an historic meeting in Geneva, only to be totally rebuffed.
This past weekend, in a last-ditch effort, the Secretary General of the United Nations went to the Middle East with peace in his heart -- his second such mission. And he came back from Baghdad with no progress at all in getting Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait.
 
No Choice but to Attack
 Now, the 28 countries with forces in the gulf area have exhausted all reasonable efforts to reach a peaceful resolution, and have no choice but to drive Saddam from Kuwait by force. We will not fail.
As I report to you, air attacks are under way against military targets in Iraq. We are determined to knock out Saddam Hussein's nuclear bomb potential. We will also destroy his chemical weapons facilities. Much of Saddam's artillery and tanks will be destroyed. Our operations are designed to best protect the lives of all the coalition forces by targeting Saddam's vast military arsenal.
Initial reports from General Schwartzkopf are that our operations are proceeding according to plan. Our objectives are clear: Saddam Hussein's forces will leave Kuwait. The legitimate government of Kuwait will be restored to its rightful place, and Kuwait will once again be free.
Iraq will eventually comply with all relevant United Nations resolutions, and then, when peace is restored, it is our hope that Iraq will live as a peaceful and cooperative member of the family of nations, thus enhancing the security and stability of the gulf.
 
'Why Not Wait?'
 Some may ask, why act now? Why not wait? The answer is clear. The world could wait no longer. Sanctions, though having some effect, showed no signs of accomplishing their objective. Sanctions were tried for well over five months, and we and our allies concluded that sanctions alone would not force Saddam from Kuwait.
While the world waited, Saddam Hussein systematically raped, pillaged and plundered a tiny nation no threat to his own. He subjected the people of Kuwait to unspeakable atrocities, and among those maimed and murdered, innocent children.
While the world waited, Saddam sought to add to the chemical weapons arsenal he now possesses, an infinitely more dangerous weapon of mass destruction -- a nuclear weapon. And while the world waited, while the world talked peace and withdrawal, Saddam Hussein dug in and moved massive forces into Kuwait.
While the world waited, while Saddam stalled, more damage was being done to the fragile economies of the Third World, emerging democracies of Eastern Europe, to the entire world, including to our own economy.
The United States, together with the United Nations, exhausted every means at our disposal to bring this crisis to a peaceful end. However, Saddam clearly felt that by stalling and threatening and defying the United Nations, he could weaken the forces arrayed against him.
While the world waited, Saddam Hussein met every overture of peace with open contempt. While the world prayed for peace, Saddam prepared for war.
I had hoped that when the United States Congress, in historic debate, took its resolute action, Saddam would realize he could not prevail, and would move out of Kuwait in accord with the United Nations resolutions. He did not do that. Instead, he remained intransigent, certain that time was on his side.
Saddam was warned over and over again to comply with the will of the United Nations, leave Kuwait or be driven out. Saddam has arrogantly rejected all warnings. Instead he tried to make this a dispute between Iraq and the United States of America.
Well he failed. Tonight 28 nations -- countries from five continents, Europe and Asia, Africa and the Arab League -- have forces in the Gulf area standing shoulder to shoulder against Saddam Hussein. These countries had hoped the use of force could be avoided. Regrettably, we now believe that only force will make him leave.
Prior to ordering our forces into battle, I instructed our military commanders to take every necessary step to prevail as quickly as possible, and with the greatest degree of protection possible for American and Allied servicemen and women. I've told the American people before that this will not be another Vietnam, and I repeat this here tonight. Our troops will have the best possible support in the entire world, and they will not be asked to fight with one hand tied behind their back. I'm hopeful that this fighting will not go on for long and that casualties will be held to an absolute minimum.
 
'An Historic Moment'
 This is an historic moment. We have in this past year made great progress in ending the long era of conflict and cold war. We have before us the opportunity to forge for ourselves and for future generations a new world order, a world where the rule of law, not the law of the jungle, governs the conduct of nations.
When we are successful, and we will be, we have a real chance at this new world order, an order in which a credible United Nations can use its peacekeeping role to fulfill the promise and vision of the U.N.'s founders. We have no argument with the people of Iraq. Indeed, for the innocents caught in this conflict, I pray for their safety.
Our goal is not the conquest of Iraq. It is the liberation of Kuwait. It is my hope that somehow the Iraqi people can, even now, convince their dictator that he must lay down his arms, leave Kuwait and let Iraq itself rejoin the family of peace loving nations.
Thomas Paine wrote many years ago: "These are the times that try men's souls." Those well-known words are so very true today. But even as planes of the multi-national forces attack Iraq, I prefer to think of peace, not war. I am convinced not only that we will prevail, but that out of the horror of combat will come the recognition that no nation can stand against a world united. No nation will be permitted to brutally assault its neighbor.
No President can easily commit our sons and daughters to war. They are the nation's finest. Ours is an all-volunteer force, magnificently trained, highly motivated. The troops know why they're there. And listen to what they say, because they've said it better than any President or Prime Minister ever could. Listen to Hollywood Huddleston, Marine lance corporal. He says: "Let's free these people so we can go home and be free again." And he's right. The terrible crimes and tortures committed by Saddam's henchmen against the innocent people of Kuwait are an affront to mankind and a challenge to the freedom of all.
 
'Worth Fighting For'
 Listen to one of our great officers out there, Marine Lieut. Gen. Walter Boomer. He said: "There are things worth fighting for. A world in which brutality and lawlessness are allowed to go unchecked isn't the kind of world we're going to want to live in."
Listen to Master Sgt. J. P. Kendall of the 82d Airborne: "We're here for more than just the price of a gallon of gas. What we're doing is going to chart the future of the world for the next hundred years. It's better to deal with this guy now than five years from now."
And finally, we should all sit up and listen to Jackie Jones, an Army lieutenant, when she says, "If we let him get away with this, who knows what's going to be next."
I've called upon Hollywood and Walter and J. P. and Jackie and all their courageous comrades-in-arms to do what must be done. Tonight, America and the world are deeply grateful to them and to their families.
And let me say to everyone listening or watching tonight: When the troops we've sent in finish their work, I'm determined to bring them home as soon as possible. Tonight, as our forces fight, they and their families are in our prayers.
May God bless each and every one of them and the coalition forces at our side in the Gulf, and may He continue to bless our nation, the United States of America.

HEADLINE: Businesses Brace for Temporary Sales Slump

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
As the nation went to war against Iraq, many business executives braced themselves last night for a possible sales slump. Retailers and others who depend on confident consumers or low gasoline prices said they expect their businesses to suffer, at least in the short term.
But a few industries, like long-distance telephone companies, said the public's apprehensiveness might actually help their business. 
 Retailers said they expect shoppers to stay home initially as they absorb the news. Whether sales rebound, they said, depends on the war's success.
"People won't be interested in going out shopping frivolously, for a little while at least," said Russell Solomon, the president of Tower Records, a chain based in Sacramento, Calif. The longer-term effect is uncertain, he said.
 
Effect on Markets
 Financial services executives have said in recent days that a war might compound the damage their firms suffered from the recession and the dearth of active individual investors. But bond and equity traders said yesterday that they expected volatility to multiply their opportunities.
James F. Higgins, president of the Dean Witter Financial Group, said his company had told its brokers to guard against panic. "In these times, we can have very volatile markets," he said. "It is very important not to fall into the pitfall of short-term emotionally driven decisions."
George L. Ball, the chairman and chief executive of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., urged investors to avoid quick reactions. "To the extent that investors base decisions on the commencement of a war, which has long been anticipated, they would be making a mistake," he said.
Other companies expressed fear that higher gasoline prices would reduce travel. "A great deal of our business comes by car from Southern California," said Phil Cooper, a spokesman for the Caesars Palace casino in Las Vegas, Nev. A long war or higher fuel prices could well reduce this traffic, he said, adding, "I don't think people are fleeing the casinos, but there is a tone of great concern."
 
Domestic Travel May Rise
 But in Los Angeles, a Hilton Hotels Corporation executive said domestic travel might improve as Americans shun travel abroad. "Since our company is principally within the United States, I would think that people might give further consideration to traveling here," said William C. Lebo Jr., Hilton's senior vice president and general counsel. "That would benefit us."
Within the military industry, executives at the Hughes Aircraft Company, a subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation, assumed Hughes's missiles were being deployed in the Persian Gulf. The company manufactures TOW anti-tank missiles and other missiles used by Navy and Air Force jets.
Richard Dore, a spokesman for Hughes, said the company expected no quick reorders of missiles to replace used supplies. "I'm sure the military has more than a one- or two-day supply," he said.
In fact, Mr. Dore said Hughes executives were worried that the expense of the Middle East war would require cuts by the Pentagon in the future.
 
Harm to Military Industry
 "A lot of this action is being paid for out of current defense budgets," he said. "They have to be taking that money from somewhere. Unless that money is somehow replaced this could actually be very damaging to the defense industry."
William T. Esrey, the chairman and chief executive of United Telecommunications Inc. and its major subsidiary, U S Sprint, said he expects the long-distance industry to benefit as Americans make calls to discuss the Persian Gulf crisis.
"I think you'll see a substantial effect," he said. When he heard about the American strike against Baghdad, he reached for the phone. "I talked to my family," he said. "It's human instinct."
Bert C. Roberts Jr., the president of the MCI Communications Corporation, said the long-distance carriers would benefit from the extra calling in proportion to their market shares.
MCI will give special priority to Government communications during the crisis, he said.
 
Worries About Morale
 Some executives said they worried about the war's effect on employee morale.
"I think like a lot of us, I'm still in shock," said Sandra L. Kurtzig, president and chief executive of ASK Computer Systems, a software company in Mountain View, Calif.
Ms. Kurtzig said she heard the news while in a meeting with employees, some of whom are only 21 or 22 years old and could be called to fight if a draft were reinstated. "These employees were 3, 4, 5 years old when the Vietnam War ended," she said. "It's amazing to me how little understanding they have about what war is."
She said company travel would be reduced and might be eliminated because of the fear of terrorism. "If any employees felt concerned about traveling, they certainly would not have to do it," she said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Volatile Trading Expected After Dollar's Drop in Asia

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Traders said last night that they expect the currency markets in New York to be volatile today, responding, as one dealer said, to just "fragments of news." But they expect that the surprising fall of the dollar overnight should continue unless news from the Persian Gulf does not remain positive for the U.S.-led coalition.
"We haven't heard from the Iraqis yet," said one trader last night. "We are dealing more in a psychological market than a financial one." 
 Several banks in New York had some extra staff in last night to be ready to respond to the beginning of a war. The same was true in Europe.
After just a brief rally the dollar fell sharply throughout Asia overnight, outfoxing those who had thought the dollar would rise when war began in the Persian Gulf.
Traders in New York said that there were reports that both the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Bank of Japan were selling dollars in Asia as part of an expected effort to calm markets and prevent an overreaction to the attack. Financial officials both in the United States and elsewhere have said recently that they would make efforts to keep all financial markets calm.
In addition, they said that many traders in the market who had bought dollars in anticipation of it rising began to sell when they heard reports of the intervention and the rally ran out of steam.
"A lot of people were anticipating or afraid of the fact that the dollar would move up with a war," said a trader at a major bank in New York. "Once that it was apparent that this was not gong to be the case, the world changed its mind about the dollar."
He also added that once the concern about the war is pushed aside in investors mind, the focus will turn back to the economic fundamentals for the dollar, all of which are bad. The United States is in a recession and the Federal Reserve is expected to continue to lower interest rates here, which will weaken the dollar further.
In Philadelphia, where the Stock Exchange conducts night trading in foreign currency options, about 1,000 option contracts were traded in the first hour after the attack, a spokesman said.
As overnight traders in the foreign currency options market in Philadelphia learned of the apparent success of the initial raid, just after 9 P.M. Eastern standard time, the dollar defied expectations and began to drift lower. Arnold Staloff, a partner in Bloom Staloff Corporation, said the most likely cause was that central banks around the world, coordinated by the Federal Reserve System, were selling dollars to prevent a strong surge in price.
The dollar ended trading in New York yesterday at 136.83 yen and 1.5462 marks, compared with 135.73 yen and 1.5420 marks on Tuesday.
In trading in New York yesterday, the British pound fell to $1.9050 from late Tuesday's $1.9095.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's prices, included: 1.2890 Swiss francs, up from 1.2845; 5.2605 French francs, up from 5.2420; 1,163.50 Italian lire, up from 1,160.00.

Shaving Nickels From the Budget At City Hall

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
"Now more than ever," Mayor David N. Dinkins said yesterday as he sketched his latest budget strategy, "New York City's most precious natural resource is its collective imagination."
His four-year financial plan -- a preliminary budget, to be sure -- appeared to leave that potential resource largely untapped for the time being. Rather, the administration's 275-page agency-by-agency template for pruning expenses nickeled and dimed dozens of municipal programs. The economies would save hundreds of millions of dollars, but do they make the most sense? Could bureaucrats have been more creative and politically courageous in lopping off whole programs that the city can no longer afford? Will some economies be counterproductive? 
 The Mayor didn't dodge those questions.
"The only thing I haven't heard is, 'Let's sell a piece of Central Park,' " Mr. Dinkins said, by way of explaining the scope of alternatives presented, if not seriously considered.
He mentioned a few others, the boldest being transferring responsibility for maintaining East River bridges to the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority -- a transfer that would presumably be contingent on the imposition of tolls. He acknowl edged, though, that two panels he had ap pointed were just beginning to test the waters for changes of that magnitude.
 (The boldest shift actually proposed yesterday seemed to be the merger of two duplicative offices re sponsible for relocat ing homeless families to apartments.)
 Nor was Mr. Din kins sanguine about the possibility that some cuts might be false economies. "We know from our experience in the 1970's that the budget cuts of today lead to higher social costs a decade from now," he said. But he coupled that cautionary note with exasperation. It is one thing to press a Mayor to spare a program and quite another to be obligated, as he is, to pay for it.
"It ain't so damned simple," Mr. Dinkins said, adding that "one has to look at the total picture" -- a perspective that, during his first year as Mayor, he appeared at times to overlook.
The section listing dozens of departmental economies -- "David Scissorhand" was how one Queens parent portrayed Mr. Dinkins in a protest placard at a community meeting Monday night -- dramatized not merely the scope of proposed service reductions, if mostly at the margins. It also portrayed the dimension of services to which New Yorkers have become accustomed.
The financial plan would save $5.6 million next year by laying off 957 part-time school-crossing guards, nearly $1.5 million by exercising greater discretion over which prisoners are served halal and kosher meals, $173,000 by eliminating "long line painting" on highways and $1.1 million by delaying a proposed 42d Street Transitway in Manhattan. The latter -- like the city's Clean Team and proceeds from the expected sale of the Coliseum site -- is a perennial candidate for budget-cutting in the category of Generally Accepted Accounting Gimmicks. The Coliseum option, however, was listed this time as only a contingency.
Other cuts suggested included $1.2 million by reducing wattage in 20,000 more street lights on commercial strips (obscuring dirtier sidewalks and perhaps prompting the Mayor to rename his anti-crime program "Dark Streets, Safe City); $116,000 by shutting the Children's Zoo in Central Park; $274,000 by cutting the Parks Department's marionette program (unless someone pulls strings to save it); $1.4 million by switching to volunteer chaplains in the Health and Hospitals Corporation, and $108,000 by terminating "dry culture sewer cleaning" (the city's version of germ warfare).
It is commonly accepted that some of the hundreds of individual decisions that make up the preliminary budget are predicated on posturing: If the proposed economies in education and other programs generate enough of an outcry, maybe they won't have to be made -- particularly if another level of government comes to the rescue.
After years of rosy dreams, "we are coming to dread pink slips," the Mayor said. It hardly seemed coincidental that his financial plan was printed in buff binders, but an accompanying booklet about proposed relief from Albany was bound in pink.
Mr. Dinkins's Budget Director, Philip R. Michael, acknowledged that the vagaries of the Persian Gulf conflict, of state aid and of the local economy had made projecting deficits even harder for an administration that has often appeared to be weeks or more behind in responding to crises.
This time, Mr. Michael said, "I think we've gotten a little bit ahead," but he prudently declined to speculate for how long.

HEADLINE: THE DINKINS BUDGET;
Falling Short of Dinkins's 'Smaller Government' Goal

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
"In the future, ours will be a smaller government," Mayor David N. Dinkins said last week in his State of the City message. "One able to cope with the rapid changes, but a stronger one, more creative, more productive and more responsive."
 Measured against this standard, his $29.3 billion preliminary budget, released yesterday amid a recession and a state budget crisis, appears to fall short. 
 After weeks of worry over a $2 billion budget gap in the fiscal year that begins on July 1, the administration has produced a budget that fails to halt the seemingly inexorable growth of government. It would actually increase spending by 5.6 percent, surpassing the rate of inflation.
And while the plan calls for thousands of layoffs in some agencies and hundreds of service cuts, large and small, most of these would be offset by increased hiring in other agencies, particularly police and social services.
 
Small Cut in Work Force
 The number of city employees in the new fiscal year would be only 3,000 less than when the current fiscal year began, a decrease of about 1.3 percent. Most of the layoffs are scheduled for the Board of Education, an agency beyond the Mayor's direct control.
While some agencies, like the Parks Department, would face devastating cuts, others, like the Police and Fire Departments and the Human Resources Administration, have successfully resisted them.
"Given the current economic recession and severe fiscal pressures at all levels of government, we question whether this reduction is sufficient," State Comptroller Edward V. Regan said in a statement yesterday.
Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a research group financed by businesses, said of Mayor Dinkins, "You have to give him good marks for being serious about balancing the budget, but it should be balanced at a lower level while the economy is declining."
 
Opportunity in Crisis
 For reorganizing government, the worst of times is often the best of times. A budget crisis may be an opportunity to parry the power of bureaucratic and political interest groups and achieve long-sought gains.
Some experts say New York's government has been due for large reductions and reorganization for years. The city, they say, has been spending far beyond its means at least since the stock market crash in 1987 while balancing the budget through such one-time measures as raiding the cash hoards of city agencies.
"There is a structural imbalance of about $1 billion which has persisted for the last several years," said Allen Proctor, director of the state Financial Control Board. "The solution to that requires permanent changes in the level of services the city provides and which the local economy can't sustain."
But in practice the administration has found such reorganization difficult to achieve. Rather than rethinking the delivery of services -- how many fire houses the city needs, for example -- most of the cuts in Mr. Dinkins's budget plan would be made on the edges of existing services.
While hundreds of duplicative and otherwise unnecessary administrative jobs have been cut from the Board of Education and the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation, other agencies have successfully resisted such cuts.
In the preliminary budget, many cuts would be in the delivery of services -- the cleaning of parks, for example -- that would almost certainly be restored when city revenues pick up at the end of the recession.
After Mayor Dinkins spent weeks reviewing budget cuts for city agencies, the administration decided it could cut no further, at least for now, without hurting too many New Yorkers.
Instead, the administration wants to close gaps through tax increases -- $580 million in proposed taxes on top of an additional $1.3 billion in taxes either pending or already adopted.
In the footsteps of previous administrations, the city is trying other means to close budget gaps. A public corporation, the United Nations Development Corporation, will refinance bonds and turn over the proceeds to the city. Surplus cash at two other city corporations will be turned over to the city as well.
In addition, for the first time, the city would sell bonds to cover the interest costs incurred while city projects are under construction.
 
Savings Noted
 Administration officials say they did achieve some administrative savings. For example, they would consolidate in one agency the management of senior-citizens centers. And more of these savings are to come, they say. Mr. Dinkins noted that he had set up a business-labor panel to study productivity and management.
Perhaps the clearest indication of the administration's failure to make inroads on the bureaucracy was Mr. Dinkins's decision to list "possibilities for streamlining operations" in his statement at yesterday's budget briefing.
They include breaking up the Human Resources Administration, transferring some emergency services from the police to the Fire Department, establishing a "super commuter" agency and transferring maintenance of East River bridges to the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority.
But all these, Mayor Dinkins said, remain to be considered.

HEADLINE: Brisk Trading Worldwide, but No Panic;
Yen Soars And Tokyo Stocks Rise

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Early reports of American success in attacking Iraqi military positions sent Japanese stock prices and the yen sharply higher, while oil prices in Asia tumbled. The financial markets appeared to express relief at the early signs that the world economy would not suffer major damage from a war in the Persian Gulf.
Anticipating a brief war that would rout the Iraqis, and with no reports of Iraqi counterattacks or defensive operations, traders reversed themselves after an initial burst of nervousness and moved ahead with optimism and unusual energy. 
 The dollar is regarded as a safe holding in times of international stress, and it had risen strongly against the yen in recent days with the approach of the Tuesday deadline the United Nations had set for Iraq's withdrawl from Kuwait. But once the United States finally ended the long waiting game and its forces were reported to have had dramatic successes, traders dumped the dollars they had accumulated, taking profits.
 
A Volatile Currency
 The dollar shot up to 138 yen after the first news reports of the attack flashed through Tokyo trading rooms. But it then fell back steadily, hitting 133.65 yen in mid-afternoon here.
On the Tokyo stock market, the Nikkei index of 225 stocks rose 1,004.11 points, or 4.47 percent, closing at 23,446.81. The rise, on volume of 450 million shares, was the 10th-largest ever for the Nikkei. The surge in stock prices reversed a decline of more than 300 points in early trading when it was unclear what was taking place in the Persian Gulf. On Wednesday, the Nikkei had lost 770.53 points, or 3.3 percent.
"There's still a lot of volatility out there, but people are generally pleased that the world economy seems unlikely to suffer major external shocks from the situation in the gulf," said Kermit Schoenholtz, an economist here with Salomon Brothers Asia.
The oil market in Singapore, the main base for crude oil dealings in Asia, also reacted nervously to the first reports of air raids on Baghdad. Prices shot up to $34 a barrel, traders said, then reversed around the same time the dollar began to decline. By mid-afternoon, crude oil was quoted as low as $27.50 a barrel in Singapore, with many traders in Europe waking up early to sell barrels.
At midmorning in Tokyo, news agencies reported that President Bush had authorized selling crude oil from the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and that also put downward pressure on oil prices.
 
The Dollar's Decline
 The dollar's decline began when reports spread through bank dealing rooms that the Federal Reserve was selling dollars in Singapore to limit the dollar's gains. Once the pullback began, the tumble gathered steam, as news reports of American military successes in the gulf circulated.
The Bank of Japan went out of its way to calm markets by injecting about $4.5 billion into the banking sector. The move was seen as an attempt to make clear that the central bank would act to avert any disruptions in normal trading. The central bank governor, Yasushi Mieno, issued a statement that the bank would intervene if necessary.
In addition, the Finance Minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, was quoted as saying that the central banks of the major industrial nations were prepared to intervene if necessary to ease volatility. There was no evidence, by midafternoon, however, that that had been necessary.
 
Traders React Warily
 
By The Associated Press
Stock trading around the world was cautious today as the markets reacted to the American-led attack against Iraq. Market professionals said traders were wary because of uncertainty over the extent of the fighting.
The Hong Kong stock market was steady at the opening. The Australian stock exchange suspended trading for 10 minutes to allow the market to adjust. After trading resumed, the market's principal index fell to levels not seen since the 1987 stock market crash.
"It's not panicky yet but it's a fast market," said Jack Barbanel, president of First Global Asset Management in Princeton, N.J.
"The belief of many traders is that it has been a one-sided battle," he said. "We have not heard of any damage to the American side or the allied side."

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: THE DIPLOMACY;
Excerpts From U.S. Report Of Its Attempts to Avoid War

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a letter sent by President Bush today to notify Congressional leaders that he had exhausted all diplomatic means to persuade Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. The letter was required under the resolutions approving the use of force that were passed on Saturday by both houses of Congress.
 From the beginning of the gulf crisis, the United States has consistently pursued four basic objectives: (1) the immediate, complete, and unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait; (2) the restoration of the legitimate Government of Kuwait; (3) the protection of U.S. citizens abroad; and (4) the security and stability of a region vital to U.S. national security. In pursuit of these objectives, we have sought and obtained action by the U.N. Security Council, resulting in 12 separate resolutions that have been fully consistent with U.S. objectives. 
 The last of these 12 resolutions, U.N. Security Council Resolution 678 of 29 November 1990, authorizes U.N. member states to use "all necessary means" to implement Resolution 660 and all subsequent relevant resolutions of the Security Council, and to restore international peace and security in the area, unless Iraq fully implements those resolutions on or before Jan. 15, 1991.
. . . Iraq has taken no steps whatever to fulfill these requirements. Iraq has forcefully stated that it considers the Security Council's resolutions invalid and has no intention of complying with them at any time. . . . Iraq has strongly and repeatedly reiterated its annexation of Kuwait and stated its determination that will remain permamently a part of Iraq. . . .
In short, the Government of Iraq remains completely intransigent in rejecting the U.N. Security Council's demands -- despite the exhaustive use by the United States and the United Nations of all appropriate diplomatic, political and economic measures to persuade or compel Iraq to comply.
. . .
The President, the Secretary of State and other U.S. officials have engaged in an exhaustive process of consultation with other governments and international organizations. The Secretary of State alone has, since Aug. 2 of last year, held more than 250 meetings with foreign heads of state, foreign ministers and other high foreign officials.
Most recently, on Jan. 9, the Secretary of State met at length in Geneva with the Iraqi Foreign Minister, who in six and one-half hours of talks demonstrated no readiness whatever to implement the U.N. Security Council resolutions. The Iraqi Foreign Minister even refused to receive a diplomatic communication from the President intended for Saddam Hussein. On Jan. 13, the U.N. Secretary General was rebuffed by Iraq for a second time, in this case in a direct attempt to persuade Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait peacefully. Many other heads of state, foreign ministers and private persons have made similar attempts.

HEADLINE: Brisk Trading Worldwide, but No Panic;
Companies Set Gasoline Price Curbs

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The news of military action drove oil prices wild last night, first up by 20 percent in a few minutes, and then down below their starting point, as it appeared that the American air strike met almost no resistance from the Iraqis.
Meanwhile, some large United States oil companies quickly announced that at least for now, they would not change retail gasoline prices at their company-owned service stations. They also said they would freeze the prices they charge independent distributors and urge them to hold the line, too. 
 Most companies acted as the prices were rising, reaching a peak of about $39 in the thinly traded cash market, $7 higher than the close on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday afternoon for light, sweet crude.
 
Companies' Reactions
 Conoco, Unocal, Mobil and Chevron were among oil companies making announcements shortly after the bombing began.
Noting that petroleum supplies were adequate, the companies said they were holding the line on prices to try to calm customers and prevent panic buying or fuel hoarding. Some companies also attempted to combat hoarding by limiting deliveries to wholesale customers to the amounts of their existing contracts.
But the meaning of the freeze was not clear last night, because of an unexpected turn in the oil market. By midnight New York time, prices had fallen to below their starting point. North Sea Brent, which has been trading for about $2.20 under the price of oil on the New York Merc, was reported at $28, implying that the exchange would open this morning below where it closed last night, despite the start of fighting in the Middle East.
 
Price Spike Expected
 Traders had long expected a price spike, because of the uncertainty created by war, but most had thought it would last a few days, or a week or two. "The entire spike has occurred while the future market in New York was asleep," said Thomas Blakeslee, an analyst at Pegasus Econometric Group, of Hoboken, N.J., at midnight last night.
The cash market is harder to monitor than prices on the exchanges, however, and the jump oil markets could still take sharp swings in either direction.
The news that bombing of Iraq had begun came hours after the close of the two big markets, the New York Mercantile Exchange and the International Petroleum Exchange in London, so that the price change was evident only in cash trades between oil companies.
Under rules recently adopted by the New York Merc, prices for delivery in the first two months -- currently February and March -- are limited to a movement of $7.50. At that point, trading would halt for an hour. When it resumed, if the price moved another $7.50 in the same direction, further price changes that day would be barred.
The oil company announcements come less than a week before many large oil companies are expected to announce stunning profit increases for the fourth quarter.
"The outbreak of war in the Middle East could cause a run-up in world oil prices," said Richard J. Stegemeier, Unocal's chairman. "We urge our customers to avoid any panic buying or fuel hoarding here at home that could create a supply-demand imbalance in the market."
 
Strategic Reserves
 Late last night, President Bush authorized Energy Secretary James D. Watkins to make available 1.12 million barrels of oil a day for the next 30 days from the strategic petroleum reserve. In normal times, the United States imports about seven million barrels a day.
Speaking in a telephone interview last evening as prices were near their peak, Theodore Eck, chief economist of the Amoco Corporation, said that any price increase reflected fear, and not reaction to events in the oilfields. "There's no news at all of anything hitting anything in Saudi Arabia, and it's irrelevant, in a technical sense, what happens to oilfields in Iraq or Kuwait," he said. "They're not producing anyway."
At Cambridge Energy Research Associates, W. Dennis Eklof, a senior consultant, pointed out that apart from the war threat, "The fundamentals of the market are still that there's an excess of supply, but we have seen continuously since last August that there is a war premium in the price."
William Randol, an oil industry expert at First Boston, said that the price freezes by the oil companies were not surprising, and that other companies were likely to freeze wholesale prices or announce that they were going slow on raising fuel prices to match crude rises.
"They're worried that someone would propose a windfall profits tax," he said. "They're looking for brownie points; they're looking to be good corporate citizens."
He added that crude prices are likely to rise only for a few days, so the sacrifice by the oil companies might not be that large.
 
Price Increases in the Future
 "If crude oil prices don't come down -- and I would be surprised if they don't -- over the next two or three months, the companies can raise gas prices to compensate," Mr. Randol said.
Several companies with large refining operations, including Chevron, Exxon and Mobil, are among those expected to post sharp gains in profits. Their operations improved in the quarter because crude costs fell in the quarter far more rapidly than retail and wholesale prices for refined products like gasoline, heating oil and jet fuel.
Some members of Congress already have introduced bills to enact a windfall profits tax that would limit oil-industry profits, with earnings above a certain percentage being paid back to the Government.
In a statement issued shortly before 8 P.M. yesterday, Lawrence J. Rawl, chairman and chief executive of the Exxon Corporation, said oil supplies in the United States and around the world appeared to be "sufficient to meet demand."
 
Prices at the Pump
 Mr. Rawl did not address the question of gasoline pump prices, but said, "Exxon pledges that it will do everything within the capability of its supply system to insure continued supplies for its customers."
Conoco, which is based in Houston, said its decision to hold retail gasoline prices was meant to insulate customers from possible price surges at the pump that could follow "the outbreak of hostilities." It said the freeze would continue "for the time being."
Average prices for unleaded regular gasoline across the United States had fallen approximately 14 cents since peaking at $1.37 a gallon late last year. For instance, the average price in Texas this week was $1.23 a gallon, according industry officials.
On energy markets before last night's attack, product prices rose. Heating oil closed at 91.6 cents a gallon, up 6.9 cents, and gasoline was at 82.19 cents, up 5.15 cents.
 
Instances of Extra Demand
 At Sun Refining and Marketing, which does business in 28 states east of the Rockies under the Sunoco and Atlantic names, Paul J. Durkin, a spokesman, said the company's product terminals had seen "spotty" instances of extra demand. The company is now limiting its customers to 100 percent of the volume on contracts they have signed. Since demand recently has been down slightly, the 100 percent figure is likely to satisfy most retailers.
Sun does not have its own wells, having spun off its exploration and production division into a new company more than a year ago. But Mr. Durkin said, "Everything I've seen says we're not going to have a problem getting our hands on supply."
Marathon Oil is limiting the gas stations that sell under its brand name to 300 percent of their contract amounts a day for the remainder of January; others can buy up to 200 percent a day, with lower limits for a 10-day period. "I hope people will be calm," said William Ryder, a company spokesman. "We've been telling people, there's plenty of supply out there, and I hope the message has gotten through. But when the first shot is fired, Lord knows what people are going do."
Mobil is also limiting sales, and Phillips Petroleum is charging a 10-cent-a-gallon surcharge on purchases above contract specifications.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: EGYPT;
Exiles From Kuwait Rejoice in Cairo

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Thursday, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Hundreds of Kuwaitis drove their cars around the corniche and over briges crossing the Nile River in downtown Cairo, honking and waving flags at around 2 A.M., after news of the American attack against Iraq and Kuwait began to spread here.
Egyptian television suspended regular programming in the early morning to announce that "the Persian Gulf battle has started." 
 Egyptian national radio, which broadcasts around the Arab world, transmitted President Bush's formal announcement of the start of the war at 4 A.M. Cairo time.
"Thank God! Thank God!" was a cry heard over and over again in the lobby of the Intercontinental Hotel, where some Kuwaitis are staying, as many of them began to drift into the lobby, into the streets and eventually into cars in which they joined others.
 
30,000 Egyptians Deployed
 In the early morning, most of this city's 13 million people was asleep, unware that a battle in which some 30,000 to 40,000 Egyptian soldiers may take part had just begun.
An Egyptian taxi driver who toured the city, watching the Kuwaitis demonstrating their enthusiasm, said: "We are worried about our people who are there. I hope the Americans have a good map. They should stay away from the areas where Egyptians live."
It is estimated that 750,000 Egyptians are still living in Iraq. A senior Egyptian Foreign Ministry official said on Wednesday that efforts were under way to evacuate them via Jordan at a pace that may rise to 50,000 a day.
But as early reports filtered to Egypt, it appeared that the initial attack against Iraq had largely avoided residential areas, at least in Baghdad, where many of the Egyptians live.
 
Effect on Economy Feared
 Over the last two days, Egyptian newspapers have been filled with commentary warning of the devastating effect that a war will have on the economy of the region.
Egypt has already suffered the impact of about one million expatriate Egyptians who have returned from Kuwait and Iraq since the invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. Most have come back destitute, and are unable to find employment in an economy that cannot employ much of the work force.
In addition to the new burden they represent, Egypt has been deprived of the remittances they used to send, a loss that has amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars since August.
Tourism and the Suez Canal, two other major sources of income for Egypt, have been badly affected. The number of tourists in Egypt now is barely a 10th of the normal figure for this time of year, and fewer ships are traversing the canal.
 
Calm Is Seen in Cairo
 The early morning edition of Al Ahram, the semi-official newspaper, declared that war had started in a banner headline that proclaimed the destruction of all missile bases, Iraqi communications centers, the Baghdad airport and the Iraqi broadcast station.
"The Iraqi Air Force was nowhere in the battle of sky," Al Ahram said, adding that "the bombing aims at the total paralysis of Iraq."
Cairo seemed calm and authorities said the airport would function normally today and that Government-owned television would continue to broadcast news in a nonstop fashion to cover the gulf war.
It even seemed that the apparent success of the first strike against Iraq hads motivated some writers to speak of the beginning of a new erar for the Arab world.
"The tragedy of a large number of the population in the Arab world is that it is living in a fog in which its rulers have been turned to gods who demand thatey their subjects kneel and worships them," wrote Said Senbel, editor in chief of Al Akbar, the largest Egyptian daily, in a front-page editorial today.
Mr. Senbel went on to say that the era of empty sloaganeering in praise of Arab dictators hads come to end, "and it is its a sorry thing that some people never learn."
 
Castro Criticizes U.N.
 HAVANA, Jan. 16 (Special to The New York Times) -- The Cuban President, Fidel Castro, criticized the United Nations tonight for the outbreak of war in the Persian Gulf.
In remarks to foreign journalists moments after he was told of the outbreak of fighting in the gulf, Mr. Castro said:
"The Security Council had a great arsenal of measures at its disposal, even economic measures, medical measures without embargoing food measures. There could have been other economic measures. There could have been isolation. There could have been more political condemnation. There were a broad range of measures that they could have taken without resorting to weapons. From the beginning to the end, they had only a declaration to war, not to peace."
He also said the war could have its most severe consequences for third world nations like Cuba. He feared that an increase in oil prices would drastically hurt his economy, which is already operating under austerity measures imposed five months ago.
 
Japan Considers More Aid
 TOKYO, Thursday, Jan. 17 (Special to The New York Times) -- Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu summoned his senior national security advisers into an emergency session this morning amid signs that Japan would make some sort of announcement about providing additional financial assistance to the war against Iraq.
Japanese officials said they would try to prepare a quick announcement of assistance to try to mute possible worldwide criticism over Japan's decision to help pay for the war but not to go into combat itself.
The officials said Tokyo also wanted to avoid the delays in announcing aid that led to criticism last summer.
"The most important message we have right now is that we stand firmly by the United States," Taizo Watanabe, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said on Wednesday. "We won't have to ask America if they need a contribution. We take it for granted they will need it, and we have got to pay."

WAR IN THE GULF A14-19
The war in the Persian Gulf began as the United States and allied forces struck targets in Baghdad and other sites in Iraq and Kuwait with waves of bombers and cruise missiles launched from naval vessels. Page A1
The military campaign started, as expected, with air strikes on a huge scale in Iraq and in Kuwait. The aim was to cripple the Iraqi military by destroying command and control centers, and establish air superiority by knocking out Iraqi air defenses and airfields. A1
The first planes that headed off to attack Iraq from a big Saudi air base were F-15 fighter bombers. They thundered off into what had been a still desert night at 12:50 A.M. A1

 News analysis: "The liberation of Kuwait has begun," the White House announced, echoing a war pronouncement by Dwight D. Eisenhower. The choice of words was apt; for months, President Bush has sought to compare his struggle against Saddam Hussein and Iraq to that against Hitler and Germany. A16

A big decline in industrial output was indicated in a Government report. Analysts said the report eroded confidence in the widely held, though far from unanimous, view that the recession would be brief and mild. D1
The Senate ethics panel's hearings concluded, and the panel prepared to deliberate the fate of the five Senators accused of improperly acting to influence Federal regulators investigating Charles Keating. B6
Women are less likely to be victims of violent crime than are men, but women who are victimized are far more likely to have been attacked by someone with whom they are intimate, according to a Justice Department study.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: AMERICA'S REACTION - U.S. AND ALLIES OPEN AIR WAR ON IRAQ; BOMB BAGHDAD AND KUWAITI TARGETS; 'NO CHOICE' BUT FORCE, BUSH DECLARES;
A TENSE WAIT ENDS

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
In one long moment yesterday, word that the United States had attacked Baghdad swept the country.
In split-level suburban homes on the East Coast where dinner was in the oven, in big-city restaurants in the Midwest where bars were jammed with the happy-hour crowd and in skyscraper offices on the West Coast where people were still at work, there was an odd mixture of apprehension, sadness and relief. 
 In malls, shoppers emptied out of stores and cried. In supermarkets, cashiers rushed to call relatives and share the news that after five months of waiting and wondering America was at war. In department stores, people crowded in front of television sets, with some saying they were stunned that President Bush had decided to act so soon after the United Nations deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
 
A Scene Out of World War II
 Suddenly, in public places where cacophony is the norm, there was an unusual silence, eerie rather than giddy. Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan -- where even whispers can take on an echoing, high-decibel intensity -- was quiet. On trains to Connecticut, passengers gathered around people who had radios with headsets. "The people with the radios would listen to the news and then relay it to the other passengers," said Dan Brucker, a spokesman for the Metro-North Commuter Railroad, "kind of like World War II radio dispatchers delivering the news."
The word that waves of air attacks were striking Iraq silenced black-tie galas in Manhattan. And in a Houston hotel, the chatter around the bar stopped when the President began his speech from the Oval Office. Only the machine making frozen margaritas kept whirring.
Some people applauded Mr. Bush's decision to order the attack. "It was direct and to the point," Lester Alexander, a New Orleans real-estate investor, said of Mr. Bush's speech. "He did not try to sell me on his reasons, but he explained to me why he took the action. For a politician, that's good. I had a feeling I was hearing truth."
For other people, it was a long night of ambivalence and complicated, conflicting emotions. "I support what Bush is doing," said Scott Mosenson, the manager of a Los Angeles restaurant. "But there's definitely dissonance inside of me. The taking of lives, any lives, is hard to deal with.
"But I'm not a moral absolutist, and I try to envision the highest good possible, so I pray the highest good comes out of the this. I believe Bush is acting in good conscience."
 
Taking to the Streets
 But others questioned Mr. Bush's motivation. And some took their objections to the streets.
Protesters chanting "no blood for oil" assembled in Times Square about an hour after the announcement of the attack. Their target was the military recriting office at 43rd Street and Broadway, some sitting in the street and delaying traffic.
Later the demonstrators walked east toward the United Nations, delaying traffic on Second Avenue and setting police barricades on fire. Two demonstrators were arrested, one for assaulting a police officer by kicking him in the throat.
Although the protesters, then about 2,500 strong, slowed traffic, some motorists honked their horns in support.
Shortly after midnight, the protesters marched back to Times Square, where some burned an American flag.
Two anti-war demonstrators fell from the Brooklyn Bridge early this morning when a car struck a group of protesters marching across the bridge, the police said.
One demonstrator fell 40 feet to a parking lot beneath the western end of the bridge, and the other apparently fell into the East River, said Sgt. Tina S. Mohrmann, a police spokeswoman. The condition of the two demonstrators was not immediately known, the police said.
 
Airport Security Tight
 Airports around the country, where fears of terrorist attacks had been rising all week, went on highest alert shortly before midnight. This means, among other things, that passengers will not be able check luggage at the curbside and that airport roadways will be monitored.
A Federal Aviation Administration official said many airports had taken these steps on their own before the agency's order. Passengers were told to allow more time than usual for checking in.
 Telephone callers may not have it so easy. U S Sprint said its international switching center had been swamped. The American Telephone and Telegraph Company asked customers not to call the Middle East, saying its international lines had also been overloaded with Americans phoning business associates, friends and loved ones.
Other rhythms of daily life skipped a beat as soon as the allied fighter planes began crisscrossing the Iraqi sky. The President's speech interrupted music videos on the MTV cable-television network, which played peace songs from the 1960's afterwards. In Times Square, even the strippers at the all-nude Paris Theater clustered inside the red-curtained lobby, watching television news. And some Americans worried how close to home the conflict might come.
"You don't know what to expect and then you think, 'Am I really going to be affected by this?' " said Carla Houston of Cupertino, Calif. "Physically, I probably won't be. Mentally, I know I will be. I mean, I was only 6 years old during Vietnam."
On college campuses, on sidewalks and in city parks, people who had not heard the news said they realized something had happened just by the way friends said hello on the telephone. "I called home and my boyfriend was in tears," said Robin Cheevers, a 27-year-old legal secretary in San Francisco.
 In bars and restaurants, managers made somber announcements. At Joe's Stone Crab, a restaurant in Miami Beach, George Silas punched the button on the public address system.
"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, "I've just received word that the United States has started to bombard Iraq. The war is on." There was no cheering and no clapping among the 50 or so customers.
The excitement level was higher in a crowded pub near Dupont Circle in Washington. Robert Parkes Jr. motioned to a bartender and said: "The war's on. Have a drink!"
 But, with two televisions blaring the news at both ends of the bar, Mr. Parkes said: "I have mixed emotions. I don't want lives wasted. That's why I'm kind of happy to hear that the bombs are flying. I know I sound like I have veins in my teeth, but if we do it, we should make it mean something. Let's not make this into another Vietnam."
At the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas, executives huddled around television sets. "We seem now to really have crossed the line," said one, Alan Feldman. "It's no longer hyperbole and politicians' statements."
It was a moment many had not expected, at least not so soon after the United Nations deadline. "It's scary," said Cindy Winterhalter, a textile designer in Manhattan. "I guess, like a lot of people, even though the deadline had passed, I was hoping there would still be some negotiations or something. But when you make a commitment and a statement like that, I guess you have to follow through with it."
After all the failed diplomacy and conflicting expectations, Mr. Bush's decision brought relief for some. At dusk in the Pike Place Market, Seattle's most popular open-air market, a passer-by announced the start of war. "Finally," said Gary Levy, a vendor there. "Finally."
Some who had been worrying about the outbreak of war talked about where they were when they heard the news, wondering if the conflict would take on the personal historical significance that older generations assign to crackly radio broadcasts of Pearl Harbor or bulletins on black-and-white television about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
Rosemary Scanlon, an economist for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, had just arrived at her Brooklyn apartment. She turned on the television in her living room, and while it was warming up, she walked to the bedroom to turn on the radio. As she was walking back to the living room, she heard a reporter in Baghdad saying the bombing had begun.
"I said, 'Oh, God, here we go,' " she said. "I'd worried about it for days. I've had to give two speeches in the last three days about the economic outlook for New York City and New Jersey and I've been thinking about what could be this terrible blow to us all: war. I've been thinking, all of our economic problems are manageable in the context of this war. Just let this pass by and I'll happily solve the savings and loan crisis, the city's fiscal problems, just go down the list of all the problems and I'll solve them."
 
Critical Words From Ellsberg
 In Washington, Daniel J. Ellsberg, the Defense Department analyst in the 1960's who became a prominent opponent of the Vietnam War, was critical of Mr. Bush's decision. He said the President appeared to be ordering the type of massive air strike that the Joint Chiefs of Staff and hawks like Barry Goldwater had advocated, unsuccessfully, against North Vietnam in 1965.
"If the bombing fails in Iraq, I'm afraid the President will compound the error by the worst possible gamble, a ground assault," Mr. Ellsberg said, "with the net result that we will destroy Kuwait in order to liberate it."
That fear was echoed in Detroit , which has the largest concentration of Arab-Americans in this country. Clutching rosaries and lighting candles in their living rooms, some Iraqi Christians voiced despair and resignation as they watched Mr. Bush announce the attack on their homeland.
"I'm visualizing Baghdad at this moment," said Josie Sarafa, a teacher who lives in the Detroit suburb of Birmingham. "The work of centuries will go down the drain."
The concern at a Jewish Community Center in San Francisco, where parents picking up their children from an after-school program stopped to watch Mr. Bush's speech, was more immediate. "I think he tried to justify something nobody yet understands," said Jackie Lewis, 36. "I don't see the reason for the war."
Then the parents prayed.

HEADLINE: Art Deco Lovers Gather in Miami

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MIAMI BEACH, Jan. 16

 BODY:
Admirers of the pastels and streamlined forms of the Art Deco hotels and apartment houses in Miami Beach came here from around the world last weekend to learn from preservationists who helped establish the nation's first historic Art Deco district. The event was the World Congress of Art Deco.
Delegates from Argentina and Australia, among other places, discussed preservation tactics and Art Deco sites around the world. They hope to establish an international plan to conserve the architectural style. 
 Art Deco, the sleek, elegant style associated with glamour and sophistication, takes its name from the Exposition des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes, a design fair held in Paris in 1925. The style took hold as the United States entered the Depression. In the 1980's, the blue and pink concrete "painted ladies" of Miami Beach provided the backdrop for the television show "Miami Vice" and helped popularize Art Deco again.
In 1979, a square-mile district of 800 Art Deco and Mediterranean Revival buildings in Miami Beach was put on the National Register of Historic Places. The founder of the Miami Design Preservation League, Barbara Baer Capitman, who led the four-year effort to designate the area a landmark, died last March.
"I think that for many years Art Deco was underestimated," said Luis Rivas, an architect who teaches at the national university in Buenos Aires. "It was considered a poor cousin of the International Style of modern architecture."
Leaders of the Art Deco Society of Western Australia told of demonstrations in Perth to protect Art Deco buildings. "It's been a battlefield of preservation," said Vyonne Geneve, the society's president.
The unsuccessful efforts to save a 1936 Art Deco chapel of a crematorium in Perth included vigils at dawn in the chapel's sanctuary and rallies on the steps of Parliament.
Groans were heard as Ms. Geneve showed a videotape of an official saying he wanted to demolish the chapel because "it's become outdated."
"So has the Parthenon," Ms. Geneve pointed out.
Mr. Rivas said the weak economy in Argentina has blocked developers from tearing down many of the Art Deco buildings in Buenos Aires. Yet the lack of Argentine Government financing has left many of the Art Deco theaters, office buildings and homes of the 1920's and 1930's in ruins.

HEADLINE: Mr. Dinkins Does His Painful Duty

 BODY:
The preliminary budget Mayor David Dinkins released yesterday offers a plausible start at getting ahead of the continuing plunge in New York City's revenues. His plan confronts an anticipated budget gap of nearly $2 billion mainly by cutting some spending and seeking an unusually large package of new taxes. It is not yet as rigorous as it may have to become, but it's a conscientious start.
The plan does not yet take adequate advantage of the recession to make government more efficient through fundamental reorganization; a new mayoral committee of business and labor experts may find ways to do that. Nor, despite threats of huge layoffs, does the plan reduce the city's work force by more than 8,500 employees by June. 
 What Mr. Dinkins does in this plan, as he must by law, is balance the budget, and he has done so reasonably and responsibly. He does not resort to wholesale fiscal gimmicks or borrowing, and even increases the general reserve against emergencies.
The preliminary budget also shows he has made some difficult choices. They are more difficult than they might have been had City Hall negotiated less costly labor contracts, but they are tough nonetheless, reflecting Mr. Dinkins's sober conclusion that, "In this environment, we must measure our priorities by what we cut the least."
Sanitation, parks, bridge maintenance and hospitals are hit hard, while the Police Department and spending for some social services grow. The largest cut -- $321 million -- is imposed on the Board of Education. A cut that deep would be devastating, but may not be real. The city is clearly trying to put pressure on the State Legislature for higher education aid. Moreover, the city is now negotiating a wage deferral with the teachers' union and that would restore some of the cut.
The fate of the education budget is one of many unknowns. If the city has guessed wrong, it will probably have to cut much more. For instance, the plan calls for $580 million in new or higher taxes, on top of the $181 million earmarked for the city's new police program.
Much of the tax package needs state legislative approval, highly unlikely in a year when the state faces a huge deficit of its own. The plan also relies on saving $100 million by getting out from under some state requirements; but those requirements haven't been lifted yet and the Legislature has been resistant in the past.
It's another five months before the new budget has to be adopted, and the Mayor won't have to present his plan in final form until April. That leaves Mr. Dinkins and his administration the time and opportunity to finish the job now so conscientiously begun.

HEADLINE: Supply and Demand Govern Ship Charter

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Pentagon Paying High Prices for Shipping Supplies to Gulf" (front page, Dec. 24) does not describe the operation of the ship charter market very well. The ship charter market is one of the few areas of economic activity truly governed by supply and demand. When ships are in short supply or when the demand for ships increases sharply, as now, charter rates escalate. And when the high rates bring more ships into the market, or when demand slackens, the rates plummet.
Owning ships and trading them in the charter market is a very risky business. While it has made a few noted billionaires, it has made many more bankrupts. So to quote a shipping analyst describing the charter rates as "ludicrous" misses the point. The rates have certainly been high, but also appropriate to a particular situation at a particular time.
While there is no ceiling to charter rates, there is also no floor, and the same economic forces that boosted the rates can ratchet them down to losing levels very quickly. Adam Smith would be right at home in this market.

Personally

BYLINE: By Anna Quindlen

 BODY:
Woman walks into a bakery, where there's a sign announcing that the price of bagels will go up a nickel on Jan. 15. "War and an increase in the price of bagels on the same day," she says.
"I hope he backs down," says the baker. 
 "Who?" says the woman. "Saddam Hussein or George Bush?"
"Either one," the baker says.
Bagels were more expensive yesterday, and war broke out. Real life was peculiar, with an edge of sadness and of slow motion, and a sense of New Year's Eve gone nuclear: only one shopping day till Armageddon. "Now it is our job to shift without too much awkwardness . . ." Bob Costas said Saturday on NBC Sports, segueing from reports on war to a football post-mortem. That is what it is like. Dinner and war. Homework and war. The mundane and the horrible.
There's a moment in one of the Godfather movies when a capo is being executed for disloyalty. "It was business," he says of his traitorous behavior.
This is personal.
It's personal for Saddam Hussein. This war is a career move. His psyche has been dissected like a biology class frog, but it seems to me that he suffers from a lethal dose of that craziness that afflicts anyone audacious enough to lead a nation, egomania. The Secretary General of the United Nations came to call, hoping to avert the deaths of thousands upon thousands of people, and when he left Saddam Hussein delivered this non sequitur: "He met the American President four times before coming to us."
This brings to mind the moment in Woody Allen's "Bananas" when the new dictator of a Central American country belittles the danish Mr. Allen has brought him. "He brings cake for a group of people," complains one of the dictator's aides, "he doesn't even bring an assortment." Saddam Hussein's comment might be humorous in its egocentricity if it were not so ominous, such a clear indication of how he has intertwined this conflict with those two little words: Big Man.
For George Bush this is personal, too. I don't think the wimp factor is the only thing at work here. But I think that the sled of public positioning always stands at the top of a slippery slope, and when it begins to move, it is difficult to stop it or slow it down, even when half the electorate are yelling, "Wait a minute!" Sanctions needed more time to work, more time than the sled allowed. But that, alas, is yesterday's story.
This is personal. Most people agree that Saddam Hussein is pond scum and that he can't be permitted to take Kuwait as though it were the lunch money of the littlest kid in class. But then they ask themselves this question: Would I sacrifice my child for this?
And the answer is often no.
I only hope that we will continue, when this is done, to take these issues personally. We should take personally the fact that we habitually give aid to the kind of men we can easily and accurately describe as monsters.
We should take personally the fact that few politicians have had the guts or the vision to shape a coherent energy policy that would lessen our dependence on foreign oil. And we should take personal responsibility for the fact that we have not had the will to conserve or change.
We should take personally the idea that if there is to be a new world order, it must include a new answer to the question: Why us? It is time for our messiah complex to get a good overhaul. We can no longer afford economically, psychologically or politically to be the policeman of the world, even if we are the first one called when someone needs a cop.
That will be then. This is now. Time has stopped. So do our hearts, each time a clinch on "One Life to Live" is punctuated by the words "We interrupt this program to bring you a special report. . . ." In Des Moines, a teen-ager demonstrating against the war said he did not want a big black wall in Washington with his name on it. In the desert, a soldier wrote to his wife saying that he would understand if she remarried. It came to me that, no matter how swift the conflict, we will someday soon be reading about the design for the memorial to its dead.
"When do they decide to call it World War III?" a friend asked the other day.
I don't know. There's so much we don't know today. I only know that everyone seems sad and afraid, that the loss and mourning had begun even before the fighting. We are taking this very personally indeed.

HEADLINE: What Recession? Auction Records of 1990

BYLINE: By RITA REIF

 BODY:
THE weak economy notwithstanding, last year antiques and collectibles buffs paid the highest prices ever for the rarest objects auctioned. While sales slowed at auctions, fairs and antiques shops, bidders flocked to those auctions where uncommon items were offered, some with choice pedigrees. Most of the records were toppled in sales held during the first half of the year, before the worldwide economy worsened and war threatened in the Middle East.
Herve Aaron, who heads Didier Aaron's New York gallery, said he was certain that prices would continue to escalate for quality examples of period furniture and decorative arts. 
 "Everything top quality will continue to soar in value," Mr. Aaron said. "Things of lesser quality will maintain their prices or decline about 20 percent."
Diana D. Brooks, president of Sotheby's North America, said: "Buying will continue in collecting areas where there has been the least amount of speculation, where there is a strong collector base and where the people buying are from strong economies -- France, Germany, Spain and Japan."
Furniture upstaged all else and realized the highest prices in the auction arena. The most sumptuous piece on the market this year, a lavishly gilded and inlaid Italian cabinet commissioned by an English duke in 1726, brought $15.2 million on July 5 at Christie's in London. This hefty family heirloom, more than 12 feet tall, was sold by David Somerset, Duke of Beaufort, a descendant of the original owner, to pay estate taxes and the costs of upkeep on Badminton House (where the game was born) in Gloucestershire. The cabinet had reigned there since about 1730.
The collector who outbid all competitors to acquire the cabinet was Barbara Piasecka Johnson of Princeton, N.J., widow of J. Seward Johnson of the pharmaceuticals family.
Musical instruments made headlines several times in the London sales. On April 25 at Sotheby's, one of Jimi Hendrix's guitars, a white 1968 Fender Stratocaster that the rock star used at Woodstock in 1969, became the most expensive guitar ever sold at auction. It was sold for $334,620 to Red Ronnie, an Italian actor.
On Nov. 21, a red violin by Antonio Stradivari from 1720 brought $1.7 million at Christie's, a record at auction for a musical instrument. It was bought by an American woman whom the auction house described as "a young professional violinist." The violin was owned from the late 19th century until the 1950's by members of the Mendelssohn banking family of Berlin, descendants of the composer Felix Mendelssohn.
Collectibles, another area where the choicest objects did surprisingly well while run-of-the-mill items declined in price or went unsold, achieved unexpectedly high records.
A 1905 tin sign advertising Campbell's Soups was auctioned in July at Oliver's Auction Gallery in Kennebunk, Me., for $93,500, more than double what one of these signs brought in 1989. In June, a 1950 uniform worn by Jackie Robinson of the Brooklyn Dodgers was sold by Lelands, a Manhattan auction house, for $16,093, a record for a baseball shirt.
Even more remarkable was Sotheby's auction in Milan, Italy, of some relatively new watches, a sale that Andrea Amedesi, the managing director, found as exciting "as a football match." The sale of 62 Swatch watches, some designed by artists and produced in limited editions, included designs made from 1983 to 1989. The costliest, the artist Mimmo Paladino's 1989 black, white and red watch, brought $20,210, a record at auction for a Swatch watch.
The numbers on the face of Paladino's offbeat design are reversed, and the dominant image, a black devil's face, has a red tongue that serves as the hour hand. One of an edition of 100, the watch originally cost about $70. The money paid for this watch and the 61 others totaled $191,410 and was contributed by Swatch, the seller, to the scholarship fund of Domus's design school in Milan.
More conventional collecting areas like American folk art and furniture were bid to astounding levels, especially in sales held last January. On Jan. 27, a splendid 1860's copper and zinc weathervane of a horse and rider changed hands for $770,000 at Sotheby's in New York, a record for a weathervane.
On Jan. 20, an 18th-century Philadelphia pier table by Thomas Tuffts, exquisitely carved with a Chinese-style apron, became the most expensive table in the world when it was sold at Christie's in New York for $4.6 million to Harold Sack of Israel Sack, a Manhattan dealer.
"A lot of the pieces that brought these prices were put on the market to take advantage of the high prices other works brought at auction," Mr. Sack said.
Mr. Sack, who came into the business in the 1930's, said some records for American furniture were set in 1929 and 1930 that were not eclipsed until the 1960's. "In 1931, prices had not collapsed but no masterpieces came up, and everything was sold at a slower pace," he said.
Oprah Winfrey was determined to buy an 1830's Shaker work counter in an Aug. 5 sale by Willis Henry Auctions in New Lebanon, N.Y. The 44-inch-long table desk was sold for 10 times its estimate, or $220,000, the highest price ever paid at auction for Shaker furniture.
"I loved it and I knew it would be perfect," Ms. Winfrey said later.
Records were rewritten last year for traditional as well as more adventurous Oriental art. In November, a 19th-century Chinese jadeite snuff bottle was sold for $607,188 in a Hong Kong sale by Sotheby's to Peter Lai, a local dealer. A Japanese ivory netsuke, a palm-sized toggle four inches high in the form of a grazing horse, brought $257,180 at Sotheby's in London in May. The price paid by a London dealer, Barry Davies, was a record at auction for a netsuke.
A new high was established for Chinese furniture. A horseshoe-back armchair from the 16th or 17th century was sold at Sotheby's in New York on Oct. 19 for $176,000 to an anonymous American buyer.
"The fastest growth seen recently in the decorative arts was for Japanese and Korean works of art," said Christopher Burge, president of Christie's in the United States. A pair of Japanese 17th-century six-panel screens depicting a panoramic view of Kyoto was sold at Christie's in New York in March for $1.76 million, almost three times the presale estimate and a record for Japanese screens sold at auction.
An eight-panel Korean screen depicting Confucian court ceremonies, from the late 18th or early 19th century, was sold for $1.05 million, a record for Korean art at auction.
Silver objects commanded extraordinary prices in a number of auctions. A 17th-century Sicilian table fountain was bought at Christie's in New York in April for $1.98 million. The 22-inch-tall tour de force of metalworking skills is the only known surviving example of such a table decoration.
The buyer was Armitage, a London dealer. The wine fountain, depicting Orion, a symbol of Messina's maritime supremacy, was sold for $1,500 in 1947 from the estate of J. P. Morgan Jr. at Parke-Bernet Galleries, Sotheby's predecessor in New York.
"The prices of silver have not risen nearly as sharply as the prices of Impressionist paintings," Mr. Burge said. "They were not subject to the sort of speculator frenzy that other areas of collecting were."
Jacques Koopman, a London silver dealer, kept busy throughout last year paying top prices at auctions for teapots, salvers and candlesticks. One of Mr. Koopman's major purchases, in October, was an exuberant 18-light English silver chandelier from 1837 by Robert Garrard 2d. Mr. Koopman bought it for $1.16 million at Christie's in New York, in partnership with two other London dealers, S. J. Phillips and Partridge. It was a record at auction for a chandelier and for 19th-century silver.

HEADLINE: Fleet/Norstar Posts Deficit

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I., Jan. 16

 BODY:
Fleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc. today reported a fourth-quarter loss of $48.9 million after increasing its reserve fund for potentially bad loans to $700 million from $638.7 million.
For the year, Fleet's loss was $48.5 million. A year ago, Fleet earned $371 million, or $3.30 a share.
Fleet said it increased nonperforming loans to $987 million from $852 million, although the company said it still expected some of those loans would eventually "prove to be sound."
Fleet painted the loss as wise financial management that will put the company in good standing if the economy continues to worsen.
"We believe this action reflects prudent management in the current economic environment," Fleet's chairman and chief executive, J. Terrence Murray, said.
A Fleet spokesman, Charles Conway, said the loss was the first "in modern times" for the 200-year-old company. He said it was not clear when Fleet last recorded a loss for a full year, but it had not been since the early 1960's.
New England continued to be the drain for Fleet. The company's subsidiary banks in New York recorded earnings, although down from a year ago, but its banks in New England had losses, Fleet said.
Fleet's stock slipped 37.5 cents today, to $9.625, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Post 0.3% Increase

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16

 BODY:
Consumer prices rose three-tenths of a percent in December, the Labor Department said today, putting the year's inflation rate at a nine-year high and signaling that the recession has so far failed to control rising costs.
The Consumer Price Index, the key gauge of inflation, rose 6.1 percent in 1990, up from 4.6 percent in 1989. It was the sharpest advance since an 8.9 percent jump in 1981. 
 The rise in oil prices since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 accounted for most of 1990's inflation. The energy index shot up 35.4 percent, its sharpest rise since the Iranian revolution in 1979, when prices rose 52.1 percent.
But even if the often-volatile food and energy prices are excluded, inflation remained robust -- climbing four-tenths of a percent in December and 5.2 percent for the year.
Analysts said the December figure indicated that the recession had so far failed to tame price rises.
"The slowdown has not yet chewed too meaningfully into consumer inflation," said Robert Dederick, an economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. "But it takes time for this to manifest itself."
Despite the figures, some economists and officials said the downturn might be easing.
"It is still declining, but at a slower pace," Samuel Kahan, an economist at Fuji Securities Inc. in Chicago, said of the industrial sector.
 
The Fed Chief's View
 This view is shared by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who said in The Washington Post today that the economy was stabilizing after falling into a recession in the fourth quarter.
If the signs are correct, "the worst is behind us," Mr. Greenspan told Washington-area businessmen at a lunch on Tuesday.
Bond prices fell on the chairman's remarks, seeing it as a sign the Fed would not continue to reduce interest rates to help stimulate the economy.
But the White House economic adviser, Michael J. Boskin, said the recession was likely to continue for a while.
In a speech to the Transportation Research Board, Mr. Boskin said fourth-quarter figures would show a significant contraction of the gross national product.
Robert McGee, an economist at Tokai Bank Ltd., said the main reason inflation remained moderately strong was that the service sector has only recently moved into recession, so price declines there have yet to emerge.
 
Services Cost More
 Service costs, which account for 55 percent of the price index, rose four-tenths of a percent in December, the same rate as a month earlier, and by 5.7 percent for the year. Medical costs were a major factor in the latest inflation report, rising seven-tenths of a percent in December and 9.6 percent for the year.
"It is just a matter of it taking quite a while for inflation to come down," Mr. McGee said.
He said he was starting to see signs that weakness in manufacturing was working its way through to retail prices. Prices of manufactured goods, excluding the food and energy figures, rose only 3.4 percent in 1990, down from 4 percent a year earlier.
Falling gasoline prices during the lull in the Persian Gulf crisis also provided some relief in December. They were down three-tenths of a percent, reversing the 27.2 percent climb of the previous four months.
The drop would have been larger but for a 5-cent-a-gallon tax imposed Dec. 1 as part of an accord on the Federal budget.
But analysts fear the drop will prove short-lived in a war in the Persian Gulf. War is expected to reignite inflation by sending oil prices climbing. Analysts say that will kill consumer confidence, deepening the current recession.

HEADLINE: Ameritech Net Falls Sharply

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
The Ameritech Corporation yesterday announced a sharp drop in fourth-quarter profits, and Wall Street analysts greeted the report as a poor omen for results soon to be released by the other six regional Bell companies.
Other local and long-distance telephone companies are also likely to report low growth in the fourth quarter, said John S. Bain, a telephone industry analyst at Raymond James & Associates Inc., a St. Petersburg, Fla., brokerage. "It's no secret the phone business is slowing down generally," he said. 
 William H. Springer, the vice chairman and chief financial and administrative officer of Ameritech, said only part of the drop in earnings reflected a weakening economy. Most resulted from a series of small, one-time expenses, he said, for which the company did not release figures.
Ameritech, based in Chicago, said profits dropped 13.5 percent, to $286.8 million, from $331.7 million in the comparable 1989 period. Earnings per share fell to $1.09 from $1.22.
 
Revenues Rise by 3.5%
 Revenues for the company, which provides local telephone service in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, rose 3.5 percent, to $2.7 billion from $2.6 billion.
For all of 1990, Ameritech's profits increased by 1.3 percent, to $1.3 billion, and sales grew by 4.4 percent, to $10.7 billion.
Ameritech's shares fell 75 cents yesterday, to $63.25, on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts had predicted the company would earn $1.10 to $1.20 a share.
Mr. Springer said the one-time charges resulted from the purchase of a small German publisher of business-to-business telephone directories, administrative expenses following the third-quarter purchase of a large stake in New Zealand's telephone company and heavy investment in a new form of cellular telephone service involving many pocket-size phones and tiny radio transmitters.
Local telephone traffic showed little effect from the weakening economy, but there was a drop in the rate at which businesses ordered new telephone lines, Mr. Springer said in a telephone interview.

HEADLINE: 25% of Assaults Against Women Are by the Men in Their Lives

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
Women are less likely to be victims of violent crime than are men, while women who are victimized are far more likely to have been attacked by someone with whom they are intimate, according to a new study by the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics.
The study found that while violent crime against men dropped about 20 percent from 1973 to 1987, violence against women has stayed constant, with about 2.5 million women a year becoming victims of robbery, assault or rape. Those numbers, which include crimes not reported to the police, are based on interviews with at least 49,000 households a year. About four million men a year are victims of violent crime. 
 "Women have traditionally not been victimized by crime as much as men, but the trend is that the men's rates are coming down closer to the women's," said Caroline Wolf Harlow, the statistician who wrote the report. "But the main lesson of the study is that violent crime against women is different than crime against men because it's six times as likely to be committed by their intimates."
According to the study, which was made public on Sunday, 25 percent of the violent crime against women is committed by family members or men they have dated while only 4 percent of the violent crime against men is committed by family members or women they have dated. More than five of six of the violent crimes by intimates that were reported by female victims were assaults, including attacks with weapons, beatings or threats.
About one in five women victimized by a husband or former husband reported that they had been the victim of a series of similar crimes, with at least three assaults in the last six months so similar that they could not remember them distinctly.
"The overall issue is that men have so much more power than women, physically, politically and economically," said Lois Reckitt, the chairwoman of the National Organization for Women's newly formed Committee on Violence Against Women. "In the vast majority of cases, it's men who use violence, against men or against women, to solve problems. That is a result of our society and how we raise our kids, and that's what we need to address."
The special nature of violence against women, and the likelihood that the offender will be someone close to the victim, has attracted new attention on several fronts:
*Last month, Gov. Richard F. Celeste of Ohio granted clemency to 25 imprisoned women who had been convicted of killing or assaulting husbands or companions they said had abused them.
*On many college campuses, date rape has become a serious concern, prompting lectures and orientation sessions on the subject, discussion groups for men, and, at some schools, protests by women's groups accusing school administrators of not doing enough to combat the problem.
*On Monday, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, reintroduced legislation to combat violence against women by increasing penalties for sex crimes involving Federal violations, financing college campus rape prevention programs, increasing financing for shelters for battered women and provide $300 million for the police, prosecutors and courts to combat violent crimes against women.
"Today, it is easier to convict a car thief than a rapist," Senator Biden said. "Police officers are more likely to arrest a man for parking tickets than for beating his wife and lawyers still put victims of vicious assaults on the stand to ask what clothes they were wearing at the time of the attack. This bill would begin to remedy these types of problems."
 
Assaults Found to Be Serious
 The Bureau of Justice Statistics study found new evidence of the seriousness of the victimization of women by those closest to them. In 23 percent of the cases involving violence by an intimate, the victim received medical care, the study said, as against only 13 percent of the victims of other offenders. And women were victimized by their intimates were as likely to report the crime to the police as those victimized by stranger.
The study produced some puzzling results regarding rape. According to the statistics gathered in the household interviews, the rate of rapes and attempted rapes decreased by nearly a third from 1973 to 1987. The study estimated that there were 137,509 rapes and attempted rapes in 1987, down from 159,890 in 1973. The incidence of rape, the study said, dropped to 1.3 per 1,000 people 12 or older in 1987 from 1.9 per 1,000 in 1973.
However, according to the nation's other leading crime statistics -- those published by the Federal Bureau of Investigation based on reports to the police -- the incidence of rape has risen steadily since 1973. Indeed, rape was the fastest growing violent crime in the first six months of 1990 according to these statistics, with reported rapes rising 10 percent over the same period a year earlier. According to the F.B.I. statistics, the incidence of rape per 1,000 people rose to 0.37 in 1987 and 0.38 in 1989 from 0.25 in 1973.
The two measures differ in part because the F.B.I. statistics are based only on crimes reported to the police, while the Bureau of Justice Statistics study was based on interviews asking about all violent crime, whether or not reported. And while the F.B.I. statistics per 1,000 include the entire population, the Bureau of Justice Statistics figures include only people 12 and older.
Statisticians and experts on rape agree that the Bureau of Justice Statistics report of a drop in rapes should not be considered conclusive, for while the sample of households interviewed is large, rape is a relatively rare crime, so the number of rapes reported to interviewers in a given year was small. They ranged from 64 in 1987 to 136 in 1974. With numbers that small, statisticians say, it is difficult to draw any solid conclusion about trends from year to year.
Experts on rape, too, said they generally believed that the incidence of rape is rising and distrusted the Bureau of Justice Statistics report.
"I don't know anything about those particular statistics, but I do know when there's a rotten fish, and it's absolutely not true that rapes have been decreasing in number," said Susan Brownmiller, author of "Against Our Will," an influential book on rape.
Ms. Harlow said that although the statistical rape trends from year to year may be distorted, the aggregate rape data from the Bureau of Crime Statistics in all the years of the study can be trusted.
Almost two-thirds of all rapes occurred at night, 4 in 10 occurred at the victim's home and 2 in 10 at or near a friend's home. About 7 in 10 rapes were reported to the police when the offender had had a weapon but fewer than half were reported when the rapist was unarmed.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: THE OVERVIEW - U.S. AND ALLIES OPEN AIR WAR ON IRAQ; BOMB BAGHDAD AND KUWAITI TARGETS; 'NO CHOICE' BUT FORCE, BUSH DECLARES;
No Ground Fighting Yet; Call to Arms by Hussein

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Thursday, Jan. 17

 BODY:
The United States and allied forces Wednesday night opened the long-threatened war to drive President Saddam Hussein's army from Kuwait, striking Baghdad and other targets in Iraq and Kuwait with waves of bombers and cruise missiles launched from naval vessels.
"The liberation of Kuwait has begun," President Bush said in a three-sentence statement confirming the start of the attack that was read by his spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, shortly after the raids began. 
 Later, in a televised address to the nation from the Oval Office, a somber Mr. Bush said that after months of continuous diplomatic overtures had failed to produce movement by Iraq, the United States and its allies "have no choice but to force Saddam from Kuwait by force. We will not fail." [Transcript, page A6.]
 
No Planes Reported Missing
 United States officials said shortly after midnight Wednesday that none of the planes that took part in the nighttime raids were reported missing.
In Baghdad, Mr. Hussein said in a speech broadcast by the Iraqi radio that "the mother of all battles has begun," according to news service reports. He called Mr. Bush a "hypocritical criminal" and vowed to crush "the satanic intentions of the White House." It was unclear when Mr. Hussein had read his remarks, whether they had been pre-recorded, or where he was at the time. [Page A18.]
Mr. Bush said his goal "is not the conquest of Iraq, it is the liberation of Kuwait." But he also said, "We are determined to knock out Saddam Hussein's nuclear bomb potential. We will also destroy his chemical-weapons facilities."
 
3 Other Nations Take Part
 Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters at the Pentagon Wednesday night that those targets had been among those assigned to the first wave of American F-117 Stealth fighter-bombers, F-15 fighter-bombers, British Tornado attack planes and Saudi and Kuwaiti F-15's that raided Iraqi military targets about 3 A.M. local time Thursday (7 P.M. Wednesday Eastern standard time.)
Administration officials also said United States Navy ships in the waters off the Arabian Peninsula had fired ground-hugging cruise missiles at targets that had been programmed into their guidance systems for months. The officials said the ships fired a total of 50 Tomahawk missiles in an assault on Iraqi command and communications centers.
 
Seeking to Avoid Civilians
 Mr. Cheney said the initial targets were spread throughout Iraq and Kuwait and were chosen to "do everything possible to avoid injury to civilians." Both officials declined to say if there had been any American or allied losses, or to describe in any detail how badly they thought they had damaged Baghdad or the other Iraqi targets.
"The response of the Iraqi forces at this point has been limited," Mr. Cheney said, leading analysts to conclude that the allies may have succeeded in their goal of largely incapacitating Iraq's Air Force at the outset.
But Mr. Cheney said that the war was just beginning and that "it is likely to run for a long period of time."
 
Reports of New Attack
 Cable News Network reported that antiaircraft fire resumed in Baghdad about 9:30 A.M. Iraqi time and that its correspondents heard explosions that sounded like bombs in the far distance from their central Baghdad hotel.
The network also reported the first sighting of President Hussein since the start of the attacks, by a Western television technician at a Baghdad television center this afternoon.
Mr. Cheney said the United States could not confirm reports that Iraq had fired Soviet-made Scud missiles at allied positions after the attack began. Reuters reported from Bahrain that the civil defense authorities there had detected missile launches but that the weapons fell short of their targets.
Assuring Americans that ground forces were not yet engaged in the battle, the President added: "Five months ago, Saddam Hussein started this cruel war against Kuwait. Tonight, the battle has been joined."
He said initial reports indicated that "our operations are proceeding according to plan."
"Our objectives are clear," he said. "Saddam Hussein's forces will leave Kuwait, the legitimate Government of Kuwait will be restored to its righftul place and Kuwait will once again be free."
"Some may ask, why act now? Why not wait?" the President said. "The answer is clear. The world could wait no longer."
Repeating his promises that Saudi Arabia would not become "another Vietnam," Mr. Bush said he would bring American troops home as soon as possible.
"I'm hopeful that this fighting will not go on for long and that casualties will be held to an absolute minimum," he said. "Our troops will have the best possible support in the entire world, and they will not be asked to fight with one hand tied behind their back."
In the written statement issued earlier, Mr. Fitzwater said: "In conjunction with the forces of our coalition partners, the United States has moved under the code name Operation Desert Storm to enforce the mandates of the United Nations Security Council. As of 7 o'clock P.M., Operation Desert Storm forces were engaging targets in Iraq and Kuwait."
The current President of the United Nations Security Council, Bagbeni Adeito Nzengeya of Zaire, convened the Council late Wednesday night to discuss the outbreak of fighting.
Security Council Resolution 678, which authorized the use of force against Iraq after Jan. 15, also requires "the states concerned" to keep the Council regularly informed about any action they take under the resolution.
 
Skies Over Baghdad Alight
 The nighttime attack was first revealed in television reports by American correspondents in Baghdad that the skies over the Iraqi capital were alight with anti-aircraft and tracer fire. Initial reports were that multiple waves of warplanes bombed central Baghdad, hitting oil refineries and the airport.
Mr. Bush notified Congressional leaders of the planned attack between 6 and 7 P.M., telephoning House Speaker Thomas S. Foley and Robert C. Byrd, the President pro temp of the Senate. In a letter and a report, he also sent the formal notification, as required under the war resolution passed by the House and Senate last week, that all efforts at diplomacy had failed and that he had made his final decision to commit America to its first all-out war since Vietnam.
"The Government of Iraq remains completely intransigent in rejecting the U.N. Security Council's demands, despite the exhaustive use by the United States and the United Nations of all appropriate diplomatic, political and economic measures to persuade or compel Iraq to comply," the report said.
 
Foley Urges Unity
 Mr. Foley said: "We must now pray for a conflict that ends quickly, decisively and with a minimum loss of life. We must now stand united in support of our armed forces in the gulf who have embraced the duty and burden of conducting the war."
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican Leader, said, "The cause of this war is Iraqi aggression, not American determination."
In New York, the United Nations Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, said, "I think it is for me to express deep sorrow."
United States officials said that the decision to go to war had been developing over several days, and that Mr. Bush had been working on at least four drafts of his speech for two or three weeks.
But he put into motion the actual order for battle only at 8 A.M. Wednesday, when Saudi officials said Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d called in the Saudi Ambassador, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, and told him that American forces would attack Iraq.
 
Code Word to King Fahd
 The Ambassador telephoned King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, using a prearranged code word, the informants said. The King then repeated back a code word that constituted the final acknowledgement that the offensive would begin.
Mr. Bush monitored the offensive from the Oval Office, where he had watched the evening news and waited for the first signs of attack with Vice President Dan Quayle, Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, and John H. Sununu, the White House Chief of Staff. Mr. Scowcroft spent the night in the Situation Room in the White House basement, connected electronically to the Central Intelligence Agency, the State Department and the Pentagon, where Mr. Cheney and General Powell worked through the night as well.
Making good on his repeated warnings to Mr. Hussein, who had defied 12 United Nations resolutions and a naval blockade, Mr. Bush began the largest American military offensive since the Vietnam War about 19 hours after the expiration of the United Nations deadline for Iraq to leave Kuwait peacefully. The President said he decided to order the attack because "the world could wait no longer." He added, "Sanctions, though having some effect, showed no signs of accomplishing their objective."
He said he had hoped that the Congressional vote authorizing the use of force last weekend would prompt Mr. Hussein to agree to withdraw from Kuwait. "Instead he remained intransigent, certain that time was on his side," Mr. Bush said.
"No President can easily commit our sons and daughters to war," he said.
Mr. Fitzwater's statement about the start of war was prepared Tuesday night, the President's spokesman said, but Mr. Bush could have withheld the final order to attack "if there was a massive pullout by Saddam Hussein."
"It could have been changed," Mr. Fitzwater said.
Late Wednesday night, the White House said that Mr. Bush had authorized the Energy Secretary, James Watkins, to distribute 1.12 million barrels a day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for the next 30 days in a measure "designed to promote stability in world markets."
The United States had spent the day formalizing a command system under which international forces are expected to fight under United Nations auspices but under the actual leadership of the United States.
 
Bush Calls Other Leaders
 Mr. Bush called Prime Minister John Major of Britain and other leaders of the anti-Iraqi alliance Wednesday from his private study to inform them that the attack was about to begin.
The White House also sought to reassure the American people that all prospects for a peaceful solution had been exhausted, leaving Mr. Bush no choice but to begin what he has said will be an overwhelming display of air, sea and land power that will end Iraq's occupation of Kuwait swiftly and decisively.
"This military action, taken in accord with United Nations resolutions and with the consent of the United States Congress, follows months of constant and virtually endless diplomatic activity on the part of the United Nations, the United States and many, many other countries," Mr. Bush said.
Some of those who had opposed the Congressional resolution on the use of force issued statements rallying behind the President.
 
'Unite Behind Our Troops'
 Senator David L. Boren, Democrat of Oklahoma and chairman of Senate Intelligence Committee, said: "Now that the war has begun, all Americans should unite behind our troops. We hope and pray that victory will come quickly and with minimum loss of life."
The House majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt, said, "My prayers and thoughts are with the soldiers and their families, and my hopes are for a swift and successful conclusion to this war."
Although initial reports from Saudi Arabia and Iraq were very sketchy, the first wave of attacks appeared, as expected, to exploit the alliance's overwhelming air power, perhaps in an attempt to bomb strategic command targets in Baghdad.
Reports from members of the news pool stationed in Saudi Arabia with American forces said two squadrons of F-15E fighter-bombers loaded with bombs and air-to-air missiles took off at 12:50 A.M. local time today from the largest American military base, in central Saudi Arabia.
They made the 600-mile-plus flight to Baghdad in about 90 minutes, flying into the clear night sky in pairs. "We've been waiting here for five months now," said Col. Ray Davies, the base's chief maintenance officer. "Now we finally got to do what we were sent here to do."
A steady stream of F-15E's were taking off from central and eastern Saudi Arabia, part of an international air force that includes the deadliest, fastest and most technologically advanced warplanes in the world.
The United States alone has about 1,800 warplanes in the Persian Gulf region, based at military installations in Saudi Arabia and aboard six aircraft carriers plying the gulf, the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea.
The Pentagon said Wednesday that there were now 425,000 American soldiers stationed in the region after the swiftest and largest mobilization of arms in American military history. There are an additional 265,000 troops from 27 other countries, facing what the Pentagon estimates is an Iraqi Army of 545,000 in southern Iraq and Kuwait.
From Baghdad, television broadcasts said the pounding of the city continued intermittently through the night. The city had gone black, shaking from bomb reports as the night sky was pierced by tracers from batteries of anti-aircraft weapons massed around the city. At one point, reporters in Baghdad said volleys of anti-aircraft fire, and the glow of distant explosions lit the entire night sky.
A Cable News Network correspondent said he had seen a fire near a mosque, while another reported that a refinery near the presidential palace was being fired on. Loud explosions and machine-gun fire could be heard in the background as the reporters spoke by telephone with their oprganizations in the United States.
In Saudi Arabia, news reports said that air raid sirens had been turned on at air bases and that reporters had been ordered to go inside and advised to put on their gas masks, but there were no reports of enemy attacks.
Congress had given Mr. Bush authority to use force against Iraq on Saturday after a long and emotional debate. The President also acted with the authorization of the United Nations. It had given Iraq until Tuesday to leave Kuwait, which Baghdad occupied on Aug. 2 in a lightning raid that shattered what the United States and Europe had hoped would be a time of peace following the end of the cold war.
The American response had been orchestrated over the next five months, as Mr. Bush moved virtually the entire might of the nation's non-nuclear forces to the gulf while the United Nations sought to dislodge Iraq from Kuwait through a constantly tightening chokehold of economic sanctions.
The United States had expressed growing impatience with the sanctions, however, and the planning for war was stepped up sharply after Nov. 29, when the United Nations approved the resolution authorizing the use of force if Iraq did not withdraw by Jan 15.

HEADLINE: Dr. Leona Baumgartner, 88, Dies; Led New York Health Department

BYLINE: By GLENN FOWLER

 BODY:
Dr. Leona Baumgartner Langmuir, a public health official who was New York City's Commissioner of Health from 1954 to 1962 and later was an assistant administrator of the Agency for International Development, died on Tuesday in Chilmark, Mass. She was 88 years old and lived Chilmark.
She died of polycythemia, a blood ailment, said her husband, Dr. Alexander D. Langmuir. 
 Dr. Baumgartner, as she was known during her career, joined the Department of Health in 1937 and rose to become its first female commissioner. Characteristically, she shrugged off the distinction, as she did again in 1962 when President John F. Kennedy appointed her to head the Office of Technical Cooperation and Research at A.I.D., making her the highest-ranking woman in the United States Government at the time.
In 1966 Dr. Baumgartner was named visiting professor of social medicine at the Harvard Medical School, a post she held until she retired in 1972.
 
Family Planning Advocate
 In her career at the Health Department, Dr. Baumgartner was a strong proponent of improving public-health education and of modernizing government programs, particularly in family planning and in maternal and children's health.
In the national and international health arena, while serving with the Agency for International Development, she established a Research Advisory Council to improve standards of professional quality in grants for health and welfare programs around the globe. She was credited with persuading President Lyndon B. Johnson to reverse a policy that had prevented the agency from including birth control in its support of health programs in underdeveloped countries.
Dr. Baumgartner was born in Chicago and raised in Lawrence, Kan., where her father taught zoology at the University of Kansas. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees from the university and was a Rockefeller Research Fellow at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Munich before winning a Sterling Fellowship to study at Yale, where she took a Ph.D. in immunology and went on to receive an M.D. from the Yale Medical School.
After internship and residency at New York Hospital she spent a year with the United States Public Health Service before joining the New York City Health Department, where she started as an instructor and served as director of the Bureau of Child Hygiene on her way to the department's top position.
 
Safeguarding Public Health
 She left for 18 months in the late 1940's to become associate chief of the United States Children's Bureau, returning to the Health Department in 1950 as assistant commissioner. In 1953 she left again to become executive director of the nonprofit New York Foundation but returned a year later when Mayor Robert F. Wagner promised her a free hand as commissioner.
A woman of seemingly boundless energy, Dr. Baumgartner raced about the city on inspection tours and spoke out on sanitary failures of restaurant kitchens, day nurseries and anywhere else she felt the public health could be safeguarded. For several years she gave a health-education message to a nationwide television audience on a morning program hosted by Arlene Francis.
In contrast to most large cities, as many as 35 percent of the babies born in New York were seen in the city's well-baby and immunization clinics under her direction. Her management of emergency maternity and infant-care clinics for dependents of military personnel in World War II was recognized as innovative.
After the war she undertook a thorough revision of the city's sanitary code and expanded a public health laboratory that had already won acclaim in the field. In 1958 she established a Public Health Research Institute in New York with an annual budget of more than $7 million from municipal money to perform basic and applied research on a wide range of health problems.
Dr. Baumgartner was an early advocate of the Salk vaccine to immunize the public against polio, and one of her last achievements as health commissioner was to win a political battle to fluoridate the city's water supply to prevent tooth decay.
Among the honors Dr. Baumgartner received were the Sedgwick Medal and the Lasker Award of the American Public Health Association and the Public Welfare Award of the National Academy of Sciences.
Dr. Baumgartner's first husband, Nathaniel M. Elias, a chemical engineeer, died in 1964. In 1970 she married Dr. Langmuir, an epidemiologist, who survives.

HEADLINE: In Midst of Big Bailout, Banker Stays Positive

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Slumped in a chair, after having just met with Federal regulators, Lawrence K. Fish, chairman of the failed Bank of New England, looked tired, but ebullient. A "Smile It's a SNAPP" button dangled from his shirt pocket, referring to a new checking account the bank was promoting. His bank is on its way to becoming the object of one of the costliest bailouts in history, but the 46-year-old Mr. Fish was irrepressible.
He has been on the job only 10 months, brought in to try to rescue a bank sinking under the weight of bad loans. The attempt failed, but not Mr. Fish's enthusiasm. despite his inability to accomplish what many felt could not be done. 
 "Why did I take this job?" he said in response to a question. "My God, I'd take it again. You spend a lifetime, getting ready to run your race -- and this is my race."
 
Cost Could Reach $2.3 Billion
 It is a race that has put him at the center of banking's most visible trouble spot -- a bailout that could cost as much as $2.3 billion. Federal regulators have, in effect, endorsed Mr. Fish and his hand-picked management team by taking the unusual step of leaving them in place after having taken control of the bank.
As the regulators prepare to sell the bank and prospective buyers comb its wreckage, Mr. Fish is left to try to rally morale and protect the value of the $22 billion institution, which has loyal deposits, billions in still-valuable loans and buildings and properties. He walks around the floors these days, reassuring employees. In the week after the Federal takeover, he appeared before 8,000 of the bank's 12,000 employees. (Another 5,700 have been let go in recent months.)
Top managers are pressed into calling a dozen big clients daily, and rank-and-file loan officers are sent calling on their best customers. Mr. Fish is drafting a "Dear Colleague" letter telling employees how Government ownership will affect their benefits. And he loves to tell heart-warming stories like the one about the elderly woman who brought cookies to a Hartford branch manager to make him feel better. His task is to keep track of the thousands of little things necessary to keep the bank alive until a buyer is found.
 
Talk of 'Sadness'
 "This is not a happy time," Mr. Fish allowed, as he sat in a conference room at the State Street headquarters. "Disappointment isn't a word that comes to mind right now. More like sadness. Sadness that this fine institution has come apart after 200 years, sadness for the employees who went through so much. There's a feeling of loss.
"But, I've drawn an incredible amount of strength from the employees. We feel proud of all we got done together, and yes, I've drawn strength and joy from that. There's a lot of positive energy here. There's sadness but also energy."
For Mr. Fish, the months at the Bank of New England are yet another twist in a career he says has come in chunks. Mr. Fish came to the East from his native Midwest to go to Harvard Business School. From there, he went to South Africa, where he worked in a cement factory; to India, where he spent a year living in an ashram, studying transcendental meditation, Zen Buddhism and yoga, and to Brazil with the Agency for International Development.
In Rio de Janeiro, he joined the Bank of Boston and was later transferred to Hong Kong and Tokyo, where he met his wife, Atsuko Toko. The couple's three children are being raised Buddhist and Jewish, and the family maintains strong cross-cultural links, including efforts that resulted in the Japanese Government's donating more than 1,000 cherry trees planted along the Charles River here.
 
Move to California
 He rose steadily through the Bank of Boston until, at age 43, he was within striking distance of the presidency only to find his way blocked by the presence of two relatively young executives ahead of him. In 1988, he surprised conservative Boston by becoming chief operating officer at the teetering Columbia Savings and Loan Association in Beverly Hills, Calif., which was a leading buyer of high-yield "junk bonds."
After 18 months, Mr. Fish left Columbia, his reputation among bankers damaged by the association, but $2 million richer for the effort. (He donated $1 million of that to his alma mater, Drake University in Iowa.) Of that episode, Mr. Fish says: "I was told they wanted to turn Columbia into a serious bank. That didn't prove to be the case."
He took a year off, traveled in the Khyber Pass region in Afghanistan, and when an executive recruiter approached him about the Bank of New England, he was interested. "It was his ticket back to respectability," said a banker close to Mr. Fish.
Last February, his salary now cut to $675,000 a year, Mr. Fish took over a bank that had been bloated to $33 billion in assets through overpriced acquisitions and a binge of lending to questionable real estate projects. Its nonperforming loans were more than $2 billion and climbing, and its losses for 1989 totaled more than $1 billion. Federal regulators were closely watching the bank, which was everyone's favorite candidate for collapse.
 
A Six-Point Rescue Plan
 Terming this the "challenge of a lifetime," Mr. Fish, accompanied by advisers from New York's top law firms, from Goldman, Sachs & Company and from McKinsey & Company, set out on a six-point plan. The goals were to cut costs, improve liquidity, recruit new executives, retain customers, improve internal credit operations and raise capital. By the time the bank was seized, progress had been made on every front, except the most important -- raising capital.
"At the end of the day, the piece that didn't get done was that we didn't raise enough capital fast enough to keep up with the deterioration of our real estate portfolio and the New England economy," Mr. Fish said.
Edward D. Herlihy, a partner at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, attorneys for the bank's board, said Mr. Fish "clearly reinvogorated the organization."
"He put together a first-rate management team," Mr. Herlihy said, "and had the genuine ability, even in the worst of times, to project optimism and a sense that we would be around to fight another day."
During the second and third quarters of 1990, the Goldman, Sachs bankers were working hard to raise capital, only to find little interest. "The general cloud over the New England economy created high enough uncertainty so no one was prepared to take a risk," Mr. Fish said.
 
Negotiating a Swap
 Negotiations began with bondholders -- too slowly in the eyes of some -- in an effort to get them to trade their debt for equity. The bank tried to retain depositors through intense marketing and offering mouth-watering interest rates, and it managed to bring in $1 billion. It even switched from being a heavy borrower in the Federal Reserve system to being a lender. It had a harder time, however, attracting new commercial loans because of the reluctance of New England companies to deal with a bank whose future was uncertain.
In the end, real estate loans caused the bank to fail. A very high 36.7 percent of loans were in risky real estate ventures (that has since declined to 28 percent).
Through most of last year, the bank was barely able to hold its own -- the amount of troubled loans it could restructure and repair was about equal to the amount of loans beginning to go bad. After late November, however, when New England was reeling from a credit crunch as lenders withheld cash, the bank could no longer maintain that balancing act. Developers could not get money to pay off the bank by borrowing from other lenders. More real estate projects failed. More developers were throwing down the keys and walking. The bad loans came in waves, faster than the bank could absorb them.
An outside adviser, who insisted on not being identified, said: "Everybody felt going into the fourth quarter that the bank had a chance of pulling it off without Government assistance. But as the fourth quarter wore on, the loan situation turned dismal."
 
The Final Days
 As the end of the year approached and the bondholders were putting the finishing touches on an $800 million debt-for-equity swap, the losses continued to mount. At a management meeting in late December, Mr. Fish sensed for the first time that morale was so low and the bank's condition so bad that Federal assistance was mandatory. On Jan. 2, he told the board about the dismal state of the bank, and received permission to ask the regulators to come in.
After that, events unfolded with lightning speed. On Jan. 3, Mr. Fish met with regulators to get help. The next day, a Friday, the bank announced a $450 million fourth-quarter loss -- making it insolvent. The announcement made headlines, and about $800 million of deposits fled that Friday and Saturday. Mr. Fish and his staff huddled in their offices and watched the money flee.
"It was frightening," Mr. Fish said. "There were concerns about the stability of the whole financial system in this part of the country."
On Sunday, Jan. 6, at 5:50 P.M., L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, called Mr. Fish to say that Federal regulators were taking over.
Since then, regulators have sought a buyer for the bank, which now, with Government assistance, has a recapitalized balance sheet, a strong retail franchise and a portfolio purged of bad loans, many of which will be assumed by the Government.
Mr. Fish and his staff remain to manage the bank until it is sold. After that? He is not sure. He says he might not even mind tackling another troubled bank.

President Quits Post At Browning-Ferris

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
John E. Drury, the president and chief operating officer of Browning-Ferris Industries, the nation's second-largest waste-management company, resigned yesterday. His duties are to be assumed by the company's chairman and chief executive, William D. Ruckelshaus, a former director of the Environmental Protection Agency.
The company's statement said only that Mr. Drury, 46 years old, had resigned "based upon a mutual agreement" with Mr. Ruckelshaus. Analysts of the waste-management industry tied the resignation to the company's recent poor financial performance, which included a $44.7 million loss in the fiscal 1990 year. 
 "They had a disappointing year in 1990, so given that Mr. Drury was the chief operating officer and given the operating results, I don't find it particularly surprising," said Leone Young, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company.
The company, based in Houston, declined to comment beyond its news release and said neither Mr. Ruckelshaus nor Mr. Drury was available for comment.
Mr. Ruckelshaus, 58, once known as Mr. Clean for his efforts on behalf of the environment, joined Browning-Ferris in 1988. The move was seen as a coup for the waste industry because its major companies, including Browning-Ferris and Waste Management Inc., based in Oak Brook, Ill., had had freguent clashes with regulators and environmentalists over waste disposal practices.
Browning-Ferris had two decades of steady growth and healthy profits, but it shocked Wall Street last year when earnings for its fourth fiscal quarter, ended Sept. 30, fell 55 percent, to $32.7 million. The company forecast that this year's results might be below expectations, hurt by the weakened economy and higher landfill operating costs.
On Nov. 6, the day of the earnings announcement, the company's shares tumbled $6, to $24. On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, they ended at $20.75, down 62.5 cents.
Why all the weight of the company's problems appeared to fall on Mr. Drury and not Mr. Ruckelshaus was not clear. "Mr. Drury, as the operating person and who has been with Browning-Ferris longer, must have taken more of the heat," Ms. Young said. Mr. Ruckelshaus "is going to run it his way now," she added.
Mr. Drury, who had been with Browning-Ferris since 1970 and served in various regional and corporate positions, was named president in 1982. His father ran a company acquired by Browning-Ferris, which said yesterday that Mr. Drury would serve as a consultant with emphasis on operations in Europe.
The resignation "highlights a period of change," said Marc H. Sulam, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody. "As the industry is changing, the challenge presented to Mr. Ruckelshaus is to try to position the company so that he can manage the change. Browning has been reacting to change, rather than anticipating it."

HEADLINE: At the Bar;
Bashing the bar, a treasured and still thriving tradition that dates from the Bard.

BYLINE: By David Margolick

 BODY:
"The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers."
-- "The Second Part of King Henry the Sixth," Act 4, Scene 2.
 In the pantheon of Shakespearean creations, Dick the Butcher is no Othello. But to anyone who follows law or lawyers, his modest proposal has become an overly familiar friend. It is a staple of law school commencements, momentarily introspective speeches at bar meetings, and legal reporters looking for an erudite and handy way of writing that lawyer-bashing is nothing new. 
 In their rebuttals, lawyers and lawyerphiles note by rote that Dick is the lowliest of knaves, a follower of the nefarious insurrectionist Jack Cade, who heartily seconds Dick's suggestion in his less familiar response: "Is not this a lamentable thing, that of the skin of an innocent lamb should be made parchment? that parchment, being scribbled o'er, should undo a man? Some say the bee stings; but I say, 'tis the bee's wax, for I did but seal once to a thing, and I was never mine own man since."
But despite these caveats, the Butcher's flock flourishes. His sentiment can now be found in a variety of mediums, including coffee mugs, T-shirts, pillows and soon, perhaps, at the Cannes Film Festival.
Souvenir plates inscribed "Let's Kill All the Lawyers" combine the two passions of Robert van Kluyve of Madison, Va.: English literature and pottery. For more than 20 years, Mr. van Kluyve has been making them, along with companion plates for other professions (e.g. "God heals, and the doctor takes the fee"; "If all the economists were laid end to end, they would not reach a conclusion").
For a while, Mr. van Kluyve sold his plates through the Folger Shakespeare Library. More recently, he placed advertisements in The New Yorker and The National Law Journal. These produced orders for some 300 plates, placed largely, the artist said, by the mothers and spouses of either lawyers or those who hate lawyers but have to use them.
Whether out of humorlessness or hypersensitivity or whatever, lawyers seem disinclined to buy the plates for themselves; the notice in the Law Journal netted a grand total of one order. So Mr. van Kluyve also offers plates with another, more lawyer-friendly message, from "The Taming of the Shrew": "Do as adversaries do in law, strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends."
Still, one lawyer, Finn M. W. Caspersen of Wilmington, Del., ordered "Kill all the lawyers" plates as Christmas presents for six friends, including Supreme Court Justice David H. Souter and Robert Clark, Dean of the Harvard Law School. Justice Souter would not say whether he had received the plate or if it now hangs in his chambers. Dean Clark acknowledged its arrival but said he would most certainly not display it in his office, even though Mr. Caspersen is a Harvard Law School graduate and fund raiser.
"I disagree with the sentiment, quite vehemently," he said. "I'm not quite sure what the message was behind it, but I'll talk to him and straighten him out."
This year, Lighten Up Films Inc. of Farmington Hills, Mich., will release "Let's Kill All the Lawyers," a chronicle of a young man's preprofessional angst. In it, the hero rejects a legal career to become a gardener at a retreat for burned-out lawyers.
The story is loosely based on the experiences of Ron Senkowski, the film's director and writer. Mr. Senkowski landed in the 99th percentile when he took the Law School Admissions Test, but his legal career ended prematurely when he devoted the essay portion of the examination to a diatribe on lawyers. It included a quotation from H. L. Mencken worthy, perhaps, of one of Mr. van Kluyve's plates: "If all of the lawyers were hanged tomorrow, and their bones sold to a mah-jongg factory, we'd be freer and safer, and our taxes would be reduced by almost half."
Shannon Hamed, the film's producer, hopes "Let's Kill All the Lawyers" is a sleeper, in the manner of "She's Gotta Have It," and thinks the catchy title might help. "It's our greatest asset," she said.
Though Pamela Du Val embroiders more than 1,000 adages on her pillows, "Let's kill all the lawyers" cushions are perhaps the most popular item in her Manhattan boutique on Lexington Avenue, between 63th and 64th Streets. She began making them three years ago and since then, she said, they've sold "like wildfire." As disaffection with the bar has grown, sales of "Let's kill" cushions have outstripped those of the previous best seller: "Old lawyers never die, they just lose their appeals."
"People know that lawyers are brilliant and all that, but too expensive," she said in a telephone interview. But when pressed to explain, she suddenly grew suspicious.
"Why are you asking me all these questions?" she asked. "Are you trying to sue me?"

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
A Second Chance For Greenspan

BYLINE: By David E. Rosenbaum

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WAR in the Persian Gulf could give Alan Greenspan a chance to redeem his reputation. During his first three and a half years as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Mr. Greenspan was generally viewed by politicians here and by economists on Wall Street and in the universities as a masterful captain who was sailing the economy on a steady voyage, fighting the tailwinds of inflation while avoiding the shoals of recession.
But then the economy strayed off course, and many blamed Mr. Greenspan for miscalculations. What used to be gentle hints from the Bush Administration that interest rates could be lower have turned into an almost daily tongue-lashing. The Congressional committees that once heard the Fed chairman in an atmosphere that bordered on reverence are prepared to challenge him now. 
 "I think it's fair to say that our committee is going to question Dr. Greenspan more vigorously than usual," said Senator Jim Sasser, the Tennessee Democrat who heads the Budget Committee, where Mr. Greenspan will probably testify this month.
Among economists, the prevailing though by no means unanimous assessment is that the Fed waited too long before beginning in earnest to drive down interest rates last fall. "I think they fell behind the momentum of the downturn in the economy, and that means they are now playing catch-up," said Benjamin M. Friedman, a prominent economics professor at Harvard.
But war changes the equation, and if Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues can manipulate the economy in a way seen as minimizing the damage, itwould probably assure the chairman's reappointment when his term expires in August.
At the Federal Reserve, where Mr. Greenspan is well liked for having established a collegiality that was missing for most of the eight-year reign of his predecessor, Paul A. Volcker, the view of many governors and staff members is that the economy was jolted by circumstances beyond Mr. Greenspan's control -- the credit crunch in the banks and, most important, Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. The chances are at least 50-50, Fed officials say, that if it had not been for the higher oil prices and general wariness caused by the situation in the gulf in the summer and fall, the economy would not have slipped into recession at all.
Mr. Greenspan's allies have begun passing the word that he favored a more aggressive approach to driving down interest rates but was constrained by the opposition of several presidents of the regional Federal Reserve banks who sit on and vote in the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making group.
The chairman does not give on-the-record interviews, but people who have met with him privatelysay he has been talking for a few months about "majority rule" on the policy-making committee, a reference he did not usually make when times were good.
It is impossible to say confidently whether Mr. Greenspan really was thwarted in his desire to lower rates earlier in the year or whether this is an after-the-fact excuse. The Open Market Committee meetings, where such decisions are made, are not open to the public, and the members scrupulously avoid discussing exactly what was said.
Summaries of the proceedings, published about six weeks after each meeting, give no indication that Mr. Greenspan wanted to act more aggressively last year than most of his colleagues. But the summaries are so sketchy that they probably would not reflect such a disagreement if one did exist. And Fed chairmen are always reluctant to vote in the minority, regardless of their thinking.
In the last half of 1989, the Fed did gradually lower the Federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans, to 8.25 percent from almost 10 percent. Fed officials are quick to point out that this is the first time since World War II that the economy entered a recession at a time when interest rates were falling. But during the first two quarters of last year, when the economy grew at the anemic annual rates of 1.7 percent and four-tenths of 1 percent, respectively, the rate went unchanged.
In hindsight, it can now be seen that expectations of inflation were falling in the first six months of 1990, that the money supply was growing little if at all and that banks were establishing restrictive lending policies. The effect of the steady rates was thus an actual tightening of credit rather than the looser policy that was probably needed to prevent recession.
But all that will be forgotten if Mr. Greenspan makes the right decisions in the weeks ahead about how long the war is likely to last, what will happen to oil prices and what the right level of interest rates is to encourage economic recovery.

HEADLINE: U.S. Clears Japanese Stake In Atomic-Arms Toolmaker

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
The White House has approved a Japanese company's purchase of 40 percent of the only American company that makes precision machine tools that satisfy the requirements of the Defense and Energy Departments for making atomic weaponry.
The deal between the Fanuc Company of Japan, which makes robots and machine tools -- machines that make other machines -- and Moore Special Tool Inc. of Bridgeport, Conn., was hotly debated within the Bush Administration. 
 The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a Government review panel, recommended late last month that the White House approve the deal, and that recommendation has been accepted, people involved in the process say. A White House announcement is expected soon, perhaps as early as next week.
Approval is likely to provoke reaction in Congress, where many lawmakers think the Government should be taking stronger action to keep national security technology in American hands.
"Failure to stop this sale sends a clear signal that everything, no matter how vital to our interests, is for sale in the U.S.," said Representative Mel Levine, Democrat of California, chairman of the House High Technology Caucus.
The review panel has examined 517 foreign investments in the last three years, only one of which was blocked -- a Chinese company's effort to acquire Mamco Manufacturing Inc., a Seattle company that makes aircraft components.
Foreign investments are reviewed under a law that permitted the President to block foreign purchases deemed a threat to national security. The 1988 Exon-Florio law has lapsed, but it is expected to be revived by the 102d Congress, and the Administration has proceeded as if the legislation were in effect.
The purchase of 40 percent of Moore, a private company employing 400 people in a plant near the Bridgeport airport, has been the subject of a debate within the Administration since the middle of last year, when the agreement with Fanuc was reached.
The Defense, Energy and Commerce Departments initially objected to the deal, fearing that vital security used to build nuclear weapons would pass to the Japanese. The State and Treasury Departments supported the deal, saying that if Moore did not find a strong financial partner it would close and the Government would lose the technology entirely.
Moore has been in the red for two years, and in recent years one of its prime sources of credit was the Bank of New England, which the Federal Government seized last week, saying it was insolvent.
To satisfy the critics' concern about Japanese access to weapons technology, Moore and Fanuc agreed to strict rules about what information would be shared. Fanuc officials, who will have two seats on Moore's five-member board, described their investment as passive and said they were interested only in the technology used for making machines tools used for nonmilitary products.
Moore's main products are computer-operated jig borers that gouge tiny, highly accurate holes in metal, and other precision machining equipment.
In addition to their use in making atomic weapons at Energy Department plants in Oak Ridge, Tenn., and Rocky Flats, Colo., the company's products are widely used in the manufacture of watches, cameras and other products.
More than 60 percent of Moore's output is exported, but because of their strategic value, the Moore tools often required Government export licenses that were not easy to obtain. The blocking or delay of major overseas sales is said to be one reason for the company's financial troubles.
The Fanuc deal was originally drawn so that within five years either the Japanese company or the Moore family, which controls the American company, could buy the other out.
This raised some Government objections that Fanuc could end up in undisputed control, so the agreement was modified, leaving the Moore family with the right to buy out Fanuc but no reciprocal right for the Japanese.
Under the revised agreement, should Moore continue to lose money over the next two years, Fanuc would take effective control of the company by naming a third director. Fanuc says one of its two initial directors will be American, and that if it is entitled to name a third director that person would also be an American.
Fanuc's control of the board would continue until Moore turned a profit, when the third board seat would be given up, under the agreement.
 
Decision Called Unfortunate
 Kevin L. Kearns, a former Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff member now with the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington research group, called the decision unfortunate and said it underscored that the United States "does not have any strategy for dealing with the surge of investment."
One Government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the review panel had been persuaded that no similar technology could be purchased abroad. The decision, he said, came to a choice of "either save the company or lose the technology."
The company was founded by Richard F. Moore, who died two years ago. His son, Wayne R. Moore, a champion swimmer at Yale in the 1950's and a former Olympic gold medalist, is now president. He could not be reached for comment.

HEADLINE: Construction of Homes Plunges to 8-Year Low

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Construction of homes and apartments plunged last month and for all of 1990, to levels not seen since the recession eight years ago, the Commerce Department reported today.
Most industry analysts predicted housing construction would continue to decline in this year's first quarter, but said a quick, decisive victory in the war against Iraq might soften the slide by encouraging buyers and lowering interest rates. 
 "Where we go now clearly depends upon the outcome of the war," said David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders. "Our hope is that a clear outcome soon could produce a major turnaround in consumer confidence."
 
The Lowest Since 1982
 Construction dropped 12.4 percent in December, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 987,000 units. It was the lowest level since June 1982, deep in the last recession, when the annual rate was 902,000.
For all of 1990, housing starts approached the lows of the 1982 recession. Starts in 1990 fell to 1.19 million, compared with 1.06 million units in 1982, department officials said.
For the year, construction of homes rose in only two months -- January and November -- and fell in 10 months as the building industry led the economy into recession.
"Clearly the fall in starts has not bottomed out," said Martin Regalia, senior economist with the National Council of Savings Institutions. "They're continuing to erode, but they're not falling out of bed."
 
Possibility of Lower Rates
 Tom Holloway, an economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association, said that if Iraq was unable to damage Saudi Arabian oilfields, there was a possibility that interest rates could come down significantly.
"The initial reaction is an improved outlook for inflation and removal of the uncertainty that plagued the market," Mr. Holloway said, adding that long-term interest rates could fall to the 9.5 percent range.
Regionally, the biggest drop in December construction was in the Northeast, a decline of 21.1 percent. Housing starts fell by 15.1 percent in the South, by 12.6 percent in the West and by 1.3 percent in the Midwest.
December's decline followed a revised 9.8 percent increase in building in November. It was initially reported that construction was up 9.3 percent in November because of an unexpected surge in apartment building.
Building of single-family homes fell 1.7 percent in December, the lowest since October 1982, while apartment building dropped 35.4 percent from November levels.
 
Down From November
 The December annualized rate of 987,000 units compared with a rate of 1.127 million units in November.
Total starts last month were 22.5 percent lower than in December 1989, when they were at a rate of 1.273 million units.
Building permits, an indicator of future plans, fell 6.6 percent in December, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 846,000, the department said. They fell 1.5 percent in November.
Permits for single-family homes fell 3.9 percent, to 645,000 units, in December, while permits for apartments were down 14.5 percent, to 201,000 units.
It was the lowest rate for permits since February 1982, when they fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 808,000, officials said.

Texas Instruments Cuts 725 Workers

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: DALLAS. Jan. 17

 BODY:
Citing the persistent weakness in the military supply business, Texas Instruments Inc. said it had laid off 725 employees. The cuts, which took place on Wednesday, ranged from production workers to managers, said Terri West, a company spokeswoman.
Texas Instruments said 540 layoffs came in its defense systems and electronics group, with 125 in its information technology group and another 60 in its semiconductor group. "The reductions were made in response to continued weakness in the U.S. economy and constraints on national defense spending," Ms. West said. Texas Instruments' worldwide work force totals more than 70,000, with 47,000 of those in this country. Texas Instruments' stock dropped 25 cents a share today, to $40.25, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Panel Proposes Paying Towns To Take Waste

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Acknowledging that New York State probably could not force a community to accept a low-level nuclear waste dump against its will, the state commission charged with finding a dump today proposed a different approach: offering money.
The Low-Level Radioactive Waste Siting Commission, whose members have been run off of research sites and burned in effigy in the upstate counties where they have identified potential dumps, called on Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the Legislature to adopt a "benefits package" of road construction funds and other local assistance for any community that decides to take the waste site. 
 While other states have adopted variations of a benefit package to soften resistance to similar waste sites, the resolution here appears to represent a clear shift in New York's approach to the problem. It was also blunt acknowledgment that incentives were needed to get such sites built, even though state officials insist they will be safe.
Previously, the state had said that it would conduct its search on purely scientific grounds, and would choose the best site from a technical standpoint, even if the surrounding communities were hostile. But the commission, in a one-page resolution released here, said it had concluded that "imposing such a site on an unwilling community has little or no possiblility of success."
All the states are acting under Federal mandate to find a home by 1993 for the low-level waste they generate, which is now shipped to storage sites in South Carolina, Nevada and Washington State.
 
'A Horrible Idea'
 The commission's proposal produced no immediate takers today, and residents in some of the communities in Allegany and Cortland Counties that made the oriinal list of finalists reacted bitterly.
"No way," said John L. Smith, a member of the town board in Taylor, a Cortland County community near three of the potential waste sites. "It could be a million dollars and we'd say no. What's a million dollars worth compared to your health?" He said he and other town residents feared the dump would leak, despite state assurances that it would not.
Sally Campbell, a member of the Allegany County Non-violent Action Group, who was arrested last year while trying to block commission members taking geologic samples from a proposed site, described the commission proposal as "a horrible idea." The commission, she added, was "trying to take advantage of the economic problems that a lot of rural governments are facing. They're trying to find a sucker."
Still, with the size of the proposed benefits package still undetermined, it remains unclear whether some community in the state might ultimately find it large enough to consider accepting the dump.
 
No Specifics
 The commission did not outline specifics for the package, saying that should be worked out by state agencies, the Legislature and the Governor, who are already grappling with falling revenues and large budget gaps.
Anne W. Crowley, Governor Cuomo's spokeswoman, said that Mr. Cuomo had always been "supportive" of providing assistance to any community that might suffer adverse financial consequences -- for example, declining home values -- if it accepted the dump. But she said Mr. Cuomo had not seen today's resolution and could not comment on it.
Maurice D. Hinchey, the Ulster County Democrat who is chairman of the State Assembly's Environmental Conservation Committee, said he would look on a benefits package not so much as an inducement to a community, but as a recognition that "there has to be some element of fairness for whoever takes it."
Any adoption of a benefits package would not change existing laws establishing technological criteria for the site, such as the type of rock composition or permeability of the soil, said Barbara S. Congemi, a spokeswoman for the siting commission.
But, she said, if a community that could meet such criteria now came forward and volunteered to take the dump, "we would seriously want to take a look at that."
Low-level waste, some of which is considered a serious threat to public health if not safely stored, is generated in nuclear plants and in many industrial and medical procedures. It includes contaminated clothes, tools, machine parts and resins. New York produces 80,000 cubic feet of waste a year, enough to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool.

Precious Metals Prices Fall; Gold Loss Biggest Since '83

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Belief that the war with Iraq would be short and successful sent precious metals prices plunging yesterday, with gold registering its biggest one-day loss since early 1983.
While silver and platinum prices spiraled downward with gold, their losses were limited by the thinking that a quick end to the Persian Gulf war would revive the economy and thus create demand for what are basically industrial metals. But yesterday's optimism could be tempered in today's trading, following reports of explosions in Tel Aviv, signaling that the scope of the war may change. 
 At the close of the Commodity Exchange in New York, the spot January gold delivery, in which only two contracts traded, settled at $373.40 an ounce, down $29.80 on the day. But the more active February contract tumbled $30.10, to $374.40.
In either case, the drop in the price of bullion was the biggest since Feb. 28, 1983, when gold plunged $42.50 an ounce, to $400.50. On that Monday, falling oil prices combined with President Ronald Reagan's strong anti-inflation measures to send gold prices plummeting.
Except for an occasionally brief upward move, gold has been trading around $400 since 1983, after hitting a record high of $850 on Jan. 21, 1980, when silver peaked at $50.35 an ounce. Platinum's record price of just over $1,000 an ounce was reached a month later.
"What we had today in the gold market was an almost unanimous belief that the war with Iraq would be over quickly and end victoriously, and this caused selling from all quarters," said Bette Raptopoulos, metals specialist at Prudential-Bache Securities. "Producers sold to get quick profits after the outbreak of the war caused an initial jump in prices in the Far East. There was also selling by commodity funds and from the Mideast, where the initial success of the attacks against Iraq have calmed nerves."
 
Commodity Funds Buying
 Scott W. Mondry and Steven J. Pepper, senior vice presidents at the Republic National Bank of New York, leading dealers in bullion, noted that the commodity funds had been accumulating gold since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, and were also buyers of silver and platinum because of what they perceived were cheap prices and limited downside risk.
The two bullion dealers noted that while silver and platinum were pulled down with gold, their declines were limited by the belief that a quick end to the gulf war would stimulate the economy and create much greater demand for what are basically industrial metls.
On the Comex, the spot Janaury silver delivery lost 18.9 cents an ounce, at $4.005, while the far more active March contract fell 19.5 cents, to $4.013. At the New York Mercantile Exchange, spot January platinum closed down $10.60 an ounce, at $407.20, with the active April delivery also off $10.60, at $411.20.

HEADLINE: SOVIET CRACKDOWN: Washington;
BALTIC CRACKDOWN ANGERS CONGRESS

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Voicing anger at repressive measures taken by the Soviet authorities against pro-independence forces in the Baltic republics, members of Congress called on the Bush Administration today to impose sanctions on Moscow and take other retaliatory steps.
The legislators, speaking at a session of the United States Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, pointed repeatedly to what they perceived as a link between the moves of Soviet military units in Lithuania and Latvia at the very time the United States had mounted air strikes against Iraq. 
 Senator Dennis DeConcini, Democrat of Arizona, said he believed that the Soviet authorities were using the gulf fighting as a pretext for "continuing to heighten" their pressure on the democratically elected governments in the Baltic republics.
Senator Malcolm Wallop, Republican of Wyoming, asserted that Moscow was also "flouting the embargo" by continuing to send military supplies to Iraq. "Gorbachev has shown he is no longer to be trusted," he said. Representative Don Ritter, Republican of Pennsylvania, proposed "a strategy to hold Mr. Gorbachev's feet to the fire," with a goal of stripping him of his Nobel Peace Prize.
 
Delay in Summit Meeting
 The legislators' recommendations included postponing a Bush-Gorbachev summit meeting scheduled for next month and taking up diplomatic relations with the three Baltic governments. The United States refused to acknowledge the Soviet Union's annexation of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in 1940 and continues to maintain ties with the vestigial diplomatic missions of those countries in Washington. But it has not accorded full recognition to the newly elected governments of the Baltic republics.
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, declared: "Only by granting diplomatic recognition to the embattled Baltic republics can we send the message that must be sent."
Both Democratic and Republican legislators said they felt the Administration was treading too lightly on the Baltics issue. "I think the Administration and the State Department will have to do better," said Representative Frank R. Wolf, Republican of Virginia. Representative Bill Richardson, Democrat of New Mexico, said, "I would have wished a stronger response from the State Department."
 
Measures 'Under Review'
 Addressing the Congressional members of the panel, which also includes representatives from the executive branch, Assistant Secretary of State Raymond G. H. Seitz said the Administration had a number of punitive measures "more or less under review."
Mr. Seitz, who is responsible for European and Canadian affairs at the department, said the Administration was considering a proposal to elevate the Baltic states to the status of observers at sessions of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. That conference is the permanent forum that grew out of the 35-government Helsinki agreement of 1975.
Asked whether the United States might send a special high-level delegation to the Baltics to show solidarity with the independence movements, Mr. Seitz said that, too, was under consideration.
Representative Steny H. Hoyer, the Maryland Democrat who as co-chairman convened today's session of the commission on one day's notice, said such a delegation to the Baltics should be headed by former Presidents Carter and Reagan.
In a statement, Mr. Seitz said that the Administration, viewing the military actions in the Baltics 'with abhorrence," had repeatedly sent protests to Moscow. "We ask the Soviet authorities to undo what has been done," he said.
He also noted that Dainis Ivans, deputy prime minister of Latvia, and Bronius Kuzmickas, one of the vice presidents of Lithuania, were arriving in Washington this evening and would "be received here at a high level." Several of the commission members urged that President Bush receive the Baltic leaders as a means of sending the proper signal to Moscow.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Security Prices Stage Rally

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The stunning successes scored by the United States and allied aircraft on the first day of the attack on Iraqt generated a powerful rally in the credit markets yesterday, as prices of some Treasury securities rose by as much as 2 3/8 points and interest rates fell sharply.
The markets' reaction, and huge rise in prices, took place before Iraq lobbed a number of missles into Israel. 
 As participants had predicted, the onset of hostilities led to a sharp sell-off during overnight trading in Tokyo.
The decline was quickly reversed, however, when initial reports showed that the air battle was going entirely as American military leaders had planned.
"The pure gut reaction initially was to sell," said John P. Costas, director of the taxable fixed-income department at the First Boston Corporation. "But as it became evident how successful the event was, it began to look like this obstacle was being overcome in a much easier fashion than anyone had anticipated."
 
Bonds Post Biggest Gains
 Bond prices posted the biggest gains, as traders, analysts and at least some investors determined that the increased likelihood of a speedy resolution to the war would allow the Fed as well as market participants to refocus their attention on the weak economy.
In addition, yesterday's enormous $10.56 drop in oil prices suggested that inflation, which has been moderating lately, would fall further.
"Right now it looks like it will be a quick war, and that is a positive for the economy," said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers. "But a major reason that is so is that a quick end to the fighting will allow interest rates to come down a lot. When we get the war behind us, it will free up the Federal Reserve to do whatever they need to alleviate the credit crunch."
Other analysts took issue with that view, and said the Fed might well choose to delay any further reduction in short-term rates.
"The Fed will have to determine whether the reduction of tensions in the Middle East and the drop in oil prices will cause a rebound in consumer spending, and whether that will lead to a rebound in the economy," said Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist at Fuji Securities in Chicago.
"Barring any banking crisis, the Fed will probably keep monetary policy steady for awhile."
After rising to a high of 8.48 percent during trading in Tokyo, bond yields plummeted as results of the first day's fighting became known.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 106 7/32, up 2 3/8 points, or $23.75 for each $1,000 face amount of securities, to yield 8.18 percent. Late Wednesday, before shooting started in the Middle East, the benchmark issue was offered at a price to yield 8.39 percent.
 
Treasury Note Issues
 Among Treasury note issues, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 103 3/32 late yesterday, up 1 7/32 point, to yield 8.03 percent. The 7 7/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 100 23/32, up 1/2 point, to yield 7.68 percent. And the 7 1/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 6/ 32, up 2/32, to yield 7.14 percent.
As bond yields fell, interest rates on Treasury bills rose. In the run-up to war, investors had sought a safe haven in highly liquid, short-term securities like Treasury bills.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 6.09 percent late yesterday, up six basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose 12 basis points, to a late offered rate of 6.25 percent.
The elation that permeated the market produced fairly active trading, participants said, but at least some investors decided to remain on the sidelines.
"We don't see any real reason to jump on right now," said Roger A. Craig, manager of about $650 million in fixed-income investments at the Banc One Ohio Trust Company in Columbus.
"The war news is great right now, but it might not be over the next couple of days. And if we are wrong, there is still plenty of time to jump on board. If everything goes right, bond yields will be well below 8 percent in the near future."
Corporate and tax-exempt municipal bond prices also posted strong gains on the positive developments in the Persian Gulf.
By late in the day, traders in the secondary market for investment-grade bonds said that prices of most intermediate to long-term issues rose as much as 1 1/4 points. Prices of shorter maturities were basically unchanged, the traders said.
In the secondary market for municipal bonds, prices of most widely quoted issues rose by 3/4 point to a full point, market participants said.
Elsewhere, the Public Securities Association, a trade group, said yesterday that because of the war it was recommending that the Government securities market remain open on Monday, the holiday observance of the the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday.
"Given the state of global tensions, many government dealers wish to be in a position to provide the maximum amount of market liquidity to investors around the world," the association said in a statement.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that all three measures of the nation's money supply fell sharply in the week ended Jan. 7.
With the Fed reportedly paying more attention to the monetary aggregates, yesterday's figures might have been expected to elicit some reaction from credit market participants. However, the war news dominated trading activity yesterday, and the money report had no impact on prices.

HEADLINE: A Sharp Drop in Dollar Counters Expectations

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply yesterday, confounding the expectations of many analysts who thought the United States currency would be a safe harbor in a time of war.
Traders said that the market would continue to be volatile and move with the headlines. Because of the uncertainties -- and the ability of the dollar to turn on a dime -- many are leery of trying to make money now on the currency's movements. 
 In early trading in Tokyo today, the news that Iraqi missiles had been fired on Israel pushed the dollar a little higher.
In one foreign exchange room in New York yesterday morning, some traders could be heard cautioning customers against taking positions at this time. "The market continues to be confusing," said Robert A. White, a vice president of First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles. "The risk-reward ratio is just not there."
 
Brief Rally in Tokyo
 After just a brief rally in Tokyo, which elevated the dollar to more than 136 yen and 1.55 marks, the dollar fell sharply against all currencies. It held at the lower levels as trading opened in Europe, but began to slip some more as trading moved into the afternoon in New York and news from the Persian Gulf continued to indicate that the United States and its allies were having success in their assault on Iraq.
By the close of trading in New York, the dollar was at 1.5080 marks, down 2.4 percent from the Wednesday close of 1.5450 marks, and at 132.35 yen, off 3.3 percent from 136.83 yen at the Wednesday close.
The dollar also fell against other currencies, including the British pound. Sterling cost $1.9312 in New York, 1.4 percent more than Wednesday's close of $1.9050.
Some traders said they thought people who expected the dollar to rise on news of war were wrong all along, because the crisis had already given the currency a boost.
"It is just a typical, typical foreign-exchange move," said Liliana Nealon, vice president of foreign exchange at Union Bank of Switzerland. "It's a textbook case. Buy on the rumors and sell when it actually happens."
 
Central Bank Rumors
 Other traders said the dollar was hurt in Asia on Wednesday night by reports that the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan were intervening in the market to sell dollars in an effort to keep the currency from lurching wildly on war news.
The intervention to sell dollars could not be confirmed, but traders said the rumors had almost the same effect and forced many dollar holders to sell in a hurry.
During trading in the United States yesterday, some traders said that the Fed had entered the market to buy dollars with yen for customer accounts, including other central banks. This is not considered normal intervention, and it did not have much impact. But one trader said Fed traders were expressing some concern about the dollar's decline.
 
Underlying Weakness
 The fall of the dollar shows its long-term underlying weakness, the fickleness of the markets and the quickness with which a trend can be turned around when any event seems to signal that it has run its course.
The factors that have weakened the dollar in the last seven months, bringing it to record lows against the mark and the Swiss franc last year, are still in play. They are declining interest rates in the United States; the possibility of rising interest rates in Germany; an American recession at a time of growth in most of Europe and Japan, and concern about the American banking systems and the budget deficit.

HEADLINE: Gulf Oil Flows as Usual Despite Damage to Storage Tank

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
The Government said today that Persian Gulf oil flowed as usual after war broke out with Iraq, the only damage coming when Iraq destroyed a Japanese-owned storage tank in northern Saudi Arabia that held 200,000 barrels.
Production of 300,000 barrels a day from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Iraq was halted as planned in the event of war. 
 "It is quiet," Energy Secretary James D. Watkins told reporters. "The situation is normal."
Mr. Watkins contended that world commercial and strategic supplies were more than adequate to meet demand, now suppressed by recession in the United States and some other countries, and that the Bush Administration had no intention of imposing any controls.
The Government should avoid "trying to interfere in any way with what goes on in the private sector," the Secretary said. "We don't believe there will be any allocation, price control, anything like that."
He said he had discussed with various oil companies the issue of possible windfall profits arising from the war and said they were highly sensitive to political and consumer repercussions if they were seen as gouging.
But Mr. Watkins said he had not requested the price freeze announced late Wednesday by four companies, Mobil, Chevron, Conoco and Unocal.
When asked this afternoon, after the oil price had collapsed, whether he thought the freeze might remain in place to the benefit of the companies, Mr. Watkins said, "I don't think the oil industry is going to play games on that."
Secretary Watkins, a retired admiral, said security measures had been considerably enhanced at the Trans-Alaska oil pipeline and at the nation's utility plants. Moving swiftly to carry out President Bush's decision Wednesday to release 1.12 million barrels a day from the nation's 586-million-barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the department said in putting out bidding notices this morning that the oil would be drawn from four of the six Gulf Coast storage sites and that the bulk of it would be delivered in late February or March.

HEADLINE: So Far, U.S. Industry Finds It's Business as Usual: Aerospace;
No Rush Soon To Reorder Arms

BYLINE: By Richard W. Stevenson

 BODY:
A short war with Iraq would not have any direct mpact on aerospace companies and other military contractors, analysts and industry executives said. The war is being fought with existing inventories of weapons systems and other hardware, and contractors generally do not expect immediate new orders to replace arms expended or lost in the conflict.
Missile manufacturers, like the Raytheon Corporation and the Hughes Aircraft Company, could eventually receive replacement orders if the military decides to rebuild its supplies of tactical weapons. 
 The effects on the industry of a long war are more difficult to gauge. If many front-line fighters, bombers, tanks and other equipment were lost, the Pentagon might want to replace some with new orders. But contractors are increasingly concerned that the cost of a long war -- and perhaps even a short one -- would come at least partly out of the Pentagon's procurement budgets. Rather than improving the military-supply companies' prospects for new business, a war in that way could mean further reductions in orders for existing weapons and a slowing of plans for new systems.
In any case, industry executives do not expect the war to reverse or substantially slow the decline in Pentagon spending.
Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf nations have made it clear that they would like to make additional major arms purchases from the United States when the war is over. But sales to Arab nations are always politically complicated because of objections from supporters of Israel. The biggest likely winners if a sale to Saudi Arabia goes through would be the General Dyanamics Corporation, which makes the M-1 tank.

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Surprises Wall Street With Strong Quarterly Net

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
I.B.M. surprised Wall Street analysts yesterday by reporting an usually strong fourth quarter. The hefty increase in earnings and sales for the world's largest computer maker was taken as evidence that the industry was set for a significant shakeout.
Apple Computer also reported sizable gains yesterday, and the improved performance of the two big companies is expected to put increasing pressure on weaker competitors. 
 The International Business Machines Corporation said its income on an operating basis was up 16.1 percent in the quarter, aided by strong sales of new products. Net income was more than four times greater than a year ago, but that increase was magnified by a large charge to earnings taken in the fourth quarter of 1989. Revenues rose 12.7 percent.
The report, capping a year of financial improvement for I.B.M., came in the face of growing concerns about the international economy and continuing doubts about I.B.M.'s success in controlling expenses.
"This is an upside surprise," said Ulric Weil, a computer industry analyst at Weil & Associates in Washington. "This is a very clean report; there are no gimmicks."
Driven by the unexpectedly strong fourth-quarter figures and by positive market reaction to the initial fighting in the Persian Gulf, I.B.M.'s stock jumped $6.625 a share yesterday, closing at $115.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume was 4.3 million shares, making I.B.M. the sixth most-active Big Board stock.
Wall Street analysts had generally cut their earnings estimates for I.B.M. in recent weeks, concerned that the United States economy was rapidly deteriorating and that European growth, which had buoyed American computer makers in recent years, had stalled. Most analysts had expected I.B.M.'s fourth-quarter earnings to be less than $4 a share, but the number came in significantly higher than that.
Fourth-quarter net income rose to $2.46 billion, or $4.30 a share, up from $591 million, or $1.04 a share, for the 1989 quarter. The results in the 1989 quarter were depressed by the effect of a special $2.4 billion charge taken to cover the cost of eliminating a number of jobs, shutting some operations and other changes.
I.B.M.'s fourth-quarter revenues were $23.06 billion, up from $20.46 bil- lion in 1989.
For the year ended Dec. 31, 1990, net earnings were up 57.9 percent, to $6 billion, or $10.51 a share, compared with $3.76 billion, or $6.47 a share, in 1989. Revenue for the year was $69 billion, up 10 percent from 1989's revenue of $62.7 billion.
Part of the quarter's success was attributed to I.B.M.'s product cycle. Such cycles, based on the introduction of new computers and new technologies, have long been thought to offset the effects of recession by increasing customer purchases. I.B.M. recently brought out a new family of its most powerful mainframe computers, and many industry executives and analysts have said the company has done an exceptional job of managing the transition between the two generations.
"The simple story is the product cycle," said Sanjiv Hingorani, an analyst for Salomon Brothers. "The company product position is better than it's been at any time in the past five years, from personal computers to mainframes."
The Digital Equipment Corporation on Wednesday reported fourth-quarter results that were better than expected, and that, combined with I.B.M.'s showing, caused a number of analysts to say the industry's long-expected shake-out may be under way.
 
Haves and Have-Nots
 "There are going to be a few large successful players, a few boutiques and a lot of pressure in between," said Daniel Mandresh, a computer industry analyst at Merrill Lynch.
Mr. Weil said: " We're seeing a gulf developing between the haves and have-nots. The good companies are coming through with better-than-expected results."
Because of the war with Iraq, I.B.M.'s chairman, John F. Akers, decided not to comment on the financial results. Instead, Mr. Akers issued a statement that said in part: "With the outbreak of hostilities, our first thoughts are for the men and women serving there. We pray for their safety and well-being."
He did say I.B.M. was faced with uncertain conditions affecting markets and economies worldwide.
 
Strong Sales in Some Lines
 In a conference call with industry analysts yesterday, company executives said I.B.M. had shown particular strength in its RS/6000 work stations, AS/400 minicomputers and high-end data storage products. They said I.B.M. had sold all of the new air-cooled ES/9000 mainframe computers, the first members of its newest top-of-the-line family, it had been able to manufacture.
I.B.M. said it had benefited from the impact of currency exchange rates because the dollar had weakened since the end of September. It also said sales continued to grow in Europe although at a slower rate.
The company, based in Armonk, N.Y., said it had met its goal of reducing the number of its employees by 10,000 worldwide in 1990. The departures were voluntary.

HEADLINE: Cheap Oil May Not Be Enough to Cure Recession

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

 BODY:
A free fall in the price of crude oil for February delivery, which plunged more than $10, to $21.44 a barrel yesterday, may have raised hopes for a rapid recovery in the nation's slumping economy. But even if a quick, successful end to the military campaign against Iraq pushes oil prices well below $15 a barrel by midsummer, as some oil analysts predict, daunting obstacles to economic growth will remain.
Although lower oil prices would help the economy, a number of underlying problems would remain. These include growing unemployment in military-supply and manufacturing industries, declining incomes, falling home prices, rising taxes and a credit crunch. Combined with the surge in oil prices after Iraq invaded Kuwait last August, these developments sharply depressed the confidence of consumers.
 
Oil's Impact on the Recession
 Many economists agree that if oil prices average $20 a barrel this year, instead of $30, economic output would rise by half a percentage point. That would lighten the blow of the recession, but not enough to alter significantly the forces that shaped the downturn. 
 "A short, successful military conflict was widely expected by consumers," said Richard Curtin, director of consumer surveys at the University of Michigan. A longer conflict with heavy American casualties would be a staggering blow to consumers, who finished 1990 with their optimism about the economy near the lowest level since a deep recession in 1981-82.
Indeed, it is unclear what effect the missile attacks on Israel early this morning would have on short- or long-term oil prices. Other negative developments in the Persian Gulf could send prices soaring anew.
So far, oil traders have focused on a global market that is bulging with crude oil supplies. Many oil analysts said prices could tumble below $15 a barrel this spring. Demand for oil from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is averaging 21 million barrels a day, while OPEC is producing 23.5 million barrels a day.
If that imbalance continued, it would "provide a tremendous boost" to the economy, said Gordon Richards, economist at the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington. Lower gasoline prices, a lower inflation rate and falling interest rates should stimulate the economy into a rebound by midsummer, he said.
 
$20 Billion for the Economy
 Prof. Benjamin M. Friedman, an economist at Harvard University, said an average oil price of $20 a barrel would add $20 billion to the economy this year. If the Federal Reserve also eased credit by lowering interest rates, he said, the recession would be less severe.
But Rimmer de Vries, managing director at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Corporation, said Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, would be less willing to push interest rates lower if oil prices fell below $20. He said Mr. Greenspan had noted repeatedly that if the Persian Gulf crisis were to end by March or April, lower gasoline prices and inflation rates would by themselves improve consumer confidence. Further easing of credit by the Fed would thus be unlikely, Mr. de Vries said, because it could overstimulate the economy and raise the inflation rate.
Profits at most big oil companies would be little changed in the first half of the year, because oil prices fell gradually through the spring of 1990 to less than $15 a barrel by mid-June. Most oil companies based their 1991 drilling plans on oil prices averaging in the low-$20's.
Dozens of industries get a boost from tumbling oil prices, including airlines, chemicals, retailers, consumer goods and automobiles. Shares of those companies soared yesterday on the world's stock markets.
Some analysts think that once victory over Iraq is assured, Saudi Arabia would reward President Bush with oil prices low enough to insure a strong economy -- and his re-election -- in 1992. The Saudis increased their daily oil output to more than eight million barrels after the Kuwait invasion, from their OPEC quota of five million barrels.
"Oil prices in the low teens would give us at least $60 billion a year that would add a point to growth" of the gross national product, said Philip K. Verleger, an expert on oil markets and visiting fellow at the Institute for International Economics, in Washington.
"The United States has no way out of this recession in terms of fiscal policy," he said. "What we need is a 'petro' push. If I were a Saudi, I'd consider George Bush the best President they've ever had."

HEADLINE: Surge in World Markets Takes Many by Surprise

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
After days of worry about how far the world's stock markets might drop at the start of a war, markets rose strongly yesterday around the world, beginning in Tokyo and continuing through Asia to Europe and the United States.
But the firing of Iraqi missiles into Israel last night is certain to dampen some of the optimism that pervaded markets after the first 24 hours of military action. 
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 issues rose yesterday to 1,004.11 points, or 4.47 percent, to 23,446.81.
The confirmation that several Iraqi missiles exploded in Israel came after the Tokyo market opened this morning. The Nikkei 225 had jumped more than 400 points, but fell on news of the missile attack before rallying again later.
When the European markets opened yesterday, all news from the war zone had been positive for the forces arrayed against Iraq -- there had been no counterattack by Iraq and no offensive had begun against Israel. And trading in Europe opened with a rush.
In Germany, the DAX index of 30 shares surged to a one-day record rise of 99.99 points, or 7.6 percent,, closing at 1,422.67.
 
Big Run-Up in Paris
 The French market's main index jumped to 1,560.47, a surge of 102.70 points or 7.4 percent, the largest one-day rise since the CAC-40 index was introduced in 1988. In London, where stocks had declined less since the Kuwait invasion than in many other markets, The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index rose 2.4 percent, or 49.8 points, closing at 2,104.6. Volume was 564 million shares, double the recent volume.
The global surge in stocks, which was also reflected in exchanges in Norway, Australia, Hong Kong, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Canada, left some fund managers and analysts scrambling to supply explanations. One was that stock markets often move against the consensus view, because bad news has already been incorporated into the prices of stocks -- demonstrated in this case by the sharp declines since the invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
Another explanation was that expectations had been fooled, so far, by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. Some traders said that they had expected a strong counterattack and an assault on Israel -- a rocky start to the war for the United Nations alliance. But with early reports showing little trouble for the alliance forces, a wave of investor optimism was unleashed, sending markets soaring.
"The word is relief," said Alistair Ross Goobey, chief investment strategist at James Capel Ltd. in London.
 
Effect on Small Markets
 In addition, analysts said many of the markets that rose most sharply, like those in Germany and France, are small and relatively illiquid, which means a little new money can push an index a long way.
Some think the rally can continue if the war news remains positive for the coalition led by the United States.
"It is highly likely that you will get disappointments ahead," said Roger Palmer, chief strategist at Kleinwort Benson Securities in London. "The question then will be how far markets come back. Well, based on the performance today, I think the downside risk is limited."
But some said the markets would remain volatile, trading on headlines from the Persian Gulf, and vulnerable to sharp declines. These analysts also think underlying economic conditions -- recessions in the United States, Britain, Canada and Australia, and slowing growth elsewhere -- would limit any gains even when the uncertainties of the war are resolved.
David Roche, international strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company in London, added that the deteriorating situation in the Soviet Union was a potential crisis that could sharply undermine European markets.

HEADLINE: A $150 Million Loan Buys Philadelphia Some Time

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 17

 BODY:
City officials have finally obtained a $150 million loan, or enough currency to relieve a sort of Russian winter that has settled over city government, complete with lines of creditors, a weekly specter of payless paydays for municipal employees and erratic shortages of everything from fax paper to pants for new police recruits.
The loan, to be completed on Friday, does not resolve the city's political stalemate or its fiscal crisis, but it gives the city breathing room until spring when most property and business taxes are paid. At the same time, certain provisions of the loan are intended to put pressure on city and state officials to develop a long-term solution to Philadelphia's chronic inability to pay its bills. 
 "It's a critical first step," said Benjamin Blakney, the City Treasurer. "It's one small step on our road back to recovery," said Jonathan A. Saidel, the City Controller.
A potential snag in the agreement developed late today when State Attorney General Ernie Preate Jr. said he would not approve the loan until he had resolved his concerns, which included the cost of the loan to the city and the risk being incurred by the state teachers' pension fund. The pension fund is part of a coalition that would lend the money to the city, and the Attorney General is required by law to review and approve contracts by state agencies, which include the pension fund.
 
A State Authority Called For
 Also in the lending coalition are local banks and the pension fund of city employees. Under terms of the loan, the city will obtain $100 million on Friday. The rest will become available later this month, but only if city officials start working with state legislators to create a state authority that would help rebuild the city's credit. The authority is only vaguely defined at this point. The loan agreement calls for the introduction of legislation to create it but does not require that the authority actually be created.
It remains to be seen whether city and state officials can overcome sharp differences on the scope and power of such a state authority. Legislators, particularly Republicans who control the State Senate, insist that any state aid to Philadelphia be linked to state supervision of the city's finances. Many city officials reject any such comprehensive state supervision, saying they would only accept it in the future if the city got into trouble again. City officials want a state agency that would primarily guarantee future city borrowing.
City and state officials are also at odds over many other critical issues, including the city's demands for more state aid and state permission to enact a new sales tax. "Perception is reality, and the perception is that Philadelphia is frankly irresponsible in its spending practices," said State Senator Robert C. Jubelirer, a Republican from western Pennsylvania and president pro tempore of the Senate.
As much as anything else, the loan is a monument to the dire financial condition of the city, which faces a $230 million deficit on this year's $2.1 billion budget and a projected deficit of at least $170 million in the fiscal year beginning July 1.
Philadelphia had to approach local banks and the pension funds because it had been shut out of the markets where municipalities usually obtain capital. Last year, after the city was unable to head off its fourth consecutive deficit, Wall Street credit services downgraded Philadelphia's credit rating. The rating eventually reached a level generally reserved for speculative investments that are likely to go into default.
 
High Cost to the City
 The city had initially sought more than $350 million on Wall Street. But the financing from local lenders, culminating six weeks of negotiations, will be only $150 million for 8 to 12 weeks. Moreover, the city had to agree to pay more than $5 million to obtain the loan, or the equivalent of an annual interest rate of more than 24 percent. As another part of the agreement, the city must provide an unusual level of security to investors by earmarking some payments it is scheduled to get from the state for use in repaying the loan.
Saying that the cost of the loan was "absolutely unconscionable," State Treasurer Catherine Baker Knoll, a member of the state pension fund board, cast the board's lone vote on Sunday against the agreement. She said the loan was too risky for the pension fund of the Pennsylvania Public School Employees' Retirement System.
Officials of banks in the lending coalition, lead by the Corestates Financial Corporation, would not discuss the loan.
The Philadelphia police and firefighters unions, which also oppose the loan as too risky for their pension funds, were unable to persuade the Court of Common Pleas on Wednesday to stop the loan. The unions said they would appeal a judge's refusal to block the agreement.
The city's pension board, which handles the pensions of all municipal employees, is normally barred from investing in anything with as poor a credit rating as Philadelphia's, but the City Council amended the law last year in a way that allows the board could lend money to the city.
On Wall Street, reaction to the loan was muted. "This is a short-term infusion of cash for short-term problems," said Hyman C. Grossman, managing director of Standard and Poor's, the credit rating service. "But the long-term problem remains." He said the city needed outside monitoring in some form, more state aid, more taxing authority and more authority to obtain long-term financing to defray its accumulating deficit.
Philadelphia has been operating on a shoestring since September. It has delayed payments to more than 1,000 creditors, dipped into cash reserves held for other purposes, like airport construction projects, and even set rigid controls on petty cash expenditures by city agencies.
As a result, social service agencies have furloughed workers, companies have stopped shipping office supplies to city agencies, street contractors have left some streets partly repaved, and one creditor even repossessed a mobile police station.
The loan will not provide enough money to pay off all of the creditors.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Saudi Arabia;
Riyadh Prepares for New Dangers After Iraqi Attack on Israel

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Friday, Jan. 18

 BODY:
The kingdom braced today for growing internal and external threats in the wake of Iraq's missile attacks on Israel and the Saudi city of Dhahran.
The savoring of the coalition's early air successes over Iraq was dramatically cut short in the early hours of the morning by news of the Iraqi attack on Dhahran. The Iraqi missile was intercepted and destroyed by an American-launched Patriot missile, but the attack alarmed Saudis throughout the oil-laden Eastern Province and in the capital. 
 Saudi officials had no immediate reaction to the attacks on Dhahran or on Israel. But several had previously expressed concern about the impact that an attack on Israel -- and possible Israeli retaliation -- would have on the cohesion of the American-led coalition. Meanwhile, Riyadh moved quickly to prevent what Saudi officials described as an increased threat of terrorism.
"The external threat from Iraq seems much less," the official said, "but the internal threat of terrorism is very real."
Before Iraq's latest attacks against Saudi Arabia and Israel, the kingdom had greeted what appeared to be its dramatic air victory over Baghdad with a mixture of astonishment, relief and euphoria. Jubiliation was particularly strong among Kuwaitis, whose Government in exile is based in Taif, on the Saudi Red Sea coast.
 
'Thank You, Bush!'
 "This is a masterpiece! Thanks to Bush! Thank you, Bush!" exclaimed Suleiman Majid al-Shaheen, Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs in Kuwait's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. "We will be for generations and generations grateful to you for what you have done. As a mighty power, you didn't forget the small nation that needed your help. You reaffirmed the principles of your founding fathers. And you will remain part of us."
Abdullah Bishara, a Kuwaiti who heads the Gulf Cooperation Council, the Saudi-dominated economic and military coordinating group based here, said that because of Saddam Hussein's "bluster," no one had anticipated the one-sidedness of the fight so far.
"It's too good to be believed," Mr. Bishara said. Noting that there were no demonstrations Thursday in Arab capitals, where there was considerable sympathy for the Iraqi leader and opposition to the deployment of Western forces here, Mr. Bishara gloated: "Where were the so-called Arab 'masses'? They are here, in the gulf countries."
There was no reaction from the Saudi ruler, King Fahd, who was reported to have spent much of Wednesday night and almost all of Thursday closeted with his brothers in the Defense Department's Operations Room. One Saudi close to the royal family said that President Bush and the King had closely coordinated plans for the attack, and that King Fahd had spoken by phone to Mr. Bush shortly after the first wave of air attacks began.
The official described the King as "delighted" with the outcome so far of the coalition's assault, but also "saddened that Saddam Hussein had subjected the Iraqi people to this painful experience."
The Government made an unusual concesssion to Saudis, many of whom are extremely skeptical of what they see and hear on state-controlled Saudi broadcasts and newspapers. The English-language television channel carried mostly unedited and uncensored reports from the Atlanta-based Cable News Network throughout the day, including a report that Saudi civil defense forces and even soldiers had fled their posts at the border town of Khafji after Iraqi missiles hit an oil facility. Even the Arabic channel used some translated CNN material in its gulf broadcasts.
Other members of the ruling family and prominent Saudi officials expressed relief that Mr. Hussein had been able to do so little damage to the Saudis so far.
 
Prince Lauds U.S. Ties
 "While it is always sad to see any military response to international disputes," said Prince Abdullah, "I'm relieved that there may now be some relief for the whole world, and that Jubail has not been hit." The Prince is head of the Royal Commission of Jubail and Yanbu, which oversees development in these two industrial cities.
Prince Abdullah said that the alliance's joint assault on Iraq would undoubtedly enhance relations between the United States and the Saudis. "It's wonderful," he said. "Even the Israelis may be jealous."
Saudis seemed proud that some of their own pilots had flown with the Americans on initial sorties. Among them was Prince Sultan bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, a former astronaut.
Many Saudis stayed home Thursday, sleeping late after an anxious night that included two air raid alerts. Asian and other foreign workers continued to scramble for gas masks today. Many left the 70 official distribution points disappointed.
Many business owners kept their stores closed, though traffic increased considerably as the day wore on. In the city's main market, only half the stalls were open. "Most Saudis were simply content to savor their relief at home with their families," one Saudi said.
Security was tightened throughout the capital. Policemen with machine guns were posted in front of most ministries; armed police and security men patrolled streets, questioning loiterers and checking foreigners' identity cards.
An announcer on official Saudi television said that the Ministry of Interior was warning against threats to stability. "Harsh punishment will be brought against any effort to destabilize or sabotage the country," the announcer said, quoting a ministry official.

HEADLINE: STOCKS SOAR AND OIL DROPS ON WAR NEWS;
Dow Jumps 114.60 Points; Tokyo Gains

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
After a moment of silent prayer for the troops in the Persian Gulf and a short clang of the opening bell on the New York and the American Stock Exchanges, trading got off to a flying start yesterday.
The waves of buying carried the Dow Jones industrial average up 114.60 points, or more than 4.5 percent, to end the day at 2,623.51. The Dow's point gain was second only to a jump of 186.84 just after the market crash in October 1987. 
 By the 4 P.M. close, exhausted traders had shoveled 318.9 million shares through the highly automated Big Board system -- the heaviest since the Monday after the plunge in October 1989 and the eighth-largest volume on record.
 
Amex Was Busy, Too
 The American Stock Exchange, which deals in smaller stocks, had its own headaches but at a much lower level, handling 19.6 million shares, the highest in six months.
The United States markets were taking part in a worldwide rally in stocks yesterday in reaction to reports that the United Nations military forces had dominated the opening stages of the war against Iraq.
In Tokyo today, after reports of an Iraqi missile attack on Israel, stocks fell at first, then headed up again. At the close, the Nikkei 225-stock average was up 361.49 points, to 23,808.30.
 
Reaction to Attack on Israel
 Shortly after the attack on Israel, a trading executive for Instinet, which provides off-hours trading, said people were "starting to trade actively again, with many orders to sell." He said that among them were orders to sell Intel, I.B.M. and Apple Computer.
At 9 P.M., he said that activity had "calmed down." He said a number of people had entered orders in the system to sell at prices below yesterday's close but that trading on the system was light.
Both stock exchanges in New York were so alert to the possibility of terrorism that neither allowed visitors on its trading floor yesterday. The Big Board was ringed with police barricades.
The gains were striking. Minnesota Mining rose 4 1/8, International Paper 3 1/4, General Electric 3 3/8, Merck 3 1/8, Alcoa 2 5/8 and I.B.M. 6 5/8.
In one of the few disappointments, Motorola slid 3 3/4, to 45 7/8, after reporting a drop in profits.
A drop of $29.80 in the gold price toppled gold shares, with Newmont Gold and ASA each down 4.
And despite a decline of $10.56 in oil prices, to $21.44, oil and oil-service stocks generally held their gains.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, also loaded with blue chips, climbed almost 4 percent, meaning that the gains were widespread.
The composite index of the over-the-counter market advanced almost 3 percent and the Amex market-value index was up more than 1 percent.
 
Tied to Their Desks
 "We traded three days' volume in one day," said David S. Chao, head trader in New York for County NatWest Securities. "There wasn't much time to leave your desk or you could miss a chance to buy at good prices because the prices were so volatile."
William S. Stack, chief investment officer for the Lexington Management Corporation, with $2.5 billion in investments, said the firm, known for its Minute Man symbol, put about $50 million into the market yesterday.
He said the money went into retailing, airline, restaurant and paper issues and, to a lesser extent, high-technology stocks.
He said he had $80 million more to go into "the kind of stocks that benefit from an economic recovery stimulated by falling interest rates, like retailers, airlines and newspapers."
Everybody seemingly lined up to buy: banks, insurance companies, pension funds and all stripes of money manager and individual investor -- all flush with cash and eager to put money to work. Many bought 25,000 to 50,000 shares at a clip -- and often considerably more.
"The advance today is for real," said David B. Bostian Jr., chief economist and strategist for Jesup, Josephthal & Company. "We've seen the lows in the stock market. We could have some interim setbacks, depending on events in the Middle East and the Soviet Union, but I believe the risk-reward is very favorable."
Even so, today is both the start of an uncertain weekend in the gulf and a market "witching hour," when options and index futures expire. Traders said prices today could be volatile for both reasons. "Now we're coming into a weekend, Mr. Chao of NatWest said, "and people will be a little more cautious because of the uncertainty. The Dow is coming into a resistance level, near 2,610 at the start of the year, and it should have some difficulty getting through."
 
Looking Toward Recovery
 Birinyi Associates said program buying added less than 9 points to the Dow yesterday. Big Board officials intervened 14 minutes after the market opened, because the Dow had already soared 50 points. At that point, the exchange imposes limits on program trading.
At the opening of trading, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index contract rose the 5-point limit imposed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which halted trading briefly then set a 20-point limit. Prices quickly rose to within 3.15 points of the new limit.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: The Overview;
IRAQIS FIRE MISSILES AT ISRAELI CITIES AFTER SECOND DAY OF ALLIED BOMBING; U.S. DISCOURAGES AN ISRAELI RESPONSE

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
After a day of allied successes in the war against Iraq, Baghdad struck back today with missile attacks on Israel and Saudi Arabia.
Preliminary reports indicated that seven Iraqi missiles hit Israel, and there were reports of injuries but no deaths. The missiles did not appear to be armed with chemical warheads. 
 The attack on Saudi Arabia was less severe. The Pentagon said one Iraqi missile was fired at Saudi Arabia and was intercepted by a Patriot anti-missile rocket just before striking the Dhahran area in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia.
 
Right to Respond
 Tonight, the Israeli Ambassador to the United States, Zalman Shoval, said that Israel had refrained, at Washington's behest, from launching a pre-emptive strike at Iraq's missile batteries before the Iraqi attack but that his nation "reserved the right" to respond.
The United States has strongly warned against any Israeli military action against Iraq for fear that it might threaten Arab support for the international alliance against Baghdad.
The Iraqi counterattacks were the first reversal in a war that had gone completely the allies' way. United States officials said 159 Iraqi targets were hit in the first day of intense air attacks against Iraqi and Kuwaiti targets.
 
Testing Ground for Weapons
 The gulf war involved all four branches of the American military and has become in effect a testing ground for the expensive, high-technology weapons it developed for use against the Soviet Union.
American officials said that in the early going Stealth fighters, electronic jamming equipment and devastatingly accurate cruise missiles had paid for themselves in saved lives and powerful blows to a technologically outmatched adversary.
In initial reports on the results of the constant strikes against Iraq, American officials said the Iraqi Defense Ministry and the presidential palace had been struck by Navy Tomahawk cruise missiles fired from offshore in the first use of these weapons in combat.
 
Restrictions on Reporting
 It was difficult to fully analyze the Pentagon assessments, because of the extraordinarily strict information policy imposed by the Bush Administration. The Pentagon offered only sketchy details, including the death of one American pilot, in today's lone official briefing at 9 A.M. Eastern standard time. That briefing took place before the launching of most of the air sorties against Iraq in the second night of bombing, and before the Iraqi missile strikes.
American officials said they were confident that they had inflicted significant damage on their first-priority targets, including command centers, the Scud missile launchers, antiaircraft batteries and Iraqi warplanes. But they acknowledged that they had not destroyed all their targets.
Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, fended off questions about the combat situation this morning by saying full disclosures might endanger American lives.
Speaking away from television cameras on the understanding that they not be quoted by name, other American officials acknowledged that the early air strikes had not entirely achieved their mission of severing President Saddam Hussein's command and communications networks. A Pentagon official said today that some of Iraq's most advanced combat planes had escaped the initial wave of attacks by flying north to other bases.
That report, plus the success in destroying many of the airfields and planes, seemed to explain the remarkably low level of resistance in the first evening of the assault and promised tougher fighting ahead with the Iraqi military, which has been hardened by eight years of war with Iran but has never experienced the scope and intensity of the assault that began about 2:30 A.M. Baghdad time on Thursday.
 
Unremitting Wave of Sorties
 Since then American, French, British, Saudi and Kuwaiti warplanes kept up a virtually unremitting wave of aerial sorties that totaled well over 1,300 through the first day and another night in the Persian Gulf.
The initial assault also included Army AH-64A Apache helicopters that a Pentagon official said crossed into Iraq on a special-operations mission to disable an Iraqi air defense radar.
Officials said the air assault was just beginning and was merely the first phase of the assault against Iraq that was likely to include far more difficult and potentially more bloody ground battles with Iraqi soldiers and tank crews who have dug into southern Iraq and Kuwait.
 
Sense of Euphoria in Washington
 The reports of initial allied victories lent a sense of euphoria to a capital that had been mired in talk of recession, Federal budget deficits and open partisan warfare between the White House and Congress.
Administration officials tried to chasten this mood by playing down the importance of first-day successes and warning of more battles to come and with them the likelihood of American casualties. But President Bush and his advisers warned that there would be no "pause for peace" to give President Hussein time to rethink his defiance of the United Nations demand that he withdraw.
"We're using force and we're not going to stop until he pulls out of Kuwait," Mr. Bush said at the White House.
 
Hussein Is Defiant
 But in Baghdad, a defiant Mr. Hussein vowed to fight on as his Government said it would defeat the American-led coalition. Iraq released its first casualty reports, saying that 23 civilians had been killed and 66 wounded in allied bombing attacks.
Reports of damage and casualties were impossible to confirm independently. Iraq said its forces shot down 55 attacking warplanes, while the United States and Kuwait's Government-in-exile each reported one plane lost and Britain reported two downed aircraft through the first day and night of fighting. The American plane, an F/A-18 off the carrier Saratoga, was shot down by an Iraqi surface-to-air missile and its pilot was killed, American officials said. He was identified tonight as Lieut. Comdr. Michael S. Speicher, 33 years old.casualty in the war.
Officials here stressed that the combat had just started and that more casualties were inevitable.
 
Oil Flow Normal, U.S. Says
 The United States Government said Persian Gulf oil flowed as usual. The only reported damage to fields or facilities came when Iraqi artillery fire hit a Japanese-owned storage tank in Khafji in northern Saudi Arabia that had held 200,000 barrels, American officials said.
Allied F-15's and radar-evading F-117 Stealth fighters kicked off the war with the first blows against air-defense batteries near Baghdad. Two battleships and a cruiser in the Persian Gulf and Los Angeles class submarines in the Red Sea fired Tomahawk cruise missiles at communications sites, power plants and other fixed targets.
Attacking behind the wave of high-technology weapons, aging B-52 bombers pounded Iraq's Republican Guard, the elite of Bahgdad's 545,000-strong army in southern Iraq and Kuwait.
Although Iraq had responded to the allied air attacks on Thursday night primarily with antiaircraft fire, American pilots engaged Iraqi warplanes in their first aerial duels today.
 
Protected Weapons a Concern
 American officials said Mr. Hussein, whose personal behavior and military plans remained an enigma, may have enough missiles and planes in hardened bunkers to mount resistance in the days ahead. The point was driven home hours later with news of the Scud attacks.
"The Department of Defense has confirmed the firing of missiles from Iraq into Israel and Saudi Arabia," the White House press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said tonight. "Damage assessments are being made."
"The President is outraged at, and condemns, this further aggression by Iraq," said the Mr. Fitzwater. "Coalition forces in the gulf are attacking missile sites and targets in Iraq."
An American official said the United States had sent two flights of F-15's from Turkey to destroy the missile launchers that had delivered the blows.
 
Agreement to Consult
 The United States and Israel had previously agreed to consult if Iraq launched an attack on Israel. The Israelis had told the United States last week that their response to an Iraqi missile attack would depend primarily on the extent of damage done and the ability of the allied air force to prevent a second strike.
American officials said earlier in the day that the fact that Iraq launched no Scud missiles in the first day of fighting suggested that efforts to destroy the weapons or sever command links to them had been largely successful.
But General Powell cautioned that some of the Iraqi missiles, Soviet-designed surface-to-surface rockets known by their NATO code name, are on mobile launchers that are hard to find. American military planners were said to be concerned that about 30 to 35 mobile Scud launchers may still be operable.
It also was too early to tell how long the war would be confined to the air before American and allied ground forces are used. American military officials said the bombing could be expected to continue for days at least, in hopes of avoiding a more costly conflict on the ground by destroying as much of Iraq's command structure, missile sites, air force and ground forces as possible.
 
'It Will Be Awesome'
 After talking with Defense Secretary Cheney, Senator Alan K. Simpson, the Republican Whip and a close ally of Mr. Bush, said: "My sense is that it will be continuous, it will be all out, it will be awesome. We'll continue to pound and pound and pack him down in the sand with bombardment day and night."
The Bush Administration had to put out a small political brushfire this afternoon after Mr. Fitzwater said of Mr. Hussein: "All he has to do is surrender and comply with all the U.N. resolutions. The situation to Saddam is the same now as it's been for five and a half months, and all he has to do is lay down his arms."
The White House later explained that the United States was not calling for the total surrender of Iraq, but was sticking to its initial purpose of driving Iraq's army out of Kuwait. If Mr. Hussein leaves Kuwait, Administration officials reiterated today, they will stop the war.
But they said there would be no "pause" in the fighting to permit him to fully absorb what has happened and to reconsider his position. Doing that, some officials argued, would allow him to regroup militarily and increase the casualties if he then decided to keep fighting.
Mr. Bush later said he did "not want to get into semantics" and repeated his insistence that Iraq leave Kuwait.
At the briefing in the Pentagon today, Mr. Cheney and General Powell gave reporters the first bare outlines of what American and other allied forces had been able to achieve in their air raids and what remained to be done.
 
Attacks on Communications
 General Powell said the first day's bombing had done considerable damage to "the means by which the leadership of Iraq talks to its soldiers and communicates and maintains control." But he said Iraq's command system had not collapsed.
A Pentagon official said the Air Force had failed to knock out Iraq's television station in its first raid and that planes had been sent back today to attempt another mission to destroy it. Meanwhile, Mr. Hussein used the television station to make a speech exhorting his countrymen to fight and to show that he himself was still alive and unhurt.
Reports on damage to Iraq's air force were mixed. In Paris, Gen. Maurice Schmitt, head of the French armed forces, said that allied air raids had destroyed "on the order of 50 percent" of Iraq's warplanes. Pentagon officials said that B-52's and other attack planes had pounded Iraqi airfields but that it would take some time before they were entirely disabled.
"We have command of the skies, although we will have to pay attention to keeping it," said Senator Albert Gore Jr., Democrat of Tennessee and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

Allied Forces
 
The attack began Thursday morning local time.
 
Tomahawk cruise missiles carrying conventional warheads were launched from U.S. Navy battleships, cruisers and destroyers in the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf.
 
Land- and ship-based fighter aircraft massed at bases in northern Saudi Arabia, then flew north over Iraq and Kuwait, jamming radar and knocking out antiaircraft weapons.
 
B-52 bombers aimed at Iraq's elite infantry, the Republican Guard, in northwest Kuwait and southern Iraq. B-52's made runs against military centers and chemical and nuclear weapons plants throughout Iraq.
 
Iraqi Forces
 
In the initial attack, Iraqi planes were prevented from scrambling. The only retaliation was artillery fire at Khafji, where oil tanks burned but no injuries were reported.
 
Early Friday local time, Iraqi Scud surface-to-surface missiles struck Israel, causing undetermined damage and at least some minor injuries. Early reports said missiles exploded in Tel Aviv, Haifa and in unpopulated areas of the country.
 
An Iraqi missile was intercepted before it struck Dhahran. The Pentagon said American aerial bombardments of Scud sites were continuing.

HEADLINE: Of the Palate, From the Palette

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL

 BODY:
"ART WHAT THOU EAT," a display of 19th- and 20th-century American paintings and sculpture at the New-York Historical Society through March 22, makes a good case for developing an eating disorder. Eating too much -- or not eating at all -- is one of the few ways that individuals can still exert some control over the corporate takeover of American food supplies that is depicted here.
The connection to food production is, after all, an Everyman sort of link to nature. Without it, people are as vulnerable as unfettered skiffs in a squall. When appetite is no longer a response to choosing among foods of one's own making, it becomes an amorphous urge easily co-opted by industry. TV dinners, junk food, liquid diets, microwave ovens and McDonald's are the beachheads in corporate America's assault on idiosyncratic taste.
I 
 t's scary. The stylistic changes in the painting of food in the last 200 years are a graphic witness to what has been lost. The sensuous, intimate pastoral scenes and still lifes from the 19th century seem quaint and fumbling next to the inviolable, stern lines of contemporary Pop and Minimalist food art.
Bye-bye personal taste. Now you will have it their way.
The 16 groupings of paintings are arranged by concept, from food and economics to food and sexuality. The first, "Rituals for Victuals," sets the show's sociohistoric scheme. "The Dinner Party," by Henry Sargent in the 1820's, is the interior of a Boston Brahmin dining room where the mood is sheltered, mellow and perfectly ordered. By 1950, "Oyster Party" by Lucille Corcos is still a celebration of the convivial powers of food, but the tone has changed. It's chaotic. The helpful servants are gone, and so is the sedate decorum. People are cooking and crouching and singing and eating and everybody is having one heck of a time. Yet they are naive, folkloric figures, vulnerable to the world outside (where it is snowing). By the mid-20th century, food has lost its communal magic.
In "Football" (1986) by Janet Fish, the dinner companion is a hard-edged television set. Dinner is a bag of potato chips, a jar of pickles, a loaf of sliced bread, a plastic container of fruit with a plastic fork. Isolation is the entree. Even the diner is missing.
According to Linda Weintraub, director of the Edith C. Blum Art Institute at Bard College and one of the show's four curators, the stylistic move from mutable lines, mellow moods and a manageable scale to food rendered in stern strokes, unwieldy planes and scenes that seem reduced to their bottom line, parallels the nation's changing attitude toward its daily bread. "Style is never arbitrary," she said. "It always changes in tandem with society."
At the beginning of the 19th century, America was a family-oriented, farm-centered society: the food eaten was the food grown. Dinner was a direct result of effort and was therefore imbued with thankful wonder (in our Puritan soul, we could only enjoy the pleasures of food as just rewards for honest labor). By the mid-19th century, railroads and steam ships had widened the distance between the field and the table, and the span was chock full of new, exotic choices like citrus fruits and pineapples, bananas and lobsters. Inundated with choice, people began controlling food through processing. Canned and preserved foods zoomed to the front of grocery shelves in the late 19th century. Industrialization started to displace the family farm. Mass marketing started to ring the dinner bell. Instead of being judged by its inherent quality, food was increasingly appraised for the quality of its packaging.
Eventually, this led to what Harvey Levenstein, a historian and author of "Revolution at the Table" (Oxford, 1988), calls "an abundance of choice and no variety." Consumers can choose between containers, but the contents are about the same. Well, breaking up is hard to do. And by the mid-20th century, fewer than 10 percent of Americans had a hands-on connection to getting their food to the table. Instead of eating three planned (and generally communal) meals, most had 17 random encounters with food a day, Miss Weintraub said. In other words, we had turned into a nation of lonely nibblers.
 
Industrial Bread
 The effect of this shift on the individual rises like a strong yeast from the progressions of paintings in the section called "Wonder Bread." John Francis's "Still Life" from 1866 is a warm tableau of homely, handmade biscuits. Jasper Johns's "Bread" (1969), on the other hand, is a perfect slice of something white and industrial that is resolutely mounted on a void-like lead ground. The word "unappetizing" comes to mind. But a few years later, "EST Graduate," Peter Nagy's depiction of Pepperidge Farm's high-rise corporate headquarters, doesn't even "un" the appetite. It does nothing to the senses at all.
The shift from the sensuous to the systematic is even more vivid in the section called "Technology of Fruit." The first painting, Levi Wells Prentice's "Apples in a Basket" (1890), is a ruby cascade; each fruit is different, none are perfect, all inspire a rhapsody: apple pie, applesauce, stewed apples with boudin, baked apples, apple butter. But oh no! The paintings progress to "Fruit Bowl," in which Hans Hofmann's abstract lines are resolutely removed from nature and the colorless bowl of fruit is a small corner in colliding planes of reality. Next is Roy Lichtenstein's "Bananas and Grapefruit," a flat, cold-blooded cartoon of perfect, unapproachable, genetically engineered fruit.
It's enough to unsettle a gal's "appetistat." Paintings arranged around concepts like "From Market to Merchandising," "Men and Meat: Hunter, Butcher, Carver," and "Apples and Eve" provide further insight into the country's current existential crisis of consumption. Chronic obesity, diet-related health problems and runaway eating disorders seem the logical outcome to the progression of alienation from appetite that is depicted in "Art What Thou Eat."
 
A Horror of Brutality
 Estranged from the pleasure of idiosyncratic appetite, the Puritan in us has also developed a sense of horror with the brutality of food production. In only two centuries, we've moved from the philosophy that good food is just reward for hard labor to a nonspecific anxiety over what we eat. America's vulnerability to every burp and gurgle of diet-related "findings" from the health profession today is just one painful attempt to find a new justification for eating with pleasure -- or at least with purpose. And the gag response that many viewers had as they stood in front of Abraham Rattner's portrait "The Meat Cutter" (1964) is another.
Unlike the cool, Minimalist paintings that precede it, "The Meat Cutter" is painted in bold strokes and vivid colors. It is a portrait of a butcher whose bloody victim is virtually indistinguishable from his own blood-spattered arm, a revolting emblem of the blurring of lines between human and animal and the growing apprehension about people's proper position in the food chain. The painting is a sad little pat on the back to a culture estranged from its own appetite.
"Of course, you can't decide what to have for dinner; food is gross and messy and inhuman and unhealthy," says the painting. And in the 25 years since, food advertisers and marketers have tirelessly said: "Let corporate America find something tidy and healthy and convenient for you, dear!"
 
Where and When
"Art What Thou Eat" will be on view through March 22 at the New-York Historical Society, 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, in Manhattan. Hours are 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesday to Sunday. Admission is $4.50 ($3 for the elderly; $1 for those under 12). Information: (212) 873-3400.

HEADLINE: So Far, U.S. Industry Finds It's Business as Usual

BYLINE: By Agis Salpukas

 BODY:
Some executives canceled flights, fearful of terrorism. American flags sold briskly at Woolworth's. And advertising agencies scanned commercials for messages that might seem offensive to a nation at war.
But for the most part, American industry went on with business as usual yesterday, hopeful that the war would end quickly. That was before Iraqi missiles struck Israel last night, complicating the political and military situation and bringing a great deal more uncertainty to the scene. 
 Representatives of the steel and airline industries expressed hopes yesterday afternoon that the drop in oil prices that followed the first huge air raids on Iraq would ease cost pressures. In real estate and retailing, executives hoped an improvement in the public's morale would help slumping sales.
"If it continues this way, I think it removes an enormous amount of uncertainty from the consumer," said Barbara Allen, a real estate analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Company, after the initial optimistic reports of heavy damage in Iraq and few American casualties. "I would not be surprised to see an upsurge in home buying because the affordability trend is so favorable."
Following are accounts of how the fighting in the Persian Gulf region is affecting various segements of American industry:
 
Mixed News for Airlines
Most major international airlines, including British Airways, KLM and Pan Am, said cancellations had increased on most international flights. Domestic flights in the United States showed little effects of the war.
At the same time, the airlines were optimistic that the steep slide in oil prices, if sustained, will drive down the cost of jet fuel.
"This could provide major cost relief for the industry and start to limit the losses," said Paul Karos, an analyst with the First Boston Corporation. He said a doubling of fuel prices for most of the fourth quarter had damaged the industry.
Jeffrey Kriendler, a senior vice president for corporate relations at Pan American, said the spot price for aviation fuel dropped to 77 cents a gallon yesterday from 97 cents the day before. Before Iraq invaded Ku- wait on Aug. 2, the spot price was 61 cents a gallon.
In the aftermath of the opening round of air raids on Iraq, many international airlines said they had been flooded with calls.
Sandy Gardiner, the senior vice president of public relations in North America for British Airways, said the airline had 10,500 calls at its offices at Heathrow Airport yesterday morning. But only 84 callers canceled flights, he said.
Odette Fodor Gernaert, manager of public relations at KLM in the United States, said, "We have increased cancellations, but we have also seen an increase in the number of bookings."
She said some people might be switching to KLM, hoping that the airline was less of a target for terrorists than an airline of a nation whose foces were involved in the military strike against Iraq.
Airlines have made it easier to cancel; most are allowing people holding tickets with cancellation penalties to change their travel plans or turn their tickets in for vouchers good for one year. John Hotard, a spokesman for American Airlines, said only a small number of passengers had canceled trips and asked for vouchers.
At the Marriott Corporation, whose 639 hotels make it one of the largest chains in the world, Rodger Conner, the senior vice president of communications, said there had been no noticeable increase in cancellations or drop in reservations.
The sharpest drops in occupancy have come at the company's International hotels in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and Amman, Jordan. But the International Hotel in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, is 98 percent full, he said, because many Saudi families had moved there from more exposed places.
Terry Denny, the manger of public relations for the International Air Transport Association, the industry trade group, said airlines had been notified to get in touch with their insurance brokers in London to find out what new rates would be for their flights.
Lloyd's of London and other insurers increased rates more than tenfold on some flights to the Middle East before war broke out. Some airlines responded by canceling flights.

HEADLINE: So Far, U.S. Industry Finds It's Business as Usual: Real Estate;
A Way to Cure Buyer Paralysis

BYLINE: By Richard D. Hylton

 BODY:
Real estate executives, analysts and builders were relieved but cautious yesterday about what theinitial phase of the Persian Gulf conflict meant for their troubled industry.
"It's certainly positive to the extent -- and presuming -- it clears up the uncertainty on the part of consumers and commercial tenants to make long-term commitments to purchase a home or lease space," said David Shulman, a managing director and head of Salomon Brothers' real estate research department. 
 And Barbara Allen of Kidder, Peabody & Company commented, "If it continues this way, I think it removes an enormous amount of uncertainty from the consumer and I would not be surprised to see an upsurge in home buying because the affordability trend is so favorable."
Like Mr. Shulman, many industry experts said it was far too soon to judge fully the effects of the conflict.
"I hope now, with the early signs of what is going on, that some of the paralysis might be eliminated and people can bring more buyers and sellers together," said James W. Allwin, Morgan Stanley & Company's managing director in charge of real estate investment banking.
Nearly all real estate experts said that if the likelihood of a protracted conflict faded quickly, consumers would begin to focus more on domestic economic issues like the recession, falling real estate values and the banking crisis.
"The issue here is whether the problems in the economy are more fundamental than the rise in oil prices caused by the invasion of Kuwait and its affect on consumer confidence," said Mr. Shulman. "In my view, the problems are more fundamental."

HEADLINE: So Far, U.S. Industry Finds It's Business as Usual: Retailing;
A Run on Flags, But No Trends

BYLINE: By Isadore Barmash

 BODY:
There was no obvious slowdown in retailing yesterday and few industry executives were willing to quantify what the effect of the war could be.
Many retail companies, including Sears, Roebuck & Company, the largest, said they felt the Mideast conflict -- along with the recession -- had weakenened consumer confidence and hurt business. "But it's impossible at this time to say what the effect of a short- or long-term war could be on our business or that of the industry," said a Sears spokesman in Chicago. 
 At the K Mart Corporation, the second-largest retailer, a spokesman said, "Our January sales pattern has been nicely up so far and we have not heard of any interruptions in it."
The Woolworth Corporation said many of its stores reported a run on American flags. "We can't quantify how many, but lots were sold," a company spokesman said.
If the war lasts at least several days, Woolworth expects flatter or reduced sales, the spokesman said, primarily because many consumers would probably stay home to watch the developing news on television. If the war ends fairly soon, he predicted, "it will have a significant, uplifting effect on sales."
Woolworth and other major retailers said they had increased security at their headquarters buildings.

HEADLINE: So Far, U.S. Industry Finds It's Business as Usual: Steel;
Looking for Help In Durable Goods

BYLINE: By Jonathan P. Hicks

 BODY:
Steel industry executives said the war in the Middle East would not affect their business prospects in the near term.
"Very little of what we produce goes into war materials," said Robert Lefley, a spokesman with Inland Steel Industries. "The biggest impact will be what it does to the overall economy and consumer confidence, which will enable consumers to buy durable goods." 
 Other steel executives and analysts said a disruption in crude oil supplies, or higher prices, would have a damaging effect in the long term. Energy costs for steelmakers and other manufacturers have climbed by as much as 50 percent since the Persian Gulf crisis began last summer.
"When the problem is resolved and tension eases, we can expect investment in plant and equipment to accelerate and the industrial expansion phase of the business cycle to continue," said Frank W. Luersson, chairman and chief executive of Inland Steel and chairman of the American Iron and Steel Institute, a trade group.
A long war would be disastrous for the steel industry, analysts said, because interest rates and inflation would likely remain high.
"The steel industry needs lower interest rates to help stimulate capital spending," said Christopher Plummer, a steel industry analyst with the WEFA Group in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., a research concern. "The construction industry and capital spending in manufacturing accounts for 60 percent of the demand for steel."

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: AROUND THE WORLD - JAPAN;
Financial Aid Is Pledged

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Japan responded today to the outbreak of war in the Persian Gulf with a new pledge of financial aid to the United States and allied troops in the region and a reiteration of its determination to avoid direct combat itself.
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, emerging from a round of hurried meetings with his Cabinet, said, however, that Japan might use some of its military aircraft to evacuate civilians or refugees from the region but that such a decision was still being debated. 
 Mr. Kaifu said Japan would extend "maximum possible support" to military actions taken by the anti-Iraq allies in what officials said was an effort to avoid the delays that led to criticism of Japan last summer, especially in the United States Congress.
The debate on the symbolic but direct role of using a military transport plane illustrated the continuing concern that Japan not take any steps that might conceivably be interpreted as a violation of its ban on the use of force that was written into the Constitution after World War II.
Japan's avoidance of a direct role stems from deep-seated pacifist feelings, a popular distrust of the military and an equally widespread feeling, especially in business circles, that the gulf crisis generally should be resolved by negotiations rather than fighting.
 
$4 Billion Promised Earlier
 Japanese officials said they have become increasingly concerned that Tokyo react quickly with a pledge of financial aid to avoid criticism, such as was expressed in August, that it was late in coming up with its package of $4 billion in aid for the military buildup and for economic relief in the gulf.
"The most important message we have right now is that we stand firmly by the United States," Taizo Watanabe, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said in an interview.
But Mr. Watanabe and other officials said that because of Japan's procedures, specific needs would have to be identified for Mr. Kaifu's Government to come up with precise sums in addition to the $4 billion, less than half of which has actually been disbursed.
"Please don't expect that right after the shooting starts, we come up with a figure right away," Mr. Watanabe said.
Since the beginning of the crisis in August, Japan has gone through an agonizing debate over the gulf, culminating in an extraordinary setback for Prime Minister Kaifu when his bill to send unarmed military personnel to the region died in Parliament.

HEADLINE: More Cells for More Prisoners, but to What End?

SERIES: First of two articles about the future of American prisons.

BYLINE: By ANDREW H. MALCOLM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VACAVILLE, Calif.

 BODY:
At a time when the hard-pressed Federal and state governments are desperately trying to reduce most of the services they provide, they continue to build prisons as fast as possible. America's taxpayers are financing several billion dollars in new prisons every year -- and still there are not enough cells for the flood of prisoners, many of them with special mental, medical and educational problems.
By the middle of 1990 there were 695,000 inmates in state prisons and 60,000 in Federal penitentiaries, an overall increase of 80,000 in one year. That is the largest growth in 65 years of record-keeping. 
 Yet even as frightened voters elect politicians who promise to be tough on crime and authorize more and more walled compounds surrounded by razor wire, motion detectors and heavily armed guards, there seems to be little discussion about what these troubled institutions are supposed to do.
Are they simply to remove a wrongdoer from society for a while, preferably a long while, and then release him little different than he was on entry? Are they supposed to punish a prisoner somehow beyond just the simple loss of freedom? Or should they also seek to rehabilitate the prisoner to avoid future crimes?
 
Imbalance in Purpose?
 "The four classical purposes of imprisonment are incapacitation, deterrence, punishment and rehabilitation," said Frank Hartmann, executive director of the criminal justice program at Harvard University. "Right now, the balance has gone. You'd have to say rehabilitation is out and incapacitation and punishment are in."
But a growing number of prison administrators now say that locking up inmates for a while does little to make the public safer. So many criminals are being ordered to do time that the system, no matter how fast it builds prisons, cannot keep up. Corrections officials say a state could go broke trying to construct and run enough prisons to guarantee that each inmate serves a full sentence. And so, many of these convicts are released after barely a third of their sentences, having learned nothing -- except, perhaps, some crime tips from fellow inmates.
"There is no relationship between the incarceration rate and violent crime," said Daniel P. O'Brien, assistant to Minnesota's commissioner of corrections. "We're in the business of tricking people into thinking that spending hundreds of millions for new prisons will make them safer."
Anthony Travisono, executive director of the American Correctional Association, a group of prison professionals, agreed. "It is a kind of a fraud, no doubt," he said.
 
No Cure in Buildings
 Mr. Travisono said society is failing to follow through after conviction. "The problem is," he said, "we have bond issues for new buildings. But buildings, new or old, have never cured anyone of anything."
He added: "If they want corrections to lock people up just to vegetate and fester, then we don't want to take the rap when these folks come out the same as they went in, or worse. There has got to be much greater public discourse on the problems."
Kenneth McGinnis, director of Illinois's Department of Corrections, said: "Economic pressures are overwhelming most states and governments. Prisons will simply bankrupt the states unless we find cheaper ways to punish and figure out how to keep all these people from returning."
 
A 'City' of Sorts
 The state prison complex here in Vacaville, some 40 miles northeast of San Francisco, is the largest in California, probably in the world: 8,000 inmates, four times the prison's 1980 population, housed in cells and dorms sprawling over 1.5 square miles of arid land.
California's prison system is the largest in the country. It has 97,000 inmates, or 29,000 more people than live in the state capital near here. There are 32,000 employees at 20 facilities and an annual operating budget exceeding $2.3 billion.
It's still growing rapidly. Ten years ago, the system had 22,000 prisoners at 12 facilities. The Corrections Department's planning and construction division has been told to plan for 173,000 inmates by 1996, meaning 20 more prisons at a cost of at least $2 billion. When the next three prisons with 8,000 beds are completed, the state system will still be operating at 185 percent of design capacity.
Nearly 40 states are operating under court orders concerning overcrowding. Corrections, an industry of some $25 billion a year, spent $3 billion on new construction in 1990.
"We're spending billions on bricks and mortar and security staff," said Alvin Bronstein, executive director of the National Prison Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, a prisoner-rights group. "But we're not spending on maintenance and programs because people believe, 'Nothing works, so why bother?' "
 
'Life' Can Mean Life
 The reasons for the record increases are clear. Reflecting public anger, more felonies now draw longer terms. So do new classes of felonies; in many states, repeated drunken-driving convictions now require prison time, while three-time violent offenders can draw true life terms. In 1975, 15 percent of all California's felony convictions led to prison terms. Today, 35 percent do.
Determinate or fixed sentences have eliminated much judicial discretion in assessing prison terms. Rigid formulas cross-reference a criminal's record, tendency to violence, use of weapons and other criteria to compute a precise term without flexibility -- not, for instance, five to 10 years. Use of probation is way down and violators are rejailed more quickly; 35 percent of California's inmates are violators of probation from old crimes.
Finally, the drug epidemics of the 1980's have swelled inmate populations. California officials estimate that 85 percent of convicts enter prison with a substance abuse problem, often creating greater problems of control and counseling.
"In the 1970's, we had a lot going on in counseling, treatment, education," said Mr. McGinnis of Illinois, whose prison system grew 20 percent last year, the largest increase of any state. "Then we're overwhelmed with these numbers, so we end up just scratching the surface."
 
Don't Dare 'Coddle'
 No corrections official would argue that sure-fire strategies have been developed for turning criminals away from crime. But most corrections officials maintain that it is sensible and cost-effective to try counseling, education and drug treatment. Even if only a few inmates respond, they say, the public is that much safer and will be spared future expenses for years of warehousing them.
But in the get-tough political climate, virtually any such programs smack of coddling criminals, and most politicians want no part of them.
Years ago, in fact, California's legislators wrote rehabilitation out of the state code. "Our mission," said Michael Van Winkle, a corrections spokesman, "does not include rehabilitation."
But if sheer punishment, not rehabilitation, is now the aim of incarceration, are the prisons doing even that job adequately?
Centuries ago, no criminal was sentenced to prison as punishment. Prisons were merely storage sites where prisoners were housed temporarily, at their own expense, to await trial or imposition of their punishment, which typically was exile, flogging or execution. As an alternative to, for instance, cutting off the hands of thieves, a reform movement of the late 18th century led by Pennsylvania Quakers invented the penitentiary: humane housing where convicted wrongdoers would go for a term to reflect on their sins and be penitent.
 
Starting at the Bottom
 Since then, the slow but steady increases in prison populations combined with declining public enthusiasm for rehabilitation efforts among more violent criminals. Prison terms, though varying widely in length for the same crimes even in adjoining counties, did remove the criminal from society. But in many cases the prisons became mere schools for crime.
And all this was complicated by the emergence of a substantial urban underclass, usually uneducated and often involved with drugs. For many of these convicts, who have rarely had stable families, steady employment or even basic reading skills, any prison programs are aimed more at providing basic habilitation than rehabilitation, Mr. Hartmann said. "If you're an illiterate drug addict who can't fill out a basic job application," he added, "it would seem very likely we would see you back in prison someday."
James Waite of Oklahoma's penal system stresses the expense of the current system. "Ninety-eight percent of all prisoners will be back on the street someday," he said. "If they don't go out any better prepared to face life, then we've just warehoused them for a time. And at our cost of about $15,000 a year per inmate, it would be cheaper to send them to college than keep them in here."
 
A Place to Sweat
 Most citizens would find even the nicest prison a discouraging place, an where everyone awakens, eats, works and sleeps at set times. Well-behaved inmates can earn better accommodations, moving from solitary cells to 100-man open dorm rooms, and jobs, from washing floors to filing papers.
But here at Vacaville, a combination of units built in the 60's and 80's, everyone swelters through the heat; when it's 90 outdoors, it's 110 degrees in the rooms. Bathrooms are open to full view. Prisoners can be stripped and searched before and after each visit, as can visitors who wait behind a steel barrier that warns: "Do Not Kiss Thru Bars."
Good inmates may receive four packages per year. Television is offered in day rooms, corrections officials say, primarily as an institutional tool to soak up inmates' idle time. Twice each night every room and cell is checked; if the guard can't see skin through the door, the inmate is awakened to prove his presence. There are gangs and violence, though less at newer institutions, where large groups cannot mingle.
 
Safer Than the Street?
 Then why isn't the threat of a prison sentence more of a deterrence to crime? "I think the average American would find such a life quite a deterrence," said Mr. Travisono, "But for many of these guys, prison is safer than the street. They get three square meals a day, a bed and free health care because that's what the laws set as humane."
Reuben Greenberg, chief of police in Charleston, S.C., suggested that there would be greater deterrence if first offenders were punished more certainly, though not necessarily more harshly. As he put it, "How fast would you learn to get your hand off a hot burner if it took a year to feel the pain?"
Many experts say that what's necessary is a range of sanctions. "Right now," says Barry Krisberg of the National Council on Crime and Delinquency, "we can give criminals an aspirin or a lobotomy." What's most important, he says, is more certainty of some other punishments, from community service and house arrest to intensive probation with daily check-ins.
Mr. Travisono said governors, not corrections officials, would have to lead the search for new methods of punishment. "They are the leaders of a state," he said. "They must involve prosecutors, judges, community groups. It's a bureaucratic reality that corrections works for the governor. When he or she says this is the budget, you don't try to outbudget your boss in public. Or you're not around anymore either."

HEADLINE: N.F.L. PLAYOFFS: The Conference Championships;
Lofton Brings Healing Touch

BYLINE: By MALCOLM MORAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ORCHARD PARK, N.Y., Jan. 17

 BODY:
As the events in the Persian Gulf developed Wednesday night, and Carlton Bailey, a linebacker for the Buffalo Bills, became concerned about his father, a chief warrant officer in the naval reserve stationed there, one of the two telephone calls Bailey received from a teammate came from James Lofton.
When Marv Levy, the coach of the Bills, was asked again this week to explain the influences that helped reduce the internal problems that characterized Buffalo's 1989 season and could have threatened the team's future, the first player he mentioned was James Lofton. 
 Less than a year and a half after he was released by the Los Angeles Raiders, Lofton, a wide receiver, will present his former team with a significant problem in the American Football Conference championship game this Sunday.
Although the 34-year-old Lofton's success in the Bills' playoff victory over Miami last Saturday provided the latest evidence that his skills have not eroded, his contributions have extended beyond statistical achievements since he joined Buffalo early in the 1989 season.
 
In His 13th Season
 And the numbers, by themselves, have already given him Hall of Fame-caliber credentials. Lofton is at the end of his 13th professional season, his second with the Bills after two with the Raiders and nine in Green Bay, seven of which were Pro Bowl seasons.
Lofton's 642 career receptions rank sixth in pro football history and third among active players, behind Art Monk of Washington and Ozzie Newsome of Cleveland. Lofton's 7 receptions in the playoff victory over the Dolphins last Saturday, for 149 yards, were the most in each category for a playoff game in his career.
His 174 yards in Buffalo's victory over Philadelphia on Dec. 2 was the fourth-highest total in his career, the most in six years, and increased his career total, now 11,963, beyond that of Don Maynard and into third place for career receiving yards. His 63-yard touchdown catch, 45 seconds into that game, was the 60th touchdown reception of his career and started the Bills toward a 24-0 first-quarter lead. The 71-yard catch that day was Lofton's longest in six years.
Less than 18 months ago, Lofton was considered an expendable part of a Raider offense that had grown to include Willie Gault, acquired in a trade with the Chicago Bears, and Mervyn Fernandez, a former most valuable player in the Canadian Football League. "I wasn't looked at as a backup," Lofton said. "I was either a starting receiver or nothing."
 
New Role for a Veteran
 Soon he was unemployed, considering a number of options that included the Bills and the Philadelphia Eagles. Nick Nicolau, a receivers coach who joined the Bills for the 1989 season, had held a similar job during Lofton's second season with the Raiders.
"Nick Nicolau knew him and liked him," Levy remembered. "We brought James in with a bunch of 22-, 23- and 24-year-olds. He outran all of them. We just wanted to see if he lost speed or lost movement, and he hadn't."
Once the Bills had their answer, Lofton had to accept a new role. His first game with Buffalo was the first of his professional career in which he was not a starter. He started just 2 of 11 games in 1989, and caught just eight passes. But his contribution to a tense atmosphere in the dressing room went beyond those statistics.
"I've been around worse, when it's physical, between players and player and coach," Lofton said. "It was settled before the season was over, but the articles hadn't finished coming out."
"I watched James when I was younger and he was with Green Bay," said Andre Reed, the wide receiver. "He was always, 'This guy is amazing.' You never thought he would lose a step.
"I worked out with him during the off-season," Reed said. "And the way he works out makes you want to be a better player."
 
Tight Security
 Bill Polian, the general manager and vice president of the Bills, said that the security force for the game had been doubled from 250 people to 500. Polian confirmed that the Federal Aviation Administration would not allow airplanes that carry advertisements to fly over the stadium. He said the Bills organization had asked for a ban on such flights long before the current global situation. The Bills increased security and banned the sale of beer for the playoff game against Miami as a result of a raucous celebration that followed the regular-season victory over the Dolphins on Dec. 23.

HEADLINE: Rhode Island Bank Inquiry

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I., Jan. 18

 BODY:
Gov. Bruce G. Sundlun urged on Thursday that an independent prosecutor be appointed to investigate Rhode Island's banking crisis.
"I feel it is dead wrong," he said, "to have multiple investigations." 
 The Governor did not disclose how the special prosecutor would be picked but said his decision was not an attempt to put pressure on the State Attorney General, James O'Neil, and legislative leaders to abandon their investigations.
There have been widespread reports that insiders at credit unions withdrew thousands of dollars from their institutions just before Mr. Sundlun closed 45 of them on Jan. 1 after the collapse of the state's private bank insurance system.
Fifteen institutions, with about $1 billion in deposits, remain closed because they cannot obtain Federal deposit insurance.
Under the Governor's bailout plan, closed banks and credit unions will be merged into a new state agency, the Depositors Economic Protection Corporation, which would make payouts to depositors. Depositors would receive up to $12,500 in cash immediately but would have to wait as long as four years for the rest of their money, up to $100,000.

HEADLINE: About New York;
In a Dark World, A Diverse Few Pray for Peace

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
At 3:30 A.M. yesterday, a cool breeze caressed a nearly empty Amsterdam Avenue in front of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. A newspaper truck rumbled past. A man carrying a mountain of plastic bags stumbled toward tomorrow.
The neo-Gothic towers of one of the world's largest churches loomed against wispy white clouds high in the violet sky. It was 11:30 A.M. in Iraq. Inside the vast and nearly dark cathedral, two women sat alone holding candles. They have been staying here in the deadest part of the night since Sunday, praying for peace. Since early evening Wednesday, they and half a hundred other vigilants could no longer pray that there would be no war. 
 "Peace be with you," Kristin Bergfeld, owner of a cleaning services company, said by way of greeting.
Ms. Bergfeld recalled Wednesday evening. She held up the tiny, tiny remnant of a candle that she had been burning when war exploded. "I will always have this," she said with palpable intensity. "I will always, always have this."
The vigil is held around the "Peace Altar" made by the late woodworking genius George Nakashima. It is carved from a 125-foot English walnut tree, perhaps 300 years old. A small bouquet of white carnations and a red table rested on the huge altar.
New York in times of national crisis is very much like New York at any other time. People walk straight ahead through difficult lives, trying not to catch the eye of strangers. They look for something interesting but are sure they have seen it all before. A demonstration in Times Square, no matter the purpose, is but another inconvenience.
 But judging by call-in shows, talk in cafes and barbershops, the unexpected smiles, there is some pleasure even in this hopelessly blase metropolis that Uncle Sam is standing tall in a strange and dangerous conflict. Or at least that, so far, few Americans have been casualties.
But in the liberal churches grave doubts persist. At the Episcopal cathedral, Islamic religious leaders have been invited to pray for peace. At the Community Church of New York, a Unitarian Universalist congregation, body bags were placed on the front steps in dramatic protest. The impressive thing about the prayer vigil is that it is so unimpressive. Individuals come quietly as pilgrims seeking some measure of peace.
Over the course of the vigil at St. John the Divine, there was a Vietnam veteran in a three-piece suit whose son is somewhere in the Persian Gulf. There at the same time was a woman who had been thrilled to get a picture in the mail of her best friend's fiance. He too is in the Gulf. The two held hands, sobbing inconsolably.
Pilgrims have included an executive who had been in Baghdad two days before. A Nicaraguan who had lived through that nation's bloodbath. A little boy who said God lived in the green balloon he carried. A group of young women formed a circle and danced.
There have been a 30-year-old investment banker and an unemployed man dying of AIDS who lives in a single-room-occupancy hotel. On Wednesday night, there were people who had wandered the city looking for an open church.
"You can bring horrible dreams here and be comforted," said a poet, writer and actor ("what New Yorkers do"), Seanan Forbes, the other woman praying.
Around 4 A.M., Lewis S. Payne, a social worker, padded in. As much as he disagreed with Washington's attack, he was now enraged at Iraq for hitting Israel. "I found myself really angry last night," he said. "I actually felt a rage." He stepped into a corner and put on Zen Buddhist robes. He joined with the women to sing hymns, then settled onto the prayer mat and pillow that he had brought. He crossed his legs. He expressed despair at the seemingly inexorable pace of events.
"It's as though we're playing out a dream and everybody knows the scenario," Mr. Payne said. "The whole thing is an absurdity."
Time passed. Every so often, security men would saunter past. A woman who had brought her cat in a box slept in the choir seats. A drunk staggered here and there. The vigilants talked and prayed and made paper cranes, a symbol of peace. They recited a G. K. Chesterton poem in unison, "Our earthly rulers falter, our people drift and die."
Ms. Forbes left after finishing her second consoling letter to "Any Service Member." Outside, birds began to chirp and dawn teased the stained glass. Mr. Payne suggested that he and Ms. Bergfeld pray.
"Forgive us, forgive us for this madness we bring on ourselves," he said through tears. Then they hugged, two human beings alone with their hopes, fears and conceptions of God.
Morning traffic drowned out New York's birds. It was 3:05 P.M. in Iraq.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Public Opinion;
Approval of Bush Soars

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. KAGAY

 BODY:
President Bush's job approval rating has sharply increased in the past week, reaching the highest level measured for an American President in the last 30 years, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
Eighty-six percent of 544 adults interviewed Thursday evening -- one day after the war against Iraq began and primarily after it was reported that Iraq had attacked Israel -- said they approved of the way Mr. Bush was handling his job as President, while 10 percent disapproved and 4 percent had no opinion. 
 The approval rating was 20 percentage points higher than in a Times/CBS News Poll taken Jan. 11-13, before the hostilities. In the past such striking shifts have occurred at the outset of other international conflicts, as Americans rallied in support of flag and country, their armed forces overseas and their Commander in Chief.
Mr. Bush's rating was the highest recorded for any President since John F. Kennedy received 83 percent approval in a Gallup Poll in May 1961 after another military operation, the unsuccessful attempt to liberate Cuba in the Bay of Pigs invasion.
The new nationwide telephone poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points, and polls completed in just one day can be subject to additional error.
Over the past week, an even greater movement occurred in public opinion about the desirability of starting military action against Iraq. In the latest poll, 79 percent of the respondents said the United States "did the right thing in starting military actions against Iraq," while last weekend, before the war, only 47 percent said the United States "should start military actions against Iraq" if it did not withdraw its troops from Kuwait by Jan. 15.
Only 16 percent now say the United States should "have waited longer to see if the trade embargo and other economic sanctions worked," whereas last weekend, before the war, 46 percent expressed a preference for giving sanctions more time to produce results.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Off Despite Crisis; Technical Factors Aid Slide

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar closed mostly lower yesterday although war raged in the Middle East, a crisis that would normally draw investors to the safety of the United States currency.
Reports of early successes by the United States-led forces fighting to oust Iraq from Kuwait had already pushed the dollar down, and technical factors accelerated the slide yesterday, traders said. 
 "The market was acting as though the war had ended, not that it started," said Rayelle Weber Tyler of International Treasury Consulting.
The dollar closed yesterday at 1.4985 German marks, down from 1.5080 marks Thursday. It finished slightly higher, however, against the Japanese currency, at 132.50 Japanese yen, up from 132.35 yen.
 
Feeble Midday Rally
 The dollar managed a feeble rally around midday when Defense Minister Moshe Arens of Israel spoke of retaliating for Iraq's missile attack on Israel. Even reports of new missile attacks, which were later proved false, failed to help the dollar.
Ms. Tyler said dollar sentiment has been bearish since last year because of the weak United States economy. The prospect of war changed the mood, but the buying evaporated when fighting actually broke out. Others traders called it a classic case of "buy on the rumor, sell on the news."
The British pound rose yesterday to $1.9490 from $1.9330 Thursday. The dollar closed at 1.2565 Swiss francs, down from 1.2690 in the previous session.
Against the Canadian currency, the dollar closed at $1.1585 (Canadian), down from $1.1590 (Canadian) Thursday. Against the French franc, the dollar closed at 5.0945 francs, down from Thursday's 5.1190 francs.

HEADLINE: Modest Late Rally Lifts Treasuries

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
A modest late rally lifted prices of long-term Treasury securities yesterday. The market had marked time earlier waiting for bond traders to convert some of their huge gains of the previous session into cash. But dealers said no significant profit taking materialized.
One reason, dealers said, was the sharp drop in crude oil prices to below the level that prevailed before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. This diminished fears of inflation, the bane of the fixed-income market. 
 Another big reason for the lack of selling in the Treasury debt market was the plunge in the key interbank lending rate after the Federal Reserve had moved to drain reserves from the banking system.
 
 Heavy Selling in Tokyo
 "What contributed heavily to the market's firmness was its failure to emulate the sharp losses in our Treasury bonds overnight in Tokyo," said William V. Sullivan Jr., senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "News that Iraqi missiles had hit Israel came after our market closed, but caused heavy selling of our Treasury bonds in Tokyo. The selling there erased half the two-point gain in the long bond earlier in New York."
But the loss in Tokyo was quickly recouped at the opening in New York. In late trading, the Treasury benchmark long bonds, the 8.75 percent issue maturing in August 2020, were offered at 106 13/32, up 6/32 on the day, as the yield dipped to 8.17 percent, from 8.18 percent the day before.
Thursday, widespread belief that the war would end quickly and successfully sent the price of the long bond soaring over two points, or $20 for each $1,000 of face value, and its yield tumbling to 8.18 percent from 8.39 percent. A week ago the long bond's yield was 8.35 percent.
 
Auctions Next Week

On Wednesday, the Treasury plans to auction $12.5 billion of new two-year notes, and on Thursday $9 billion of new five-year notes. The two-year notes traded on a when-issued basis to yield 7.11 percent, down from 7.15 percent the day before, while the yield on the five-year notes slipped to 7.35 percent from 7.68 percent on the same basis.
The credit market was fascinated by the odd behavior of the market in Federal funds. The funds rate is considered the basic cost of credit because that is what banks charge each other for temporary loans.
According to dealers, the funds began trading at 6.5 percent, or a quarter-point below what is now perceived as the Federal Reserve's target for this interest cost. Just before noon, Eastern time, the Fed moved to drain reserves from the banking system over the weekend.
Instead of bolstering the funds rate, the draining of reserves was quickly followed by a drop in the rate to as low as 4.5 percent. The funds rate then snapped back to 5 percent and traded at 6 percent just before the close.
 
Linked to Holiday
 Some dealers said the odd moves in the funds rate reflected the ample reserves in the banking system that resulted from the Fed's cut in reserve requirements last month, as well as the fact that banks were still reluctant lenders.
Other dealers linked the Fed's action to the observance of the holiday for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on Monday. While the Federal Reserve will be closed Monday, primary dealers in Treasury securities and many banks will be open, along with most brokerage houses.
In any event, the gyrations in the funds rate had no impact on bill rates, which are normally the debt issues most sensitive to changes in the funds rate. The discount rate on 90-day Treasury bills dipped two basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 6.08 percent; six-month bills dropped nine basis points, to 6.18 percent, and the one-year bills lost four basis points, at 6.22 percent.

HEADLINE: Teacher Corps May Feel Weight Of New York City Budget Crisis

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW

 BODY:
The first teacher-recruits in a new national program to help troubled schools have come to New York City and met the enemy, but it's not truancy, or poverty, or drugs or violence. It's a budget crisis.
And unless the Board of Education and the teachers' union can come up with a foolproof fiscal strategy to avoid as many as 4,000 layoffs, these recruits, with the least seniority, will be among the first to go at the end of the month. 
 "It's very disheartening and ironic," said Jessica Larntz, who joined the Teach for America program out of Stanford University. "I saw Teach for America as very idealistic, a way to give something back to society."
"We knew we'd be assigned to districts with high teacher turnover because of poverty, crime, drugs and single-parent families," added the 23-year-old native of St. Paul. "It's been a tough experience, and thekids have sometimes been difficult to control, but in mid-October, I made my decision to stick this out. Now, it's sad to have it taken away after so many people put so much time into it. But I guess nobody could do anything about the money."
 
Welcome to New York
 Ms. Larntz is one of about 155 recent graduates from some of America's best colleges who came here in September, one of nearly 500 young people nationwide who volunteered for the Peace Corps-like program. Energetic and idealistic, their goal was to spend two years in the country's toughest urban or rural districts.
But their arrival here coincided with a worsening of the city's financial problems and a nationwide recession, and now hope has given way to disillusionment.
Jennifer Copaken, a 22-year-old Harvard University graduate who moved from her home in Potomac, Md., to teach in Queens, said: "The hardest thing is how it vacillates from day to day. It's very difficult to stay motivated."
"One day, people say the wage deferrals or furloughs could go through and our jobs could be saved," she added. "Other days, we're told we might be transferred to Oakland."
 
When Does the Ax Fall?
 Principals at schools throughout the city know that they may have to dismiss hundreds of teachers with the least seniority to help reduce New York's budget deficit by slashing $90 million from this year's schools allocation. Most or all of the dismissals could be rescinded within the next two weeks, if an agreement is reached between the board and unions representing teachers and other school workers to achieve the cuts by deferring school employees' pay, rather than laying off workers.
But, if layoffs are required, the vast majority of these young teachers will be out of a job on Feb. 1. And, because of their junior status as Board of Education employees and the molasses-like progress of the budget negotiations, they may only learn their fate a few days before that deadline.
 
'A Pretty Bad Blow'
 And even if the board resolves its immediate crisis without layoffs, these young teachers' jobs are still vulnerable because of job cutbacks that are likely to result from state budget cuts and about $400 million in proposed reductions in Board of Education financing included in the city's fiscal 1992 budget plan presented Wednesday by Mayor David N. Dinkins.
"It's a pretty bad blow," said Jackie Graves, a Williams College graduate who is teaching at Public School 65 in the Bronx. "If it happened, I don't think I could move. I've got an apartment with a lease that I probably couldn't get out of."
Suzanne Muchin, a teacher at Intermediate School 139 in the South Bronx, added: "We all chose New York City because of the teacher shortage here. We thought we were doing New York a favor."
Most teachers in the program are paid $26,500 a year.
Curtis Etherly and Timothy Knowles, the program's regional directors, said at two emergency meetings for local corps members in the last two weeks that they were trying to line up replacement jobs in Los Angeles, New Orleans and Oakland, and subsidized training for members who wanted to stay in New York.
But Mr. Etherly acknowledged that many would be "fending for themselves," and that the threat of layoffs in many cities "could not have come at a worse time, in the middle of a school year, and when financial problems are affecting New York and other cities."
Many corps teachers say that it would be extremely disruptive to have to move next month, and that their experience has soured them on the idea of remaining with the program, even though Mr. Etherly said that they would have "guaranteed placements" next fall at the location of their choice.
"If any of our members are cut, it would be a real shame and very shortsighted," said Wendy Kopp, the 23-year-old founder of Teach for America.
The program was started last year, and its first recruits were dispersed to classrooms around the country in September. Ms. Kopp's idea was that intelligent, dedicated college graduates who were not education majors would take a crash teacher-training course and spend two years teaching as a form of public service.
Ms. Kopp and her assistants recruited prospective teachers at more than 100 colleges, raised more than $2 million from corporations and foundations and convinced school systems to hire corps members even though they lack education degrees or teacher certification.
"Our corps is exactly what New York City needs -- young, energetic teachers," she added at a meeting last week to prepare New York corps members for the possibility of layoffs.
Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez seemed to concur, at least last year, when he said: "Without programs like this, we are never going to resolve pipeline issues related to attracting the very best and brightest to our profession."

HEADLINE: Alcoa Posts $140.4 Million Quarterly Loss

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
The Aluminum Company of America, stung by lower aluminum prices and $275 million in reductions to after-tax income, yesterday reported a $140.4 million loss for the fourth quarter. The company had net income of $164.7 million, or $1.88 a share, in the quarter in 1989.
The company said that excluding the charges, fourth-quarter earnings were $134.6 million. Revenues fell slightly, to $2.75 billion, from $2.76 billion in the quarter in 1989. 
 Alcoa, the nation's largest aluminum producer, said the reductions to income included a $142 million write-off of mostly non-aluminum businesses, but the company did not specify the operations involved.
 
 Environmental Costs
 An additional $90 million charge was related to the costs of cleaning up environmental problems at United States plants. The company said that nearly all of its domestic plant sites would be affected.
Also, there was a $43 million charge for an expected loss from the sale of the Astech division of Alcoa Composites Inc., a subsidiary. Astech, formerly a part of TRW Inc., was acquired by Alcoa in 1986 and was put up for sale a year ago.
For the year, Alcoa earned $295.2 million, or $3.40 a share, compared with record earnings in 1989 of $944.9 million, or $10.67 a share. Total revenue for the year slipped to $10.87 billion from $11.16 billion in 1989.
The Pittsburgh-based company has de-emphasizsed its non-aluminum operations in recent years under its chairman, Paul H. O'Neill. It sold several businesses in plastics and in composite materials, choosing instead to focus on aluminum. Aerospace and industrial products now account for 28 percent of revenue.
 
Falling Prices
 But aluminum ingot prices have fallen in the last year, hurting earnings. The price of aluminum averaged about 75 cents a pound in 1990, compared with about 89 cents in 1989. Also, results of Brazilian operations plunged because of actions by the Government there to curb inflation. Earnings from Brazil dropped to less than $1 million in 1990 from $104 million in 1989, the company said.
Despite the fourth-quarter loss, analysts said that Alcoa's alumunim business remained firm regardless of a downturn in the economy. Analysts also said that the supply and demand patterns in the industry were in balance and that Alcoa would likely fare well, unless the price of aluminum eroded further.
In trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Alcoa shares rose $1.25 each, to $59.75.

HEADLINE: Nissan Plans New Factory For Engines in Tennessee

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 18

 BODY:
The Nissan Motor Company said today that it planned to build a second plant in the United States that would make automobile engines, enabling the company to increase the domestic content of its American-assembled cars.
Nissan, Japan's second-largest auto maker, plans to spend more than $500 million on the new plant, which will be in Decherd, Tenn. Decherd is about 60 miles from Smyrna, Tenn., where Nissan makes subcompact cars and small pickup trucks.
With tensions rising again between Washington and Tokyo over Japan's huge trade surplus, Nissan's move may help blunt criticism that the company has been slow to increase the domestic content of the vehicles it assembles in this country. Domestic content covers not only components like engines and transmissions, but also all other aspects of a manufacturing operation from the labor force to the source of the food served in the employee cafeteria.
 
 Company's View of U.S. Role

The announcement also strengthens Nissan's argument that the company is adding jobs and increasing the technical sophistication of its American operations. 
 Nissan's Smyrna plant is not unionized. A spokesman for the United Automobile Workers said the union "consistently has welcomed the creation of jobs in the U.S. by those who sell extensively in the U.S. market."
While there are clear political advantages to adding American plants, such moves can end up hurting Japanese car makers financially, because of Federal rules on calculating the corporate average fuel economy for a company's output of vehicles.
The rules classify vehicles with less than 75 percent domestic content as imports. Separate calculations are made for an auto maker's domestically made and foreign-made fleets, but each category must meet the standard of a fleet average of at least 27.5 miles a gallon. Using more American-made components could shift some of Nissan's output from the import to the domestic category, altering the mix of higher-mileage and lower-mileage vehicles in each category and possibly subjecting the company to stiff Federal penalties for not meeting the mileage standard.
 
Part of Long-Range Plan
 "This new plant is part of our long-range plan to increase the localization of parts in the United States and reduce imports from Japan," said Jerry L. Benefield, president and chief executive officer of Nissan's American manufacturing arm.
People familiar with Nissan's operations said executives had not intended to announce plans for the new plant for several weeks. But the news began to leak out in Japan, possibly in connection with trade talks going on in Tokyo between the American and Japanese Governments.
The new plant will be highly automated, Nissan executives said, employing 500 workers who will produce 300,000 engines a year. Production is scheduled to begin in early 1996.
"Engines are one of the heaviest components, so they are very costly to bring over from Japan," said Ron Harbour, an automotive manufacturing consultant in Troy, Mich. "But they are also the most critical component, so control of quality is very critical. That may have been one reason Nissan waited this long to set up engine production in U.S."
 
Possible Link to Other Plant
 Nissan executives would not say whether the plant's engines would go into vehicles made in Smyrna, where the company built about 96,000 Sentra subcompact cars and 139,000 light trucks last year.
Nissan now imports the engines in many of those vehicles from Japan and Mexico. But four-cylinder engines for the Sentra are assembled in the Smyrna plant from parts imported from Mexico and Japan.
Nissan's announcement, which caught some industry analysts and rival automobile executives by surprise, comes seven weeks after the Toyota Motor Corporation said it would double the capacity of its assembly plant in Georgetown, Ky.

HEADLINE: Japan's Homeless: Seen Yet Ignored

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: YOKOHAMA, Japan

 BODY:
In a silent, dark alley near piers that bustle during the day, a few small piles of cardboard and blankets are all that keep the late-night chill from 10 sleeping men, a handful of the scores of homeless vagrants of this otherwise prosperous port.
"I chose this way of life myself, no one chose it for me," said Yuji Inoue, a grizzled 64-year-old unemployed construction worker, stirring momentarily for a cigarette and some conversation. "The people who come by and see me, well, no one is hostile. But nobody's giving me money either." 
 Like the United States and Europe, Japan is scarred by homelessness created by the stresses of advanced development. But the phenomenon is little discussed in a society that emphasizes its economic triumphs rather than those the miracle has trampled or left behind.
Census takers leave it up to local officials to give out the numbers of the homeless, and most decline to do so. The National Police Agency also refuses to divulge its estimates.
 
Becoming Ordinary
 Yet Japanese have become accustomed to the sight of derelicts camped in tunnels, under highways and inside train stations in Tokyo, Yokohama and Osaka. No one knows how many there are, but perhaps thousands of people may live that way part of the time.
Like their American counterparts, many suffer from alcoholism and mental illness, raising questions about how to help them while respecting their civil rights. As in the United States, the police here say they cannot sweep them from the streets unless they disrupt traffic or are disorderly.
But in contrast with the United States and some European countries, Japan has not been emptying its mental institutions into the streets. Last June, 336,271 patients were counted in mental hospitals, nearly twice as many as 25 years ago.
Some experts say more Japanese homeless are from ethnic minorities than the population at large. The minorities here include Koreans and other foreign nationalities and the descendants of the Burakumin, an ancient Untouchable-like lower class, but there are no statistics.
And unlike the United States, Japan is not faced with large numbers of entire families without homes, or people with jobs who cannot find housing. Drugs are not a major problem, but drinking and gambling are epidemic.
 
Lining Up for Jobs
 Generally, the homeless in Japan's major cities live in and near the areas where large populations of laborers reside in flophouses and line up in the morning for part-time construction jobs, usually at shape-ups run by organized crime. One such neighborhood in Yokohama is Kotobukicho, which means, roughly, town of congratulations for a long life.
"This area is a showcase of Japan's problems," said the Rev. Hidetoshi Watanabe, a local pastor. "There's worker exploitation, old men isolated from their families, discrimination against foreigners, minorities, the mentally and physically disabled -- and of course alcoholism."
Several local groups in Yokohama seek to help the homeless as well as the larger group of perhaps 7,000, most of them men, who live in squalid Kotobukicho, a trash-strewn corner of the downtown area where the streets are often filled with drunken and gambling vagrants.
Before it was razed in the American bombings of World War II, the neighborhood of Kotobukicho was a prosperous place of shops and homes. When it was rebuilt, the city chose it for dozens of cheap hotels to house laborers doing construction at the harbor and nearby American navy base.
 
Many Refuse Aid
 Today the people who work with the residents here estimate that half the derelict population spends part of the year in the streets, often when they are out of work or want to sleep off drinking bouts. Many are eligible for welfare or disability payments but choose not to accept.
"It may be an oversimplification, but I think most of the homeless are there because they want to enjoy their freedom," said Yoshinori Shibuya, a senior official in the Yokohama social welfare bureau. "We urge them to accept welfare payments or to go the hospital, but 80 percent refuse."
Census takers found 191 homeless people in Yokohama last October, but social workers think the number at its peak in the summer is twice that. That is a small number, perhaps, for a city of three million but startling because of the concentration of the homeless at downtown parks and public buildings.
Another peak time for the homeless is the New Year's period, when construction work is generally shut down for the holiday, cutting off the income for workers. At this time, Yokohama, like Tokyo and Osaka, puts up a temporary shelter -- in this case, for 200 people, in a small city park.
"If I earned a little more, I could move to a high-class hotel," said Masateru Nakano, a longtime resident, shrugging his shoulders. "But when I get money, I spend it on my women and on drinking, so there are a lot of times when I have to sleep on the street. Life isn't so easy for me."
 
No-Win Situation
 City officials say they are criticized by groups seeking to help the homeless for not doing enough and by other Yokohama residents for doing too much, thereby supposedly making it too easy to be homeless.
Yokohama spends $2 million a year for services in Kotobukicho, including running two large centers with indoor lounges, television rooms, health clinics, bathing facilities and eating areas. The city also pays welfare or disability grants to more than 2,200 residents of the area.
On a recent afternoon at one shelter, 40 men in tattered clothing were slouching in chairs, watching spangle-clad iceskaters on television. Elsewhere, men were using the laundry rooms and bathing areas, and some were just sleeping in corners.
Outside, knots of men stood at illegal gambling dens, drinking, stamping their feet in the cold and scanning pages of listings of boat races, horse races and other events. Residents say Kotobukicho has several offices of yakuza, or organized crime syndicates, that run gambling or labor operations.
The urgency of city efforts to get people off the streets deepened in 1983, when some junior high school students threw rocks and assaulted and beat some homeless people, killing three. In Kotobukicho, volunteers now patrol the homeless areas twice a week in the winter and once a month at other times.
 
'A Shameful Thing'
 Their aim is simply to make sure they are all right, offering blankets and encouraging them to sign up for welfare, unemployment or disability grants.
"We are careful not to become too familiar with the people we help because it's a shameful thing for them," said Yoh Nonomura, a volunteer. "They get annoyed even if we ask them their names. They generally want to be left alone."
Last week, dozens of residents lined up at the city-sponsored temporary shelters for free steaming bowls of rice and vegetables distributed by the Kabukicho Day Laborers Union. That evening, volunteers spread out with food and blankets in the streets and parks.
One volunteer was Masaaki Kagoshima, a bearded and ponytailed organizer specializing in helping the conditions of Koreans, Filipinos, Bangladeshis and other foreign laborers who make up a part of the homeless.
"The problems in this area are the inevitable product of a huge and highly developed consumer society," Mr. Kagosima said. "Kotobukicho is really a kind of third world society concentrated within Japan."
Late at night, Mr. Kagoshima drove alone in his van with two visitors to the first building near the docks, where Mr. Inoue was sleeping with 10 friends. He said he and the others usually gathered up their blankets at the end of each night and hid them safely out of sight during the day.
 
'I Didn't Want to Beg'
 "If I went to the shelter at night, my things would be stolen," he said, gesturing to the bedding, clothes and pillow piled in a corner. "When I started this way of life seven years ago, I didn't want to beg for help from the government. I just don't like to beg for help."
The next stop was a park at City Hall, where Mr. Kagoshima said hello to a man and a woman underneath blankets with their dog. "Some people can't stay in the hotels because they don't allow dogs," Mr. Kagoshima said. He asked the couple whether they needed blankets, and they said no.
At the Kannae train station, 20 men were lying in blankets along an indoor tunnel as Mr. Kagoshima and other volunteers handed out plastic bowls of hot soup and small Japanese oranges. He placed a flier about a meeting the next day on a sleeping man's back, using an orange as a paperweight.
Nearby, Yoshiaki Nakamura, a 55-year-old tunnel resident with wavy gray hair, was gulping onion soup. "I'm satisfied with my way of life," he said, "and I don't think of myself as an unlucky person.," He said he earned about $12 a day from picking up cardboard from trash cans and selling it to recyclers.
Among Yokohama welfare officials, homelessness is one of many problems faced by Japan today, particularly the problems of old people and handicapped generally. "Of course, homelessness is a vital issue," Mr. Shibuya said. "But I wouldn't give it more priority than other problems we face."
But for Mr. Kagoshima, the issue of homelessness symbolizes the need for Japanese to face up to the indifference, if not antagonism, toward people with physical and mental handicaps. "If we don't overcome this hostility," he said, "Japan will become two worlds talking past each other."

HEADLINE: Trade Gap Narrowed in November

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit fell 12 percent in November, to $9.7 billion, the Commerce Department reported today, as the weakening economy dampened demand for oil and other imports.
Even though oil prices were still rising during the month, the nation's petroleum bill fell by 13 percent, the largest drop in at least three years, as volume fell by 14 percent. Industry, motorists and other users cut back their purchases as the higher prices ate into their buying power. 
 "With a slowing economy, this shows that we've adjusted to higher prices," said Stephen Cooney, the director of international investment at the National Association of Manufacturers.
A United States success in the war in the Persian Gulf that started two days ago, he added, "should mean no long-term effect on oil prices."
 
A Widespread Decline

Virtually all other major categories of imports declined as well, including automobiles, which had risen nearly 40 percent in October.
The November trade shortfall -- the excess of imports over exports -- was below a revised deficit of $10.99 billion for October, originally reported at $11.61 billion.
The report showed that total merchandise imports fell 6 percent, to $43.32 billion. Exports were also off, but by a lesser amount, 4 percent, to $33.62 billion.
"The big import decline confirms a recession," said David Rolley, a senior economist at DRI/MCGraw Hill. He predicted a "further substantial decline" in imports in coming months as the economy continues to fall.
Next Friday, when the Government issues its first report on output in the fourth quarter of 1990, many economists expect it to show an annual rate of decline of around 3 to 3.5 percent. Such a drop would follow nearly eight years of steady growth, a period of expansion second only to the record 106 months of growth during the Vietnam War buildup of the 1960's.
Although exports slackened during November, foreign sales -- now serving as one of the main economic props -- were at their third-highest level on record. Many economists described the decline in exports as a normal monthly fluctuation.
Still, just about every major category of exports fell, with declines of around $200 million each in computers, chemicals and electrical and specialized machinery. Food was among the few buoyant export sectors.
 
Decline in Growth

Michael R. Darby, Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs, pointed out that export growth has actually been falling during the last three years, but stressed that exports still remain an important source of general economic growth, helped by the dollar's decline during 1990.
The dollar's exchange rate -- near postwar lows against other major currencies -- makes United States products more competitive by lowering their prices in other currencies.
According to Mr. Darby's calculations, exports were rising at a rate of 30 percent in 1988, 13 percent in 1989 and 8 percent in the first 10 months of 1990.
Ian A. MacKinnon, senior vice president for the Vanguard Group of Investment Companies in Valley Forge, Pa., said the deterioration in the deficit since the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq was almost entirely attributable to the jump in oil prices after the invasion.
He predicted that if the dollar continues about where it is now, "We believe the country will be in a position of trade surplus in two years."
 
 Record Set in 1987
 The trade deficit has been narrowing since 1987, when it rose to a record $152 billion. In 1989 the gap declined to $109.40 billion, from $118.53 billion in 1988. The annual rate for the first 11 months of 1990 was $103.58 billion.
Two-thirds of the November drop in imports was accounted for by petroleum. The volume of oil imports was off 14 percent, to 214 million barrels, from 249 million in Octoer. Volume had declined 2 percent in October after rising sharply in September.
The average price for a barrel of oil imported in November was $29.44, or 40 cents more than in October and $10.30 a barrel more than the average price in the first 10 months of 1990.
The price of oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed today at $19.25.
The bilateral deficits with most trading partners declined in November. The gap with Japan narrowed to $3.79 billion, from $4.45 billion in October.
The second-highest deficit in November was with China, which has sharply expanded its exports of textiles, toys and other products in recent years. The deficit with China eased to $1.078 billion, from $1.175 billion in October, and it just nosed out Canada. The deficit with Canada stood at $1.070 billion, compared with $1.354 billion in October.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Iraq;
RAIDS SAID TO CUT POWER IN BAGHDAD

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18

 BODY:
Sketchy reports from Western news agencies and television correspondents suggest that the Iraqi capital has lost its electricity and telephone service and is suffering a severe shortage of water.
A third day of bombardment and the wail of air raid sirens have reportedly sent thousands more civilians fleeing for the countryside and other Iraqi cities. 
Most Baghdad residents have stayed indoors, using candles for light, since the United States began its military campaign Wednesday night. Food in freezers and refrigerators has spoiled, according to Reuters news agency reports, and residents are described as worried about food shortages.
In one of the few news dispatches from Baghdad, Maamoun Youssef, an Iraqi who has reported for over a decade for Reuters, painted a bleak picture of a ghost town of closed markets, shops and restaurants, with only a few militiamen and civilians on the streets. Most filling stations are closed but drivers have flocked to those with hand-operated pumps, he said. Mr. Youssef, operating under restrictions placed on journalists by the Iraqi authorities, described civilians praying "for the safety of their families as bombs shake homes and rattle windows."
 
Damage Hard to Assess
 Since the attacks began, President Bush and his military advisers have said key strategic and military sites in Baghdad are being bombed with pinpoint accuracy, maintaining that civilian targets have been scrupulously avoided. But neither official American statements nor sketchy information from Iraq provide a detailed picture of the damage or the impact on Iraq's civilian population.
Normal communication to the Iraqi capital has been cut; the authorities imposed censorship rules today on the few remaining foreign correspondents and on foreign news agencies. Monitoring of official statements on Baghdad Radio and from the Iraqi News Agency were left as the the main source of news.
According to the agencies involved, 10 foreign journalists from Cable News Network, the Associated Press and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation left Baghdad today in a four-car convoy to Jordan. Three CNN correspondents stayed despite the impossiblity of communication. During the war with Iran, Iraq resricted reporting of sensitive strategic and military data, particularly reports of attacks on Baghdad.
The Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, made no public statements today, and there was no report on Iraq's state-controlled media of his activities. But at a briefing at the Pentagon, Rear Adm. John McConnell, director of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that the United States believed that Mr. Hussein "is maintaining control over all elements of his armed forces."
 
Futility of Assessment
 Arab diplomats in contact with the Baghdad Government believe that Mr. Hussein will keep a low profile during the air attacks and wait to fight back from a position of strength if the war shifts to the ground.
Senior Administration officials say they are baffled by Mr. Hussein's intentions. "We've stopped trying to figure out his thinking," one senior official said.
Part of the difficulty for these officials is that there are few people who know him well, and those who do are reluctant to speak. Even Iraqi exiles who have long known Mr. Hussein acknowledge that they cannot predict his next move.
"Maybe he is out of his mind or crazy or maybe he'd like to die as a hero," said Hani al-Fekaiki, who served as a member of Iraq's ruling Revolutionary Command Council in the brief Baath Party rule in 1963. He said he first met Mr. Hussein in prison in 1958. "I'm beginning to think he will keep fighting no matter what the result will be," Mr. al-Fekaiki said. "Anyone in his place should have withdrawn two weeks ago. I just don't know. What I do know is that we, the Iraqi people, will never forgive the United States for bombing Iraq. You supported Saddam and now when you get cross with him you are asking our people to pay the price."
 
Echoes of Enemy Heard
 In recent weeks Mr. Hussein, a secularist, has increasingly borrowed the messianic language of his late enemy, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran. Mr. Hussein's speech on Thursday, his only public comment since the assault, was filled with religious imagery, portraying Mr. Bush as Satan and the Iraqi people as "the descendants of prophets and believers." In place of hailing Iraq's military might and denouncing Americans as lacking the will to fight, he presented himself as a victim of external treachery and fatalistically called on God to bring him victory.
One indication of Mr. Hussein's disdain for surrender came today from the Baghdad Radio, which said that attacking forces would face a long, bloody war. Another came from Saadi Mehdi Saleh, the Speaker of Iraq's Parliament, who described steps to defend Baghdad. In remarks quoted by the Baghdad Radio, he said that hundreds of thousands of weapons had been distributed to the people of Baghdad, turning the capital into "a jungle of fighters and trenches."
The Baghdad Radio also broadcast military reports that, like its communiques in the war with Iran, included claims of Iraqi successes.
In one communique, Iraq asserted that it shot down 22 allied aircraft Friday afternoon, saying this brought to 94 the number shot down since the war began. The allied command said seven aircraft had been shot down: three American, two British and one each from Italy and Kuwait.
 
'Wailing of Its Daughter'
 Iraq's confirmation of its missile strike on Israel came from over the official radio about eight hours after the attack. Iraq struck "political, economic and scientific targets" in "the criminal Zionist entity with long-range missiles to avenge the suffering of the Arab and Muslim people," the radio said. "Let the United States hear the wailing of its daughter implanted in the heart of the Arab homeland," the radio dispatch said.
Iraq also asserted on its radio today that Israel sent 64 planes to join the multinational force in Saudi Arabia, the home of Islam's holiest shrines, a claim that Saudi authorities swiftly denied. Shortly after the first American troops landed in Saudi Arabia last August, Iraq charged that Israeli pilots had painted their planes like American aircraft.
The Iraqi Information Minister, Latif Nassif al-Jassem, a close associate of Mr. Hussein, told foreign journalists in Baghdad on Friday that Iraq had captured American pilots shot down in air raids. When he was asked by Peter Arnett of CNN, who remains in Baghdad, the Minister said that the pilots would be shown to journalists.
In a briefing at the Pentagon today, Lieut. Gen. Thomas Kelly, the director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that seven American pilots are listed as missing but "We know of no American prisoners of war at all."

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Turkey;
U.S. IS SAID TO USE TURKISH AIR BASES

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, Jan. 18

 BODY:
Using Turkish bases to open a second front in the air war against Iraq, United States planes began bombing runs on Iraqi military targets today, foreign diplomats here said.
The American raids on northwestern Iraq were said to have come with the Turkish Government's blessing, a decision of supreme delicacy for this Muslim country where opposition leaders, news commentators and many ordinary Turks warned that they were being dragged unwisely into a war against an Arab neighbor. 
 So sensitive was Turkey's reported approval of air strikes that both the Government and the United States Embassy refused to acknowledge that they had occurred. Foreign Ministry spokesmen issued a statement confirming that 27 warplanes had taken off this morning in the early hours, but added that the flight was "purely for night training."
Non-American diplomats said, however, that the planes, an assortment of fighters and bombers, had struck at targets in northwestern Iraq, some after refueling at the eastern Turkish city of Batman. They then returned three hours later the Incirlik Air Base near the southern city of Adana, 430 miles from the Iraqi border.
 
Turks All but Confirm It
 News reports from Washington quoted unidentified Bush Administration officials as saying much the same as the Ankara diplomats. Moreover, Turkey's President, Turgut Ozal, all but agreed tonight that the raids had taken place, although he stopped short of a full confirmation.
"The flights started as training," he told a Turkish television interviewer. "But they had permission beforehand, and afterwards they may have gone somewhere else."
On Thursday, at Mr. Ozal's behest, Parliament authorized United States air strikes from Turkish soil, and the Government gave its formal, and fully expected, approval today.
The Americans are in the process of doubling their number of war planes at Incirlik to 96, and they are also bringing in Patriot air-defense missiles. Being able to strike at Iraq from Turkey gives the United States more flexibility and more firepower from the north in the air war.
In return for their help, the Turks have won pledges from Washington of more military equipment, new economic assistance and trade concessions and promises from the Administration to seek a sharp increase in military aid next year.
