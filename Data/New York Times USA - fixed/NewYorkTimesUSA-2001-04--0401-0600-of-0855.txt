HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Marketers are continuing their search for efficient haven in a storm-tossed economy.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
THREE large advertisers -- Dell Computer, Goodyear and PepsiCo -- are changing agencies on assignments with billings estimated at $220 million to $280 million.
 The Dell Computer Corporation is consolidating its account, with billings estimated at $150 million to $200 million, by naming agencies owned by the Omnicom Group to handle creative and media assignments. 
 "Dell is always looking for ways to become more efficient in all aspects of our business," said Venancio Figueroa, a spokesman for Dell in Round Rock, Tex., and such a consolidation "provides us with the type of efficiency we're looking for."
Efficiencies like those are becoming increasingly important to marketers in competitive categories like computers that have been hit hard by the slowing of consumer demand as the economy sags. The marketers are loath to cut ad budgets, fearing rivals will make inroads, but they need to spend less money as sales soften. 
The Chicago office of DDB Worldwide was awarded creative duties for the Dell brand as well as home and small-business products. The brand duties had been handled by the New York office of BBDO Worldwide, also part of Omnicom, while the other duties had been handled by the New York office of Lowe Lintas & Partners Worldwide, part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
The Dell decision is a sweet comeback for DDB, which in April 2000 lost the account of a Dell competitor, Compaq Computer, to the New York office of FCB Worldwide, owned by True North Communications.
A DDB Chicago sibling, OMD in New York, keeps the brand media duties for Dell and adds the media duties for the home and small-business products that had been handled by Lowe Lintas. Another DDB Chicago sibling, the Irving, Tex., office of Rapp Collins Worldwide, continues as the direct marketing agency for Dell.
Dell began a review in February that was confined to the media account but was soon broadened to include the creative duties. After Dell parted ways with BBDO New York, it considered Lowe Lintas, along with DDB Chicago and Temerlin McClain in Irving, Tex., part of True North, to handle the consolidated creative tasks.
For the media review, Dell considered OMD; Carat in New York, part of the Aegis Group; Lowe Lintas; and the Starcom MediaVest Group in Chicago, part of the Bcom3 Group.
The loss of the Dell assignment is a blow for Lowe Lintas, which as recently as September had two high-technology clients but now has none. Lowe Lintas parted ways with the other client, Sun Microsystems, which had been handled by its San Francisco office since April 1997, because of a conflict that arose after the merger that created Lowe Lintas in 1999.
"Naturally, we are disappointed in Dell's decision," said Gary Goldsmith, chairman and chief creative officer for the United States operations of Lowe Lintas.
"Due to the great volatility in the technology sector, unfortunately change has become a regular feature of that category," he added. "We stand by our work and the results we achieved."
The loss was cushioned by a big gain Lowe Lintas made last week, when Verizon Communications consolidated many creative tasks there with billings estimated at $400 million, about four times the billings leaving for DDB Chicago.
In a second change, the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company in Akron, Ohio, named Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco, a unit of Omnicom, to handle its North American account, according to advertising executives who were told of the decision. Billings were estimated at $60 million.
Chuck Sinclair, a spokesman for Goodyear in Akron, Ohio, said the company was "not in a position to make an announcement" until next week, adding that a report of Goodby, Silverstein's hiring in the online edition of the trade publication Advertising Age "has not been confirmed by anyone at Goodyear."
The Goodyear review lasted three months and had been narrowed to Goodby, Silverstein and three other finalists: BBDO New York; GDS&M in Austin, Tex., also owned by Omnicom; and the New York office of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of Interpublic.
Goodyear had worked for 16 years with the Detroit office of J. Walter Thompson, part of the WPP Group, which declined to take part in the review, thereby resigning the account. McCann continues to handle Goodyear outside the United States.
The decision is a big boost for Goodby, Silverstein, which laid off about 10 percent of its staff in February as part of the dot-com cutbacks sweeping San Francisco agencies.
The final switch involved the Pepsi-Cola Company division of PepsiCo, which expanded its relationship with FCB by naming the agency's Chicago office to handle the Aquafina water account. Billings on the assignment, handled since December 1999 by the New York office of Thompson, were estimated at $10 million to $20 million.
Bart Casabona, a spokesman for Pepsi-Cola in Purchase, N.Y., said the decision came after a review that had been narrowed to FCB Chicago and agencies owned by Omnicom that work for PepsiCo. While he declined to identify them, they include offices of BBDO and DDB.
FCB Chicago has "a wonderful reputation," Mr. Casabona said, for work for brands like the Gatorade sports beverage sold by the Quaker Oats Company.
Not coincidentally, PepsiCo is acquiring Quaker. In addition, the New York office of FCB creates campaigns for the Tropicana Pure Premium line of juices sold by PepsiCo.
Thompson continues to handle the account of the Lipton Brisk line of teas, a joint venture of Pepsi-Cola and a division of Unilever.

HEADLINE: 2 Retailers Report Disappointing Sales 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
Two of the nation's largest retailers reported monthly sales yesterday that disappointed investors and warned that quarterly profits would fall below Wall Street's expectations.
 Sears, Roebuck and Wal-Mart each blamed cold, wet weather for slow sales of spring fashions and lawn and garden equipment. 
 But while the weather was dreary, some analysts said excessive expansion and a slowing economy might have been more responsible for the sluggish sales than the retailers would like to believe.
Overall retail sales in stores open at least a year, a crucial industry measurement, fell 0.7 percent last month, according to the Goldman, Sachs retail composite index. They had risen 1.6 percent in February. 
Many retail stores blamed the weather for slow sales of the apparel and lawn-care items that produce some of the highest profit margins.
The weather's effect was perhaps most starkly clear in the contrast between reports from Sears, where comparable-store sales fell 5.3 percent, and from Wal-Mart Stores Inc., where same-store sales rose 3.5 percent. Wal-Mart's percentage gain paled next to last year's 5.5 percent rise, but strong sales of food and kitchen products helped it post a gain where Sears reported a decrease. The figures cover the five weeks that ended in the first week of April. 
As a result, Sears projected that profits would fall to 53 cents a share in the first quarter, which ended March 31. Last year, the company earned 65 cents a share in the first quarter, and analysts had expected earnings of 57 cents a share in the latest quarter, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.
Wal-Mart, which earned 30 cents a share in the quarter a year earlier, was expected to increase that figure by 2 cents in its first fiscal quarter, which ends April 30. The company said earnings would be short of expectations but would exceed the comparable quarter; it stopped short of actually saying that earnings will be 31 cents a share.
Investors said they were disappointed by both reports. Wal-Mart shares closed down 53 cents, to $49.70. Shares of Sears rose 10 cents, to $34.75. 
Sears said more than a third of the decline resulted from soft sales of seasonal clothing and garden tools. Clothing represents 40 percent of Sears' business, analysts said.
People "don't go to a store in the middle of a March when it's snowing to buy shorts and tank tops," said Steven Kernkraut, analyst for Bear, Stearns. "They know they'll need them, but they don't buy them."
Indeed, Wal-Mart said sales were strongest in the West, where temperatures climbed more rapidly, but the company's revenue growth came primarily from strong sales of products with low profit margins, like food and household paper and chemical products. Comparable-store sales growth was 4.1 percent at Sam's Clubs, the company's bulk discount chain, and 3.3 percent at the Wal-Mart stores.
Eventually, the weather will improve, and, consumers will presumably again demand halter tops and lawn mowers, but inventory backlogs could require the stores to sell merchandise at significant discounts.
"If you didn't sell it in March and you need to clear it in April, you're going to need to promote it a little more," said Daniel T. Binder, an analyst for the Buckingham Research Group. Wal-Mart seems to have tight control of its inventory, he said, adding, "I don't think you're going to see slash-and-burn pricing."
But other analysts, including those that track corporate debt rather than stocks, said retailers faced more daunting and less temporary concerns than foul weather.
Because of "concerns over the economy and the possibility of lower consumer spending, I'm not so sure it's a one-time event for March," said David Novosel, a fixed-income analyst at Banc One Capital Markets.
Some analysts said the few retailers who had not warned of reduced earnings might do so soon.
"It's pretty clear that Dillard's and Saks and Nordstrom's all have a problem; they just haven't said it yet," said Michael Exstein, analyst for Credit Suisse First Boston. "We have added so much new capacity in the system. Your margins had to go south under those circumstances."

HEADLINE: G.E.'s Operating Earnings Rise 16%, Despite Slow Economy 

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
The General Electric Company, buoyed by strong sales of gas turbines and medical systems, said yesterday that its first-quarter earnings rose 16 percent compared with results in the period a year earlier.
 The profit from operations, which matched analysts' estimates, was $3.02 billion, or 30 cents a share, up from $2.59 billion, or 26 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose less than 2 percent, to $30.49 billion. 
 "The strengths in some of the businesses clearly offset the weaknesses in others, which is the whole reason to own a conglomerate," said Nicole M. Parent, an analyst with Banc of America Securities. 
Although a one-time change in accounting rules resulted in a $444 million charge, lowering net income to $2.57 billion, or 26 cents a share, none of the 13 analysts who cover G.E. were put off. "G.E. remains one of the highest-recommended companies we track," said Charles L. Hill, director of research at Thomson Financial/First Call.
Investors bid up G.E. shares $1.43 yesterday, to $44.70. 
That gain broke a pattern. G.E. shares generally rise before its earnings report as investors bet that G.E. will exceed its own forecast. Historically, the company meets the estimate or barely exceeds it -- and the stock falls, as disappointed optimists sell shares.
This time, there was little optimism and thus little let-down.
"When so many companies are reporting negative surprises, coming in on expectations counts as a positive surprise," said Timothy M. Ghriskey, a senior portfolio manager of the Dreyfus Corporation, a big G.E. shareholder.
There are big question marks on G.E.'s horizon, though. Its finance and industrial businesses remain vulnerable to any long-term economic downturn. And neither the Justice Department nor the European Union has yet approved the planned takeover of Honeywell International.
Most analysts expect the acquisition to be approved. But Honeywell's businesses have been eroding. The longer it takes, the harder it may be for G.E. to repair the damage and reap the benefits of cost reductions.
Analysts expect G.E., which is based in Fairfield, Conn., to eliminate close to 19,000 jobs this year even without cuts at Honeywell -- some 8,000 because of the softening economy and 11,000 or so as the company continues to transfer people-intensive support operations to the Internet.
But perhaps the biggest question is where Jeffrey R. Immelt, who has been picked to replace John F. Welch Jr. as chief executive, will take G.E.
"Jeff's operating hand is indistinguishable from Jack's," said Jeanne G. Terrile, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. "Down the road, we'll see if Jeff has a different perspective on G.E.'s portfolio of businesses."
For now, G.E.'s short-cycle businesses -- those with a short time between order and delivery -- are suffering with the economy. Profits at its industrial group, a potpourri including lighting systems, small motors and locomotives, plummeted 18 percent, although sales rose 4 percent -- a discrepancy that many analysts say came from reducing prices to keep volume up.
Sales at GE Appliances dropped 5 percent and earnings fell 3 percent. Sales and profits were flat for GE Plastics. Advertising prices stabilized at NBC.
But the long-cycle businesses have thrived. Revenue at GE Power Systems was up 33 percent. "And their earnings essentially doubled, which certainly covers a multitude of sins in other businesses," said James N. Kelleher at Argus Research.
Orders at GE Medical Systems -- Mr. Immelt's alma mater -- gained 21 percent, while GE Aircraft Engine sales rose 12 percent. Revenue at GE Capital Services declined 6 percent, principally because of divestitures like the closing of Montgomery Ward. Revenue from continuing operations rose 9 percent. 
G.E.'s ability to meet forecasts despite such disparate results again gave rise to suggestions that G.E. keeps earnings on an even keel by timing divestitures or write-offs.
G.E. denies this, but most analysts say that is exactly what is going on. And, they applaud the practice.
"Bad companies can only dream of managing their assets and cash flows and earnings as well as G.E.," said Ms. Terrile of Merrill Lynch.

HEADLINE: A Smaller I.R.S. Gives Up On Billions in Back Taxes 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
The Internal Revenue Service, its staff reduced by a sixth since 1992 and its mission shifted to customer service, has virtually stopped pursuing more than one million tax delinquents and has sharply curtailed other kinds of enforcement.
 More than a third of the three million Americans who are behind on paying their taxes have had their cases sent to an inactive file since the I.R.S. decided in June 1999 not to try to collect their debts, according to internal documents provided to The New York Times. 
 For just last year, the decision effectively wrote off $2.5 billion in taxes owed by 668,018 taxpayers, the documents show. In 1998, by contrast, just 98 taxpayers had their cases sent to the inactive file.
The I.R.S. defined the cases -- some involving as much as tens of thousands of dollars -- as too small to be worth going after, given its current resources, David A. Mader, I.R.S. assistant deputy commissioner, said yesterday. The criteria used by the I.R.S. to deactivate cases were blacked out from the documents, and Mr. Mader declined to discuss them. 
The documents were provided to The Times by an I.R.S. executive opposed to the new policy.
Since 1992, I.R.S. enforcement actions have fallen by two-thirds for audits and by 99 percent for seizures of property to pay back taxes.
Yesterday, the I.R.S. Oversight Board, created by Congress to supervise the tax agency, issued a report saying that the I.R.S. was seriously underfinanced. The report called for spending $10.26 billion, or $800 million more than the $9.4 billion in President Bush's budget for the year starting Oct. 1.
"The I.R.S. is broken," said Larry R. Levitan, a retired Andersen Consulting management expert who is chairman of the oversight board. "It doesn't provide good service, it doesn't do adequate enforcement -- and that gives people the impression they can cheat."
The Treasury secretary, Paul H. O'Neill, who serves on the nine-member oversight board, issued a statement disputing its report. Mr. O'Neill said that the nearly 7 percent budget increase recommended by the president, some $580 million, was adequate.
I.R.S. data show that the agency fell behind in some of its most basic enforcement functions as its staff declined to 97,000 last year from 115,000 in 1992 while the number of tax returns filed rose 10 percent.
For example, to make sure taxpayers disclose all their income, the I.R.S. matches individual tax returns with reports from employers, banks and investment firms. Last year, the agency pursued just one in six cases in which it found discrepancies, down from four in six cases in 1997.
Another measure, the number of individual tax returns audited by the I.R.S., fell to one in 204 last year, from one in 67 in 1995. The audit rate for all but the 1,100 largest corporations, which are under constant audit, fell to 1 percent last year, from 3 percent in 1992.
Seizures of property to pay past-due taxes fell to 174 last year, from more than 10,000 annually in the early 1990's. 
The oversight board is not alone in criticizing the agency's performance. In interviews this week, 13 prominent tax experts with a broad range of political views said that the agency was overwhelmed. 
Because it is focused on trying to help cooperative taxpayers and on fulfilling new mandates from Congress -- including a complete reorganization -- tax evasion and chiseling are spreading, these experts said, as people realize how weak and ineffective enforcement has become.
"The truth is that the enforcement side is sorely lacking," said Sheldon S. Cohen, who served as I.R.S. commissioner in the Johnson administration. Fred T. Goldberg Jr., who held the post under President George Bush, and Donald Alexander, the commissioner under President Richard M. Nixon, said they agreed that enforcement was too lax. Mr. Goldberg added that enforcement efforts needed to be redirected from corporate to individual tax avoidance.
Charles O. Rossotti, the current commissioner, said the critics were justified in describing the agency's performance from the summer of 1998 -- when Congress first directed the I.R.S. to refocus its efforts on helping taxpayers obey the law -- until the end of last year. 
But he said that a year from now, data would show that the I.R.S. hit bottom in 2000 and was now on an upward track in terms of both customer service and enforcement.
"No one can argue with the statistics," Mr. Rossotti said. "They have been going down, and if they kept going down that would be untenable. We clearly need to do more in a lot of respects, but the trend is moving in the right direction now."
None of the 13 tax experts concurred.
Kip Dellinger, a Los Angeles accountant who has written two recent books on I.R.S. practices, said that "it is beyond question that no matter how they deploy their resources, the I.R.S. just does not have a sufficient body of resources to enforce the law." 
"And as more and more people cheat and evade, the problem gets worse," said Mr. Dellinger, who describes himself as a libertarian and fiscal conservative. "We, the honest taxpayers, are all paying for this."
The experts all said they were astonished that the I.R.S. had not moved forcefully against business owners who have stopped withholding income taxes from employee paychecks since The New York Times reported on the movement on Nov. 19. The I.R.S. has sent some of those employers warning letters, but in the last week alone, 11 more businesses have publicly declared that they have stopped withholding.
Bruce R. Bartlett, a conservative economist who was a senior Treasury official in the first Bush administration, said that he was troubled by the statistics showing a sharp drop in enforcement, but that he saw them as part of a decades-long pattern of management woes at the agency.
Charles Davenport, a Rutgers University tax professor who has studied the I.R.S. for years, faulted Mr. Rossotti for "telling Congress what it wants to hear, instead of the truth." 
Mr. Rossotti said that he had been forthright.
Mr. Levitan, the chairman of the oversight board, said that the commissioner, as a member of the Bush administration, must be restrained in his comments to Congress. By contrast, the oversight board was specifically intended by Congress to be free of such inhibitions, he said.
Mr. Levitan said that the president's proposed budget, despite its recommended increase for the I.R.S., would damage the agency's performance, because no money was provided for routine pay increases, promotions and the growth in tax filings. 
The agency is spending hundreds of millions of dollars on new software "that won't run on the laptop and desktop computers the I.R.S has," he said, "but there is no money budgeted for new computers."
The I.R.S. executive who provided the documents said he was appalled by the curtailed pursuit of delinquent taxpayers. He also said he was troubled that the policy had not been disclosed.
He also said that because of the policy, people who ignored their debts were getting a better deal than those who paid their taxes. Moreover, he said, the policy halts pursuit even of people who have stopped filing tax returns, a significant departure from past policy.
Mr. Mader, the assistant deputy commissioner, said that the pullback from pursuing tax delinquents was "a decision that had to be made because of resource allocation issues."
Interest continues to accrue on the accounts categorized as inactive, officials said, and the cases can be reactivated within a 10-year collection period.

HEADLINE: Senator Clinton Settling In as Just One of 100 

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 12 

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton once wrote a book depicting the world as a global village. Now she issues press releases seeking to rename a courthouse in Manhattan and protect apple farmers.
 She once traveled to places like Beijing to denounce human rights abuses around the world. Now she finds herself visiting the Holiday Inn on Route 3 in Plattsburgh, N.Y., to talk about job growth. 
 She once spoke of a right-wing conspiracy in the nation. Now she is forging alliances with some of the fiercest critics of the Clinton White House, like Senators Arlen Specter and Orrin Hatch. 
One hundred days after her splashy arrival in the United States Senate, when her friends and foes alike predicted that she would loom large over Capitol Hill, Mrs. Clinton is doing her best to be seen as just another freshman lawmaker.
Even as scandal continues to follow her, Mrs. Clinton and her advisers have set out to gradually remake her image to convey a very simple message: the former first lady is not too big for her new job. It is the same message she tried to get out when she was a candidate.
"I'm a measured kind of person," she said playfully. "I carry around a little measuring cup, a little measuring spoon." 
These days, the woman who once sought to overhaul the nation's health care system says she is satisfied with decidedly smaller goals: a good committee assignment, passage of an amendment here and there, and support from her colleagues, even Republicans, on issues dear to her.
Her daily schedule on Capitol Hill is as mundane as any other junior senator's. There are meetings and photo opportunities with constituents, like the members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of western and southern New York who showed up at her office the other day. There are also news conferences, committee hearings and press releases on matters of national importance (global warming, acid rain and immigration) and local concerns (Governors Island, West Nile virus and renovating the port of entry on Lake Champlain).
In public gatherings on Capitol Hill, she is now often the last to speak, waiting her turn in deference to ranking members of the Senate. Mrs. Clinton has reached out to her colleagues in other ways, from quietly joining a prayer group led by Republican senators (she's a churchgoing Methodist) to telling her fellow Democrats, in a closed-door meeting with them, that she intends to be "a workhorse, not a show horse."
Her attendance record has been perfect so far, with Mrs. Clinton voting all 86 times that the Senate has held floor votes. Mrs. Clinton has also introduced 10 bills, most of them part of an economic package intended to help upstate New York. 
Mrs. Clinton stays in Washington during the week at her new home near Embassy Row, where she usually ends her days reading reports, memos and correspondence. Weekends are usually spent in Chappaqua, N.Y., with her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Her advisers say she continues to rely on him for advice on matters from the wording of a minor speech to the interpretation of poll numbers. But Mr. Clinton has visited their home in Washington only a few times, possibly because he is trying to abide by the tradition former presidents have of living outside the capital. For the most part, the two lead separate lives, people who know them say.
Mrs. Clinton's new Senate Web site is telling, as well. It features photos of her giving her first floor speech, meeting with constituents in her office in the Senate Dirksen Building and reciting Edgar Allan Poe's "The Raven" in a Capitol Hill pressroom after losing a Super Bowl bet to her colleagues from Maryland who wagered on the Baltimore Ravens.
For all that, Mrs. Clinton can't easily escape her fame. The other day, as she walked out of the Senate chamber, a group of high school girls from Philadelphia spotted her and yelped with delight. "There's Hillary Clinton," shouted one girl. "Give me the camera!"
Her celebrity profile is still considered a big draw at Democratic fund-raising events, despite the investigations into her involvement in the pardons granted by her husband. Mrs. Clinton agreed to play host at a fundraiser in her Washington home later this month on behalf of another Democratic freshman senator, Maria Cantwell of Washington State.
Mrs. Clinton's debut on Capitol Hill was unusually bumpy. Her attempts to get down to work were overshadowed by the disclosures over her last days in the White House: the furniture and other gifts that were later returned; her brothers' involvement in getting presidential pardons for their clients; and so on.
But none of it -- not even chatter about her possible presidential ambitions for 2004 or beyond -- has deterred her from reminding people what she is doing in the Senate. 
Recently, for example, she sent an e-mail press release to dozens of reporters boasting that she had pushed through a relatively minor measure that would have been overlooked: money to help communities upgrade their water treatment systems. She made sure to share credit with Republicans, the sort of gesture that goes a long way in the clubby world of the Senate.
More striking was when Mrs. Clinton agreed to team up with Mr. Specter, a Republican from Pennsylvania, on a bill he introduced that seeks to tighten the rules on presidential pardons. Mr. Specter, who this winter raised the possibility of trying to impeach Mr. Clinton again, this time out of office, said the bill was a response to the controversial pardons. But Mrs. Clinton made no mention of that when she offered her support, saying only that it was "sensible bipartisan" legislation.
Even her occasional jabs at Republicans are couched in cautious terms, confounding some of her most ardent supporters. Many of them had hoped that she would be more outspoken, particularly about President Bush's pick for attorney general, John Ashcroft, a man with a conservative record on abortion rights and school desegregation. Mrs. Clinton did not criticize the Ashcroft nomination for weeks, until it was about to go to the floor of the Senate. Then she did so in a news conference in New York, not Washington, so as not to draw national attention to herself and still address the concerns of liberal groups in her state, her advisers say.
But at the same time, Mrs. Clinton has pleasantly surprised many people who were initially wary, most notably Republicans in the Senate, whose support she needs if she hopes to get anything done legislatively.
"She has handled herself well, being collegial and getting to know the system," said Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Texas Republican. Mrs. Hutchison added that her colleague "is doing what a new thoughtful senator should do, and that is learning the ropes before you jump out."
With Congress in recess this week, Mrs. Clinton returned to New York, where she has been traveling the state and criticizing the budget President Bush released on Tuesday.
Her aides say that as much as anything, Mrs. Clinton wants to be known as a lawmaker who delivers for her fellow New Yorkers. She has, in fact, made several swings across the state since being sworn into office, hitting just about every available media market to drive home that message. And when she is back on Capitol Hill, she threads her speeches with homespun references to average folks she has met in places like Utica and Rome.
Much of her legislative record has been tailored with an eye toward her constituents, too. Her first major bill, for example, seeks to revive the economy of upstate New York. And the other bills that she has helped introduce include one that would secure more defense contracts for the Army's Watervliet Arsenal near Albany, and another that would require the federal government to turn Governors Island over to New York.
But it would be a mistake to think that she has abandoned the bigger picture. Asked about the failed health care initiative she pushed in 1993, Mrs. Clinton said her goal was valid; the problem, she said, was the way she went about trying to achieve it. Nor has Mrs. Clinton shied away from using her new elected power to advance an agenda that reflects her deeply held positions on child care, education and health care. She has also shown a willingness to use blistering oratory to defend those goals.
Recently discussing the dangers she believes President Bush's tax cuts pose to social programs, Mrs. Clinton posed this question to her audience: "Will we meet the challenges of our time or will we squander this moment on a budget that puts politics first and people last?"
It is still too early to say what kind of senator Mrs. Clinton will be once she establishes herself. Will she have enough stature to shape her party's national agenda, in the tradition of Edward M. Kennedy and Daniel Patrick Moynihan? Or will the kind of troubles she has run into over the last few months prevent her from leaving a legacy? 
Mrs. Clinton knows that there is plenty of time for such questions to be resolved. "My life has been kind of an unfolding drama, to me as well as everybody else," she said while standing outside the Senate chamber. Then, she concluded, "I have six years, and I am somebody who does take the long view."

HEADLINE: New Attention for the Idea That Abortion Averts Crime 

BYLINE:  By ALEXANDER STILLE 

 BODY:
In the last several years, many causes have been enthusiastically advanced to explain the dramatic drop in crime in the United States over the past decade: innovative policing, tougher sentencing laws, the waning of the crack epidemic, better enforcement of gun laws and an improvement in the economy. Many scholars have leaped to promote a pet theory, which often coincided with a favorite policy recommendation. But one theory has come along that no one, not even the authors, is eager to embrace as policy: abortion.
 At first glance, abortion as crime prevention may sound like a modern equivalent of "A Modest Proposal," in which Jonathan Swift, tongue in cheek, suggested that the Irish solve their famine by eating their own children. In fact, when word of the scholars' findings was first made public two years ago, the reaction was shock and fury. Some people accused them of promoting abortion, others of supporting racist eugenics. 
 Now, the authors of the theory, John J. Donohue III of Stanford Law School and Steven D. Levitt, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, are publishing their completed research for the first time next month in Harvard University's Quarterly Journal of Economics. And they insist, however controversial its implications, that it is impossible to ignore what they say is a striking link between the introduction of legalized abortion in the early 1970's and the drop in crime about 18 years later. 
But as other experts have had their first chance to scrutinize the research in detail, almost every aspect of the theory has been attacked, from its assumptions to its conclusion that abortion and crime are connected, not separate trends that happened to surface at the same time. Indeed, given all the influences on the crime rate -- including the economy, the availability of guns and drugs, and policing strategies -- some critics doubt whether it is ever possible to figure out the precise relationship between the two, let alone to assert that abortion might be responsible for a 50 percent drop in crime. "My instinct was nothing in the social sciences accounts for 50 percent of anything," said Ted Joyce, an economist who has examined Mr. Donohue and Mr. Levitt's data and is now about to publish his own counterstudy. 
Mr. Levitt and Mr. Donohue insist their paper is purely descriptive and has no policy recommendations. Studies cited by them indicate that unwanted children are twice as likely to engage in criminal behavior as those who are wanted. "The thesis is about as simple as you could have," Mr. Levitt said. "A difficult home environment leads to an increased risk of criminal activity. Increased abortion reduced unwantedness and therefore lower criminal activity."
But that's not all. Children of poor teenage mothers, unmarried women and black women are statistically at a higher risk for crime when they grow up. And it is these groups who have higher rates of abortion, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Studies show that children of both teenage mothers and unmarried women generally, for example, are twice as likely to commit crimes; one-third of all abortions are performed on teenagers, Mr. Levitt and Mr. Donohue note.
But the critics say it's not at all simple. As summed up by Alfred Blumstein, a leading criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University and the author of major studies on the drop in crime: "The problem with these kinds of econometric analyses is that if a couple of the assumptions change, you can come up with very different results." 
For instance, is the assumption that unwanted children are more likely to commit crimes valid?
Still, even many skeptics concede that Mr. Levitt's and Mr. Donohue's study deserves serious attention; that even if they are wrong on some specifics, the subject of abortion has been wrongly ignored in discussions of crime. "I don't think many people think it could account for 50 percent of the reduction in crime," said Mr. Blumstein, "but they have convinced me it's a factor that needs to be considered." Indeed, the next meeting of the American Society of Criminology in November will dedicate a session to arguing both sides of the issue. 
Before the Supreme Court overturned bans on abortions in 1973, about 700,000 were performed each year; the number reached 1.6 million in 1978, remained fairly constant through the 80's and has begun to decline slightly in the last decade. "When I first learned of the magnitude of abortions performed in the late 1970's, I was staggered by the numbers and thought, 'How could this not have had some dramatic social impact?' " Mr. Levitt says. 
"When you put that together with the studies of crime among unwanted children and the fact that legalization suddenly made abortion available to millions of women who were not in the economic elite, you have a picture that screams out for further analysis," he continued.
Mr. Levitt adds that working on the abortion issue made him lean personally toward a right-to-life position. And he says that one could easily decide, based on these findings, that improving the education and life conditions of the poor is the most effective way of fighting crime.
As he was beginning to think about the problem a few years ago, he had a talk with Mr. Donohue. " 'I have this wacko idea,' I told John, and he told me he had been thinking about the same thing," Mr. Levitt said. "I think the thing that cemented it for us was the literature on the extreme importance of early family environment." 
Mr. Levitt and Mr. Donohue needed a way to test their hypothesis, a difficult task in the social sciences, where experiments cannot be controlled and repeated as in a laboratory. But the two thought that the way in which abortion was legalized in the United States could provide them with a good comparison.
Five states -- New York, California, Hawaii, Alaska and Washington -- legalized abortion three years before the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade made it a national phenomenon. "The five states that legalized abortion in 1970 saw drops in crime before the other 45 states," the scholars write. "States with high rates of abortion have experienced a roughly 30 percent drop in crime relative to low-abortion regions since 1985." While caution is necessary in extrapolating results, they continue, "the estimates suggest that legalized abortion can account for about half the observed decline in crime in the United States between 1991 and 1997." 
Immediately, scholars began to focus on several potential problems with the thesis. First: was the comparison valid? Hawaii and Alaska are hardly representative states; moreover, women from all over the country traveled to states like California and New York to obtain legal abortions. Mr. Blumstein points out other problems: "Of the five states that legalized abortion, two of them, New York and California, totally dominate and skew the sample. The crack epidemic started in New York City and Los Angeles. That big city effect could be driving the crime rate up and then down."
In other words, states with large urban populations are likely to show the strongest trends in terms of both abortion rate and crime, and a correlation between them does not prove that one causes the other. Other factors are bound to play a role.
Mr. Joyce agrees: "Crack and the spread of guns are the great confounders. There is no question that the introduction of crack and the spread of handguns among kids 15 to 24 years old between 1985 and 1991 played a role in the rise of homicide. After that, crack begins to decline and there is a major campaign to check the spread of handguns among young people. My concern is that Levitt and Donohue are simply picking up the correlations in the huge downturn in crack and handguns." 
In fact, Mr. Joyce said, when he looked more specifically at homicides among young people in the early 1990's in New York, the data showed the opposite of what the Donohue-Levitt thesis would have predicted. "If their theory were correct," Mr. Joyce said, "you would expect to see a drop. Instead, murders hit an all-time high." 
Mr. Donohue and Mr. Levitt respond that the high murder rate was just a temporary spike created by the crack epidemic. The fact that the overall crime rate was going down even during the crack epidemic and has continued to do so since crack use abated, they say, suggests that something larger and more long-lasting is at work. Moreover, they say, their research shows a steady decline in places where there was no crack epidemic and where innovative police strategies were not put into place. 
Another potential hole, said Mr. Joyce, is that no one can prove that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the number of abortions and the number of unwanted children whose birth was avoided. 
But Mr. Donohue argues that the data strongly suggest that a link does exist. He said that the birth rate fell by 13 percent among teenagers, a group whose children are twice as likely to commit crimes, and that the birth rate fell by 12 percent among black women, a group whose children are nine times more prone to commit homicides, according to police and Centers for Disease Control statistics. And he says that the drop in the number of adoptions during the 1970's from 170,000 a year to 130,000 indicates a drop in unwanted children. 
But is it really true, Mr. Joyce asks, that unwanted children are twice as likely to commit crimes? "The main study they use," he said, "involves children who were institutionalized for at least four months in their first year of life, which means it's a pretty exceptional pool." Mr. Levitt insists that this is more typical than one might think: "A lot of poor teenage mothers have poor prenatal care and have drug and alcohol problems that lead to birth complications and hospitalization for the children." 
Such questions make it nearly impossible to pinpoint the relationship between abortion and crime, other scholars say. "There are a lot of different things going in this period at the same time that plausibly fit these same facts," said Lawrence W. Sherman, a criminologist at the University of Pennsylvania. "The waning of the crack epidemic. A major crackdown on handguns in cities. An improving economy. So while I think Levitt and Donohue are brilliant, no amount of brilliance will overcome a lack of data. So maybe rather than propose new theories, we should spend our money gathering better information." 
Mr. Joyce said: "The notion that fertility control could have an impact on child well-being is a reasonable one. But to show it you would need to study 50,000 women, half of whom terminated their pregnancies, half of whom wanted to but did not, and follow them and their children over time. 
"Can you tease out that effect from crude aggregate data on crime 15 to 20 years later? I don't think so."

HEADLINE: Russia Trying To Head Off Debt Squeeze 

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, April 13 

 BODY:
The order seemed simple enough in the late 1980's: 79 brand-new fishing trawlers for the Soviet Union to upgrade its fleet.
 Work began at European shipyards, financed by bank loans backed by millions of dollars in guarantees from the Soviet government. 
 But when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the trawlers and the bills for them went separate ways. The boats slipped into private hands; the new owners promptly disappeared into a web of offshore companies, and the Russian government was left owing $1.5 billion. The debts were later rolled into the $42 billion Russia owes to a group of Western governments known as the Paris Club. 
After 10 years of stalling and haggling with its creditors and two defaults, Russia is now paying up. Ample oil revenue and a booming economy have made Russia's 2001 and 2002 interest and principal payments manageable.
After that, though, it may not be so easy: nearly $19 billion will come due in 2003, and the government is trying to negotiate relief of some of the burden. This week in St. Petersburg, the German chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, discussed Russia's debts with Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, though little progress was made. Germany is the biggest single creditor in the Paris Club, holding about half the total owed.
Even if it does win some relief, Russia is feeling the cost of servicing all this debt, prompting it to take a closer look at just how it was run up.
Much of it, like the cost of the trawlers, was borrowed hastily in the chaos of the Soviet Union's dying days, and is now the legacy of a bankrupt state that lost control of its finances, and ultimately, its very property.
Often missing from the back-and-forth between Russia and creditors like Germany and the United States, who have taken a tough line in negotiations, is the identity of some big beneficiaries of the borrowing: Western companies like the shipyards. Many credits granted to Mikhail Gorbachev and his failing state were tied specifically to Soviet purchases of western goods, from German industrial equipment to American grain. For this reason, politicians and taxpayers alike are questioning whether it is fair to expect Russia to pay in full.
The Soviet Union had been borrowing modestly since the 1960's, and made a deal in 1970 with Fiat S.p.A. to build what is now Russia's biggest car manufacturer. In the late 1980's, the onset of Mr. Gorbachev's glasnost policies brought both an opening to the West and a relaxation of state controls over company managers. Many of those managers seized their new chance, borrowing recklessly and then privatizing the companies they ran, leaving the government to pay their debts.
"It was like someone died and left a will, a car, an apartment -- and all the heirs came and took the goods, but skipped out on all the payments," said Valentin Pavlov, the Soviet prime minister under Mr. Gorbachev, who also served as finance minister.
In one case, the renowned eye surgeon Svyatoslav Fyodorov bought the surgical center he directed, which was built largely on Soviet-era loans, and then persuaded the Russian government to assume responsibility for the debts, according to Anatoly Chubais, the architect of Russia's state-asset sales program.
"That was the worst Wild West period," said one western adviser to the Russian government, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "There was a lot of what you'd call self-privatization -- Red managers grabbing things.
"Gosplan had lost control," he continued, referring to the state planning agency, "and Gorbachev wasn't asserting his authority. A lot of joint ventures spinning off from state enterprises gave rise to theft."
The fishing trawlers exemplify the problem. About half the boats never even reached Russia, instead disappearing abroad along with the bureaucrats who were supposed to oversee the purchase, according to the state fishing committee chairman, who investigated the case last year. The trawlers that did reach Russia were transferred to private owners, but the lease payments on them were made sporadically or not at all.
Foreign debt tripled over the six years that Mr. Gorbachev led the Soviet Union, from 1985 to 1991. A combination of low world prices for oil, the Soviet Union's biggest export, and an ill-fated anti-alcohol campaign had left the treasury depleted. Mr. Gorbachev began asking for loans to prop up his crumbling state.
"Our officials were running all over the world taking loans -- Gorbachev in Paris, billions coming, Gorbachev in London, billions coming," said Boris Fyodorov, a former Russian finance minister, who at the time was an adviser to the Soviet government. "It was clear that the amount of loans was quickly exceeding Russia's capacity to repay them. In May 1990 we warned Gorbachev of an impending debt crisis."
At a time when the Soviet state was at its least cost-conscious, it had vast new access to funds, and it was borrowing uncontrollably, in many cases simply to cover current costs, like subsidizing imported food and clothing to cover gaps in the rapidly disintegrating Soviet supply system. 
Russia was running out of everything. Even city governments were borrowing overseas. Mr. Chubais tells of how a 1990 cigarette shortage in St. Petersburg led to a crowd of desperate smokers blocking the city's main road demanding deliveries. As deputy mayor, he approved a loan to replenish the city's supply.
"The whole ship was sinking, and loans were taken to plug the holes," Mr. Chubais said in an interview.
In the West, export credits were seen as good business. Companies were eager to get access to a vast and underserved market ahead of competitors, or to unload excess supplies where they would not depress prices at home. At one point in the early 1990's, there was so much American chicken for sale in Russian markets that people began jokingly calling drumsticks "Bush legs."
In hindsight, some experts say, it was hardly wise to lend so lavishly to a very weak Soviet state deep in financial crisis. Credits were poured into industries that had never before been obliged to stick to a budget or repay a loan. 
"The West was closing its eyes," said Mr. Fyodorov, formerly of the finance ministry. "We never needed so much grain. Everyone was interested in selling cheap surplus, but inside Russia it wasn't so efficiently used. The average Soviet official never looked at loans as something you have to repay."
In a way, the situation in Russia prefigured the trouble seen today in the technology sector. Like the manufacturers who lent dot-com start-ups the money to buy equipment from them, the Paris Club countries enjoyed making debt-fueled sales to Russia without worrying too much about the borrowers' profligacy. Unlike many dot-coms, though, Russia is still around to collect from.
Even with extra oil revenue, the Russia that is now making its payments is significantly poorer than the one that inherited the Soviet Union's debts in 1992. The economy is beginning to recover after a decade of decline, but output remains one-third below 1991 levels.
"It was fair then that Russia took on the entire Soviet debt," said Russia's current finance minister, Aleksei Kudrin, in an interview. "And it would be fair now if the G-8 countries would agree on restructuring with a partial write-off."

HEADLINE: Powell, on First Balkans Trip, Warns Against Fresh Violence 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, April 13 

 BODY:
Gen. Colin L. Powell came to Bosnia for the first time today and used his stature as secretary of state to try and douse the flames of nationalism that stoked three and a half years of war here and still threaten the peace.
 In Macedonia, and in what he described as quite passionate talks with political leaders of Kosovo, General Powell delivered a stern message: Violence will not work. 
 Like so many Western visitors before him in the Balkans, the general tried to encourage leaders of different ethnic groups to work together. He met behind closed doors in Skopje, the capital of Macedonia, where gunfights last month between Albanian rebels and security forces fanned fears of a new Balkan war, and later here, with leaders from Kosovo, Macedonia and Bosnia. 
The general was also making a quiet assessment of the American peacekeeping presence in the region. 
The Bush administration came into office indicating that it would like American peacekeepers to exit Bosnia and Kosovo fairly swiftly. But that exit depends on political and economic stability in the two places, as well as Macedonia.
General Powell, who spent 35 years in the military -- several of them as its most senior commander -- said today that the Bush administration was constantly looking for ways to reduce the number of American combat troops, and to transfer their responsibilities to what he called paramilitary or police units. He cited riots and the forced detention of 10 foreign officials in and around the Bosnian city of Mostar last week as instances in which international police officers would have been appropriately used.
The general met this morning with the new commander of the NATO-led forces in Kosovo, a Norwegian general, Thorstein Skiaker, but he declined to specify what recommendations he would make to Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld about the level of American troops.
As a symbol of his emphasis on the political fabric of the region, General Powell did not visit American troops on this trip.
He arrived last night in Macedonia, where he stayed through the morning. He said he was particularly concerned about the "fragility" of the government in Macedonia, whose president, Boris Trajkovski, a Methodist minister without much political experience, has needed Washington's support.
The general described a number of "moving conversations" he had had with Mr. Trajkovski as the Macedonian Army was sent out against the Albanian insurgents two weeks ago. For now, the government forces have prevailed. "Never having been in the Balkans," General Powell said, "I thought I had better move it up a little higher in my priority and see it with my own eyes." 
He made it clear in Macedonia that the United States would not be sending troops but trying to help the young military with communications equipment. He urged Mr. Trajkovski to move more quickly on political reforms that would embrace the Albanians who make up about one-third of the two million people. 
General Powell suggested delaying a planned census until the fall so that it could be more accurately conducted under international supervision; he also urged quicker construction of a long-planned university in the city of Tetovo, where most of the population is Albanian.
After meeting in Skopje with foreign ministers from the Balkans region, General Powell said: "We will be engaged politically and economically. We will provide military assistance as appropriate and try in every instance to provide an example of what can be done in a multiethnic society as we have done in the United States."
His planned trip to Kosovo was canceled this morning because of heavy cloud cover of the mountains that divide Macedonia from Kosovo. He had been scheduled to take a helicopter tour of the border and the Presevo Valley in southern Serbia, where NATO troops were working with the Yugoslav Army to flush out Albanian guerrillas. 
Aides said the general -- meeting in Skopje with the Kosovo Albanian leaders Ibrahim Rugova, Hashim Thaci and Ramush Haradinaj -- told them they should more forcefully oppose the Albanian insurgency in neighboring Macedonia. 
General Powell set a target for Kosovo-wide elections by the end of the year. In the meantime, he encouraged the province's Albanians, and remaining Serbs, to define what kind of presidency, legislature and other institutions Kosovo needed. 
Here in Sarajevo, General Powell met with the three members of the joint presidency that governs Bosnia. He also met with the leaders of the Muslim-Croat Federation and the Bosnian Serb Republic, the two entities that make up the state government under the Dayton peace accord, which ended the Bosnian war in 1995. The facade of unity built by that agreement is under threat from hard-line Bosnian Croats, who have declared that they are pulling out of the federation.
Afterward, at the once heavily bombarded main government building in Sarajevo's city center, General Powell stood in a reception room that has been elaborately restored -- save for two big bullet holes left as a reminder -- and read a statement aimed at the Croatian rebels.
"We know the differences between the Croatian people of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- whose community has brought forth many fine leaders -- and a small group of people who use nationalist propaganda in fighting to preserve their own power and wealth," he said. 
General Powell never came to Bosnia when he was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the first Bush administration and in the first eight months of the Clinton presidency, largely because both presidents followed his advice. He argued forcefully, he recalls in his autobiography, that only a large commitment of ground forces in Bosnia would prevail against the Serbs. Even then, he wrote, there needed to be a "clear political objective." 
General Powell left the Clinton administration in 1993. Two years later, NATO air strikes against the Serbs and talks led by Richard Holbrooke resulted in the Dayton accords.

HEADLINE: COLLISION WITH CHINA: INTELLIGENCE-GATHERING; 
Listening, Looking: Old Methods Still Work

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER DREW 

 BODY:
For more than 50 years, the EP-3E and similar spy planes have made tens of thousands of flights off the coasts of Russia, China and North Korea and in the Middle East, gathering intelligence. 
 The EP-3E that was damaged in a collision with a Chinese fighter jet on April 1 is still in China, and as diplomats discuss its fate, the issue arises whether this facet of the spy game has outlived its usefulness. 
 Chinese officials have clearly been aggravated by the growing frequency of the flights. And the tension caused by the collision shows how delicate such spying can be in a world where potential adversaries are also major economic partners. 
Pentagon officials acknowledge that the flights may seem provocative, and that in an age of spy satellites, placing American lives at risk in turboprop planes may seem like a dangerous anachronism. 
But even critics of other Pentagon practices say the reconnaissance flights provide critical intelligence, particularly about other countries' radar defense systems.
One such critic, William M. Arkin, an independent analyst and author, said this kind of intelligence helps the Pentagon figure out how to disrupt communications and disable missile batteries that could endanger American troops and pilots.
"Our dominance in undermining other countries' electronic capabilities is the reason we have been able to maintain such low casualties in the Persian Gulf and in Yugoslavia," he said. "And this dominance is dependent on the information that these planes collect."
Others noted that even though China is at a relatively early stage in modernizing its armed forces, it has been buying submarines and planes from Russia. The reconnaissance flights help discover how and where China plans to position them. 
The flights are "one piece of the puzzle that help us figure out what they're doing overall," said Kenneth W. Allen, a former assistant air attache at the embassy in Beijing.
Much of China's buildup is aimed at Taiwan. And in 1996, when China fired three unarmed missiles into the Taiwan Strait in an attempt to intimidate the islanders before their first presidential election, the EP-3E planes made almost daily flights over the strait, soaking up radio messages, radar beams and other electronic signals, current and former intelligence officials said.
In a typical mission off China, the planes carry 14 intelligence specialists. They include some who speak Chinese, who eavesdrop on the military's radio traffic, and others who record the radar signals emitted by antiaircraft batteries.
Military experts said much of this data cannot be captured by satellites. And since satellites have predictable orbits, and it is not hard for other countries to suspend their military activities when they pass over.
Jeffrey T. Richelson, who has written several books on intelligence, said the slow-moving planes could also circle over an area for more lengthy periods. Another advantage, he said, is that the presence of the spy planes often stimulates Chinese defense forces to light up their radar systems to track the flights.
As the Chinese fighter jets scramble to intercept the spy planes, the American intelligence officers record the radio chatter between the pilots and their bases and note their flight tactics.
But the dangers are evident as well. Pentagon officials say that in recent months, some Chinese pilots started to fly too close to the American planes. Still, the action is nowhere near as heated as during the cold war, when many American planes were sent to penetrate the coastlines of Communist countries.
From the 1950's through the early 1970's, the Soviet Union, China and North Korea all shot down American spy planes. Declassified records indicate that more than 30 planes were lost, and at least 150 airmen were killed or reported missing.
Pentagon officials said they had minimized the risks by strictly limiting the surveillance planes to routes over international waters. 
But the determination -- or perhaps the fear -- that led to establishing these missions is still alive and well. One former EP-3E pilot, Donald E. Chomiak, said that in the mid-1990's, an officer in his squadron had printed business cards with an unofficial motto: "In God we trust. All others we monitor."

HEADLINE: Officials Move To Increase Police Recruits 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM 

 BODY:
With a deadline fast approaching, applications for the coming police test have lagged, suggesting that interest in a career with the New York Police Department remains anemic. While unwilling to concede they have a recruiting problem, police officials said yesterday that they would make a wide range of changes to the recruitment program.
 The changes include waiving the $35 application fee, extending the deadline to apply for the June 23 test, and offering additional test dates at military bases around the country and at campuses in New York City, Police Commissioner Bernard B. Kerik said yesterday. 
 So far this year, with the original application deadline two weeks away, only 800 people have signed up to take the June 23 test. The number pales in comparison to recent years, when tens of thousands of men and women applied. Police officials yesterday acknowledged the number of applicants was low, but contended that it was not a clear-cut indication of low interest in police careers. They said it was usual for many applications to come in the final weeks of the sign-up period. 
But rather than wait for a last-minute surge that may not come, officials decided to take the steps to increase the number of candidates for the force of 40,000 officers. Chief among them, Mr. Kerik said, was the elimination of the filing fee. The decision, made last week, will require city personnel officials to refund the entry fees already paid by the current applicants.
In addition, the city has extended the filing period for the June 23 test by two weeks, from April 30 to May 15, in the hope of reaping the full benefit of eliminating the fee.
In the past, the department offered the police test twice a year, and only in New York City. Now, officials plan to schedule more testing days over the next six weeks, with on-the-spot registration, at Fort Bliss in Texas, Fort Campbell in Kentucky and Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, as well as at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan, St. John's University in Queens and St. Francis College in Brooklyn, Mr. Kerik said.
Next year, the department will also offer the free test using a dozen city public school sites, with tests in February, June and October, and both morning and afternoon sessions. The department is also exploring giving the exams at the State University of New York campuses at Albany, Binghamton and New Paltz.
Mr. Kerik is facing the same problems that plagued his predecessor, Commissioner Howard Safir: a department dragged down by abysmal morale after several high-profile incidents that tarnished the department's reputation, including the torture of Abner Louima in a Brooklyn station house in 1997 and the fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, in 1999.
At the same time, officers are almost unanimously bitter over a pay scale roundly criticized as miserly in an economy that for years has offered attractive alternatives. But concern appears to have deepened in recent weeks, because the applications have lagged even as the economy has shuddered.
Yesterday, Mr. Kerik, talking to reporters about the new recruiting initiatives, sought to play down the concerns. He said he was taking the new measures because he believed the department, which he said hired more people than any other city agency, would generally benefit from a consistently larger pool of candidates.
"This department, unlike just about any other city agency, should be recruiting constantly," he said. "Because we're constantly hiring, I think we should maintain a bigger pool, instead of just testing one or two times a year," as the department has in the past.
But the head of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, the union that represents police officers, said the new efforts failed to respond to what he called the underlying problem.
"The city is refusing to address the real problem in recruiting," said Patrick J. Lynch, the P.B.A. president. "The problem in recruiting is we have a substandard salary. Surrounding jurisdictions, who pay their police officers a decent, livable wage, have thousands of thousands of applicants for hundreds of spots."
Members of the P.B.A. start at an annual salary of $31,305, and the union is now engaged in contract talks with the city. Mr. Lynch said a smaller pool of recruits meant that the city might be forced to lower its standards for hiring officers. "What the city has to be careful of doing is lowering the standards to increase their numbers," he said. "Once you lower the standards, it affects the city's citizens as well as their fellow police officers. Raise the salaries and you can keep the high standards."
Mr. Kerik said the department was undertaking a new advertising campaign, with print, radio and television ads that he said would be unveiled next week. While he was unable yesterday to provide the cost for the advertisements, he said the budget would be less than the department's last advertising blitz, which cost about $20 million over two years under Mr. Safir, with limited success. Mr. Kerik said the advertisements would be produced largely in-house.
The 800 candidates who have signed up during the last five weeks for the June 23 test represent an increase over the 375 who signed up during a five-week period in July and August of last year for a test that was given in December, officials said. "We're really enthused about these numbers," said Patrick J. Muldowney, a spokesman for the city's Division of Citywide Administrative Services.
But neither figure measures up to the roughly 4,000 who signed up in a five-week period early last year. In the end, 8,300 signed up for that test -- a figure that itself represented a marked decline from the 1990's, when 15,000 to 30,000 people applied to take the tests.

PERSON: Harold Leon Korn 

HEADLINE: Harold Korn, 71, Expert On New York Civil Law 

BYLINE:  By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Harold Leon Korn, a legal scholar who helped devise a road map for the maze of civil laws invoked in courts across the state of New York, died on March 27 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 71 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and in Lenox, Mass.
 The cause was cancer of the esophagus, said the Columbia Law School, where he held the Harold R. Medina chair in Procedural Jurisprudence. 
 Professor Korn was one of the three chief architects of "New York Civil Practice," a work that made its debut in 1963 and now comprises 16 volumes. Its authors were Senior Judge Jack B. Weinstein of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, Prof. Arthur R. Miller of the Harvard Law School and Professor Korn, who was the project's director of research.
They inventoried and compiled civil laws and clarifying commentaries. The resulting text serves to guide judges and lawyers, as well as jailhouse lawyers who help fellow inmates with their legal matters.
Professor Korn was also a co-author of "Elements of Civil Procedure" (4th ed., 1985) and "Catastrophic Accidents in Government Programs" (1963), a Columbia report that advised government officials on how to deal with the possible legal fallout of nuclear-plant accidents.
Harold Korn was born in the Bronx, the only child of Polish immigrants. He graduated from Cornell University in 1951 and from Columbia Law School in 1954.
At 28, when he was recently married, he and his wife were severely burned in a car explosion in Wellfleet, Mass. The marriage ended in divorce. 
Harold Korn had a distinguished legal career and was also involved with propagating the arts.
He was a law clerk to the chief judge of the state's Court of Appeals and research director for a state advisory committee on practice and procedures in the 1950's. Then the American Law Institute hired him as a special consultant for drafting its Model Penal Code, a source of the state's current Penal Law.
He then taught at Buffalo Law School and New York University before joining the law faculty at Columbia in 1971. He taught subjects including conflicts of law, constitutional law, evidence and civil procedure.
At his death, he was finishing a book, "Modern Conflicts of Law and Jurisdiction," that discusses revisions of law necessitated by changes in modern life, like lightning communications technology, a global economy and major toxic spills.
Referring to his death in The New York Law Journal, Judge Weinstein wrote, "the loss to the bar for works in progress, which would have illuminated the future of our law, is substantial."
Professor Korn honed his love of the arts inspired by his life's companion, Amy Clampitt, a poet of dense, ornate and allusive metaphysical verse. They met in 1968 at a Democratic Party gathering in New York, when she had not yet published and he was at the threshold of legal renown.
They eventually married, and Ms. Clampitt died a celebrated poet in 1994. They had no children. 
In the foreword of her collected works, she referred to a contented 25 years of "life with Hal." He, in turn, recently created the Amy Clampitt Foundation to benefit poetry and the literary arts. His Lenox home is part of it and will offer poets a place to work.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL; 
Winfield Chooses Padres Over Yanks

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Before he played for the Yankees, he played for the San Diego Padres, and that is why Dave Winfield has decided his plaque at the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., will depict him in a Padres cap. It is the biggest upset the Yankees have suffered since they lost to the Cleveland Indians in the first round of the 1997 playoffs.
 When Winfield was elected to the Hall of Fame earlier this year, for most people it was a foregone conclusion that he would adorn himself with a Yankees cap for his induction in August. After all, George Steinbrenner had his way with Reggie Jackson eight years ago and may also have his way with Roger Clemens before the decade is over. Steinbrenner has an economic knack for that sort of thing. But he did not attempt to buy the cap that will reside on Winfield's head on his plaque. 
 "He neither offered nor did we ask," Jeff Klein, Winfield's lawyer, said after the Hall of Fame announced the decision yesterday. "The respect for the game, the process and what has happened here were such that we were adamantly opposed to participating in an attempt to sell the cap."
Steinbrenner met with Winfield recently and had breakfast with him the day after the season opener. But while he made the suggestion that his adversary of the 1980's could represent the Yankees, he made no offer to try to buy his representation. Not that he could have bought off Winfield. And his decision, Winfield said, had nothing to do with the way Steinbrenner treated him when he played in New York.
"What people don't know probably is for some time we've had a pretty good mutual respect," Winfield said by telephone from his home in the Los Angeles area. "He expressed his pleasure, his being happy for me. We didn't talk about the hat at all. We've had conversations about my entire career and personal things. Things between us, too. We know we can look at each other with mutual respect. We've been able to go through everything that we've been through. When it's all said and done, the people who know me well know I felt good to be able to speak to him like that. It has nothing to do with any previous history. That didn't affect my decision. I'm comfortable where we are."
Winfield played for six teams in his 22-year career. He spent the first eight years in San Diego, the next eight in New York. The Yankees traded him to the California Angels in 1990, and from there he moved on to Toronto, where he helped the Blue Jays win the 1992 World Series; then to his hometown Minnesota Twins, with whom he stroked his 3,000th hit in 1993, and then to Cleveland for his final season in 1995.
"I didn't anticipate there'd be this much discussion or thought about the hat," he said. "It caused me to be very introspective. It caused me to reach out and talk to a lot of people. The essence of this is I feel that I belong to all of baseball, more than just one city or one team. When my friend Kirby and I played together in Minnesota, he called me Ambassador. He kidded me about it because everywhere we went there was a very good response by all the people. He'd say, 'Winnie, you're something else.' "
Why, then, a Padres cap?
"When I look at everything," said Winfield, whose plaque will be the first to have a Padres cap, "it's kind of like, who gave me the first opportunity, where do I come from, where did I emerge? All this started a long time ago. They saw me, drafted me first, gave me a chance to play in the big leagues right away. I was an All-Star there; I was their first captain."
Although he left the Padres two decades ago, Winfield has, in a way, returned. Several years ago he met John Moores, the Padres' current owner; they became friends, and Winfield became a member of the team's board of directors. He threw out the ceremonial first ball on opening day, and the Padres will honor him tonight before their game, retiring his uniform No. 31.
The Yankees, who engaged him to help raise their latest World Series championship flag on their opening day, plan to honor him, too, holding a day for him Aug. 18. He won't be the 17th member of the Hall of Fame to wear a Yankees cap, but he is expected to become the 17th member of the Yankees to have his number retired. 
Winfield said he hoped that his friends and his fans in New York would understand his decision.
"It was a tug of war on me for a long time," he said. "I identify with the city. I lived there longer than any place and did more things in the community there. It's a real personal decision."
With Kirby Puckett, who spent his entire career with the Twins and will go into the Hall with Winfield, the exception, more players in the era of free agency will have difficult cap decisions to make. In its announcement yesterday, the Hall said that the choice of a cap is actually its decision. "The Hall has a responsibility to properly interpret the game's history," Dale Petroskey, the Hall's president, said.
His comment was believed to be aimed at Wade Boggs, who amassed 2,098 of his 3,010 hits with Boston and only 210 with Tampa Bay, but agreed contractually to go into the Hall, if he makes it, with a Devil Rays cap.

HEADLINE: COLLISION WITH CHINA: THE OVERVIEW; 
U.S. SAYS SPY CREW WIPED OUT SECRETS IN FRANTIC LANDING

BYLINE:  By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, April 13 

 BODY:
As Chinese troops surrounded the crippled American spy plane on April 1, waving their guns and shouting, the crew spent 15 furious minutes after their emergency landing destroying secret materials before opening the hatch and surrendering, senior American officials and diplomats said today. 
 It is not clear precisely how much material was destroyed. 
 "The crew completed all of its checklist," one of the diplomats here said today when asked what share of the plane's sensitive items had been destroyed -- an indication that the loss of American intelligence data and technology may not have been as great as feared. 
When asked how much had been destroyed by the crew, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, in his first public comments, said today in a briefing in Washington: "With respect to the gear, the crew has a checklist. They went through that checklist and did an excellent job of doing everything that was, I believe, possible in the period of time they had." 
He did not qualify what he meant by "excellent job," but added, upon further questioning, "The crew is being debriefed, and what we know at this present time is that they succeeded in doing a major portion of their checklist." 
Two senior diplomats who played central roles in negotiations here to win the crew's release reasserted the United States' position today: the mid-air collision with the American plane was caused by reckless flying by the pilot of a Chinese fighter jet tailing the spy plane. Beijing's rejects that assertion.
After the collision, as the American plane approached a Chinese air base on Hainan island for an emergency landing, the crew sent 15 to 25 messages on standard international frequencies warning of their imminent approach, but received no reply, the diplomats said, speaking on condition their names not be used. 
The Chinese government insisted that because it heard no distress calls or requests for permission to enter Chinese air space, the landing was illegal and said that was an additional reason for holding the crew and plane and demanding an apology. The plane is still on Hainan.
Since the crew's release on Thursday, American officials have become eager to get out their side of the story. Senior officials in Washington and Beijing, expressing resentment at Chinese accounts that blame the Americans for the collision, have provided their interpretations. 
While the release of the crew removes the most explosive element, the incident is far from closed, and what could become an acrimonious bilateral meeting is scheduled April 18 to discuss the causes of the collision, how to avoid future incidents and the return of the plane. The Chinese also insist on discussing whether the United States has the right to make surveillance flights near China's coasts.
Chinese officials have called for an end to the flights, which stay outside the 12-mile territorial zone but are near enough to monitor military secrets. The collision occurred 70 miles off Hainan, American officials say. 
The United States insists such flights are legal and will not stop, and American officials are already debating how soon to resume them.
In today's briefing here, the diplomats elaborated on the circumstances of the collision and its frantic aftermath, as well as the secret day-and-night talks in Beijing and Washington that resulted in a contrite letter from the American ambassador in return for the crew's release. 
According to their information, based largely on preliminary talks with the crew while they were still in Chinese custody, the large, propeller-driven EP-3E surveillance plane was on a steady course when a tracking Chinese F-8 fighter jet made two "fairly aggressive" passes, coming within 10 feet. 
In a third pass, just after 9 a.m. on April 1, it zoomed in fatally fast and close. The jet's tail nicked a left engine of the larger plane, and the fighter jet broke into at least two parts, the officials said. The American crew did not see whether the pilot, Wang Wei, was able to eject. He is lost at sea and has been declared a national hero in China. 
With the damage to the American plane, the flight commander, Lt. Shane Osborn, had a tense choice: to try a dangerous landing at sea, to have the crew bail out, or to attempt to land at the nearest field, in China. 
The two officials praised the crew as heroes for stabilizing the plane after a steeply angled fall of perhaps 8,000 feet, landing it safely and carrying out prescribed procedures for reducing the loss of secrets. "They did everything right, in accordance with international procedures," one diplomat said. "The Chinese say they never heard any of these calls. It could be they weren't monitoring the guard frequencies," he said referring to frequencies that all air towers are supposed to monitor.
The American version of the collision, while flatly contradicting the assertion by a second Chinese jet pilot that the American plane caused it with a sudden, huge swerve, suggests the possibility of a genuine misunderstanding. That second pilot, in the split-second confusion, could have seen the American plane banking and his comrade's jet breaking up and assumed the spy plane caused the crash.
If the American pilot did send several messages, this would undercut China's argument that the plane entered its territory illegally. Seeking to assuage that concern of the Chinese, who are exceptionally prickly about perceived infringements, the letter that Ambassador Joseph W. Prueher delivered here Thursday specifically said the United States was "very sorry" for the unauthorized entry. 
Today, the diplomats indicated some doubt that the landing was a total surprise at the base. They said the pilot of a second Chinese tracking jet, seeing the collision, had landed at the same field 10 minutes earlier; that the runway appeared to have been cleared for the damaged plane's arrival, and that the Americans signaled their intent to land with a 280-degree "clearing turn" above the air base. 
After landing, the plane was immediately surrounded by heavily armed soldiers, but the American crew spent 15 minutes running through a list of security procedures before emerging, the officials said. Soldiers peering through the windows yelled through bullhorns and pointed their weapons to "make it very clear" that the crew must stop, one said. 
The crew sent a final message home that they were "closing up" and leaving the plane, then opened the door and were taken into custody. The officials do not believe shots were fired at any point, they said. 
They also questioned reports from Chinese sources that a soldier had barged into the plane and wrestled with an American. "I don't want to be flip about this." one said. "But you take a look at Shane Osborn, there's no way he was wrestled down." 
The crew had no alternative to giving up, the officials said. One added: "They were in a disabled aircraft on the ground, after a very emotional, disabling event. There was nowhere to go."
In Washington, Secretary Rumsfeld addressed the same issue, saying, "With respect to the guards coming aboard the aircraft, they boarded the aircraft, they were armed and they invited the crew off the aircraft." When asked if the crew had been forced off at gunpoint, he said, "I do not know if the guns were even taken out of the holsters." 
In custody on Hainan, the crew members were questioned intensively by the Chinese, the diplomats said.
Ambassador Prueher, a former commander of Pacific forces, and Gen. Neal Sealock, the military attache in Beijing, learned of the collision and emergency landing at about 10:30 a.m. on the same day, but the ambassador was not granted an official meeting until 9 p.m. 
From that first meeting, with Deputy Foreign Minister Zhou Wen zhong, the chief interlocutor through the ordeal, the Chinese asserted that the American pilot had caused the collision and that the United States must bear full responsibility. 
"We'd had a bad thing happen, an accident," the diplomat said. "I think the Chinese missed an opportunity to handle it well and strengthen our relationship." 
He said it appeared "very possible" that the Chinese military had misinformed Beijing about the nature of the collision, causing a hardening of the initial position. Early in the standoff, for example, President Jiang Zemin said China had proof that an unsafe maneuver by the American pilot had caused the mishap. "The Chinese leadership appears to me to have chosen a path of confrontation when there were other paths available to them," the diplomat said. The reasons for this "are known only to them." 
In the ups and downs of negotiations, many experts theorized that the Chinese were divided, or that the military was resisting concessions. The diplomat would say only, "We spent a lot of time trying to understand the Chinese decision process." 
It was clear, he said, that in this type of situation, "the decisions are made at a very high level, they are consensus decisions and they take a long time to make." 
From the first moment of the first meeting in the Foreign Ministry, the diplomat said, all discussions were held in English, and it was tacitly understood that the American letter saying "sorry" would be offered only in English.
"That allows a little more elbow room," he said, referring to the variations in translation and interpretation of the letter given by Chinese and American leaders as they sought their way out of a politically charged confrontation. 
"I believe the Chinese when they say their foremost goal is economic modernization," the American diplomat said.

Boeing and Russia to Study Making Planes

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, April 13 

 BODY:
As Russia moves to consolidate its foundering aircraft industry, the Boeing Company and Russian government officials said today that they had agreed to study joint development of regional commercial jets to be built in Russia and sold here and abroad.
 Russia's aviation industry plunged deep into recession in the early 1990's when government orders for military and civil aircraft evaporated. The manufacturing sector is clogged with dozens of money-losing companies, while domestic commercial aviation, once dominated by a single state monolith, Aeroflot, has atomized into some 200 airlines. Many of those lines are small, cash-short regional operators with little ability to replace aging planes, many of them Soviet-era craft nearing the ends of their intended working lives. 
 In an interview on Thursday, Boeing's chief executive, Philip Condit, said his company saw a potentially profitable niche in supplying smaller jets for service among Russia's far-flung regional cities. The challenge, he said, will be to build them at a price airlines can afford.
"It's an opportunity," Mr. Condit said. Regional jets are "likely to be a very high-demand item in Russia, so you have a built-in market to start with," he said.
"There's a fascinating geography -- huge land mass, 11 time zones -- a natural market for aircraft," he continued.
Boeing said it would work with a group of Russian design companies to determine whether a new regional plane built in Russia would be viable. The two Russian-built regional models available now, the Yakovlev Yak-42 and Tupolev TU-134, are rugged but outdated, analysts say.
Boeing would contribute marketing knowledge, lease financing services and help in winning international safety certification for the new planes, a roadblock for export-minded Russian producers now.
Russia is a small sales market for Boeing, which has leased or sold just 17 planes to Russian airlines in the seven years it has done business here. But it operates its only overseas design bureau here, employing about 500 scientists and engineers who design components and develop new technology for Boeing's American-built aircraft.
Some of the bureau's innovations are a new overhead luggage bin for the Boeing 777 that opens downward and accommodates carry-on bags with wheels, and a new ceiling design for the 777 that creates room for crew sleeping quarters.
Boeing said it had spent and invested about $1 billion in Russia over the last 10 years, about a quarter of it on contracts for the United States government.

The Two George W. Bushes

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
In bringing the imbroglio with China successfully to an end, President Bush displayed qualities that had not been evident since he entered the White House. He was measured, and sensitive to the other party's interests and political needs.
 It was in striking contrast to foreign policy moves that had U.S. allies talking worriedly about his unilateralism, arrogance, bullying. One was his sudden cancellation of talks with North Korea -- to the embarrassment of the South Korean president, Kim Dae Jung, who was visiting Washington at the time. Another was his disavowal of the Kyoto protocol on global warming, which shocked Europeans. 
 Mr. Bush learned and adjusted during the China episode. After first brusquely demanding return of the U.S. spy plane's crew, he moderated his tone. He paid no attention to right-wing calls for punitive action, which would have delayed the crew's return and harmed both Chinese and American interests. (After the crew was freed he spoke more critically of China: a gesture to the right.) 
The lesson of the episode should not have been lost on Mr. Bush. For all its power, the United States cannot just impose its will on the world. Unilateralism has limits, and costs.
The interesting question now is whether Mr. Bush will think about applying that lesson in domestic affairs. For on a whole host of domestic policy issues he has sought to impose his will even more starkly.
Environmental policy is a signal example. Mr. Bush and his people have proposed radical policy changes in defiance of public feelings and of his own campaign promises.
In a campaign speech in Miami last August, for instance, Mr. Bush said he would ask Congress to relieve developing countries of $100 million in debt in exchange for the protection of tropical forests. "These forests," he said, "affect the air we breathe, the food we eat, medicines that cure disease, and are home to more than half of earth's animal and plant species."
But in the budget he announced this week, Mr. Bush allowed just $13 million for tropical forest conservation. And that money will not come from a direct appropriation but will be diverted from the Agency for International Development.
Other policy changes made by the administration have outraged the most moderate of environmental organizations. The steps include disavowal of Mr. Bush's campaign promise to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and indications that the administration will allow road-building in now-protected areas of the national forests.
The latest environmental move is notable for its sweeping character and slippery means. That is the Bush budget proposal that would undermine lawsuits to require the listing of particular animals and plants as endangered species. Instead of trying directly to amend the Endangered Species Act, the proposal would prohibit the expenditure of any funds to carry out court orders for listing -- orders that up till now have forced most of the protective steps. Officials would be required to disregard court orders: a terrible proposition in a country that prides itself on adherence to law. 
Passing these and similar proposals would involve Mr. Bush in bloody battles. The somnolent Democrats could be aroused by the environment issues. Al Gore, who has disappeared without a trace, could re-emerge. More important to Mr. Bush, his suburban supporters who care about the environment could become disaffected.
A certain logic, then, would counsel Mr. Bush to consult, consider the other side's interests and try to find mutual accommodations -- on the pattern of the China episode. But there is a sharp difference in the situations.
Mr. Bush came to office with no profound foreign policy commitments. But in domestic matters it is payback time for his supporters -- the right, business, religious groups. And there is a sense of vengeance, of getting even for years of frustration over, say, developers' inability to gut the Endangered Species Act.
And Mr. Bush's own ideology is involved, not only his supporters' wishes. But on environmental issues, above all, unilateralism is dangerous to him. Does he want to be remembered as a president who knowingly left the world a worse place for his children and grandchildren?

HEADLINE: Dole Says Trade Accord On Bananas Favors Rival 

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY DePALMA 

 BODY:
The Dole Food Company, one of the largest banana producers in the world, yesterday sharply criticized the recent agreement between the United States and the European Union to end the trade dispute over bananas.
 Dole said that the temporary import quotas outlined in the accord were contrary to principles of free trade and were likely to complicate plans to open the European banana market in 2006. 
 The accord reached earlier this week is "inconsistent with the American free enterprise system," said David H. Murdock, chairman and chief executive of Dole, which is based in Westlake Village, Calif. "All American agriculture exporters will be deeply disappointed by the action." 
The accord announced on Wednesday by Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, and Pascal Lamy, the European commissioner for trade, establishes a transition period of four and a half years beginning July 1 during which Europe will change from a system of quotas and tariffs to a tariff-only import regime in 2006.
Dole contends that the agreement favors Chiquita Brands International because it establishes a system under which European import licenses will be distributed based on import levels from 1994 to 1996.
Chiquita is the dominant American banana supplier in Europe. Before the Europeans imposed quotas in 1993, the company controlled 40 percent of the market. Now it has about a 20 percent share. Dole entered Europe later than Chiquita and as a result was a much smaller player from 1994 to 1996. 
Company officials said Dole made substantial investments over the last eight years to help it gain market share in Europe. Those steps include investments in Ecuador, which is a major producer of the bananas Dole sends to Europe.
Dole company officials had lobbied for a first-come-first-served system, which would have allowed them to gain ground in Europe. They opposed the system based on past import records, as did Ecuador, because they contended that would unfairly benefit Chiquita. 
Dole officials met with American trade officials and contributed money to political campaigns, but trade experts said Chiquita contributed more and lobbied harder to get the situation resolved. 
Chiquita officials generally expressed satisfaction with the agreement that was reached this week, noting, however, that it did not address $200 million a year in damages that they contend Chiquita suffered because of the European import quotas. The damages, they say, have brought the company to the brink of bankruptcy. 
The cross-Atlantic dispute, which soured relations between the two commercial powers and led to complaints before the World Trade Organization and retaliatory measures, began in 1993 with the European Union's decision to favor bananas from the former European colonies in Africa and the Caribbean.
Most of Chiquita's bananas are grown in Central America, where many workers are unionized and protected by worker safety and minimum wage laws. With few exceptions, workers on Ecuador's banana plantations, which are major suppliers of Dole's bananas, are not unionized, said Stephen R. Coats, executive director of the U.S./Labor Education in the Americas Project, a nonprofit group that supports workers' rights in Central America. 
Mr. Coats said the quota system based on import records that the United States and Europe have agreed to use favors Central American and Colombian banana plantations and "provides some protections to workers who are paid decent wages." Still, he said, the long-term outlook for banana workers and the banana industry is uncertain because the quota-free system that comes into place in 2006 "doesn't take into account the social and environmental conditions under which bananas are produced."
A percentage of banana imports will continue to be reserved for fruit grown in the Caribbean and in Africa, but under the agreement the total amount of bananas from that region will drop starting in January 2002, while Central and South American allotments will rise.
Mr. Murdock, Dole's chairman, said the continuation of quotas and other protectionist aspects of "managed trade" outlined by the agreement will actually block competition in Europe's market. 
"These vested interests along with their political influence will make it difficult for the European Union to actually implement an open-market, tariff-only system in 2006," he said.

HEADLINE: Airport Problems, And Solutions 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Taking greater advantage of Stewart International Airport near Newburgh, N.Y., should be a key component of any long-term solution to La Guardia Airport's gridlock problem (editorial, April 9). Stewart is situated just 60 miles from New York City. 
Using it to alleviate congestion would also provide an economic boon to Newburgh and the upstate region, which desperately needs more direct flights to the metropolitan area. 
 Efforts are already under way to upgrade Stewart's control tower and road access. West Side rail and high-speed ferry service into New York City should also be considered.
I have urged the Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of Transportation to join together to make a greater investment in Stewart. This convenient and beneficial solution should not be overlooked.

HEADLINE: A Threatened Act 

 BODY:
It was probably just a matter of time before the Bush administration tried to shorten the reach of the Endangered Species Act. The act is the most controversial of the great wave of environmental statutes enacted in the early 1970's. It also greatly annoys some of President Bush's core constituencies, like the logging and mining interests, which argue that by protecting habitat for the spotted owl and other species, the law inhibits economic development. Mr. Bush's own appointee as interior secretary, Gale Norton, once filed a brief challenging the constitutionality of the act, and now she is in charge of administering it. 
 So it was no surprise that Mr. Bush's new budget contained a provision that would weaken the act in the short run and could presage broader attacks in the future. In simplest terms, the provision would -- for one year -- relieve Ms. Norton's Fish and Wildlife Service of the obligation to address citizens' petitions or court orders aimed at getting new plants and animals on the endangered species list, as well as the related obligation to protect their habitats. The service would be required to honor existing court orders, but protecting new species would be left entirely to Ms. Norton and her subordinates. 
 For conservationists, that is not a happy prospect. Nearly every important move to protect endangered species, from Pacific salmon to the spotted owl, has originated not with the government but with citizens' petitions and lawsuits. Remove those private efforts from the equation, and some of the greatest environmental triumphs of the last 30 years would not have happened. As one critic noted, "the administration has pulled up the drawbridge on Noah's Ark, at least for a year."
The administration says that the purpose of the provision is to give it time to reorder its priorities. It argues, with some justification, that Fish and Wildlife has been overwhelmed with hundreds of petitions and lawsuits asking it to list new species and that this, in turn, has limited the agency's ability to devise rescue plans for species it has already identified as needing protection. It also points out that last November the Clinton administration, feeling similarly besieged, declared a moratorium on considering new listings so that it could address old ones. 
But getting one's house in order is not a justification for devaluing the role of individual citizens and the courts. Moreover, Congress has a habit of rolling over one-year moratoriums into succeeding years. Should that happen, a one-year deterrent to citizen lawsuits could become a permanent deterrent, with unfortunate consequences. 
The best answer would be to increase the Fish and Wildlife Service's budget for listing and protecting endangered or threatened species. Although the Bush administration has requested that the current budget of $6.3 million be increased by about $2 million, that will still leave the agency well short of the $80 million to $120 million it says it needs over the next five years to handle both old and new listings. Endangered species in this country have never had an easy time of it. Their prospects are diminishing under Mr. Bush.

HEADLINE: Bush Relaxes Clinton Rule On Central Air-Conditioners 

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 13 

 BODY:
The Bush administration said today that it would block a rule published in the last days of the Clinton administration requiring new central air-conditioners to be 30 percent more efficient than the current minimum and instead require that they be 20 percent more efficient. 
 In a statement that contrasted with President Bush's recent assertions that the nation faces an energy crisis, Spencer Abraham, the energy secretary, said energy conservation goals needed to be balanced against the need to minimize "future price increases on consumers, particularly low-income consumers." 
 The retail price difference between models meeting those standards is about $123, according to the Energy Department, for an appliance that generally costs $2,000 to $4,000. The extra cost is covered by the savings in energy over about 15 months of its 18-year average life, according to the department. 
The industry's trade association had argued that 30 percent would be "a crushing burden" for some consumers, especially those who live in centrally air-conditioned mobile homes, because the more efficient machines are larger and would not fit. That problem would discourage people from moving to more efficient models, said Edward Dooley of the Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute.
The idea that the standard should be weakened to protect the poor was attacked by supporters of the old standard, including Dan W. Reicher, an assistant secretary of energy in the Clinton administration who helped write it. 
"There are about 100-plus million households in the U.S., with 15 million classified as low-income, but of those, only 1.6 million have central air-conditioners," Mr. Reicher said. "We're going to lose, over time, a major improvement in the efficiency of the air-conditioning fleet, to save $122 per household in less than 2 percent of the people's homes."
David Nemtzow, director of the Alliance to Save Energy, a nonprofit group, said, "Guess what, poor people don't buy central air-conditioners, they tend to live in rentals." If the rented house or apartment is air-conditioned, the air-conditioner is owned by the landlord, he said, and if it is more efficient, then the tenant's bill is lower. 
A better group to worry about, Mr. Nemtzow said, was old people whose health would be threatened by summer blackouts, which are made more likely by too much electric demand and too few generating stations.
According to the Energy Department, the 20 percent improvement it now favors would eliminate the need for 27 power plants of 400 megawatts each, nationwide, by 2030. Mr. Abraham in his statement said that the result would be to "help dramatically reduce electricity demand during peak periods." 
The 30 percent improvement would avoid the need for 39 such plants, according to the department.
State governments in New York, California and Texas, worried about meeting summer electricity demands, had supported the 30 percent standard. Those states could now ask the Energy Department for permission to enforce the 30 percent standard within their own borders.
The economic difference between the two rules, taking into account higher purchase price but lower operating costs, is that a 20 percent increase would save about $2 billion over the next 30 years, compared with about $1 billion for the 30 percent standard.
But energy experts inside the department and outside acknowledged that all the estimates may be significantly off. If the price of electricity in 2010 is different from projections by only a few percent, the balance of costs and benefits to consumers may be far different.
The industry was also divided concerning the issue; Goodman Manufacturing, which owns Amana and is the second-largest producer of central air-conditioners, favored the stricter standard.
Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, said in a statement that the decision was "breathtaking in its cynicism."
"Since taking office, the president has used an 'energy crisis' as justification to weaken environmental laws," he said.
Environmental groups rushed to criticize the decision, which they said would result in extra pollution from power plants. Some suggested that it was illegal, because the 1987 law that calls for standards forbids weakening them.
Energy Department officials said, however, that even though the rule had been published in the Federal Register, they had acted before it was scheduled to take effect -- first with a 60-day delay on all rules, announced by Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff, and now with a specific decision on the standard. 
Under the Clinton rule, the "compliance date" -- when the rule would affect sales -- was 2006, to give manufacturers time to retool.
Technically, what the department did today was state its intention to propose a new standard. The Clinton standard was in the works for six years; it was not immediately clear how long a new one would take.

HEADLINE: CRIME 

BYLINE:  By Marilyn Stasio 

 BODY:
If trial by jury actually works the way it plays out in David Cray's BAD LAWYER (Otto Penzler/Carroll & Graf, $24), we might be better off under the imperial thumb. "The truth was that guilt or innocence (except as pronounced by a jury) didn't particularly interest me," says Sid Kaplan, a New York criminal lawyer who was on top of his game before he crashed on cocaine and arrogance. Now that he's straight and sober, Sid is itching to get back into action, and when a distraught mother asks him to handle her daughter's murder defense, he grabs his chance. The defendant, Priscilla Sweet, admits that she shot her husband, and that they were both dealing drugs. But Priscilla is white and shrewd, her victim was black and abusive, and Sid figures he can con the press and pull off his cynical Roxie Hart defense of a poor, helpless, battered woman.
 Cray, a pseudonymous writer who is said to know "a great deal about crime and bad lawyers," proves a master manipulator, treating the trial scenes with sardonic humor while taking us through the brick-by-brick process by which Sid builds his brilliant legal case and seals his fate. Sid may be familiar with abstract concepts of truth and justice, but he lives by his belief that "the corrupt inner nature of the criminal justice system mirrors the corrupt inner nature of humanity." 
 Guido Tarkenen, the debauched and depressive hero of Rick DeMarinis's off-the-ivy-wall academic mystery, A CLOD OF WAYWARD MARL (Dennis McMillan Publications, 11431 East Gunsmith Drive, Tucson, Ariz. 85749, $30), writes the kind of genre fiction you want to keep out of impressionable children's hands: "slasher trash" like "She Screamed Bloody Murder," a 300-page paperback thriller "with 27 anatomically detailed, sexually motivated serial murders," and "The Milksop Strangler," the opus on which he is currently stalled. Before he can work through his writer's block, Guido has to salvage his teaching job at La Siberia Tech, a state college on the Mexican border whose best scholars are being murdered, possibly by the multinational company that wants to turn the school into a laboratory for revolutionary virtual-reality toys.
More important than unmasking the killer, Guido has to come to terms with his wayward imagination and decide what kind of writer he wants to be. "Look at it this way," the mad-dog protagonist of his latest potboiler lectures him. "I'm not in your head, I am your head. You are what you think." DeMarinis, whose last novel was "The Mortician's Apprentice," doesn't strain himself to pull the sinister doings at La Siberia into a coherent plot, but he pumps plenty of black-comedy gusto into his renegade hero's academic breakdown and moral recovery. And in the end, he reassures us that rebel lit is not yet lost.
Carol Anne Davis couldn't have picked more deserving people to torment than the complacent Scottish couple who become unraveled in her twisted psychological thriller NOISE ABATEMENT (Do-Not Press/Dufour, cloth, $29.95; paper, $15.95). Quiet, colorless, unfailingly polite, Stephen and Caroline Day are utterly bereft of the survival skills needed to cope with the three young idiots who move into the apartment above and shatter the peace of their Edinburgh neighborhood with earsplitting music and raucous parties. Goaded beyond endurance, Stephen and Caroline summon their inadequate defenses. They try the cops, they try environmental agencies, they try pushing one of their neighbors down a flight of stairs. Stephen "hadn't known till this morning that he was capable of such overwhelming rage," and he eventually goes too far in retaliating for his pain. He pays the price. Unfortunately, we know so little about his character outside the immediate frame of the story that his heavily ironic comeuppance seems more a contrivance than poetic justice for his moral deterioration.
Things get off to a macabre start in Timothy Sheard's offbeat procedural, THIS WON'T HURT A BIT (Creative Arts, paper, $15.95), when a student at a Philadelphia teaching hospital identifies the cadaver she is dissecting in anatomy class as a medical resident she once slept with. Although hospital administrators are relieved when a troublesome laundry worker is charged with the murder, outraged staff members go to their union representative, a scrappy custodian named Lenny Moss, and ask him to find the real killer. Since there's no merit to the case against the laundry worker to begin with, Lenny is just wasting his time. But Sheard, a veteran nurse, makes sure that readers do not waste theirs. His intimate view of Lenny's world is a gentle eye-opener into the way a large institution looks from a workingman's perspective. "The doctors and the supervisors don't hardly notice us," a nurses' aide says of the orderlies, security guards, secretaries, seamstresses and other "invisible" service workers who keep a hospital humming. "But we see everything."
Mystery writers rarely venture to the north of England, to gritty Tyneside cities like Newcastle and Shields that watched their shipping industries sink into recession during the modern age of technology. And yet, as Roy Lewis establishes with cool efficiency in A FORM OF DEATH (Allison & Busby/International Publishers Marketing, $24.95), it's a region where dockside rats and drug smugglers and enterprising businessmen can get together on any number of criminal schemes. There's enough traffic, at any rate, to guarantee work for Eric Ward, a lawyer who has a rich wife and a stake in a big merchant bank but maintains an old-fashioned commitment to his own "miserable practice in Newcastle, dealing with the grubby underbelly of Tyneside life." When his chilly wife takes herself to Hong Kong on business, Ward dallies with an up-market prostitute whose murder brings him to the attention of both the police and the killer. Despite some obvious finger-pointing at a villain who "snarled," "snapped," "sneered" and "averred" his evil intentions, Lewis smartly moves the hero in and out of his bind while making his devotion to his shady waterfront clientele entirely understandable.

 GANDHI'S PASSION
The Life and Legacy
of Mahatma Gandhi.
By Stanley Wolpert.
Illustrated. 308 pp. New York:
Oxford University Press. $27.50.
 In 1894, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi arrived in South Africa as a young shiftless lawyer from India. He planned to spend a year; he ended up spending two extraordinary decades during which he moved from being the resentful victim of local racial humiliations to the initiator of a wholly new kind of political activism based upon nonviolence. When he finally left South Africa in 1914, after having organized a small and frequently trampled-upon Indian minority into a significant political force, his greatest Afrikaner adversary, Gen. Jan Smuts, was relieved enough to write to a friend, "The saint has left our shores, I hope, forever." 
More than 30 years later, a few months after India's long-delayed independence in 1947, Gandhi was assassinated by a Hindu Brahmin named Nathuram Godse, who turned out to have been one of the many rationalists exasperated and bewildered by Gandhi. In a remarkably coherent statement in court, Godse explained that he had killed Gandhi in order to cleanse India of such "old superstitious beliefs" as the "power of the soul, the inner voice, the fast, the prayer and the purity of the mind." He had felt that nonviolence of the kind Gandhi advocated could only "lead the nation toward ruin." With Gandhi out of the way, Godse said, India would be "free to follow the course founded on reason which I consider to be necessary for sound nation-building"; it would "surely be practical, able to retaliate, and would be powerful with armed forces."
Far from being a lone gunman, Godse spoke for millions of educated Hindus, including some of Gandhi's closest disciples, who felt that the "father of the nation" was a burden upon a country that now had to be governed in modern, rational ways. There can be little doubt that if Godse had lived to see India's nuclear tests of 1998, he would have been among the middle-class Hindus who cheered the prime minister's announcement that "India has the capacity for a big bomb."
It was the tests, and the euphoric reaction to them, that shocked Stanley Wolpert, an emeritus professor of South Asian history at the University of California, Los Angeles, into writing "Gandhi's Passion." Wolpert had previously published biographies of Mohammed Ali Jinnah, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Jawaharlal Nehru. But Gandhi lived out his life more publicly than any of them -- he made no attempt to conceal even the weird experimenting of his last year, when he slept naked with young women in order to test his sexual self-control. Gandhi is also written about more widely and diversely than any other South Asian leader, and the best that can be said about Wolpert's book is that while it tells you nothing about Gandhi that hasn't been said before, it doesn't oversimplify its subject.
For Gandhi eludes easy description. Born in 1869, half a century after the British consolidation in India, he was among the first Western-educated Indians to realize how thoroughly a colonized people had been denuded of its identity and self-respect. It was his task to discover new values and ideals for himself as well as for his countrymen; and in this, he was, above all, an improviser, "neither an Arcadian nor a Utopian," as Richard Lannoy, one of the more distinguished writers on Gandhi, put it, but a "relentless explorer of immediacy -- immediate needs, immediate means, immediate ends." 
This is why it is hard to describe him as an intellectual or a politician, or indeed the Hindu sage he was often taken to be in India. As an insecure small-town Indian in Victorian England, trying to be more English than the English, Gandhi awakened to his Hindu ancestry and heritage. In South Africa, confronted with a depressed Indian minority and an arrogant government, he appealed to the same liberal-humanist values of Western civilization that he had absorbed in England through personal friendships and through readings in Ruskin, Thoreau and Emerson. In India, he came into his own as a leader of the Hindus, but not before he had cast a cold expatriate eye on the corruptions of Hinduism.
Few Indians in his time denounced more strongly, or worked harder to end, the practice of untouchability, the appalling sanitary conditions in Indian villages and towns, the distrust between Hindus and Muslims. For Gandhi, liberation from British rule meant nothing if it wasn't preceded by severe self-appraisal and social reform within Indian society. Wolpert quotes him as saying early in his career that "we should learn to be men, to be a nation"; and the operative word here is "learn." He often seemed self-contradictory: he attacked untouchability, for instance, but at the same time he spoke in favor of the caste system, which, according to him, worked well in the past and could be made to do so again in the future. 
Many of his more Westernized followers, like Nehru, despaired at his seemingly quixotic rejection of the Industrial Revolution, his partiality for small, self-sufficient villages, his distrust of overcentralized nation-states. But Gandhi preferred to find sanction for the radical changes he proposed in the long Indian past. For instance, he managed to reinterpret the Bhagavad-Gita, which was read by many of his contemporaries as a call to arms, as an argument for nonviolence and continuous self-awareness. Quite apart from pragmatic considerations -- Gandhi, after all, was working within a highly traditional society -- he felt it important for a conquered people to look for fresh identity and dignity in its own traditions. India, he believed, must find its own way. To attempt to beat the West at its own game, as Japan was then doing, was already to admit defeat. 
Appropriately, his political method, satyagraha, attempted to change the rules of the game. As he saw it, a nonviolent movement against the British could not be, as national liberation struggles usually were, a zero-sum contest, with clearly defined winners and losers. He exhorted the Indian masses to resist demonizing the British, to make them participate in a process of self-questioning and self-purification. His aim was to bring about a moral transformation among the British, to the point where they themselves would share with their victims an awareness of the profound evil of colonialism: how the suffering created by organized exploitation touched both exploiter and victim. Only such an awareness could create the possibility of compassion and reconciliation between peoples and nations. 
Wolpert mentions Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela as having drawn inspiration from Gandhi's methods. Disappointingly, he doesn't go into the manifold ways Gandhi's distrust of modernity has found echoes among many political and environmental movements around the world. Gandhi's opposition to the railways seemed absurd in the early 20th century. But his argument that the railways encouraged grain owners to sell their wares in the dearest markets and thereby undermine local small-scale economies would make sense to the anti-globalization protesters of today. 
In retrospect, Gandhi appears to have possessed a peculiarly instinctive grasp of historical realities. The idealists spoke of the syncretic civilization of India, of the essential unity between Hindus and Muslims. But more than most, Gandhi understood how intense the animosity and distrust between Hindus and Muslims had become under British rule -- an insight sadly played out first in the partition of India and then in the relations between India and Pakistan. 
Goodness and sincerity of the kind Gandhi embodied go only so far in politics; and there is cruel irony in the fact that his attempt at bringing Hindus and Muslims together on the platform offered by the Hindu-dominated Congress Party nourished Muslim insecurities and fears, leading to the demand for Pakistan. There is even greater irony in the fact that during the last lonely months of Gandhi's life, as the savagery that accompanied the partition of India intensified, the Muslims continued to think of him as a promoter of Hindu interests, while the Hindus accused him of being partial to Muslims.
Gandhi was tormented by his failure, and half longed for death, but still he persevered. The abandoned leader fasting in a derelict house and bringing about, through his moral power, an end to the sectarian violence in Calcutta; the frail man in his late 70's walking barefoot through riot-torn villages in East Bengal, where hostile locals strewed shattered glass on his path; the anguished witness of an independent India planning to travel to Pakistan and work for Hindu-Muslim accord -- Gandhi in his last days was truly magnificent. A sense of the glory and the tragedy of the man can be gained even from Wolpert's somewhat perfunctory biography.

HEADLINE: The Last Straw 

BYLINE:  By Michael Sokolove; Michael Sokolove is the author of "Hustle: The Myth, Life and Lies of Pete Rose." This is his first article for the magazine.

 BODY:
Darryl Strawberry was beautiful. That was the first thing you noticed. A pure physical glory. The young slugger was long and lean and popping with sinewy muscle, not the kind manufactured in the weight room or purchased from the supplement aisle at the vitamin store, but the real thing. God-given, if you believe in that.
 At 18 years old, he stood six-foot-five and weighed 180 pounds. He had the body of a basketball forward and the swing -- a powerful, looping uppercut -- of a historic home run hitter. He made normally cautious baseball men gush. "The best prospect I've seen in the last 30 years," the legendary scout, Hugh Alexander, said in 1980, when Strawberry was a senior at Crenshaw High in Los Angeles. Sports Illustrated profiled him that spring, and sportswriters began to refer to him as "the black Ted Williams." 
 One afternoon at Crenshaw, a big white Lincoln pulled up beside the practice field, and a man in an expensive-looking suit got out and approached the star while he was shagging fly balls. Strawberry talked to him; he was no good then, or ever, at telling anyone to go away. His coach, Brooks Hurst, came sprinting out to right field. 
"Who the hell are you?" shouted Hurst, who considered the ball field sanctified ground. "Get off my field and don't ever come back!" The man took Hurst aside, told him he wanted to be Strawberry's agent. "Would you be interested in going to Palm Springs this weekend?" he asked the high-school gym teacher. "I could put you up."
Hurst chased the would-be agent off. "But there was this circus around Darryl," he says now. "It just kept getting bigger, and he was the last person in the world who could control it."
The New York Mets, then a lowly, bad-box-office franchise, chose Strawberry with the first pick in the June 1980 amateur draft. They paid him a $200,000 bonus to forgo a college scholarship, flew him to New York and proudly showed him off at a news conference and luncheon -- an event that began with the playing of the Beatles song "Strawberry Fields Forever." Even in his jacket and tie, and with his mother, Ruby, affixed to his side, Strawberry moved with a lovely athletic grace. "He had a certain majestic quality to him that you see only in a few young players," recalls Frank Cashen, the former Mets general manager.
A great many New Yorkers fell hard for Darryl Strawberry that summer, fell just for the news of his arrival before ever seeing him play, because that is what sports fans do. They hook onto a young player, the showier and more ballyhooed the better, and give him their hope and devotion. The ballplayer stays a part of their lives for years. He outlasts marriages. The fan invests in a narrative and in return hopes to follow it to its natural, not unnatural, conclusion.
We imagined Darryl Strawberry, awaited his thrills, and then watched as his life unfolded in fast forward, as the young man who rippled with greatness became sick and confused and old. Late last month, he fled his court-ordered drug treatment program in Tampa and descended into a four-day crack-cocaine binge -- in motel rooms in Tampa and Orlando -- with a female friend and five armed men who he said robbed him of his jewelry. 
He fled rehab one day before his once-a-week chemotherapy treatment, a highly toxic experimental regimen to treat his virulent colon cancer. These sessions left him violently ill, not just after the treatment but also sometimes before it -- from sheer dread. He ran as the Yankees got ready to head north at the end of spring training and leave him behind, a moment when he had fallen into trouble before.
And there was one other marker: Darryl Strawberry ran just one day before he was to receive a "sleepover pass" that would have allowed him, for the first time in five months, to spend the night at home with his second wife, Charisse, and their three young children, who have been living nearby while he undergoes treatment.
What made him run? "You can't ask that," says his close friend Ray Negron. "He's a junkie. There's never a rational explanation."
"Where is the good stuff?" asks Darryl Strawberry, who has hit home runs in World Series games, made millions, fathered children. 
It is April 14, 1999, and he sits behind the wheel of a gold-colored Ford Expedition. Strawberry carries no cash / save a $20 bill rolled around half a gram of cocaine / just credit cards, in his Louis Vuitton wallet. His left hip pocket is stuffed with a wad of bills, $1,159. 
If Crenshaw High was the beginning of the legend and the promise of Darryl Strawberry, superstar -- the first flash of the phenom who would open our eyes to what was possible on the field of play -- this is the beginning of the end. 
And in between? Let it be said, just for the moment, that Darryl Strawberry delivered. He truly was epic. Larger than life and achingly human. So much so that sometimes you wanted to avert your eyes. 
"I am the good stuff," says Kellie Daniel, as she sidles up to the vehicle.
Strawberry is parked near Caf 1/8 Con Trey, which shares a stretch of highway on the outskirts of downtown Tampa with a bail bondsman, a liquor store and a billboard that asks sinners to turn to Jesus. The area is a geographical void, a space, a nowhere land. How does a famous American find his way to such a place? Darryl Strawberry is drawn here, utterly defenseless against his worst impulses. He suffers a version of a compromised immune system; he cannot fend off the bad stuff. 
Strawberry, at this point in 1999, is 37 years old and still a valued member of the world champion New York Yankees. The team has left Florida to begin the regular season. Strawberry's second wife, Charisse, and their two children (they now have three) await him in their New Jersey home. Rehabilitating an injured knee -- but well enough to play after colon cancer surgery the previous October -- Strawberry is expected to rejoin the Yankees in a matter of weeks. His agent tells him earlier that evening: "You're going to have a great year, Darryl. You're going to be healthy. You're going to put up numbers. You're going to make $2.5 million." 
Now, just two hours after that conversation, he is bantering with Kellie Daniel, Officer Kellie Daniel of the Tampa police, a decoy in a prostitution sting. "How can I get some good stuff to party with?" Strawberry asks. 
From anyone on the street, she says.
He says he wants to "party" with her; she asks what exactly he wants.
"I want it all," he says.
"You mean you want straight sex?"
"Yes," he answers, and when she asks how much he is willing to spend, he says $50.
Officer Daniel gives a hand signal, and her superior officer drives up. Sgt. Marc Hamlin, five years younger than Strawberry, grew up in Queens and cheered him maybe a couple of hundred times from the cheap seats at Shea Stadium. He has seen Strawberry at nightspots. He's a huge fan. "Oh, my God!" the officer says to himself as the spotlight from a nearby squad car illuminates the sad, ashamed face of Darryl Strawberry.
A search turns up the half gram of cocaine in Strawberry's wallet, as well as traces on his Automobile Club of Southern California membership card. He is charged, and ultimately pleads nolo contendere to solicitation of prostitution and cocaine possession. This is the incident for which he will break parole three times. Hamlin's report states that Strawberry "continually apologized and was very remorseful. . . . He asked several times if there was anything that we could do to change the situation because this was going to ruin his career."
Local address? 
"One Steinbrenner Drive," he says. The address of the Yankees spring training site.
"I had a cloudy day today," Darryl Strawberry tells me one evening in late March. "You know, I woke up, and it was all gray outside. And that's how I felt all day. I was kind of down."
As we talk, it is one week before he will flee Healthcare Connections, his drug-rehab program. He says he has no thought of playing baseball again. It has been more than a year since he even held a bat in his hands, and he has lost a lot of weight; he now weighs about what what he did in his early years with the Mets. He has been living in an apartment near the center with three other men. "We have to do for ourselves," Strawberry says. "We clean. We cook. We grilled some steaks the other night, and they came out pretty good."
His free time is spent reading the Bible and various meditations on the subject of recovery. He can watch TV only on weekends. His family visits regularly, and he has been permitted to spend some time with them at the home they rent in nearby Lutz, Fla. He tells me that he is looking forward to his sleepover pass, that he has worked hard and pushed himself in rehab to earn the privilege. "You get to certain steps in your recovery, more privileges come along with that," he explains. "You always want things sooner than you can have them, but that's not their agenda here. They don't want to work you back into life too fast."
He has had countless hours of treatment for substance abuse, starting in 1990. I ask if it ever bores him. "I'm not gonna sit here and tell you it doesn't," he says. "I'd be tellin' a tale if I said that. But when it gets boring is when you really have to sit there and hear what has to be said."
The conversations I have with Strawberry take place over the telephone, because contact with the media is one of the many things his addiction counselors want to eliminate from his life. (They believe it is at cross purposes with the therapeutic goal of "ego deflation." ) A couple of times when we talk, I can hear Motown music - the Supremes, the Four Tops -- playing in his room. It reminds me how old Strawberry is, how long he has been a part of the landscape.
There are people like him in every generation -- Charlie Parker, Judy Garland, Robert Downey Jr. -- artists and entertainers who bring great pleasure to everyone but themselves. Stone-cold addicts who can't keep it together. They rarely have insight into their own lives, and never a satisfying answer to the inevitable question: how could you throw it all away? If they did, they wouldn't be in the spot they're in. 
Strawberry doesn't have answers; he has feelings: sadness, faith, fear, regret, love, shame, hope, resignation, gratitude. "I'm not in a disappointment part of my life," he says when we first begin talking. It is his way of saying that he will not deal in sharp angles or blame, that he will do only so much revisiting of fact.
The restrictions on his freedom and the drug treatment were imposed as part of a two-year "community control" sentence imposed last November, after he broke his probation on the 1999 cocaine and prostitution solicitation charges. A handful of friends sat in a small courtroom at the probation hearing in which he narrowly escaped jail. Among them was Dwight Gooden, who long ago in 1980's New York shared with Strawberry searing stardom and a sense of youthful invincibility. Gooden listened impassively as his old teammate told Circuit Court Judge Florence Foster: "I'm not a danger to society. I've never harmed nobody. I never will. . . . I'd rather go ahead and kill myself, but the reason I haven't killed myself is my five children. It wouldn't be fair to them."
Ballplayers live by statistics, and Strawberry still does -- although now by an entirely different set of them. His urine is tested three times a week for drugs. Until he tested positive for cocaine after his most recent spree, he had been clean since he entered rehab in November. "I'm putting together a lot of time clean," he says, as if recounting a long hitting streak.
The cancer calls forth more numbers, not good numbers. When colon cancer recurs somewhere else in the abdomen, as it did in Strawberry's case, surgeons succeed in getting it all out less than 20 percent of the time, according to Dr. Carmen Allegra, a colorectal cancer specialist at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md. And even when they do, the median survival rate is no better than five years. For the majority of patients, those with the less successful surgeries, the median survival rate is between 14 and 16 months. 
Strawberry is remarkably sanguine about the statistics. When we talk, he sounds sad and brave at the same time. "I know my odds aren't very good, but that's O.K.," he says. "I accept that. Each and every one of us will come to a point in our lives where the odds are not in our favor."
Look at any picture of Darryl Strawberry. It's remarkable how often it looks as if in the next instant he might cry. He is perpetually on the verge. Of tears, laughter, a life-wrecking lapse, a game-breaking home run. 
Even his batting stance was built for drama. He waggled his bat as the pitcher began his windup, set his weight back, lifted his right foot high and then, as the ball sped toward the plate, explosively fired his hips and whipped the bat through the hitting zone. There are less complicated ways to hit -- fewer moving parts, a more compact swing -- but Strawberry always resisted them. His approach produced towering home runs, bushelfuls of strikeouts, prolonged droughts and sizzling streaks. When his big frame and big swing were in rhythm, he was fearsome. 
"There was a certain way Darryl looked when he was really locked in," says a former Met teammate, Hubie Brooks. "It was like his whole body was alive. When he was like that, you just knew all hell was going to break loose." Once, when he was on one of those streaks, the St Louis Cardinals' manager, Whitey Herzog, had him walked intentionally with the bases empty.
His inventory of troubles over the last decade has been staggering: knee and back surgeries; arrests for spousal abuse (no charges were filed) and for failure to pay child support; a federal conviction for tax evasion; serial episodes of substance abuse. It's hard to say what is the greater marvel: that Strawberry laid waste to his career or that he managed to have one at all. Only his prodigious talent kept him in the game. "I never had a problem hitting," Strawberry says. "I had a problem living."
When George Steinbrenner first came to his rescue in 1995 -- after the player was no longer young and had undermined his body and career in a dozen different ways -- Strawberry began his Yankee habit of resurfacing at some point in the summer to make memorable late-season contributions. He even began 1996 with the St. Paul Saints of the independent Northern League, a baseball equivalent of dinner theater in Trenton, and by season's end was swatting October home runs and leading the Yankees into a World Series.
But the big New York stage and late-season heroics served only to highlight what could have been. In Strawberry's eight seasons after turning 30, he played a substantial portion of only one, when he in played 101 games (of a 162-game season) for the 1998 Yankees. In six of those seasons (including two shortened by strikes) he played in fewer than 50 games. Since 1992, he has hit just 52 home runs. 
His career home run total stands at 335. In what should have been his late prime, the ballparks were getting smaller, the pitchers more hittable and, by many accounts, the ball livelier. Five hundred home runs punches a ticket to Cooperstown. Six hundred enshrines a player among the greats of the greats, the pantheon of Mays, Ruth, Aaron. How many, in the natural order of things, should Strawberry have hit?
"Six hundred," says his old Mets manager, Davey Johnson. "He had the swing, the grace, the power. When he wanted to be, he was as good as it gets. But the thing is, I don't think he was hungry or mean enough to do the 600-home-run deal. Darryl is no dummy. He was comfortable hitting 30 home runs a year and stealing 30 bases. He knew what it would take to do more, and he didn't want to do it. He made a calculation. To be one of the real greats, it has to be your whole world, and Darryl had other worlds going on."
A real superstar is mean in a particular way. He is Michael Jordan or Cal Ripken, greedy for records and history. Armored and self-contained, his inner core is a hard knot of physical talent and fierce will. Nothing penetrates that core, and anybody or anything that gets too close is out of his life.
Strawberry had none of that. Not the inner core or the greed, and especially not the armor. Sometimes he was too nice. Always, he was too sensitive. "Darryl feels everything," says Hurst, his former high school coach. "He absorbs everything. That's how he goes through life."
Fans, particularly those of opposing teams, sensed this. As early as 1984, Chicago Cubs fans were derisively chanting "DAR-ryl, DAR-ryl," a haunting chorus that was picked up by crowds around the league -- even in his home park.
Much of what Strawberry felt so intensely, and could not repel, were the wants and needs of those around him. In many ways, the financial devastation of his life is as astonishing as the emotional devastation. And they are connected. Whatever belonged to Darryl -- his career, his good name, his money -- he did not adequately value. Everything that was his, he let others get at.
Strawberry made about $30 million in baseball and has virtually nothing left. Much of what he made he gave away. To his mother, his father and his four siblings. To his first wife, Lisa, whose clothing business, Strawberry Patch Kids, hemorrhaged money. 
He gave to Darryl Strawberry Enterprises, another money pit, which provided salaries for his mother and siblings after Ruby Strawberry convinced him that his fame made it impossible for his brothers and sisters to get jobs. "I told her that was ridiculous," says Richie Bry, Strawberry's first agent. "I told Darryl that. But they started a business with Darryl's money, and all it did was suck money from him."
As often as not, Strawberry did not have to be asked -- he just gave. He gave away a Mercedes, a Jeep and, after he got tired of living in it, a house. He gave to his inner circle of friends and to his outer circle. Strawberry was hardly the first or last athlete to turn his pockets inside out for those around him. "I have seen it a hundred times," says Bry. "A guy makes it, and the people back home get hungry."
But his giving was extreme. He was a big, generous sap in the Joe Louis mold, helpless against grasping hands. "I gave from my heart," Darryl says now. "If people took for the wrong reasons, that's on them."
Court documents show that in one month alone, April 1992, he wrote $22,000 in checks to various relatives. That same month, he paid an American Express bill of $65,616, wrote an $11,650 check to a BMW dealership and a $20,000 check to a jeweler. This was during the peak of his playing and earning power -- Strawberry in 1992 was in the middle of a five-year, $20 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers -- but even so, the ballplayer and his first wife "basically blew threw every penny they had," says Robert Gaston, who was Lisa Strawberry's divorce lawyer. 
"Darryl picked up the tab for everyone," Gaston says. "If he wanted to go to Las Vegas, he would charter a jet and fly a bunch of people with him. He would think nothing of it."
The squandering of talent, career and money were all of a piece. "It drained him financially, and it drained him emotionally," says Eric Grossman, Strawberry's current agent. "There was always this pull on him to be a gravy train even when his own life was in chaos." By the time he came back to New York in 1995, "he was paying debt after debt after debt. They lived paycheck to paycheck."
In recent years, Darryl, Charisse and their children / Jordan, 7, Jade, 6, and Jewel, 9 months -- lived in a rental house in Fort Lee, N.J., a modest place near the George Washington Bridge that shared a driveway with a next-door neighbor -- hardly a deprivation, but a comedown for a lavishly paid superstar. 
"So many people fed off Darryl," says Jay Horwitz, the Mets longtime publicity director. "Even his mother, may she rest in peace."
The last remnant of the Strawberry largess is a house in the San Gabriel Valley about one hour east of downtown Los Angeles, a four-bedroom split-level with mountain views that Darryl built for Ruby, who died of breast cancer in 1996. 
Nine people live here now: Darryl's sister Michelle and her daughter; his sister Regina, her husband and their four children; and Anthony Strawberry, Ruby's 19-year-old adopted son. The house is pleasant but shows signs of wear and tear. The roof appears to need work. A green shag carpet in the living room is tired-looking. 
There's a little Darryl shrine around a fireplace, pictures of him at various stages of his career. In one, a very young-looking Darryl is posed in a Mets uniform with his arm around his mother. They're standing in front of a new Buick Riviera, the first car he bought after he signed out of high school.
When I knock on the door, I am told by Anthony that no one else is home, but a few minutes later Michelle, 36, Darryl's youngest sister, comes to greet me. She is broad-shouldered and skinny and has the same expressive face and openness of her famous brother. Darryl was the middle child of Ruby and Henry Strawberry's five children, between two older brothers and two younger sisters.
When I ask Michelle who the owner of this house is, she says: "Basically, us. We are. The house is free and clear. There were too many things attached to him," which I take to mean that this house is beyond the reach of anyone who might like to seize it. "This is the foundation right here. It's not going anywhere. This is where all the grandkids grew up. This is where they all still come. You know, this place is for everybody. This is the rock."
Darryl calls every week or so, she says. "He always asks, 'Are you guys O.K.?' That's what he wants to know. Even with everything he's been through, his addictions and everything, we don't feel he's let us down."
(When Darryl was on the lam, Michelle says, he called the house and spoke to his sister Regina. "He called here one time and one time only," she told me at one point, while he was still missing. "The only thing we know is he's safe, and it wasn't drug-related. That's what he said.")
Ruby wanted her children to have togetherness, and they do. Michelle likes to believe that when he is free to, Darryl will plop himself in a chair in her living room, unfold his long legs and sit for hours watching televised sports while the women lavish him with home-cooked food. 
It is easy to see why Darryl would feel at home here, where he is measured by his devotion to family rather than by his lifetime home run total. Here, an alternate reality is observed: Darryl didn't blow a Hall of Fame career; he just had too much to handle. He was blinded by New York, buried by sports-page hype. Darryl was more a bystander than an actor in his own life. He was awesomely powerful from the left side of the batter's box, powerless everywhere else. Things happened to him.
"Darryl is a passive person," Michelle says. "The Strawberrys are all passive people." 
Darryl's pain, his sister says, has rippled through the whole Strawberry clan. "We've been very quiet, but we've been the backbone to Darryl. Everything he's felt, we've felt."
In one way, for sure, it is hard to be a Strawberry. It's an uncommon name, and every time a family member shows an ID or writes a check they are asked about their famous relative. They have grown weary of it over the years and do not go out of their way to be found by the press. Darryl's father, Henry, now lives in San Diego. One of his brothers, Ronnie, has been in and out of jail over the years. Michael Strawberry, the oldest, is a former minor league ballplayer and ex-L.A. cop who left the force in the mid-90's to come out on the road to try to shield Darryl from drugs and temptation. But he has fallen on hard times himself in recent years. On the day I visited with Michelle, Michael Strawberry was in Los Angeles County Central Jail, awaiting trial on forgery charges. (Later he would plead guilty and be sentenced to probation.)
"We didn't really require a lot of him," Michelle says of the money that flowed over the years."We just asked him to do whatever he wanted to do. You know, we really didn't care. People were against it. They thought we weren't his responsibility, and he didn't owe us anything. But we never thought he did. Whatever Darryl did, he did from the heart."
I ask how many cars Darryl gave to family. "I don't know," Michelle says. "One, two, three, four, five . . . it was quite a few. I really can't remember. They were always good cars -- Mercedes, Jaguars, Porsches. You know, maybe that was the problem. Maybe there were just too many of us. If he got tired of something, he would just give it away. One time he didn't want a house anymore, so he just gave it to my brother Michael. That's just how he was."
Henry Strawberry was a postal worker and a fine athlete himself -- a locally famous football and softball player in sandlot leagues around L.A. Ruby Strawberry, a secretary at Pacific Bell, was devout and strikingly pretty. The family lived in a stucco house in the Crenshaw district in what was then a decent neighborhood. "People assumed Darryl came from a poverty background," says Hubie Brooks, who was raised in nearby Compton. "They tend to assume that of all black athletes who come from the inner city. But he didn't. People in that neighborhood went to work. They owned their own homes. They had yards, and they cut their grass." 
At 12, Darryl's life changed abruptly after what he has described as a physical confrontation between the Strawberry boys and their father -- over his gambling and drinking, which were wrecking family life and finances. Henry Strawberry left home that night, and Ruby filed for divorce soon after. Having played a part in his father's exit, Darryl Strawberry said in a 1992 autobiography written with Art Rust Jr., left him feeling "wrong, shameful, guilty, and I have not not been able to see things clearly since."
He has also said his father beat him when he was drunk, which Ruby Strawberry denied in a 1995 Sports Illustrated story. "I'm not that kind of mother. I would not have allowed it with my kids." But, she added, it was important if "that's the way he remembers it."
Darryl says now: "I can't tell you why my Mom denied that. But nobody wants to admit that they're in a family where there's physical abuse."
The concept of punishment comes up again and again with Darryl. The unfair punishment he was dealt at home, he says, led to his substance abuse. "That's a form of punishment," he tells me. "And I was very good at punishing myself."
For years after his father left home, Strawberry exuded a particular kind of neediness that made older baseball men believe they were filling a void, the gap left by his father. They believed this even as they knew he was disregarding their guidance. "I'm not your father, but I'm as close as you're going to get," Bry once told him. Frank Cashen: "He was almost like a son to me. I felt close to him." Davey Johnson: "I would talk to him like a friend, and also like a son." 
Brooks Hurst first encountered Strawberry on a day he came to pick up his brother Michael, who was then on his Crenshaw High team. Darryl was sitting on a step outside the house, eating a candy bar. From the very first, he struck Brooks as a sad boy. "It was hard to get joy out of Darryl," says Hurst, who has remained close to him. "It was hard for him to be truly happy. I always thought after baseball was over for Darryl he would be happier."
No one can remember a time when Darryl Strawberry did not love sports, when he did not always have some kind of ball in his hands. But sports to him was about playing, not striving or working. When I ask Allan Lans, the Mets longtime team psychologist, if Strawberry really liked playing major-league baseball, he replies: "I'm not sure. I think Darryl liked shooting hoops in the backyard."
Hurst kicked him off the team in 10th grade for not hustling, telling him, "I hope you'll come back next year." But the Mets rarely chanced such discipline on their prized player. 
It is, perhaps, a clich 1/8 to say that ballplayers never have to grow up, that they rarely face adult consequences. But it is true. And the bigger the star, the truer it is. Strawberry was coddled. He certainly became selfish, but not in a way that served him.
Soon after he left home at age 18 for Kingsport, Tenn., to begin his quick ascent through the minor leagues, he got a taste of celebrity -- strawberry sundae promotions, strawberry shortcake giveaways, all manner of Darryl Strawberry buzz in every new city he visited. And he got a taste, as well, of the franchise player's life of entitlement. 
On at least two occasions in the minors, female employees at hotels lodged complaints against him. The incidents were quietly handled and kept out of the news. "The Mets would call me in," Bry says when I ask him about these incidents. "The team would talk to the maid and the hotel management. One way or the other, it would get taken care of. It would get quashed. It was never anything brutal. It was obscene language, or tiny rough stuff."
The Mets called Strawberry to the big leagues in May 1983. He was ready physically -- ready enough that he earned National League Rookie of the Year honors -- but emotionally raw. The team had planned to let him mature all that season in the minor leagues. "Cashen didn't want to bring him up," recalls Jay Horwitz, the Mets' P.R. director. "But we were so bad. We were dying for publicity, and we had the black Ted Williams down in the minor leagues."
Everyone was so exhilarated by the whole Darryl Strawberry package. Massive Darryl, who could hit long home runs and steal bases. Darryl the outfield gazelle who glided after fly balls in right field, who gunned down base runners with his powerful throwing arm. They were so excited that they failed to take proper notice of a disturbing fact. Darryl himself -- the accidental grand prize winner of some genetic lottery -- was not so celebratory of his great gift. He treated it cheaply. It felt like a burden. He was even oddly resentful, bemoaning that he was not loved for being just plain old Darryl Strawberry.
That was his one true insight into the world of professional sports -- no one did love him for just being Darryl. But it wasn't personal; pro athletes are loved for what they do. 
Right from the start of his big-league career, Strawberry was drowning -- and in such plain view that even some members of the city's other baseball franchise could see it. "You would hear things; players, you know, we talk a little bit," says Willie Randolph, the Yankees' second baseman when Strawberry was a young Met and later his coach and sometime confidant when he moved to the Yankees. "You would see Darryl out with his entourage; even then he had a lot of people around him. It was a shame the things that happened, but it wasn't a surprise. You knew as a player that it was only a matter of time."
Strawberry's own teammates didn't step in, in part because many were living the same fast life. And besides, that is not what ballplayers do. A major-league clubhouse is like a lot of workplaces: people go their own way, live and let live, overlook nearly any behavior that does not interfere with the product. 
Baseball is also night work. What players do after games, what they have always done, is drink. And stay out late. Even by baseball's loose standards, the Mets of the mid- and late 80's, the Strawberry era, were free-spirited and notoriously hard-living. And even by Mets standards, Strawberry was over the top.
"A lot of us drank too much," says Keith Hernandez, the former Mets' first baseman. "I drank too much. You're on the road. You're with guys. They feed you in the clubhouse after the game, and then what do you do? I could close a bar at 2 a.m. and be in bed by 2:30 and have no trouble being ready for batting practice the next night."
Those Mets teams broke down on generational and not, as many professional clubs do, racial lines. Hernandez was one of the older players. He had some tread on him, having just kicked a cocaine habit before coming to the Mets. "I found out later that many of my teammates were running around till 4 a.m.," he says. "I found out they were crazier than I was."
The Mets of the late 80's were lavishly talented underachievers; Strawberry thinks they were better than even the 1998 Yankees team, which won 114 games. "We didn't win more because we partied too hard. Whoever wants to can deny it, but that was our downfall."
Strawberry was no thug -- he has mainly hurt himself and his loved ones -- but he could be a mean drunk. On team charters, a lot of players drank and played cards. Sometimes Strawberry played cards; sometimes he just sat in the back and drank, often with Gooden, whose own career would be sabotaged by drugs and alcohol.
"One on one, you will never find a nicer person than Darryl Strawberry," says Dave Magadan, who began his 15-year-career with the 80's Mets. "You will never find a more generous person. He was great with kids. He stood and signed autographs until every last person had left. But when he got in that grouping of the team and on the buses and the planes, and had a few cocktails in him, he was vicious to a lot of guys. He was demeaning. To coaches. Players. Front-office guys."
A particular target was catcher Gary Carter, a star of the 1986 championship team who in the late 80's had a couple of woeful seasons as he struggled to reach 300 career home runs. Strawberry stayed on him about money and production -- not the usual jocularity that ballplayers engage in, but much closer to the bone. Strawberry had yet to cash in , and the older Carter was making better money. "Darryl would be like, 'I'm hittin' 30 jacks, and you're hittin' a buck 70,' Magadan recalls. "It was very unfriendly abuse."
A star of Strawberry's magnitude attracts not only a devoted fan base but a following among other players who want to be around him for the fun, the free drinks, the women, the perceived security of being known to management as part of the inner circle. So Strawberry had a clique of teammates who laughed at his jokes, even when they weren't funny. He had teammates who agreed that he was underpaid and underappreciated. And he had, as well, a growing cluster of nonbaseball associates at his side -- buddies, mainly from back home, who traveled at his expense, rode in his limos, accompanied him to clubs. One friend in particular, a childhood buddy from L.A., was suspected by teammates and some Mets officials of procuring women for him and possibly drugs.
"He was Darryl's running mate," says Horwitz, the Mets P.R. director. "Darryl paid for his flights, his hotels. We would book the rooms for him. His role, so far as I could tell, was to go to clubs with Darryl. There were people who tried to talk to Darryl. But he was a kid in his 20's -- you can't tell him who his friends should be."
So eager to please with easy money and companionship, Darryl Strawberry had one area of stinginess. Baseball. He was miserly about parceling out his talent. It flowed irregularly, and never in the heaping quantities it could have.
"He had 39 home runs in 1986 and had no interest in hitting 40," Johnson says, speaking of the final weeks of the season, after the team had clinched a playoff spot. "He had some nagging injuries. But he could have played. It was hard for me to understand."
Strawberry never hit as many as 40 home runs in a season and drove in 100 or more only three times. Elite athletes are never satisfied; he was easily satisfied. Some attributed this to a lack of character, but there was something more specific he lacked -- courage. The courage to put himself on the line and find out if he was really as good as people believed. Or maybe that he wasn't.
Strawberry, typically, has contradictory explanations for why he could not fulfill his promise. He loved being so physically gifted but hated the expectations that came with those gifts, the feeling that he could not measure up no matter what. He loved New York and especially New York fans -- God could not have picked a better place for me to play" -- but hated the extra attention that comes to New York ballplayers.
"The drinking and the drugging, that was a way of punishing myself and the fans, too," he says. "I figured, If you want to get negative on me, you won't get the best out of me. Don't get me wrong, every time I stepped on the field I gave my best effort. But I know if I did not drink and party so much, I would have been better."
When he returned to New York to play for the Yankees, older and already broken, he finally understood how much New Yorkers loved him. He knew, finally, that New York was forgiving of human frailty -- that it was as compassionate as it was demanding. And he finally knew that he had cheated his fans. "People cared for me as a person in New York. I will take that to my grave, the feeling that gave me. I received so much love from New York fans. Through everything I've been through, when I would come back with the Yankees, they would give me a standing ovation. I will never forget that, and nothing can ever replace it.
"I wish I was able to give more to those fans who loved me at the time of my career when I had more to give. I'm down in my spirit about that. I didn't give everything I had to offer."
He rejects any notion that the city itself was an actor in his demise -- that New York was too fast and filled with temptation for an unsophisticated and suddenly wealthy young man. "New York didn't destroy me," he says. "I destroyed me. I take full responsibility for that."
Over time, Strawberry's off-field behavior put all the questions and expectations to rest. Games and weeks and then whole seasons vanished. He was not going to be a once-in-a-generation ballplayer. No one had to ask him for that anymore. 
The depth of his personal problems first broke into public view on Jan. 26, 1990, when he was arrested in Los Angeles after a horrific domestic scene -- he supposedly punched his first wife, Lisa, in the face and menaced her with a .25-caliber semi-automatic pistol. The argument that preceded it, Strawberry would later acknowledge, was over his "drinking" and "fornicating." (Blood tests had just established that he was the father of a son born to a St. Louis woman.) Dr. Lans flew out to Los Angeles, holed up for a few days in a hotel with Strawberry, then flew back east and lodged him at the Smithers Alcoholism and Treatment Center on the Upper East Side.
But Strawberry approached his 28-day interlude at Smithers more as a scam than an opportunity to get well. Mainly, he viewed it as a convenient way to dodge prosecution for assaulting his wife. "Going to Smithers was my cover-up," he told Sports Illustrated years later. "I never even bothered telling them about the drugs."
He left Smithers in time to play the 1990 season in New York, his last with the Mets before signing as a free agent with the Dodgers. In 1994 he failed to show for an exhibition game, announced he was addicted to cocaine and spent the next month at the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, Calif. After the Dodgers bought out his contract, he spent 1994 with the San Francisco Giants. He then lost that job after testing positive for cocaine in February 1995.
Lisa Strawberry, Darryl's first wife, has suggested that we meet for breakfast at the Regent Hotel, which sits at the gilded intersection of Wilshire Boulevard and Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. The lobby is constructed of marble and dark woods and adorned with enormous displays of fresh flowers. But she commands the room. As Lisa approaches, I can see that she is, in one way, very much like her former husband: tall and lissome, an exalted physical being.
Lisa Strawberry does not like talking about Darryl, but has agreed to an interview for two reasons: Darryl Jr., "D.J.," the oldest of her two children with Darryl, is a six-foot-four-inch basketball and baseball player in Pasadena, a high school sophomore with a stackful of letters from college recruiters. He looks so much like his father that people stare at him, thinking they've seen him somewhere before. His mother can see it all beginning again -- the hero worship, the sense of privilege, maybe the money. "I want to know," she says, "what are we going to do for the next generation? How are we going to teach them better?"
The other reason Lisa has decided to talk is that she knows many people in baseball are only too willing to blame her for Darryl's troubles -- financial and otherwise. There are many bad marriages in baseball. Darryl Strawberry, always the one for the dramatic flair, was widely considered to have a disastrous marriage.
Lisa and Darryl met in 1984 at a Lakers game and married the next year. They fought, separated, reconciled and fought some more for the whole of their eight-year marriage. As Darryl began to negotiate a new contract during his last year with the Mets, team executives privately urged him to divorce before he signed a new deal -- regardless of whether he was to resign with them. He told them that he and Lisa were working on their marriage, that it could be salvaged.
In November 1990, Strawberry signed his five-year, $20 million contract with the Dodgers. Two months later, Darryl and Lisa separated, and in May 1992 she formally filed for divorce. When the divorce became final a year later, they split assets that included three houses and no less than eight luxury cars - including a whole category termed "the Jaguars." Lisa says that under terms of the divorce settlement, she received slightly more than half the value of his $20 million deal.
To back up her petition of $50,000 per month in spousal support, which was granted, Lisa filed papers with the Superior Court of California saying that she had been spending $20,000 a month for clothes, $5,000 a month for shoes and an average of $7,000 for each purchase of jewelry, "which I have been free to indulge myself in as desired."
"How am I the culprit?" she asks at breakfast. "They wanted to know what was my standard of living. And that's what it was."
Darryl, she says, insisted that she wear a new outfit to each game, with new shoes to match. "He wanted to have an armpiece. And I was that armpiece. People would say: 'Look at the way Lisa spends. She shops, she shops, she shops.' But why am I shopping? Because every game I had to have a different outfit. And I had a budget that reflected that."
The subject of Lisa is the one area in which Darryl's equanimity vanishes. "She said I wanted an armpiece?" he asks. "Yeah, right. She was digging for gold, and she struck gold."
Lisa Strawberry says her years with Darryl "were like a magic carpet ride. I don't regret them, because we had some wonderful times. But we were so young. I was 20 years old when I got married. What did I know? But if I knew then what I know now, I would do it differently."
Darryl Strawberry probably could not have done it much differently. Not without a lot of help. And he was in the wrong place to get that. Baseball is no good at soothing or saving souls. The business of the game, in the crass term of old baseball men, is to put fannies in the seats.
There were, for sure, many in baseball who cared deeply for Strawberry, among them Frank Cashen. A former sportswriter and brewery executive, he counseled him as best he knew how. Right at the beginning, he had promised Ruby Strawberry he would watch over her boy. He meant it, and he believes to this day he kept his word as best he could. 
Strawberry had friends in the game whom he left bewildered and exhausted. "When he came to the Yankees, we felt like this guy is trying to get his life together," says Willie Randolph. "He was a super guy, a model citizen. He was a guy we wanted to embrace and help. You saw him up on a podium, saying he had found Christ and so forth, you thought everything was cool. And then something would happen, and you felt tricked or duped."
Mental health professionals sometimes say that people turn to drugs and alcohol as a "coping mechanism." Something that Strawberry could not otherwise cope with was emotional pain. He had no place to put it and, as always, no armor to repel it. He absorbed pain, and it ate away at him. This was equally true of deeply painful events, like his father's leaving, and of much more trivial hurts. 
Consider Game 6 of the 1986 World Series. Most baseball fans remember that as the wild night at Shea when the sure-handed Red Sox first baseman Bill Buckner let a routine ground ball trickle through his legs and the Mets staged an astonishing, back-from-the-dead comeback to set up a seventh-game victory and World Series championship. 
But as years passed, what Strawberry recalled was that Davey Johnson had removed him late in Game 6 in a "double switch" -- a common strategy used by National League managers. Strawberry viewed this as an act of disloyalty, a terrible affront -- he even, incredibly, considered it a factor that led him to heavier drinking.
When I remind Johnson of how Strawberry obsessed over this incident, he laughs a little. But it is a sad laugh. "Tell Darryl that I'm sorry about the double switch," he says. "I really am."
Even after violating probation at the end of March, Darryl Strawberry was not considered menacing -- or, perhaps, important -- enough for law enforcement to really look for him. "We treated him like any other nonviolent offender," Lt. Rod Reder of the Hillsborough County Sheriffs Department, explains. "It was, like, we'll get to it whenever. There was no manhunt." 
When Darryl was ready to end his binge, he called his friend Ray Negron, who is a consultant for the Cleveland Indians on substance abuse issues. Negron and Ron Dock (who works in the same capacity for the Yankees) had spent hours on the streets of Tampa looking for Strawberry, approaching dealers and pounding on the doors of drug dens. One night they were joined in their grim task by Gooden, who only the day before retired after a fine career that was brought up short of its Hall of Fame promise by drug detours.
Strawberry, having been told that his friends were searching for him, finally called from Daytona Beach. Negron and Dock drove immediately to get him, picking him up at a Chevron station where he had been dropped off by the friend he was staying with. "We didn't ask him what he did for four days," Negron says. "When you are dealing with addicts, there is no new story. We knew what had gone on."
For most of the two-and-a-half-hour trip back to Tampa, Darryl Strawberry cried. At one point, Negron says, they stopped so that he could get some fresh air and compose himself. From the roadside, he called Gooden. "They had an embrace on the phone," Negron says. "He just wanted to talk to Dwight."
When the drive resumed, the great Darryl Strawberry stayed focused on the same two questions. "Do you think I'm in trouble," he kept asking. And: "What do you think will happen next?" 
The simple answer, the obvious one for a three-time parole violator, is jail. Yet for Strawberry, things are rarely that simple. In an earlier conversation, he had done his best to answer that question, in his inimitable, disengaged fashion. "God is going to deal me a hand," he said. "One way or the other." The idea that God had granted him the power to deal for himself in this world, to make decisions and demand respect from himself and others; that, apparently, never became a part of Darryl Strawberry's theology.

HEADLINE: Silver Surfers 

BYLINE:  By Daniel Duane 

 BODY:
What is it about surfing? Only a tiny fraction of Americans have seen the sport with their own eyes, fewer have tried it, yet its image pops up everywhere -- on TV, in movies, in advertisements. Surfing first migrated from Hawaii to California in 1907, but by midcentury the carefree golden-haired surfer had flowered into a full-blown American archetype, alongside the pilgrim and the cowboy. Blame, perhaps, baby boomers, reared by survivors of World War II, determined to live a life less burdened by history and settled on surfing as the highest expression of their laid-back youth. 
 Turning their collective gaze to the inevitable next chapter -- retirement -- and looking for inspirational examples of aging, members of that same generation (the filmmaker David L. Brown, 53, and the gerontological social worker Roy Earnest, 47) bring us "Surfing for Life," a documentary to be shown on PBS this month. The film traces the lives of 10 senior surfers, like the leathery, charismatic Woody Brown, 89, a Wall Street stockbroker's son who still hits the water when the waves come up; the surf-world celebrity Rabbit Kekai, 80, one of the original "Waikiki beach boys" who dazzled Honolulu tourists in the 1930's; and John Ball, at 94, America's oldest living surfer. 
 But images of octogenarians soaring in the spray -- and laughing while they do it -- remind us of a better reason for surfing's grip on the national imagination, one having nothing to do with baby boomers: there's simply something delightful about the sight of anyone, young or old, standing upright on a breaking wave. It's so unlikely, and such a remarkable trick, so wonderfully pointless, with no score to keep, nobody to beat and no way to quantify your achievements -- just a little effortless speed and (trust me on this) an awful lot of fun.
We all know Americans place far too little value on unproductive diversion. But when you see the elegant 74-year-old Eve Fletcher carving a pretty one at San Onofre, Calif., with her economical -- if admittedly frail -- stance, then radiating joy afterward, you realize that surfing endures in our popular culture most of all because it captures the spirit of pure, blissful play. The very gleam in her eyes argues something we all hope to be true -- that such childlike pleasure is not the exclusive province of youth.

HEADLINE: Affairs of Estate 

 BODY:
In her interview with William H. Gates Sr., Amy Barrett states, "If the estate tax is repealed, charities will most likely suffer" (The Way We Live Now, March 18). This is an unfounded comment. 
Americans are generous people. When President Reagan offered meaningful tax relief 20 years ago, charitable giving increased. The fact is, when taxpayers keep more of what they earn, they will spur the economy by spending more, and yes, they will give some of their money to noble causes.
 Sixty-five Democrats in the House of Representatives and 20 percent of the Democrat caucus in the Senate voted to eliminate the death tax last year. This is a bipartisan issue. But if Americans who are more fortunate than others want to forgo their share of tax relief, the Treasury Department would be more than happy to accept the money back.

When in Doubt, Office Building Owners Renovate

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
GIVEN the uncertainties about the national economy, a haze of caution hangs over New Jersey's commercial market, prompting developers to trim their visions of sleek new office buildings and increase efforts to renovate existing ones to make them more competitive.
 A key reason for the activity is that mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, corporate restructuring and expansions are resulting in anticipated as well as unexpected changes that have emptied buildings, or at least parts of them. As the inventory of vacant space grows, much of it through subleases, some companies are reducing their office requirements while others are nearing the end of leases and doing more comparison shopping. 
 That has slowed the pace of leasing and put a lid on rent increases, commercial brokers said. At least one landlord has cut what some said were unrealistic rents while a few others are offering incentives to brokers to bring tenants to their buildings. Work letters, payments that help tenants defray the costs of interconstruction work, are becoming more generous. 
Creditworthy tenants have more leverage with landlords than in recent years, said David Knee, an executive vice president at Binswanger/ Klatsin, a real estate services company in Edison. The focus is on retaining existing tenants and attracting new ones, he said, adding, "Cash flow is king and owners don't want holes in their buildings."
David E. Schenkel, managing director of the New Jersey offices of CB Richard Ellis, another real estate service concern, said, "Savvy landlords are hunkering down in the face of what is now a little foul weather but could turn into a storm by focusing on renovations." They realize that strategy "is the best defense in keeping tenants," he said, pointing out that buildings only 20 years old also need to be upgraded in technology and security to compete in today's market. 
Statistics as of the first quarter do not reflect current market conditions because they track deals struck last year. Still the 11-county northern and central New Jersey market's overall 10.4 percent vacancy rate, while up from 9.9 percent the middle of last year, is still considered low. At the same time average asking rents were $25.35 a square foot, up from $24, according to Cushman & Wakefield, the national real estate services company. 
Mr. Knee said certain submarkets remained tight, including the Hudson River waterfront in Jersey City. And speculative construction, which has been limited, will become more constrained as the uncertain economic climate persists, he said, noting that developers wanted lease commitments for at least half of a building before moving forward.
Developers said the renovations made sense because in uncertain times there was a flight to quality buildings by tenants. 
Mr. Schenkel, the CB executive, said another reason for the focus on renovation is that it cost landlords $5 to $8 a square foot for renewing tenants, considerably less that the $15-to-$20-a-square-foot cost of fitting out space for new tenants. Also, he said, some owners, like real estate investment trusts and pension funds, need to spend more "to maintain rents at certain levels" to meet their profit projections, especially if they paid a high price for the building during the market's halcyon days.
Those are some of the pros and cons the Ohio State Teachers Retirement Fund debated in devising an over $1 million capital improvement program for two office buildings it bought six months ago. The buildings, totaling 560,000 square feet, are in Morris Corporate Center, near the intersection of Interstates 80 and 287 in Parsippany in Morris County, where the vacancy rate for space in prime buildings is 18.6 percent. 
Crucial to the decision to renovate is that New York Life is vacating 70,000 square feet next month and that leases for 60,000 more square feet are expiring in two years, said Mr. Schenkel whose company is handling the leasing and property management at the buildings. Besides a cosmetic makeover to the common areas, he said, the renovations will include instal-ling a new security system and improving the landscaping. Average asking rents will be maintained at $31.50 a square foot. 
IN Hackensack, Stellar Capital Management of Manhattan has begun an over $1 million renovation of Continental Plaza, a three-building, 648,000-square-foot complex along Route 4. Though the work was planned when Stellar bought the complex last year, it is being implemented now because 70,000 square feet of space is or will soon be available, as will an additional 14,000 square feet of sublet space, said Curtis J. Foster, a senior director at Cushman & Wakefield, which is handling the leasing at the complex.
"In a market in transition, it is even more important to reinvest in buildings to assure tenants they are getting full value for the rents they are paying," he said. Asking rents at the complex have also been reduced from $34 to $29 a square foot, which Mr. Foster described as more realistic. 
Improvements include upgrading the complex's interior and its heating, air- conditioning and electrical systems. The cafeteria also will be renovated.
In Rutherford, renovations will begin next month at the two-building, 570,000-square-foot Meadows Office Complex at the intersection of Routes 17 and 3. The 18-year old complex has been owned since last February by the Lincoln Equities Group of Rutherford together with Investcorp of Bahrain and Crow Holdings of Dallas.
"We accelerated our plans to renovate because of the uncertain market and to be competitive," said Joel Bergstein, a partner at Lincoln Equities. Also, with leases expiring over the next 16 months the vacancy rate at the complex could rise to 8 percent, from the current 5 percent, he said.
The work, to be done by July, includes upgrading the lobby, common areas and elevator cabs. The partners are also offering brokers $3,200 watches as an incentive to bring tenants to the buildings. The idea is "to create a buzz, an excitement about the buildings," Mr. Bergstein said, pointing out that incentives were provided even when the market was heated. 
The frenzy is off the market, he said, but added, "There is no oversupply of space as there was in 1992 and choices are still limited." Rents of $28 a square foot are expected to be raised 5 to 7 percent.
Mr. Bergstein said futere plans for two more office buildings, each with 450,000 square feet, and a hotel on 28 adjacent acres would proceed only after 50 percent of space in one building was leased. 
IN some cases, renovation projects are are in prime locations where development sites are rare. That, along with the anticipated loss of a tenant, is why a $6 million renovation is planned at two buildings in Short Hills owned by Reckson Associates Realty Corporation, a real estate investment trust in Melville, N.Y., with offices in Short Hills. Reckson bought the buildings, on John F. Kennedy Parkway and totaling 310,000 square feet, for $50 million in 1997, said Jeffrey M. Schotz, senior vice president and managing director at the New Jersey office.
Both buildings, built in 1981, have long been occupied by AT&T. It has vacated one 125,000-square-foot building on which the lease expires next month, when the renovation there will start. 
Mr. Schotz said while his company was cautious about speculative construction, "there is no choice but to invest in buildings to attract tenants." 
The work will take four months to complete and will include creating a two-story atrium and installing new air-conditioning and heating systems. At the same time, improvements will begin on the exterior of the complex, such as removing a bridge that connects the two buildings and replacing it with a courtyard. 
Meanwhile, AT&T is also relocating from the other building, with 195,000 square feet, where the lease expires in 2003. Work on that building will begin once the lease expires or is recaptured, Mr. Schotz said. 
"We think companies will demand high-quality space and will be willing to pay for it," he said, noting that asking rents will be $35 a square foot, which is higher than the rent, in the low $20's, that AT&T paid. The first building has drawn interest from 25 tenants, needing 10,000 to 100,000 square feet of space, he added.

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 4-15-01: On Language; 
Foot/Hoof In/And Mouth

BYLINE:  By William Safire 

 BODY:
We need a cure for the confusion surrounding the common name for aftosa.
 "In Britain today," reported Peter Jennings on ABC six weeks ago, "the government has now confirmed 12 separate cases of hoof-and-mouth disease." For his American audience, he explained, "We call it foot-and-mouth disease here." 
 He may have it turned around; for example, in a 1978 Supreme Court decision about waste disposal, Justice Rehnquist, not yet chief justice, wrote in dissent that New Jersey must "treat New Jersey cattle suffering from hoof-and-mouth disease." Noting that, Timothy Crowley of Tulane Law School adds, "I have never seen a hoofed animal with a foot." 
 The confusion extends further. A year earlier, a dispatch from The Wall Street Journal's Marcus Brauchli in Shanghai gave the two terms a different differentiation, noting that the fast-spreading disease was "known as hoof-and-mouth in cattle and foot-and-mouth in hogs." That may not be correct, either.
To the origin: earliest citation in the O.E.D. is from an 1862 Edinburgh Veterinary Review: "Cows affected with the foot-and-mouth disease." When that nomenclature crossed the Atlantic to the U.S. in 1869, Harper's Weekly put it that Liverpool was informing the State Department that "a contagion called murrain, or hoof-and-mouth disease, has broken out." The Dictionary of Americanisms lists hoof-and-mouth as an Americanism, citing an 1884 use here and defining it as "the foot-and-mouth disease."
As foot predominated in Britain, hoof had the usage edge in the U.S. In the 1963 western movie "Hud," starring Paul Newman as a cattle rancher, hoof was the word employed, causing Bill Cosby to do a comedy routine he called "Hoof and Mouth," reviewing the movie from a cow's point of view.
But the U.S. Department of Agriculture has always resolutely followed the British Ministry of Agriculture's preference for foot, and leading American dictionaries have gone along. The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage directs us unequivocally to use the foot, sternly warning "not hoof-and-mouth." (The Times also prefers the plural hooves, but it behooves me to use hoofs.)
I'm sorry about those lexicographical and official diktats about striking hoof, because further confusion is caused by the shortening of and after foot, which is often heard as in. We never hear ham 'n' eggs as "ham in eggs," but we do hear foot 'n' mouth as "foot in mouth." That's because of a similar expression, to put your foot in your mouth, defined as "to commit a gaffe" or by the bureaucratic locution "to misspeak." The expression is rooted in Jonathan Swift's 1738 "The bishop has put his foot in it" and was carried forward when a 1984 collection of stories by Saul Bellow was titled "Him With His Foot in His Mouth."
In the early 50's, when Eisenhower Defense Secretary "Engine Charlie" Wilson showed a lack of sympathy for the unemployed by saying he preferred bird dogs to kennel dogs, he admitted that some of his cabinet colleagues "seem to think I have foot-in-mouth disease." 
That play on words has since been used often to deride the tendency of politicians to commit verbal blunders. At the 2001 Gridiron Dinner, where political figures and journalists poke fun at themselves and one another, President George W. Bush acknowledged his habit of tripping over his tongue with the line "You know that foot 'n' mouth disease rampant in Europe? I've got it." Such wordplay will become muted as concern rises about the possible spread to the U.S. of the real cattle, sheep and swine disease. 
Relatedly, another cattle affliction is raising even greater worries: bovine spongiform encephalopathy, known formally by its initials B.S.E. and more widely as mad cow disease. Unlike foot-and-mouth disease (which the French call la fievre aphteuse after its virus and the Germans call Maul-und Klauenseuche, "jaws, muzzle or snout and claw, paw or hoof"), B.S.E. can be transmitted to humans, in rare cases. 
Mad cow, probably bottomed on mad dog, was coined or first used in 1988 by David Brown, then agricultural correspondent for The Sunday Telegraph and now editor of The Daily Telegraph. He chose mad because "the cattle went from being very placid and calm to raging beasts, suddenly berserk." He recalls that the name "took off very slowly" but then "just cranked itself up." 

No Child Behind
 Democrats are somewhat irked at the adoption by President Bush of a phrase that belonged to education reformers: to leave no child behind.
"If schools do not teach and will not change," he told a campaign rally last October, "instead of accepting the status quo, we will give parents better options, different choices. We'll leave no child behind in America."
When President Bush's first budget proposed reductions in some child-care programs, the New York Times columnist Bob Herbert wrote: "He hijacked the copyrighted slogan of the liberal Children's Defense Fund and then repeated the slogan like a mantra, telling anyone who would listen that his administration would 'leave no child behind.' Mr. Bush has only been president two months, and already he's leaving the children behind."
Who coined the powerful phrase? Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund, in 1993 credited "the black community," but further research tracked it more specifically to Barbara Sabol, in November 1991 a member of the C.D.F.'s Black Community Crusade for Children. One year earlier, on Nov. 15, 1990, The Courier-Journal in Louisville reported that Dave Armstrong, a Jefferson County judge, in asking a juvenile-justice commission for better community care for children, said, "We can leave no child behind."
Seven years before that, at a White House reception on July 28, 1983, President Ronald Reagan told the National Council of Negro Women that he had "begun to outline an agenda for excellence in education that will leave no child behind." Mari Maseng Will, who worked on that speech, says, "President Reagan has not, to my knowledge, been credited with the phrase."
Until now. And until someone comes up with an earlier citation, the Gipper's the coiner.

How to Plan Chaos

BYLINE:  By Andrew O'Hehir 

 BODY:
In anticipation of the 2001 Summit of the Americas, commencing this Friday in Quebec City, heads of state from the 34 member nations have no doubt done their fair share of homework. But not as much, it's safe to say, as the thousands of activists who hope to turn the event into the same kind of mass protest staged in Seattle in 1999 and in Prague in 2000. The summit's delegates will negotiate the Free Trade Area of the Americas (F.T.A.A.) accord, which critics have dubbed "Nafta on steroids." 
 No one's willing to predict just how many activists will converge on the Francophone city, but through the movement's now familiar mix of tactics -- borrowed from punk rock, 1930's Spanish anarchism, New Age feminism, nonviolent resistance, environmental activism and rave culture -- organizers managed to get their message heard across the continent and around the world. They plan to stage a Carnival Against Capitalism in the city itself and various disruptions along the U.S.-Canada border. More modest actions are planned at the San Diego-Tijuana crossing, as well as in some 60 other cities from Thunder Bay, Ontario, to Buenos Aires. Whether they pull it off remains to be seen, as does the extent to which the police will be able to anticipate and contain these actions. But the behind-the-scenes work has been an impressive case study in post-Seattle organizing. 
 As with many such actions, the first step is a "call," a call to action from a local group defining the political principles and goals of the event. In this case, since the factions could not agree on whether property destruction violates the movement's semiofficial code of nonviolence, there were two competing calls: one from the Anti-Capitalist Convergence (known as CLAC, its initials in French) and a Quebec City group called CASA, the other by an economic-justice organization called Operation SalAMI ("dirty friend"). The calls went up on e-mail lists devoted to topics like anarchism, free-trade issues and labor organizing; subscribers reposted them -- on gay-lesbian, feminist, Green, student-activist, indigenous rights and police-and-prisons lists, among others. Within a few days, the potential audience had grown from a few dozen people to tens of thousands. 
The next step was the forming of affinity groups, small cells that will look out for one another. (One affinity group from Vermont protesting the privatization of water rights plans to dress in blue and perform pagan rituals with pitchers of water from all over the Americas.) Meanwhile, representatives from CLAC-CASA and SalAMI started out across Canada and America, educating these groups in tactics, from forming human blockades to practicing inclusive consensus-based decision making. And, of course, dealing with the media. The Independent Media Center, which functions as the movement's semiofficial news service, will be operating a Web site, uploading real-time street reports from Quebec City. 
In late March, about 200 representatives of the affinity groups attended a planning session in Quebec City. They agreed to divide protests into three "ways of being": strictly legal, peaceful but possibly illegal and the euphemistic "diversity of tactics," a category that may include property destruction or clashes with the police. The final details will be worked out at a "convergence" after everyone has arrived. (Convergences tend to bog down, as delegates are empowered to vote on only those decisions their affinity groups have already made, which means many trips back and forth to discuss new proposals.) Local organizers received more than 15,000 requests for sleeping arrangements, some of which will be filled on floors and couches of sympathetic Quebecers. 
Whatever happens at the protests themselves, the people involved say that participating is a statement in itself. "This didn't start in Seattle," says Jaggi Singh, a CLAC member. "And it sure isn't going to stop in Quebec City."

HEADLINE: FILM; 
When The Nazis Became Nudniks

BYLINE:  By J. HOBERMAN; J. Hoberman is the senior film critic for The Village Voice.

 BODY:
IT'S springtime for Hitler and Germany, winter for Poland and France," the uniformed tenor warbles. "Come on, Germans -- go into your dance!" His command is the cue for a stage full of goose-stepping chorines in storm trooper caps and lederhosen hot pants to take their places in a rotating swastika formation, filmed from an overhead angle like the climax of a Busby Berkeley musical number.
 Was "Springtime for Hitler," the "gay romp with Adolf and Eva at Berchtesgarden" that is the subject and centerpiece of Mel Brooks's first feature film, "The Producers," the big shock of 1968? Or was the spectacle of hoofing Nazis just business as usual? Roger Ebert, then starting out as a film reviewer in Chicago, recalls his first encounter with "The Producers" as something "so liberating that not even 'There's Something About Mary' rivals it." But Mr. Brooks's chutzpah was not to every taste. 
 When "The Producers" opened several months later at a midtown Manhattan art house, it was greeted with severely mixed notices -- including pans from New York's leading critics, Renata Adler, Stanley Kauffmann, Pauline Kael and Andrew Sarris. This week, Mr. Brooks's adaption of "The Producers" opens as a Broadway musical. 
Even in 1968, "Springtime for Hitler," the movie's title until the distributor Joseph H. Levine prevailed upon Mr. Brooks to change it, was a gag that its author had nurtured for years -- an ultimate "Show of Shows" skit, complete with a dialect role perfect for Sid Caesar, the television star for whom Mr. Brooks had created countless comic German characters.
As befit a movie directed by one of the most manic writers in show business, "The Producers" piled shtick upon shtick. A seedy impresario, Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel), who finances his shows by romancing and bilking elderly women, and a timorous, if ultimately crooked, accountant named Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) hatch a scheme to defraud their investors by overselling shares in a Broadway show so terrible that it is certain to close after one performance. (Among other things, "The Producers" is credited with introducing the phrase "creative accounting.")
The partners select a musical by an unreconstructed Nazi, Franz Liebkind, who, once they have tracked him down at his Greenwich Village bunker, enthuses that his play gives "not the popular conception of the Fuhrer but the young, beautiful inner Hitler who danced his way to glory." (Mr. Brooks considered taking the part of Liebkind himself, before giving it to Kenneth Mars.) Bialystock and Bloom further guarantee their show's failure by hiring a self-confident, if dimwitted, cross-dressing director, Roger De Bris (Christopher Hewitt), and bestowing the role of Hitler on a mind-blown method-acting hippie known as L. S. D. (Dick Shawn). As ultimate insurance, Bialystock proffers an opening-night bribe to The New York Times drama critic. The reviewer angrily throws the hundred dollar bill to the ground; the show, however, is a hit.
Critics pointed out that a similar premise had been employed in two George Kauffman plays, an episode of the television show "Racket Squad" and even, according to one review, a theatrical producer who was then active. (Possibly, it was first used in one of the lost plays of Aristophanes.) But "The Producers" was made with an improvisatory quality that had largely been absent from Hollywood since the wacky Paramount comedies of the early 30's and that, unstinting in its comic aggression, gave the sense -- not altogether uncommon in the 1960's -- of putting something on the screen for the first time.
The credit sequence presents Max Bialystock, sporting the world's most flagrant comb-over, playing "dirty young man" to a succession of amorous crones. Bialystock is a sort of frenzied Groucho Marx (complete with asides to the audience) inflated to Falstaffian dimensions. A fount of libidinal energy and rampant orality, Mostel not only chews the scenery and devours the lens but kisses everything in range, not least the manuscript of "Springtime for Hitler." (In another turn of phrase credited to the movie, Bialystock gazes out of his dirt-encrusted office window and, spying a white limo below, longingly screams, "Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!")
Mr. Brooks has said that this outrageous character was inspired by a theatrical producer for whom he once worked, "a guy well into his 60's who made love to a different little old lady every afternoon on a leather couch in his office." Time magazine suggested that Bialystock was a parody of David Merrick -- and others have proposed Merrick's mentor Arthur Beckhard as the model. In any case, the part was written for Mostel, a monstre sacre, who first had to be persuaded to take the role and then proceeded to embody it with an almost terrifying gusto. (Reports of on-set tension between Mr. Brooks and the sometimes difficult Mostel hardly seem unreasonable.)
Mr. Wilder, appearing in only his second movie, plays Stan Laurel to Mostel's manic Oliver Hardy. The extended one-on-ones between the bellowing Bialystock and his accountant, a flaming neurotic complete with security blanket, are classic, although Mostel also demonstrates a touching rapport in his "romantic" scenes with a kittenish Estelle Winwood, then 84.
"I want -- I want -- everything I've ever seen in the movies," the repressed Bloom explodes at one point. Mr. Brooks wanted that and more. "The Producers" is nothing if not self-conscious filmmaking and, although far less flashy in its technique than several of its contemporaries like "The Graduate" and "Bonnie and Clyde" (which also quoted Busby Berkeley), the movie was, in its way, one more example of a Hollywood new wave. Mr. Brooks flaunted his own historical references by evoking the movies of the 1930's, predicating gags on knowledge of such Partisan Review heroes as Joyce, Kafka and Dostoyevsky -- as well as incorporating the sort of Yiddishisms that were a leitmotif of Mr. Caesar's skits. (Roger De Bris is named for the Yiddish term for circumcision.)
The words "Jew" and "Jewish" are never used. One of the movie's best gags is the Nazi playwright's obliviousness to the evident Jewishness of his producers. Not only are their names, professions and demeanors meant to be stereotypically Jewish, their interpreters were as well. Having created the role of Tevye in "Fiddler on the Roof" four seasons earlier, Mostel was a Jewish icon; in 1969, after Mr. Wilder was nominated for an Oscar for best supporting actor, The Hollywood Reporter noted that he was now in "dueling contention" with Dustin Hoffman for the title role in a movie version of Philip Roth's just-published "Portnoy's Complaint." 
Some found "The Producers" not only coarse but overly ethnic. Pauline Kael wrote in The New Yorker that it "revels in the kind of show-business Jewish humor that used to be considered too specialized for movies." In its confrontational, bad boy attitude, "The Producers" was a late manifestation of the "sick comedy" associated since the late 50's with those, mainly Jewish, stand-up comedians -- Mort Sahl, Shelly Berman, Mike Nichols and Elaine May, Tom Lehrer and especially Lenny Bruce -- who treated such apparently unfunny subjects as mental illness, racial prejudice, religion and nuclear fall-out. (The most celebrated antecedent was the Bruce routine known as "Hitler and the M.C.A.," in which two German talent agents in 1930, desperate to find a dictator, discover and recruit a handy house painter.) That the film's financing was arranged by Sidney Glazier, the Oscar-winning producer of a movie as dignified as "The Eleanor Roosevelt Story," seems like one of Mr. Brooks's bad-taste jokes.
Was "The Producers" seen as an expression of Jewish anti-Semitism? Neither the New York nor Los Angeles offices of the Anti-Defamation League have records of any complaints. "The Producers" is far less redolent of self-hatred than of self-love, even narcissism. Far from self-deprecating in its Jewish humor, the movie conveys cultural confidence: it is a rebellion against invisibility, the equivalent of dancing on Hitler's grave. Indeed, "The Producers" opened in New York with a full-page endorsement from Peter Sellers, himself a Jew, who called it the "ultimate film" and "essence of all great comedy." (Four years later, Sellers announced his own never-realized equivalent to "The Producers," a movie in which the comic-strip hero the Phantom pursues the 90-year-old Hitler, to be played by Sellers, from the South American jungle to the stage of the Royal Albert Hall.)
"Those of us who have seen this film and understand it have experienced a phenomenon which occurs only once in a lifetime," Sellers wrote. Anarchic as it is, "The Producers" has an undercurrent of seriousness and even catharsis. No movie has more economically evoked the Third Reich as a regime of failed artists and crank aesthetes embarked upon a demented project to "beautify" the world -- through war and mass murder. (Magnet for a mad abundance of dancing, singing, sieg-heiling would-be Fuhrers, "Springtime's" casting call anticipates the multiple Hitlers who appear throughout Hans-Jurgen Syberberg's 1976 epic "Hitler, a Film From Germany.") And no movie has ever succeeded so well in reducing that totalitarian project to travesty, to one more tawdry show biz episode. Although "The Producers" anticipates the flood of Nazi kitsch that would soon appear, the musical "Cabaret" was already on Broadway and the prisoner of war sitcom "Hogan's Heroes" was among the most popular shows on television by the time the movie opened.
In contrast to a less vulgar Holocaust comedy like "Life Is Beautiful," Mr. Brooks's succeeds in implicating the audience in his joke. Our culture's continuing fascination with the Nazis is a factor not only of their absolute evil but also of their status as pioneers of spectacular politics -- ecstatic mass rallies, orchestrated media campaigns, eroticized violence, pseudo-documentaries created to glorify a pop star-political leader. There is nothing more prescient than the telegram sent to Mr. Brooks's shell-shocked, and ultimately naive, producers: "Congratulations. 'Hitler' will run forever."

CORRECTION-DATE: April 22, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the film "The Producers" misspelled the surname of the playwright who used a premise similar to that of the movie in two earlier plays. He was George S. Kaufman, not Kauffman.

HEADLINE: For Those on Early Flights, The Issue Is Convenience 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT WORTH 

 BODY:
ON a recent weekday morning at Westchester County Airport, some of the sleepy passengers waiting for the Continental Express 5:59 a.m. flight to Cleveland had no idea their flight had outraged local people and provoked a battle between County Executive Andrew J. Spano and the airline.
 But those who did know about the dispute were not pleased with Mr. Spano's plan to enforce the airport's voluntary midnight to 6:30 curfew by closing the garage until 5:50 a.m. 
 "I can sympathize with the neighbors, but I think it needs to be worked out with the airlines," said George Roy, a business professor at Concordia College who works in Tuckahoe and was on his way to a conference in Kansas City. "What do you do if there's a curfew here, and passengers miss their connecting flights?"
Others emphasized that more flights are needed at Westchester because of congestion at other airports.
"This airport is much more convenient than Hartford, and I can't stand La Guardia because the plane is always late," said Greg Taffet, who works for MX Energy in Stamford. "I generally think this airport should expand, because of demand."
Robin Page, who lives in Rye and was waiting for another pre-curfew flight, said that if she lived directly in the flight path "I'd be protesting too." But she added that closing the garage is "not fair to the people using the airport, as long as the airport's operating."
One passenger on the Cleveland flight had his own solution. 
"Maybe they should make the early flights more expensive -- use economic theory," said Bret Price, who lives in Fairfield and works for SS & C Technologies. "Closing the garage seems a little drastic, and I think if anything the airport needs to be expanded."
Mr. Spano, who said he goes to La Guardia or J.F.K. when he wants an early flight, acknowledged that passengers on the offending flights are "not happy" about his move to close the garage. "But they're part of the problem, not the solution," he said.
Mr. Spano added that the early flight had to be an "infinitesimal" part of Continental's business, and was surely not worth a dispute with the community. 
It is too early to tell how successful the new flight is, since it just started on April 4, said Julie Gardner, a spokeswoman for Continental Express. So far the flight has averaged 22 passengers on a 35-seat plane, according to figures provided by Joel Russell, the airport manager.

A Cinderella Story Unfolds in West Palm Beach

BYLINE:  By JON NORDHEIMER 

DATELINE: WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. 

 BODY:
SINCE the days when wealthy visitors began building seaside castles in Palm Beach, the city of West Palm Beach, just a conch shell toss across the Intracoastal Waterway on the mainland, played a supporting role to its gold-plated neighbor.
 The resort's mansions and grand hotels like the Breakers were built and served by men and women who lived in West Palm. The bluebloods journeyed across the waterway only to catch a plane or train out of town. Or to bail an errant heir out of the county jail. 
 If Palm Beach was symbolized by expensive restaurants and Worth Avenue shops selling Chanel bags and Bulgari watches, West Palm had all-you-can-eat buffets and pawnshops. But that was last century. The new one has ushered in a startling change in West Palm that is turning envious heads up and down the coast. 
The catalyst was the opening last fall of CityPlace, a 55-acre mixed-use development representing a $500 million commercial investment in the heart of a decaying downtown neighborhood previously identified with weed-studded lots, shuttered storefronts and shambling drifters. 
It combines current merchandizing trends by placing 68 national and regional specialty retailers in a downtown setting, offering open-air shopping plazas designed to invite strollers along handsome tree-lined esplanades and winding walkways in the European style and stressing entertainment and family-friendly activities like free concerts and dancing fountains.
Ten more stores are scheduled to open this spring. Average rents are $35 a square foot a year.
Its nine restaurants, themselves a key part of the development's marketing strategy, are earning high marks from local food critics and patrons willing to wait an hour or more for a table. In the view of many, CityPlace has the potential to become one of Florida's finest concentrations of dining.
"We probably took more risks by banking on the draw of food and beverage investment in CityPlace," said Kenneth A. Himmel, president and chief executive of the Palladium Company of New York, the developer of CityPlace. "The numbers in the first few months for food and drink is mindboggling; sales in some of the restaurants are hitting $1.3 million a month, which is in the top one per cent of the industry."
In positioning the shopping center's merchandise, there was no effort to match Worth Avenue's high-end retailers, Mr. Himmel said. Instead, he said, the concept was to include shops offering merchandise not readily available in other malls around the county.
For instance, there's Douglas Cosmetics, the first Florida outlet for Europe's largest cosmetics retailer, according to CityPlace officials. Regional stores include two Boca Raton-based retailers, Dolly Duz (shoes) and Lisa Todd (women's fashions), and two regional designers, Deborah James (women's) and Stuart Norman (men's). 
CityPlace has 600,000 square feet of retail space and nearly 600 condominium units and rental apartments, and it has plans at different stages of development for three premium office towers with a total of 770,000 square feet of space.
Final negotiations are under way for a 400-room upper-end hotel adjacent to a new Palm Beach County Convention Center, which is scheduled to open in 2003. The convention center, budgeted at $74 million and financed by part of the local sales tax, is to have 330,000 square feet of space and be able to seat 2,500 for dinner. 
In addition, the neighborhood has been bolstered in the last decade by $143 million in private and public money for downtown cultural venues, anchored at the west side of CityPlace by the Kravis Center for the Performing Arts, which serves a wide coastal region, a $68 million glass-and-steel bauble built in 1992 at the heavily traveled intersection of Interstate 95 and Okeechobee Road. On its eastern side, CityPlace is connected by a five-minute trolley shuttle ride to the Clematis Street District, a five-block-long combination of restaurants, bars, sidewalk cafes, shops, art galleries, gyms and jazz joints.
FOR the first time in memory, Palm Beach residents are crossing the narrow waterway separating the two cities -- as a social metaphor the bridges were considered the longest in the world -- to check out the upstart.
People are also coming from Gold Coast enclaves like Boca Raton, Delray Beach and as far away as Fort Lauderdale and Miami, some 70 miles to the south, noted Bill Fountain, director of the Downtown Development Authority since 1989.
"The future looks very good for downtown West Palm Beach," he said. As evidence of the economic boost the new developments have given the city as a destination, he said, three additional boutique hotels near the downtown waterfront will open in the next few years to meet new visitor demand.
Moreover, he said, some $157 million is earmarked to expand the cultural infrastructure, including construction of a new $56 million, 1,500-seat home for the Palm Beach Opera; a $20 million addition to the Norton Museum of Art; and a $31 million expansion of the Kravis Center.
"So many of the residents in a 50-mile radius of West Palm Beach are from urbanized Northeastern states who find themselves locked up in gated communities for most of the day or behind the wheel of a car making six stops looking for places to shop," Mr. Fountain said. "They want open, attractive spaces; they want good food; they want entertainment. They can now find all of it in one stop in West Palm Beach."
The seat of Palm Beach County, West Palm Beach has only 80,000 residents. The county tripled in size since 1970, going from 350,000 residents to 1.1 million, attributed to new residential developments along the coast and west of the Florida Turnpike. Along with Martin County just to the north, it has become the focal point of housing for new retirees to Florida and those relocating from Broward (Fort Lauderdale) and Dade (Miami) Counties farther south.
Ventures backed by public and private partnerships in the last decade helped downtown land values soar. Commercial property that once went begging -- CityPlace's 55 acres were accumulated at the equivalent of $10 a square foot -- is now priced at $100 a square foot, Mr. Fountain said, while shop rentals on Clematis Street jumped from $5 to $50 a square foot a year.
After a slow opening, when only two restaurants were up and running, shoppers, diners and the merely curious have been filling CityPlace's 3,300 free parking places on most days, CityPlace officials reported. Ridership on the three Clematis Street trolley shuttles spurted from 20,000 in November to 67,896 in March, they said. 
Palladium, which owns CityPlace with the Related Companies of New York and the O'Connor Group of New York, is heavily involved in building Columbus Center, the $1.8 billion twin office now under way at Columbus Circle in New York. It is also a lead developer of ambitious residential-restaurant-retail projects in Boston, Dallas and Birmingham, Mich.
The fountain square, the epicenter of CityPlace, where free weekend concerts are held, aims for the ambiance of a Mediterranean plaza, radiating out into two and three story shopping arcades fronted by open balconies and earth-colored Tuscan facades. A $3.5 million fountain jets about 75 streams of water high into the air to Strauss waltzes and other pulsing musical works while enticing smells of veal and polenta drift from the plates of outdoor diners seated on the plaza's edge.
Looming above the plaza on one side is a structure older than most buildings in the city: the 350-seat Harriet Himmel Gilman Theater for Cultural and Performing Arts, converted from a Methodist Church that held its last service in 1989. An imposing stucco and stone bell tower stands above a terra-cotta tiled roof and five main entrance doors of coffee-brown pecky cypress.
Down a side street and up 36 steps is a structure that defies the term "movie house." With 20 screens, reserved seats, a baby-sitting play room and refreshments like popcorn shrimp and crispy chicken breasts, Muvico was designed to recall architectural elements of the Paris Opera House. At the entrance, an atrium rises four stories, all marble balustrades, flocked drapes and statuary. Tickets cost $7.50, but seating in several "premiere" theaters with bar and meal service is $15.
Muvico looked at what people want when they go to a movie and provided it, said Bruce Macleod, executive vice president and chief operating officer of Palladium. The same philosophy, he added, is applied throughout CityPlace.

HEADLINE: L.I. @ WORK; 
Symbol U. Brings Classes to a Corporate Campus

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH 

 BODY:
AFTER nearly two decades as a manager at Symbol Technologies in Holtsville, Michael Ramputi decided -- with a nudge from above -- to enroll in the master's degree program his employer conducts in the very building he works in.
 Taking classes after work a couple of days a week, he completed his master's degree in business administration last year in a joint program offered by Symbol and the C. W. Post Campus of Long Island University. 
 Mr. Ramputi, an electrical engineer who manages the development of new products using the bar-code scanning technology that Symbol pioneered, said the M.B.A. program had taught him some useful financial skills and other management tools. 
"I learned a number of new skills, like how to read a company's financial statements," said Mr. Ramputi, who lives in Port Jefferson. "Now when I consider which companies we could partner with on new projects, I can read their financials, and if someone is having a problem, I can see that. As a result, I can make better decisions."
Now in its third year of operation, Symbol University has emerged as a nationally recognized corporate university, a model for the 200 similar programs begun every year at corporate campuses throughout North America. Symbol U. has been named as one of the country's leading corporate universities, for the second consecutive year, by the Corporate University Xchange, a consulting and auditing firm in Manhattan.
More than 20,000 people, ranging from veteran Symbol engineers to employees of companies that do business with Symbol, are registered to take at least one of the 230 courses offered this year by Symbol University. Every employee is required to complete at least 40 hours of training each year. While outsiders pay tuition ranging from $750 to $2,000, employees pay nothing.
Children of employees can also study at Symbol University, in a program designed to provide a college experience for high school students who are not yet certain of their career plans.
Symbol, which had revenues of $1.5 billion last year, holds most of the classes at its headquarters in Holtsville and at its buildings in nearby Bohemia. And thousands of hours of training take place in various Symbol outposts around the world, including Singapore and San Jose, Calif., and on the Internet. 
While the name conjures up visions of a student commons and academic contemplation, Symbol University is in fact thoroughly businesslike. In dozens of corporate conference rooms turned into temporary classrooms, engineers retrained as teachers collaborate with academics on loan from various universities. Together they provide Symbol employees, many of them bone-tired at the end of the day, with both theoretical and hands-on knowledge. The focus is the emerging technologies that will drive the next generation of Symbol products and on the management skills employees will need to turn ideas into products.
This year, Symbol has introduced instruction in mechatronics, an emerging field that combines the principles of software design, optics, mechanical engineering and electrical engineering. Mechatronics is taught at only one other school in the country, Chico State University in California, said Dr. Kathleen Galgano, who directs Symbol's management development and executive training programs.
Jerome Swartz, Symbol's chairman and the founder and chancellor of its university, said that the university served the company in two ways: "The corporate university training program is good for business and is also the right thing to do for our associates' career progress." In addition, a well-run program improves quality companywide and produces benefits in recruitment, retention and other human-resource areas. 
The educational program also builds closer relationships with local universities, in particular Polytechnic University in Brooklyn and Farmingdale and the State University at Stony Brook, and it pays off in research on emerging technologies. And through its academic ties, Symbol can identify talented engineering students, many of whom the company recruits. 
Although only three years old, Symbol University has already become one of the most successful corporate universities in the nation, said Jeanne Meister, the president of the Corporate University Xchange. Programs runs by companies that appear in Ms. Meister's Top 100 ranking are widely studied as models by other companies planning their own corporate universities and by those wanting to improve their offerings.
While the number of corporate universities continues to rise, exceeding 2,000 last year, Symbol's remains the only one developed by a Long Island company, Ms. Meister said. (Computer Associates, based in Islandia, has an extensive in-house training program but does not yet call it a university.)
Is a corporate university more than a hodgepodge of courses driven by the need for highly practical technical training and on-site management development? 
Yes, says Frank R. Rose, an economist whose title is the chief learning officer at Symbol. The university brings the typically diffuse educational offerings developed by various departments under one umbrella, he said, allowing corporate strategy, rather than departmental goals, to shape the program. 
"A traditional training department is reactive, whereas a corporate university is proactive," he said. "In traditional training, the company leads the dance. Management decides who needs training and decides what kind to offer. In the corporate university we function more as a genuine partner to the company, staying ahead of the need, knowing where the business is heading and what that will mean for education."
This year, Mr. Rose said, outside students will pay about $3 million in tuition this year, making Symbol University a profitable business. "Symbol University is in fact very profitable, but I can't tell you just how profitable," he said. 
One of the jobs facing Mr. Rose and his staff is to focus professors on the real-world needs of their students, an imperative they forget at times. "Sometimes the professors don't realize the difference between teaching at a corporation and teaching at a college campus," said Dr. Galgano, the management development director. "Part of our job is to make sure that what they teach corresponds to what their students need to know to do their jobs better."

HEADLINE: A Battle for the Skies 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT WORTH 

 BODY:
AS you walk through the automatic doors of the Westchester County Airport, you are greeted by TV screens bearing the smiling face of County Executive Andrew J. Spano, who welcomes you to Westchester.
 But Mr. Spano was not smiling when Continental Express airlines announced late last month that it would break the voluntary midnight-to-6:30 flying curfew at the airport, sending a jet roaring out over the roofs of sleeping neighbors at 5:59 a.m. It wasn't the first time, either: in September a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines began running its own 5:59 a.m. flight, provoking angry opposition from residents and various politicians. 
 So this time Mr. Spano struck back, announcing that he would take steps to close the entrance of the airport garage until 5:50 a.m., preventing customers from getting to the offending flights on time. 
"It's a drastic move, but we can't let this escalate," Mr. Spano said.
The showdown is the latest chapter in an increasingly bitter struggle over the airport's future. On 700 acres northeast of White Plains on the Connecticut border, the airport has become more popular as delays and congestion have grown steadily worse at the region's major airports, La Guardia, Newark and Kennedy. Aviation industry officials consider Westchester one of the 100 airports in the country that most need expansion or economic support, according to a recent survey, said James K. Coyne, a former Pennsylvania Congressman and president of the National Air Transportation Association, a trade group.
But the airport is surrounded by wealthy bedroom communities -- Rye, Rye Brook, North Castle and Greenwich -- whose residents have formed a vocal opposition as the din of jet engines over their heads has grown more frequent. And the airport is a mere 750 feet from the Kensico Reservoir, the conduit for 90 percent of the unfiltered water supply for 9 million people in the region. 
"There is a real environmental reason not to let the airport expand: more flights and more traffic will bring more pollution," said Robin Marx, a project scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council.
Until now, Mr. Spano had seen himself as a broker between the two groups. He has refused airlines' requests for more flight slots during the day, and in recent years he has killed a proposal to expand a business lounge and General Electric's bid to build a new hangar. 
Yet he has also extolled the convenience of the airport, which was built by the military during World War II and has been operated by the county since 1947. It serves about a million passengers a year, and a 1997 study by the county found that it was responsible for 10,000 jobs in Westchester and had a total economic impact of $614 million, including all transactions related to the airport both on and off the property. 
The key to maintaining a balance between the airport's friends and foes was the curfew, instituted in 1984. "During the day, I fight with the residents and defend the airlines; from 12:30 to 6:30 I defend the residents," Mr. Spano said.
But in September a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines began running a 5:59 flight to Atlanta. There was little Mr. Spano could do; the county's old mandatory curfew at the airport was thrown out by a federal judge in 1983, and since then it has been voluntary. The airlines have generally respected it, though five other flights were violating the curfew when Mr. Spano took office in 1998.
When Continental Express announced its plans to violate the curfew last month, Mr. Spano felt he had to act. He had already ordered county employees to boycott airlines breaking the curfew and urged residents to call the airlines and complain.
"This is about arrogance and greed," he said. "Just because they're big doesn't make them great."
Closing the garage requires the approval of the county Board of Legislators and the Industrial Development Agency, and though they are expected to grant it, they are not scheduled to meet until April 23.
Julie Gardner, a spokeswoman for Continental Express, said, "As long as others are allowed to operate during the curfew, we also have to operate to remain competitive."
Mr. Spano was not the only one angered by that stance. "They care so little about our community that we're going to have to reel them in through the law," said Representative Susan W. Kelly, who introduced a bill in Congress to grant the airport a mandatory legal curfew last fall. It died in committee, but she has reintroduced it with Representatives Nita Lowey, Eliot L. Engel, Benjamin A. Gilman and Christopher Shays of Connecticut. The bill would amend the 1990 Airport Noise and Control Act, which granted certain airports mandatory curfews but did not include Westchester.
There are only a handful of mandatory curfews in the country, including one at Reagan National Airport in Washington. But there are a number of voluntary curfews, including one at La Guardia, which has a midnight-to-6 a.m. ban.
Mr. Spano's move against the airlines appears to have galvanized the local opposition. In early April, members of the Rye Brook Airport Advisory Council held a joint meeting with Harrison residents to form a new standing committee, Westchester Citizens Against Airport Expansion. 
"If someone breaks the curfew at night, you hear the plane buzzing your house and it's like the blitz of London," said Susan Glass, a real estate broker who attended the meeting. "It's really quite frightening."
Ms. Glass lives in the BelleFair housing development, which is on the edge of the runway and is still being completed. She said people who moved into the area recently don't feel they have the right to complain about airplane noise during the day, because they were warned about it when they came. "The only thing that bothers us is violating the curfew -- that's real noise pollution to us," she said.
The airport receives about 5,000 noise complaints a year, said Renee Johns, the noise abatement officer. (The 24-hour noise hot line: 914-939-8484.) When a call comes in, the caller's name and address is entered into a computer. The address appears on a map on the screen, showing the tracks of all flights to and from the airport in the last two hours. Within moments, the caller's complaint is matched with one of the planes, and the computer shows the aircraft's height, direction and speed when the caller was disturbed. 
The information is printed in the Airport Monitor, which is sent to area residents every month. If one flight or operator provokes repeated complaints, the office will notify them, Ms. Johns said. 
The Federal Aviation Administration considers anyone who receives an average sound impact of 65 decibels or more to be "impacted" by aircraft noise, said Ms. Johns. But some advocates consider that rule inadequate: a five-year study of noise complaints at Westchester found that 99 percent came from people from outside the 65-decibel zone, said Arline Bronzaft, the chairwoman of the Aircraft Noise Abatement Group of New York and New Jersey.
Airplane noise may seem like a petty nuisance compared with drug gangs or a toxic waste dump. But many local people said its long-term effect of lost sleep and constant irritation is not trivial, even though newer jet engines are generally quieter than those used in earlier decades.
"For the last week and a half, we've been wakened at 4 a.m. by air noise, and it's getting worse and worse," said Janet Lockton, a former state legislator from Greenwich and president of the Air Conservation Trust, an environmental group based in Greenwich.
And local officials -- urged on by residents' complaints -- have joined the battle. 
"I think it's absolutely terrible, and should be stopped," said Ronald B. Bianchi, the supervisor of the town and village of Harrison, about the airlines' violation of the curfew. He added that the town had been getting a rising number of calls about aircraft noise.
Lolly Prince, the first selectwoman of Greenwich, has met with Westchester officials on the noise issue. "We absolutely support and think it of the highest priority that there be a mandatory curfew," she said.
Many residents appear to be as concerned about the overall growth in flights as they are about violations of the curfew. That growth comes largely from noncommercial aviation, including the many corporate aircraft based at the airport, which accounts for about 80 percent of flights, said Joel Russell, the airport manager.
The airlines have more or less reached the maximum number of flight slots they are allowed in their agreement with the county, which is why Continental and Delta have violated the curfew, Mr. Russell said. (Under the agreement, which was established in a legal settlement between the county and the airlines in 1985, they are allowed four flights and an average of 240 passengers per half hour.) But there is room for more noncommercial aviation, which has ticked upward in recent years at Westchester, according to the F.A.A. Web site. 
Some residents say the growth in flights also poses a safety issue. Gary Zuckerman, a former Rye Brook village trustee who lives near the airport, said, "The flight path in Rye Brook goes over several schools, and with increased traffic comes the danger of incidents." There have been no accidents, he said, though the possibility of a crash has been a priority of the village's emergency plan for years.
Others worry about the effect of more flights, particularly at night, on the value of their houses.
"I worry, if I ever had to sell, if this would become an issue," said Gazala Chinwalla, a Citibank employee who owns a house in BelleFair.
But Ms. Chinwalla and other residents conceded that at its current level of use, the airport is still an asset, particularly in light of the congestion at La Guardia, which was responsible for one-fourth of all delayed flights nationwide in 2000. 
For many local corporations, the airport's value is clear. "The airport is a great convenience for I.B.M. employees," said Carol Makovich, a spokeswoman for I.B.M., which has its own hangar and several aircraft there.
Jim Christiansen, a spokesman for TAG Aviation, an aircraft management and charter company that operates 12 corporate jets based at Westchester, said that a mandatory curfew "would be devastating to us, if for no other reason than perception."
"When I sit down with a competitor based somewhere else, and I have a curfew, it puts me at a severe disadvantage," he said.
Although TAG Aviation adheres to the curfew, the private aviation business is growing quickly, and TAG is lobbying for expanded facilities to handle more flights at Westchester, which is "a major hub for our business," Mr. Christiansen said.
Other aviation officials are more aggressive about the need for expansion. Nationally, air traffic is growing 2 percent a year, and the difficulty of building new airports has created a need for expanded flight schedules and runways, Mr. Coyne, of the National Air Transportation Association, said.
"No community would put a curfew on I-95, and airports are the same way," he said. "They're part of a national transportation system that has to be open 24 hours a day." 
Mr. Coyne said his group planned to work with local officials and businesses to build support for expanded facilities and flight slots at the Westchester airport. Yet he acknowledged that it would not be easy.
Any effort to expand the airport's facilities or hours of operation will run into heavy resistance from environmentalists as well as local residents, because of its proximity to New York City's water supply.
In addition to the 9 million people who drink the city's water -- most of which flows through the Kensico -- there are 45,000 people in Westchester whose water comes from Rye Lake, which is on the airport's border, said James M. Tierney, an assistant attorney general who serves as the state's watershed inspector general.
The water may well prove a rallying point for local opponents too, said Karen Shultz, an environmentalist and longtime opponent of airport expansion who lives in Harrison. Ms. Shultz helped organize a petition drive that has delivered about 2,400 signed letters to the county in the past year urging a freeze on new development at the airport.
There have been more than 100 toxic spills at the airport in the last decade, said Peter Dermody, a hydrogeologist who has examined state records at Ms. Shultz's request. Most were small, but some were not: in 1996, 400 gallons of petroleum spilled into an outfall that discharges into the reservoir; in 1990, a 20,000-gallon underground storage tank was found to be leaking.
The county takes the environmental threat very seriously and has made plans to dedicate a 70-acre area between the airport and the reservoir as a permanent open space buffer zone, Mr. Spano said.
Last year First Environment, an environmental consulting firm hired by the county, determined that spills at the airport had not affected the groundwater.
The county, however, is working with consultants to further minimize the airport's impact. 
The county gave First Environment a $485,000 contract to design an "environmental systems management program" that will affect all activities, from the way construction is done to the way aircraft are fueled, said Lawrence Salley, the county's transportation commissioner. 
Another firm, Harris, Miller and Harris, received a $346,000 contract to refurbish and enhance the county's noise monitoring microphones, now on the top of telephone poles in 14 places around the airport. A third firm -- as yet unchosen -- will do routine groundwater monitoring at a cost of $150,000 a year, Mr. Salley said.
The county is also bracing for a battle over how to use the space formerly occupied by an Air National Guard hangar on the terminal's northern end. A plan floated last year to build a training center for the New York Knicks -- who use the airport often -- and two other local sports teams now seems unlikely. Aviation officials are pushing hard for a new hangar, and the F.A.A. has said that if there is a need, the space should be used for aviation purposes, Mr. Russell said. But opponents of expansion are lobbying equally hard for an organic garden in hopes of blocking new construction.
The county expects to make a decision next year. "There are fringe groups who don't want an airport here at all," Mr. Spano said wearily, "and other who would like it to be La Guardia."

HEADLINE: The View From/Hartford; 
To Glimpse The Past, Just Step Into Parlor

BYLINE:  By VIRGINIA GROARK 

 BODY:
AT the northern edge of downtown Hartford, on a desolate street that was once a prized address in the capital city, sits a house from the Civil War era where Julia and Charlotte Isham made their home for more than 80 years.
 From 1896 to the late 1970's, the sisters lived in the Italianate-style house, gardening, playing the piano, painting and experiencing life's passages while the world modernized around them. 
 The sisters, who never married, celebrated their sister Mary's wedding at the house, held their parents' funerals in the parlor and kept company with their brother Oliver, who had a medical office on the first floor.
Even when urban renewal, the construction of Interstate 84 and riots devastated their neighborhood in the 1950's and 1960's, the sisters held fast to their traditions, having tea parties on their birthdays, walking to church and wearing high-neck dresses with skirts that swished as they moved.
It was their penchant for the past that inspired Miss Julia and Miss Charlotte, as they were known, to leave their house to the Antiquarian and Landmarks Society. Now the Victorian home, with its new parking lot and additional lighting, has reopened for public tours for the first time in 10 years. 
Visitors to the house are not only learning about the life of a Hartford family, but they are catching a glimpse of the city's glorious past when entrepreneurs like Samuel Colt and Albert Pope helped make Hartford one of the richest small cities in America. And in addition to that, the Isham sisters possessed one trait that makes the house a treasure trove of information: Miss Julia and Miss Charlotte were pack rats.
"This is a preservation time capsule," Bill Hosley, executive director of the landmarks society, said. "These kinds of houses are the most prized because they are bursting with documentation."
Inside the house it looks as though the sisters have just stepped out for a walk, leaving everything from a box of Ivory soap over the kitchen sink to glasses in the butler's pantry and stacks of china in a built-in sideboard in the dining room. There are prize ribbons from Connecticut Cat Club shows in the early 1900's, a piece of the Charter Oak tree, hundreds of music records along with a crank-powered phonograph. Miss Julia's floral and seascape watercolor paintings adorn the walls and gas chandeliers still hang from the ceiling.
One of the most recent finds was a box in Miss Charlotte's closet marked "automobile." Stumbling across it one afternoon, Mr. Hosley discovered a collection of pre-World War I Connecticut license plates. They include a homemade plate from 1904, the year before the state began issuing plates.
The box also contained catalogs for obsolete automobiles like the Locomobile, which was made in Bridgeport, and extensive records of the family's two antique cars, a 1901 Oldsmobile and a 1906 Mitchell. The cars, which are stored in Litchfield, are the oldest single-owner automobiles in Connecticut, Mr. Hosley said. 
Originally from a Bloomfield farm, the sisters moved to Hartford with their parents, Henry and Mary Jane, and two siblings, Mary and Oliver. Three other siblings died before the family relocated.
Oliver Isham was a doctor who bought the house as an office for his medical practice and a home for his family. He also wanted to give his youngest sisters an opportunity to attend Hartford Public High School, which Mr. Hosley said, was the Harvard of public high school education at the time.
In its prime, High Street was one of Hartford's fashionable addresses. The house was built in 1854 for a prominent merchant shopkeeper, Ebenezer Roberts, who was a partner in the mercantile company of Keney, Roberts & Goodwin. In 1883, Mr. Roberts added a three-story tower.
The neighborhood was a bit past its prime when the Ishams arrived. Though Mrs. Isham was the granddaughter of the Connecticut inventor and clock manufacturer, Samuel Terry, the family was not especially wealthy and took on boarders at one time. The family took pride in its Terry roots and to this day the building is known as the Isham-Terry. Mrs. and Mr. Isham died in 1913 and 1915 respectively, and Mary Isham married and moved to New York City.
But Dr. Isham and his sisters Julia and Charlotte remained in the house together for 50 years. Dr. Isham practiced medicine out of a front room, where partly filled bottles of white pine bark extract and liquid antiseptic still sit in cabinets. His desk drawers are full of instruments, and an 1888 diploma from the University of the City of New York hangs on the wall.
Even after Dr. Isham died in 1949, a sign for his medical practice remained outside the house. When he received phone calls, the sisters would say: " 'I'm sorry. He's not in just now,' " said Bette Guiney, a West Hartford resident who visited the Ishams as a child. "He was long since dead." 
Those who knew the Isham sisters said they were friendly but kept to themselves.
"These were sort of lovely ancients who had decided they were going to stop being modern," said Wilson Faude, executive director of the Old State House. "They had all their marbles. They just were comfortable where they were."
"They were very nice," said Dorothy Deroharian, who knew the sisters from church. "They always said, 'We were taught not to tell our age and not to tell how much money we had.' "
Miss Julia was an artist and Miss Charlotte a musician, but together they shared a passion for history. They were proud descendants of 28 founders of Hartford and could trace their genealogy back to the Mayflower. They were also members of the landmarks society.
In the mid-20th century they fought a personal historic preservation battle when they learned their home was in the proposed path of Interstate 84. Appearing at a public hearing, they expressed their opposition in a quiet and dignified manner, telling the crowd they were "disturbed to notice that the plans had the highway going through their house," said Mr. Faude, who was not present but has often heard the story.
"They were very sorry to inconvenience the gentlemen in the room, but they were there to tell them that they were not going to move and they were sorry for the inconvenience this would cause the highway," he said. "So what they figured out was how to take all of the gardens, take basically everything but the house, and that's what they did."
Miss Julia died in 1977 and Miss Charlotte died in 1979, both at age 98, and the house was left to the landmarks society with a small endowment to care for it.
The landmarks society offered tours in the 1980's but security concerns led to the discontinuation of regular hours, Mr. Hosley said. For the last decade, people scheduled appointments to see the home. 
But with a new parking lot on Walnut Street and better outdoor lighting, the landmarks society has reopened the house from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Sundays. The tours have generated so much interest that more than 250 people showed up the first day, a number Mr. Hosley said would have "melted the heart of the worst cynic."
"Isham-Terry isn't about someone famous," Mr. Hosley said. "It's about us and it's about a once and future great city."

HEADLINE: Officials Promise a Fight As Airlines Defy Curfew 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT WORTH

 BODY:
AS you walk through the automatic doors of the Westchester County Airport, you are greeted by TV screens bearing the smiling face of County Executive Andrew J. Spano, who welcomes you to Westchester.
 But Mr. Spano was not smiling when Continental Express airlines announced late last month that it would break the voluntary midnight-to-6:30 flying curfew at the airport, sending a jet roaring out over the roofs of sleeping neighbors at 5:59 a.m. It wasn't the first time, either: in September a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines began running its own 5:59 flight, provoking angry opposition from Connecticut and Westchester residents and various politicians. 
 So this time Mr. Spano struck back, announcing that he would take steps to close the entrance of the airport garage until 5:50, preventing customers from getting to the offending flights on time. 
"It's a drastic move, but we can't let this escalate," Mr. Spano said.
Lolly Prince, the first selectwoman of Greenwich, has met with Westchester officials on the noise issue. "We absolutely support and think it of the highest priority that there be a mandatory curfew," she said.
The showdown is the latest chapter in an increasingly bitter struggle over the airport's future. On 700 acres northeast of White Plains on the Connecticut border, the airport has become more popular as delays and congestion have grown steadily worse at the region's major airports, La Guardia, Newark and Kennedy. Aviation industry officials consider Westchester one of the 100 airports in the country that most need expansion or economic support, according to a recent survey, said James K. Coyne, a former Pennsylvania congressman and president of the National Air Transportation Association, a trade group.
But the airport is surrounded by wealthy bedroom communities -- Greenwich, Rye, Rye Brook, and North Castle -- whose residents have formed a vocal opposition as the din of jet engines over their heads has grown more frequent. And the airport is a mere 750 feet from the Kensico Reservoir, the conduit for 90 percent of the unfiltered water supply for 9 million people in the region. 
"There is a real environmental reason not to let the airport expand: more flights and more traffic will bring more pollution," said Robin Marx, a project scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council.
Until now, Mr. Spano had seen himself as a broker between the two groups. He has refused airlines' requests for more flight slots during the day, and in recent years he has killed a proposal to expand a business lounge and General Electric's bid to build a new hangar. 
Yet he has also extolled the convenience of the airport, which was built by the military during World War II and has been operated by the county since 1947.
The key to maintaining a balance between the airport's friends and foes was the curfew, instituted in 1984. "During the day, I fight with the residents and defend the airlines; from 12:30 to 6:30 I defend the residents," Mr. Spano said.
But in September a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines began running a 5:59 flight to Atlanta. There was little Mr. Spano could do; the county's old mandatory curfew at the airport was thrown out by a federal judge in 1983, and since then it has been voluntary. The airlines have generally respected it, though five other flights were violating the curfew when Mr. Spano took office in 1998.
When Continental Express announced last month it would violate the curfew, Mr. Spano felt he had to act. He had already ordered county employees to boycott airlines breaking the curfew and urged residents to complain to the airlines. "This is about arrogance and greed," he said. "Just because they're big doesn't make them great."
Closing the garage requires the approval of the county Board of Legislators and the Industrial Development Agency, and though they are expected to grant it, they are not scheduled to meet until April 23.
Julie Gardner, a spokeswoman for Continental Express, said, "As long as others are allowed to operate during the curfew, we also have to operate to remain competitive."
Mr. Spano was not the only one angered by that stance. "They care so little about our community that we're going to have to reel them in through the law," said Representative Susan W. Kelly, who introduced a bill in Congress to grant the airport a mandatory legal curfew last fall. It died in committee, but she has reintroduced it with Representatives Nita Lowey, Eliot L. Engel, Benjamin A. Gilman and Christopher Shays of Connecticut.
There are only a handful of mandatory curfews in the country, including one at Reagan National Airport in Washington. But there are a number of voluntary curfews, including one at La Guardia, which has a midnight-to-6 a.m. ban.
Mr. Spano's move against the airlines appears to have galvanized the local opposition. In early April, members of the Rye Brook Airport Advisory Council met with Harrison residents to form a new standing committee, Westchester Citizens Against Airport Expansion. 
"If someone breaks the curfew at night, you hear the plane buzzing your house and it's like the blitz of London," said Susan Glass, a real estate broker who attended the meeting. "It's really quite frightening."
Ms. Glass lives in the BelleFair housing development, which is on the edge of the runway and is still being completed. She said people who moved into the area recently don't feel they have the right to complain about airplane noise during the day, because they were warned about it when they came.
Sally Ogden, who lives in Greenwich near the airport, said the airport noise started early, often caused by corporate jets.
"We were wakened last night at 4:48 a.m.," Ms. Ogden said. She added that the daytime noise was not quite as bad as it had been, thanks to quieter jets. "It used to be that you'd be sitting outside in a chair in summer, and you couldn't hear the people sitting next to you."
The airport receives about 5,000 noise complaints a year, said Renee Johns, the noise abatement officer. (The 24-hour noise hot line: 914-939-8484.) When a call comes in, the caller's name and address is entered into a computer on the airport's second floor. The address then appears on a map on the screen, showing the tracks of all flights to and from the airport in the last two hours. Within moments, the caller's complaint is matched with one of the planes, and the computer shows the aircraft's height, direction and speed when the caller was disturbed. 
The information is printed in the Airport Monitor, which is sent to area residents every month. If one flight or operator provokes repeated complaints, the office will notify them, Ms. Johns said. 
The Federal Aviation Administration considers anyone who receives an average sound impact of 65 decibels or more to be "impacted" by aircraft noise, said Ms. Johns. But some advocates consider that rule inadequate: a five-year study of noise complaints at Westchester found that 99 percent came from outside the 65-decibel zone, said Arline Bronzaft, the chairwoman of the Aircraft Noise Abatement Group of New York and New Jersey.
Many local people said its long-term effect of lost sleep and constant irritation is not trivial, despite newer jet engines that are generally quieter than those used in earlier decades.
"For the last week and a half, we've been wakened at 4 a.m. by air noise, and it's getting worse and worse," said Janet Lockton, a former state legislator who lives near the airport in Greenwich and president of the Air Conservation Trust, an environmental group.
Many residents appear to be as concerned about the growth in flights as they are about violations of the curfew. That growth comes largely from noncommercial aviation, including the many corporate aircraft based at the airport, which accounts for about 80 percent of flights, said Joel Russell, the airport manager.
The airlines have more or less reached the maximum number of flight slots they are allowed in their agreement with the county, which is why Continental and Delta have violated the curfew, Mr. Russell said. (Under the agreement, which was established in a legal settlement between the county and the airlines in 1985, they are allowed four flights and an average of 240 passengers per half hour.) But there is room for more noncommercial aviation.
Many residents conceded that at its current level of use, the airport is still an asset, particularly in light of the congestion at La Guardia, which was responsible for one-fourth of all delayed flights nationwide in 2000. 
For many corporations, the airport's value is clear. "The airport is a great convenience for I.B.M. employees," said Carol Makovich, a spokeswoman for I.B.M., which has its own hangar and aircraft there.
Jim Christiansen, a spokesman for TAG Aviation, an aircraft management and charter company that operates 12 corporate jets based at Westchester, said a mandatory curfew at the airport "would be devastating to us, if for no other reason than perception."
"When I sit down with a competitor based somewhere else, and I have a curfew, it puts me at a severe disadvantage," he said.
Although TAG Aviation adheres to the curfew, the private aviation business is growing quickly, and TAG is lobbying for expanded facilities to handle more flights at Westchester, which is "a major hub for our business," Mr. Christiansen said.
Other aviation officials are more aggressive about the need for expansion. Nationally, air traffic is growing at 2 percent a year, and the difficulty of building new airports has created a need for expanded flight schedules and runways, Mr. Coyne of the National Air Transportation Association said.
"No community would put a curfew on I-95, and airports are the same way," he said. "They're part of a national transportation system that has to be open 24 hours a day." 
Mr. Coyne said his group planned to work with local officials and businesses to build support for expanded facilities and flight slots at the Westchester airport. Yet he acknowledged that it would not be easy.
The county is also bracing for a battle over how to use the space once occupied by an Air National Guard hangar on the terminal's northern end. A plan floated last year to build a training center for the New York Knicks and two other local sports teams now seems unlikely. Aviation officials are pushing hard for a new hangar, and the F.A.A. has said that if there is a need, the space should be used for aviation purposes, Mr. Russell said. But opponents of expansion are lobbying equally hard for an organic garden in the hope of blocking new construction.
A decision is expected next year. "There are fringe groups who don't want an airport here at all," Mr. Spano said wearily, "and other who would like it to be La Guardia."

HEADLINE: Favorite Son, Unfavorable Light 

BYLINE:  By JILL P. CAPUZZO 

DATELINE: SCOTCH PLAINS 

 BODY:
THE failed real estate ventures of Donald DiFrancesco's older brother, Paul, are not news to many people in this middle-class suburban town in western Union County.
 But in the 10 weeks since Mr. DiFrancesco was sworn in as the acting governor, he has found himself under a much more powerful microscope than he had in the previous nine years as the Senate president, because of several business arrangements, political decisions, personal baggage and economic realities. 
 And as the leading Republican candidate in this year's governor's race, one thing is as certain as a new Miss America in the fall: The attention paid to Mr. DiFrancesco will only become more intense. 
"He's got a much bigger bull's-eye on his head now," said Jon Shure, president of New Jersey Policy Perspective, a nonpartisan research organization. "The political advantages of being the incumbent are so great that people are really going after him, thinking, 'We better not let him get too much of an advantage.' "
Still, many of the people who grew up here -- where the name DiFrancesco not only carries the weight of governance but is also credited with developing much of this town -- are willing to overlook some questionable decisions in exchange for the possibility of one of their own taking over the governor's office.
"His brother was mixed up in the real estate business, it can happen to anybody," said Vic Passucci, the owner of Vic's Barber Shop on Park Avenue, where Mr. DiFrancesco has come for a trim every three or four weeks for the last 30 years. Mr. Passucci said he was a little surprised to learn that the acting governor had been involved in his brother's business troubles, but added: "I'm not too much concerned. He's a good guy and to my customers, he's the right one."
A fellow barber, Louis Martino, describing the acting governor as "a nice guy," put it this way: "It's all dirty politics. If they can sell a story, they'll print anything."
Yet in trying to wear three hats -- Senate president (a position the state constitution requires he continue to hold), acting governor and gubernatorial candidate -- Mr. DiFrancesco has opened himself up to critics. Not only does he face a scrappy primary challenger in Mayor Bret D. Schundler of Jersey City, who some say is planting many of the damaging stories about Mr. DiFrancesco, but also a hungry Democratic Party that wants to win the governor's race as well as regain the State Legislature, which has been controlled by the Republicans for a decade.
There is one point on which political opponents and allies alike agree: The acting governor was entirely unprepared for the bright spotlight that was put on him.
The problems date to 1989, when Mr. DiFrancesco and his brother, a real estate agent here, parted ways on a $1 million piece of property in Westfield. Records show that the brothers took a $95,000 loan on the property at that time from the Bavosa brothers, Union County trash haulers who had earlier pleaded guilty to price fixing. The acting governor now says his signature was forged on the loan documents.
His real estate problems continued in 1994 when Mr. DiFrancesco faced a $1.2 million mortgage default, including interest, which was reduced to $875,000 by the Central Bank of New Jersey, thereby knocking off $350,000.
To raise money for the remaining debt, Mr. DiFrancesco, who was Senate president at the time, borrowed $575,000 from friends, including $150,000 from Anthony Sartor, an engineer whose firm has received millions of dollars in public contracts, among them a $3.5 million subcontract on the state's plan to overhaul the auto emission program, a project that has ballooned to more than $500 million.
One additional family arrangement now haunts Mr. DiFrancesco. In 1996, K. Hovnanian Companies, the state's largest home builders, paid off a $225,000 debt that Mr. DiFrancesco owed to creditors on a Scotch Plains real estate investment made by his brother, Paul, and a cousin, Ernest DiFrancesco.
With each new disclosure, Mr. DiFrancesco's past became far more newsworthy than anything he was doing in the present.
"Very quickly it became a feeding frenzy," said the acting governor's chief spokesman, Tom Wilson, noting that many of Mr. DiFrancesco's previous business dealings were known to members of the press. "Individually, any one of the stories might have been O.K., but once the ball started to roll, it became an era of intense, heightened scrutiny."
Mr. Wilson added: "It's ironic that the press corps didn't care about all these stories when he was Senate president, but now they're saying, 'Oh, but he took that loan while he was Senate president.' There's a certain salaciousness to it all now because he is governor."
Using the Billy Carter or Hugh Rodham defense -- which says siblings help each other out -- supporters insist that Mr. DiFrancesco was only doing what any loyal brother would do to get a family member out of a jam.
"There's been entirely too much focus on the business dealings of a brother who he probably hasn't had a lot of business dealings with in the last decade," insisted State Senator Joseph M. Kyrillos Jr., who just last week was rewarded for his loyalty by being named the new chairman of the state Republican Party. "But he realized that this is his brother and his mother's son. I think New Jerseyans can appreciate that. All of us who have sisters and brothers can appreciate that."
Whether all New Jerseyans will be able to appreciate Mr. DiFrancesco's predicament is not known, but those in his hometown -- where they see the acting governor and his brother almost daily -- certainly can.
The DiFrancesco family is highly regarded in Scotch Plains. The acting governor's father, Paul Sr., was one of a wave of immigrants who came here from Montozzoli, in Italy's Adriatic region, in the mid-1940's. As a builder, he helped create many of the suburban neighborhoods of this Union County village of 25,000. Paul Sr. also served on the town planning board and as president of the local Italian-American Club for several years. 
Nor has Donald T. DiFrancesco forgotten his roots. Just days after being named acting governor, he stopped by the Italian-American Club for its annual pig roast, where he joined 500 other men to chow down on roasted pork, potatoes and antipasto.
"I met him at the pig roast," mused Joseph Barge, who was getting a haircut at Vic's. "I'm not much into politics, but he seemed like a very down to earth guy to me." 
At the Scotchwood Diner on Route 22 one recent day, Councilman Brian Gallagher of Somerville finished his lunch before weighing in on the acting governor, who still lives in Scotch Plains with his wife, Diane.
"He's a local favorite," said Mr. Gallagher, who had been a host of Mr. DiFrancesco the previous night at a Somerset County Republicans' candidates night, where he said the support for the acting governor was unwavering. "He's been so active here for so many years, it would be nice to see him get it."
Many in Trenton, however, are far less sympathetic, saying that as a seasoned politician -- in all, he has served for 22 years in the State Senate and 3 in the General Assembly -- who has had his eye on the prize for some time, Mr. DiFrancesco should have been more careful or better prepared.
"In politics today, you have to decide early how high you want to go and if you are willing to pay the price," said State Senator Bernard Kenny, a Democrat from Hoboken. "When it is your ambition to run for statewide office, you need to be sensitive to how your affairs are conducted. Many of his problems have to do with his brother, which is more or less understandable if you plan to stay a state senator, but if you're running statewide, then family is no longer an excuse."
Apparently, the Joint Legislative Committee on Ethics agrees, since it voted two weeks ago to investigate complaints filed by two Democrats who questioned the propriety of some of the Senate president's actions.
While the Democrats' lack of sympathy should come as no surprise, Republicans, despite their public show of circling the wagons, now have very real concerns that Mr. DiFrancesco could bring the party down in November, when the governor's seat and the Legislature are up for grabs. Although Republicans hold clear majorities in the Senate and the Assembly, a sizable win in the fall by the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Mayor James E. McGreevy of Woodbridge -- whom Christie Whitman barely defeated -- could mean a shift of power in the Legislature.
"I don't know of anyone who wants to hurt him," said Senator Kenny, "but if there's grist for the mill, that will be reflected in the campaign. When he's running against McGreevy, this all plays into that image that Donnie's not an outsider."
Mr. DiFrancesco reinforced his politics-as-usual image when he stood by the nomination of a close friend, Isabel Miranda, whom he had nominated for state treasurer, even after it was disclosed that she had taken a leave of absence rather than resign from her post as senior vice president at U.S. Trust Company of New Jersey, creating a possible conflict of interest with her new state job. It was also reported that Ms. Miranda had been fired by Citibank five years ago, in part because of an extramarital affair and misuse of expense account funds, charges both she and the acting governor have denied. Nonetheless, Ms. Miranda withdrew her name from consideration, a move Mr. DiFrancesco said he was disappointed by, calling Ms. Miranda "a person of enormous character and integrity."
Nearly everyone who knows him talks about Mr. DiFrancesco's devotion to friends and family and his cooperative, considerate approach with colleagues, but it may be those very traits that prove to be his downfall as chief executive.
"His personality serves him well as a human being, but it has some drawbacks as far as being governor goes," said Senator Ray Lesniak, an Elizabeth Democrat who blames Mr. DiFrancesco's staff for not preparing him well for a job that everyone knew he was going to have to fill once George W. Bush was elected president. "He's a little too trusting, too vulnerable."
There was no love lost between the former and the current governor, despite being members of the same party, making a smooth transition between administrations nearly impossible. Furthermore, former Governor Whitman had a less than harmonious relationship with the Legislature, the baggage from which Mr. DiFrancesco now carries to some extent.
"He comes to office with a lot of issues because there was no real closeness between Don and his predecessor," said Senator Wayne R. Bryant, a Democrat from Camden. "None of my Republican colleagues felt close to her or her staff. She felt a sort of disdain for the Legislature. So he inherits all the backlash from the former governor by finishing out her term."
Members of both parties agree that Mr. DiFrancesco is a breath of fresh air, and though some Republicans are reluctant to criticize Mrs. Whitman, they are quick to praise Mr. DiFrancesco for being more accessible than his predecessor. As an example, they point to the fact that he has removed the automatic locks on the door to his office, which required visitors to be buzzed in under the Whitman administration.
"Don is very different," said Senator Diane B. Allen, the Republican majority whip from Burlington. "There is a much more open atmosphere. He respects the senators of both parties, and they respect him."
Despite the series of controversies that arose during his first few months in office, Senator Allen said Mr. DiFrancesco had been successful in pushing through such important legislation as tax reform and a clean drinking water bill.
"In private moments, I'm sure he's not real happy with the fact that there have been dozens of bills he's signed into law that no one's interested in;these are just straightforward things that change people's lives," she said, reflecting a frustration felt by many Republicans who cite heightened media coverage in Trenton for much of Mr. DiFrancesco's public relations problems.
With New Jersey now serving as the poster state for racial profiling, the burgeoning New Jersey press corps is starting to look more like the White House press corps. In the press room just off Committee Room 4, where the Senate Judiciary Committee entered its fourth week of hearings on racial profiling last week, crowds of television reporters followed the proceeding on closed-circuit television, then chased down witnesses as they left the hearing room. These same crews are at the ready every time a new story breaks in the executive offices.
And though the racial profiling story is unfolding down the hall, this controversy can also be linked to the acting governor. Democrats are quick to point out that it was Senate President DiFrancesco who pushed for the appointment of Peter J. Veniero to the State Supreme Court two years ago. Yet last week Mr. DiFrancesco joined a growing voice of detractors, and asked that Justice Veniero resign from the bench for ignoring racial profiling complaints while he was attorney general.
While some, like Ron Frigerio, the Union County Republican chairman, describe the coverage of Mr. DiFrancesco as "the politics of personal destruction being leaked by his opponent," even his most ardent supporters believe there is some legitimacy to what they read.
"A lot of that stuff has been well known for a number of years," said State Senator Norman M. Robertson, a Republican from Passaic. "I didn't know every detail, but nothing came as a drop-dead shock. Anybody who's in public life is going to have a private life as well."
Mr. DiFrancesco's spokesman, Mr. Wilson, agrees, saying that no public figure could withstand the kind of scrutiny his boss has received.
"If we were to live up to the editorial standards of some media, it would require our leaders to be farm raised, in a sterile environment and not have any contact with anyone else in the world, which wouldn't make them very good lawmakers," said Mr. Wilson.
Still, the concern is now starting to shift from disputing the veracity of what is being reported to weighing the cumulative effect these articles are having on the public, what Senator Bryant calls "that critical mass."
"The question is whether he is damaged goods as a candidate," said Mark Magyar, president of the Center for Analysis of Public Issues who is a former policy advisor to Governor Whitman. "None of the items would make the 'Greatest New Jersey Political Scandals' list. They're not at the level of corruption to knock anybody out of a race. It's more the overall tarnishing of the image that affects the public perception that he'll have to come back from."
A sampling of 1,129 voters taken by the Quinnipiac Poll a month after he took over as governor found Mr. DiFrancesco's favorable rating at 23 percent and his unfavorable rating 10 percent among those polled. The largest percentage -- 46 percent -- fell in the category of "haven't heard enough."
Soon enough, they did. A poll taken last week showed Mr. DiFrancesco's favorable rating remaining almost steady at 24 percent and his negative rating creeping to 14 percent, while those who said they did not know enough dropped to 38 percent.
"He's becoming more recognizable every time we talk to people," said Scott McLean, a political science professor at Quinnipiac College and analyst for the poll. "At this early stage, bad news is still good publicity, as people are just beginning to realize he's on the radar screen. But if the negative news continues, it will start to hurt him."
The margin between Mr. DiFrancesco and Mr. McGreevey continues to widen, with the acting governor now trailing the Democratic candidate by 33 percent to 42 percent, according to the latest Quinnipiac Poll.
"DiFrancesco took some hits in the polls, which has got to be the effect of all the negative headlines," said Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac College poll. "This hasn't destroyed him, but it hasn't been good for him. McGreevey has had a free ride so far. Nobody's going after him. But when it's one against the other, they'll both be in for their share of it."
The advice most commonly offered is that Mr. DiFrancesco needs to act gubernatorial -- and avoid being a candidate -- for as long as possible. Of course, bad news about the state, like the recently projected $1 billion shortfall in next year's state budget, will become the acting governor's responsibility -- and perhaps a liability.
Finally last week, after a steady drumbeat of bad news, Mr. DiFrancesco decided it was time to make a move. He shuffled the political team by naming his man, Senator Kyrillos, as the new state party chairman, replacing Chuck Haytaian, a power broker and state party chairman for the last six years -- a sure sign of anxiety over what is expected to be a nasty primary in June and an uphill race this fall. 
Most of all, Mr. DiFrancesco's supporters are hoping there are no more shoes to drop. 
Thomas O'Brien, the police chief in Scotch Plains, has known Mr. DiFrancesco since they attended Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School in the early 1960's. Mr. O'Brien describes the acting governor as "a very decent, down-to-earth individual," and says that local pride for Mr. DiFrancesco is deep, but not blind.
"He's ingratiated himself with the local people and there's a strong sense of pride," said the police chief. "But there's not that blind loyalty you find in some parts of New Jersey. People here mostly like him, and if everything's out on the table and it's all being dealt with, he'll survive. If more things keep coming up, it's going to be a lot more difficult to support him."
Mr. DiFrancesco's closest advisors say the acting governor is trying to rise above the storm, reminding himself that "I have a job to do, to be governor, to keep my eye on the ball," according to Mr. Wilson. 
Or as Senator Kyrillos put it last week: "It's been a long month, but it's only been one month, and there are a bunch more to come."

HEADLINE: PRELUDES; 
Dot-Coms' Loss Is Peace Corps' Gain

BYLINE:  By ABBY ELLIN; Abby Ellin is a Manhattan writer. Her column on starting out in the world of money appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: preludes@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
UNEMPLOYED dot-com workers of the world take note: the Peace Corps wants you! 
 The organization, which is celebrating its 40th anniversary this year, is expanding its horizons. Thirteen percent of its service is now in the business sector, working with small businesses and the like. Last June, it assigned to Belize its first round of information-technology volunteers. 
 In October, the Peace Corps teamed up with AOL Time Warner and Hewlett-Packard to provide such volunteers with "Peace Packs" -- packages of computers, modems, printers and digital cameras -- to be integrated into their work.
All of this may be of great interest to dot-com professionals in unemployment lines. According to Challenger Gray & Christmas, the outplacement firm, more than 75,000 dot-com employees have received pink slips since December 1999 -- some 45 percent of them in the Bay Area.
Seizing the opportunity, the Peace Corps recently placed advertisements in The San Francisco Weekly, under the headline: "Dot Com, Dot Gone? Now It's Time to Network With the Real World."
Dennis McMahon, a public affairs specialist in the San Francisco office of the Peace Corps, was part of the team that created the ads. He said many dot-commers might have wanted to join the Peace Corps out of college, "but they didn't because the economy was so good."
"They had jobs," he added. "They didn't need us."
The ads appear to have paid off. Last month, Mr. McMahon's office received more than 130 applications, versus 70 in March 2000. Since October, in fact, the overall organization has had its highest number of volunteers in 26 years -- 7,300, in 76 countries. (Its goal is 10,000 volunteers.)
Is it coincidental that some young people -- the average age of a Peace Corps volunteer is 29 -- have become more benevolent as the stock market has lost ground? 
Cameron Brodeur, 27, a software engineer in San Francisco, recently applied to the corps. "The current state of the market prompted me to at least consider where I'd be in six months or a year," he said.
After reading about the 40th anniversary of the organization, he deemed it "cool" and "exciting" and applied. He will be ready to go in the fall, if accepted; the rigorous application process can last up to nine months. Although he was employed when we first talked, at NBC Internet, he said he became a dot-com downsizing casualty last week.
Clearly, it takes a certain kind of person to commit to 24 months of living in a mud hut, earning a meager monthly stipend and coming home to a paltry $6,075 "readjustment allowance."
"I have lots of friends who have been laid off who aren't joining the Peace Corps," Mr. Brodeur said.
Still, is all the renewed interest altruistic, or have applicants simply decided they have nothing better to do? Two years ago, I interviewed young volunteers who viewed the Peace Corps as a two-year internship that would, ideally, culminate in a high-paying job at a top firm back home. Does that motivation still apply? Are they just waiting for the market and economy to rebound?
"Perhaps they are really just reverse entrepreneurs who went into dot-coms to change the world -- that didn't work out, so they're looking to expand their horizons by other means," said Heather Shively, 34, the chief executive and co-founder of CapitalThinking Inc., a company based in New York that offers Web-based financial services for commercial real estate transactions. Ms. Shively has firsthand experience with the Peace Corps; she was a volunteer in Mali from 1988 to 1991. 
Perhaps she is on to something. Karen Smith, executive director of Tech Corps, which places information-technology professionals in schools nationwide to help train teachers on computers, has seen interest in its programs triple in the last few months. Ethan Zuckerman, chief executive and co-founder of Geekcorps, a nonprofit organization based in North Adams, Mass., has sent 14 information-technology professionals on four-month stints to Ghana since February 2000. There, they help small businesses with tasks ranging from managing accounting online to building the e-commerce components of their Web sites. 
"I'm not seeing people saying, 'I'm getting laid off -- please send me to Ghana,' " Mr. Zuckerman said. "But I am seeing people who are saying, 'If I'm not going to be a millionaire from this job, I might as well do the things I always wanted to do.' "
MR. BRODEUR said he fantasized in college about working internationally one day, but the rising Nasdaq kept him closer to home. "The market was so good, and I got a fantastic job right out of school that I couldn't give up," he said.
Five years later, however, "I feel there's so much more I can learn about myself than through a desk job," he said. "I don't look at this as giving something up; I'm just doing something different." He added that the Peace Corps provided "a great way to work abroad and help others and immediately see the benefits."
And, yes, one benefit may be job-related. "When I'm done, it could open up a whole lot of doors -- internationally or at home," he said.

Private Traders See Gold in Venture Capital Ruins

BYLINE:  By AMY CORTESE 

 BODY:
PSST. Hey, buddy, want in on one of the hottest, most exclusive investments of the last few years -- really cheap? 
 Such pleas are being whispered across Silicon Valley these days, as investors who once jumped into venture capital find that they no longer have the financial or psychological wherewithal to weather the market downturn. Many are now trying to get out -- sometimes at any price. 
 As the market has soured, a growing number of people who became limited partners in the booming market for venture capital in the 1990's are being hit by margin calls on their stock investments, hefty tax bills and mounting stock market losses. Often, those troubles have come just as they are being asked to pony up more money to fulfill their commitments to the venture funds, which generally require investors to commit to six-figure sums upfront but to hand over the cash only as it is needed. 
Institutional venture capitalists are feeling the pinch, too. In particular, many corporations that set up venture arms to cash in on the Internet boom -- often going far afield from their businesses -- are suddenly finding those investments a drag on earnings. With Wall Street shunning most initial public stock offerings, venture capital returns have turned into losses, leaving no cash to distribute to investors.
The rub is, unlike shares that can be traded on the stock market, investments in venture funds and other private equity are much less liquid. "Silicon Valley is crawling with people trying to get out of their V.C. funds and their jet time-shares," said a West coast venture capitalist who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
What's a former billionaire to do? Many are turning to professionals who specialize in buying out private equity positions. These specialists operate quietly in a private secondary market, where prices are set in one-on-one deals and never published.
"We're getting swamped right now from people who want liquidity," said Dayton T. Carr, general partner at Venture Capital Fund of America in Manhattan, one of a handful of firms that buy out limited-partner positions in venture capital and other private equity investments.
Brent R. Nicklas, the managing partner at Lexington Partners in Manhattan, has had the same experience. "We're seeing stuff from everywhere," he said, "from large corporations right on down to individual entrepreneurs, some of whom were worth hundreds of millions and now can't pay their taxes." 
In contrast to venture capital funds, which have lost access to piles of cash, these funds are having little trouble. Lexington has almost finished raising $2.5 billion from investors like pension funds, to pick up private equity on the secondary market.
THE business of trading private equity investments, though not new, is as discreet and clubby as the venture capital world. Because there are no reporting requirements, statistics are hard to come by. But anecdotal evidence suggests that the venture capital meltdown is proving to be a boon to the burgeoning secondary market. "This is the largest opportunity the secondary market has seen in a decade," said David E. Park, a partner at Paul Capital Partners, based in San Francisco.
The subject is sensitive for venture capitalists and limited partners alike. Venture capitalists must approve any of these proposed sales and, typically, they have the right of first refusal. Many profess to have no knowledge of sales, but others in the industry said that they were widespread. "All the big names have had secondary transactions," said Brett D. Byers, a partner at Venture Capital Fund of America.
Although most activity is behind the scenes, a few deals have been made public. At the end of last year, Chase Manhattan liquidated more than $1 billion in private equity holdings in a transaction led by Lexington Partners. And iXL, a Web design services firm in Atlanta, has said it will try to raise $50 million to $100 million by selling parts of its iXL Ventures portfolio, which invested in private Internet companies. 
For sellers, liquidity comes at a steep cost. Venture buyouts on the secondary market have typically been made at a 20 percent to 40 percent discount, to reflect the risk involved. As the economic outlook has worsened, the discounts have been increasing sharply -- by one account, positions in second- or third-tier funds can be had for as little as 10 or 20 cents on the dollar. In late March, Mr. Carr said, his fund bought out a limited partner's position in nine funds at a 68 percent discount from the already marked-down fair value. 
Investors who want to bail out of their venture investments first have to find potential buyers, which can be hard because the small secondary market is driven by relationships and word of mouth. Traditionally, just 0.5 percent to 1 percent of private equity investments under management have changed hands, mostly when large institutions reallocate investments, shift strategies or comply with new regulations.
Banks, for example, regularly dump old funds for new ones once they have mined the relationships for banking deals. Sometimes, individuals are required to liquidate their holdings after they take office, as is the case for some Bush administration officials. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, for one, has substantial private equity holdings.
In the last few years, though, new types of private equity investors have emerged. Traditionally, such investors were often pension funds and other long-term investors. But now, they increasingly include more newly wealthy individuals, or institutions interested in momentum plays. Nowhere was this more pronounced than in the venture capital market. Top-tier outfits like Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in Menlo Park, Calif., for example, set up "affiliate funds" to let the chief executives of their portfolio companies and other friends of the firm participate in a fund's profits along with their traditional limited partners. 
"In Silicon Valley, a lot of people made a lot of money over the past five to six years and broadened their investments," Mr. Park said. "It became fashionable to invest in venture capital." Then the bubble burst. "There was a disconnect that somehow you were buying into the current returns when in reality you were buying into future declines," Mr. Nicklas said. 
HarbourVest Partners, based in Boston, typically saw one individual every six months who was selling a $1 million position in a private equity fund, said Fred Maynard, managing director. But the numbers are growing. In a typical six-month period this year, he estimated, he will see 15 to 20 individuals, trying to sell assets of $5 million to $8 million, on average.
Similarly, Michael D. Granoff, chief executive of Pomona Capital in New York, said that his firm had already looked at $2 billion of secondary deals in the first quarter of 2001 -- compared with $4 billion for all of last year. And Lexington has seen a half-dozen or so corporations that want to sell some or all of their venture portfolios. 
With this increased activity, the first real attempts to create a more formal market are emerging. At least two companies -- PrivateTrade and Round1 -- are trying to construct orderly online marketplaces for private equity deals. And J. P. Morgan Chase is leading an effort to securitize private equity, in much the way that mortgage-backed securities are packaged and traded. 
That change would be part of the natural evolution of an extremely large financial market. Last year, about $160 billion in private equity was raised, with venture capital making up more than half. By the end of 2000, more than $200 billion in venture funds were under management. As the size of the private equity market has ballooned, the secondary market has blossomed naturally, to more than $2 billion last year. 
IN some ways, the development is reminiscent of the rise of the market for junk bonds in the 1980's. The emergence of a secondary market for high-yield debt provided liquidity and allowed the primary market to expand. A secondary market could do the same for private equity.
The economics of this market look good. Investments that are picked up after portfolio companies are up and running can bring a faster payoff. And unlike limited partners, who put up cash for the general partners to invest, secondary investors know exactly what is in the portfolios they are buying. That has helped Mr. Carr's fund, for example, outperform many venture funds; its average annual net returns have exceeded 30 percent for the last decade.
Secondary investing, of course, is not without risk. Valuing venture investments in this climate is a challenge. Some funds -- saddled with struggling start-ups with no chance of making money -- will still be lucky to sell at any price.

HEADLINE: GRASS-ROOTS BUSINESS; 
Oil-Patch Epicenter, Embracing the Web

BYLINE:  By JOEL KOTKIN 

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
AS the daughter of an oil-field supplier in Lake Charles, La., two and a half hours from this booming energy capital, Claire S. Farley says she always knew she would end up in the business herself. Often the only woman in her geology classes in college, Ms. Farley did eventually become one of the few top executives in the energy industry who are women. She held several high-level positions at Texaco, including president of North American oil and gas production.
 Today, Ms. Farley, 42, finds herself and the company where she is chief executive, Trade-Ranger, in another pioneering role. Trade-Ranger, which provides Internet-based business-to-business services to energy companies and suppliers, is part of a growing information sector that is rapidly transforming both the energy industry and this historically blue-collar city. 
 Energy companies have tended to be insular, Ms. Farley said, conducting most of their basic research and development internally. But to take advantage of new information technologies, she said, they increasingly look to new businesses like hers. Trade-Ranger, whose clients include 15 major energy companies, helps manage transactions between those companies and key suppliers over an Internet-based global network.
It is a potentially huge business, she said, adding that global energy companies spend more than $500 billion a year procuring most anything from pipes to computer services. "Fundamentally, the people in this business are looking for information and economies of scale," she said, pointing to a need to buy large quantities of goods and services at the best available prices. "Ten years ago, they would have done this themselves, but now they are looking for people who can give them solutions."
In a broader sense, Houston-based companies like Trade-Ranger and the PetroCosm Corporation, a rival whose founders include Chevron, are part of a rising tide of technology businesses connected to the energy industry. As technology companies, especially Internet businesses, are collapsing in places like San Francisco and New York, energy-related technology concerns have not been as troubled by the collapse of the Nasdaq or weakening investor confidence.
Trade-Ranger, founded last summer, has more than $90 million in venture capital from energy companies like Royal Dutch/Shell and BP Amoco. That money lets the company invest heavily in new technology.
But it is not just Internet companies that are thriving here. Other technology companies -- in fields as different as geology and market analysis -- are also growing rapidly.
That is a major departure from previous energy expansions, like the boom of the 1970's, when growth came largely from manufacturing oil-field equipment or dispatching riggers around the world. Barton Smith, an economics professor at the University of Houston, said that much of what Houston needs today, and is selling to the world, is technological and managerial expertise.
RECENT employment numbers reflect the trend. Over the last three years, the fastest rate of job growth in Houston has been concentrated in business services, as well as engineering, accounting, research and management services. In contrast, the traditional energy sector, which includes oil companies and businesses directly engaged in mining, gained only 10,000 jobs last year, well below historical highs.
"Houston's energy economy is increasingly high tech," Mr. Smith said. "It's white collar, not blue collar."
Other evidence of a white-collar expansion can be seen in the office market. New office towers, including headquarters for energy businesses like Enron and Reliant Resources, have been rising downtown. Vacancy rates in the central core, as high as 30 percent in the late 1980's, have dropped into the single digits. Once a ghost town after hours, downtown is starting to become a more popular destination, and increasingly a residential hub, for young professionals.
The surge in technology-related employment is also spreading across the vast greater Houston area, which is larger than all of New Jersey. Much of the most recent growth has been beyond the city limits, a periphery that is home to nearly 2.7 million of the region's estimated 4.6 million residents.
"The growth is becoming inevitable," said David Wolff, president of the Wolff Companies, a developer in the energy corridor along the city's western suburbs. "The billings are increasing at all the energy companies -- that's billions in new spending coming on line."
THE new wealth has created a large middle class of accountants, lawyers and other professionals, many of them directly or indirectly serving the energy industry. More fashionable boutiques and high-end restaurants are opening throughout the area, joining places like the Galleria -- west of downtown -- the shopping and office center where Trade-Ranger is based. "Houston," Ms. Farley said, "is becoming chic."
The shift away from a blue-collar base extends even into the industry's historic core -- the wildcatters. Once identified with roughnecks and seat-of-the-pants entrepreneurs, the exploration industry now relies more on sophisticated sensing and computer-modeling technology than on elbow grease.
Companies like Davis Petroleum, which explores largely in the Gulf of Mexico, depend increasingly on such technologies to uncover oil and natural-gas supplies. The family-owned business, which has grown to 50 employees from 20 in the last five years, now includes 10 highly paid scientists. "There's a tremendous amount of data generated in this business and a huge paper trail," said Gregg James Davis, the company's president. "To be efficient, you have to get down to the digits so you can make better guesses as to where to drill."
Deregulation of energy prices has also increased demand for sophisticated trading information, said Jay P. Lukens, 46, president of the Lukens Energy Group, which provides information and trend analysis on energy prices, as well as advice for mergers and acquisitions for major utilities and generators.
Founded in 1999, Lukens has grown to 20 employees, from 6, virtually all of them with graduate degrees. The company uses the latest computer-modeling technology for utilities and energy concerns, including the Williams Companies, Alberta Energy and BP Amoco. Lukens's billings are rising to an estimated $6 million this year from $2 million two years ago.
Mr. Lukens says, however, that his company remains an energy business at heart. "We have the software," he said, "but what we are selling in reality is knowledge of the market itself."
Such expertise, Ms. Farley said, will give Houston a competitive edge. Even if oil prices drop, major energy companies merge and most new drilling continues to take place thousands of miles from the Texas coast, she predicts that the city's new technology-oriented energy sector will continue to expand.
"Houston now sells its expertise," said Ms. Farley, whose major investors are from outside of Texas. "Why not London or Los Angeles? Why, it's the oil business -- it has to be in Houston. Everyone you know who's important in this business passes through here. It's where the information is."

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
Seeing Blue Skies, Again, For Chips

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
IN the technology food chain, nothing is more basic than semiconductors and the machines that make them. 
 If the chip makers are not doing good business, most technology companies will not fare well, either. Just now, semiconductor conditions could not be much worse. 
 Until recently, the stocks reflected that bleak reality. On April 4, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange's Semiconductor Index, known by its ticker symbol "SOX," ended at 463, or 63 percent below its March 2000 peak. 
Since then, the chip stocks have been much livelier: over the last six trading sessions, the SOX index has jumped 29 percent. 
Jonathan Joseph, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, is at least partly responsible: after months of bearish comments, Mr. Joseph turned positive on the stocks last week. He took some time to discuss his sunnier outlook. Following are excerpts from the conversation: 

Q. It is widely expected that when a turn comes, semiconductor and semiconductor equipment stocks will lead the technology sector. What is that view based on?

A. Semiconductors are the basic building block of the whole electronics industry. An integrated circuit is really a minicomputerused in everything from personal computers to cell phones to toasters. The value of semiconductor electronics in an auto today is higher than the steel.

Q.You shook up a lot of people last July when you downgraded semiconductor stocks, citing deteriorating fundamentals. What do you see now?

A. We are not seeing a lot of signs. In fact, what has surprised us has been the falloff in demand.
Last summer, we thought the downturn would be due to excess capacity, which would pull down capital spending. We forecast that capital spending would grow 35 percent in 2001, down from more than 60 percent in 2000. Current forecasts are for a 30 percent to 35 percent decline this year.

Q. So if demand has disappeared and capital spending plans slashed, why are you feeling better?

A.These are highly cyclical stocks. You buy them when the prospects look bleakest, and you sell them when business looks the brightest. These cycles generally last about two to three years on the upside, and about a year on the downside.
And there have been a couple of things that have caught my eye. 
In March, Cypress Semiconductor had virtually no net new orders. That has never happened before. If they only get one order this month, it will be an improvement. 
Second, we have seen better-than-expected demand out of Taiwan's motherboard business for the last three months in a row. That's important, because 80 percent of all personal computers go through Taiwan to pick up parts or to get assembled. 
We had written the personal-computer market off for dead this year. 
These are soft data points. But by the time you get hard data points the stocks have already moved. 

Q. Your call got a lot of attention, partly because so many on Wall Street remain so bearish, partly because you were so right about the downturn. What has the client reaction been?

A. Seven out of eight calls from institutional investors have essentially been that I have no factual basis to make this forecast. I find that very encouraging. Last summer, they had much the same sort of reaction when I turned negative.

Q. It's not like your optimism has no bounds. Last week, you said that over the next few months the SOX could trade as high as 700, but has a potential downside of around 400.

A. When I made the call, the SOX was at about 500. I thought the upside potential was about 40 percent.
The index has moved up a lot since, but what we are saying here is that we would be opportunistic and would be buyers of the stocks up to 700, but to expect pullbacks. Eventually, this group is going to double or triple. 

Q. Which stocks do you like?

A. We upgraded all eight that we follow, a list that includes Intel, Micron, ST Microelectronics, Texas Instruments and Altera. All of the names are very high quality.
Our semiconductor equipment analysts also upgraded the companies they follow, including Applied Materials and KLA-Tencor.

Q. Where do you expect to see demand picking up first?

A. Last year, there was a serial decline in demand that began with the PC manufacturers, followed by the wireless companies and then the wireline users. Now it looks like it will come back in that fashion.

Q. How sure are you that conditions will improve over the next year?

A. There is no doubt that things will look much better. If they don't, we will be in a very serious recession and I'll be teaching English in Japan.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Bear Market? The Young Needn't Be Restless

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
IN the last decade, the stock market has become something of a hometown sports team for the entire nation. We check up on it during the day, much the way people steal a peek at afternoon baseball games. When our team -- call it the Bulls -- is losing, we all feel a little glummer. When the team is winning, as it was last week, we head home for the night a bit happier.
 The reason for this cheering is basic. The whole country -- or its growing class of investors, at the very least -- appears to prosper with a rising market. That is not quite right, however. There are actually millions of investors who could benefit from a lengthy bear market. In fact, it would probably improve the long-term economic security of most Americans under the age of 40. 
 The idea certainly seems counterintuitive. After all, many people in their 20's and 30's have watched their portfolios fall along with most everyone else's in recent months. But most young people -- like typical Americans of any age -- are not selling stocks on a day-to-day or even month-to-month basis. They are regularly contributing money to retirement accounts, like 401(k) plans.
Even in 1998, when advertisements depicted ordinary people day-trading their way to wealth, middle-class families owned, on average, $8,500 in retirement accounts, almost twice as much as they held in mutual funds and individual stocks, according to Edward Wolff, an economics professor at New York University.
Now consider a somewhat typical 30-year-old, Ms. X, and imagine two chains of events for the next three decades. In both cases, she started a new job about a year ago and made an initial $1,500 contribution to a 401(k). In both cases, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index -- a proxy for her investment -- reaches 8,000 in the year 2036, although it takes different paths in between.
In the first situation, the market rebounds quickly this year from its decline. The $1,500 investment that Ms. X made a year ago, when the index peaked at about 1,500, returns to its initial value by the end of 2001.
In the second situation -- the bearish one, over the short term -- the S.& P. index ends the year at about 1,000, down 16 percent from its current level, and Ms. X's 401(k) will be worth $1,000.
At this point, she appears to be suffering from the market's drop, as is everyone else. But keep in mind how she will invest over the remainder of her career. Ms. X has no plans to take money out of her account for many years; she will only add to it -- say $1,000 each year starting in 2002.
SO she benefits from a market that does not grow in value too soon. "Theoretically, the best thing that could happen for people who are younger," said Richard E. Reibman, a financial adviser at Merrill Lynch, "is for the stock market to remain depressed while they're investing and to rise dramatically just before they retire." And the worst thing that could happen would be for the S.& P. 500 to shoot to 8,000 next week and stay there for 35 years, giving Ms. X's investment the approximate long-term return of cash sitting in a drawer.
Between those two extremes, small differences in the index's growth rate can have a major impact on a portfolio over 35 years.
Return to the first situation, in which the S.& P. 500 ends the year at 1,500. To reach 8,000 by 2036, the index would need to grow 5 percent each year, leaving Ms. X with about $95,000 when she was 65.
If the S.& P. instead declines further this year, and closes at about 1,000, it would need to increase more than 6 percent a year to reach 8,000 three decades from now. In that case, Ms. X would have $125,000 in 2036, because she would be able to buy more stock for her money in the crucial first decade of her investments. The difference between the two final totals is 30 percent. For a generation that may not be able to rely on Social Security as its parents can, that may represent the difference between a comfortable retirement and a difficult one.
Some will quibble with the assumption that the S.& P. will be at 8,000 in both situations. It may seem more logical to think that the higher the market is today, the higher it is likely to be in the future. But remember what a stock is: a claim on the future earnings of a company. If the market was overvalued at its peak a year ago, as many analysts believe, it will likely grow sluggishly in the years ahead, until earnings catch up to the expectations of share prices. "There's very little public recognition that future returns depend on current price," said Robert J. Shiller, a Yale economics professor and the author of "Irrational Exuberance."
So rather than resembling a hometown team, perhaps the market is more like an intergenerational rivalry. People nearing retirement can root for the Bulls, and those under 40 can pull for the Bears -- at least for the next decade or two.

BYLINE:  By LESLIE BERGER 

 BODY:
OF all the little businesses on East Ninth Street just west of Tompkins Square Park, none reflect the street's changes and the enduring influence of the Ninth Street A-1 Block Association better than I Coppi, a tawny restaurant featuring Tuscan food and intimate conversation.
 In the early 80's the site, at 432 East Ninth Street, housed the notorious Kiwi Social Club, which residents say was a focal point for drug dealing. Next came a punk mecca, the Aztec Lounge, whose noise and violence spilled onto the street. The block association went to court to shut down the Aztec, then fended off a proposed club, paradoxically named No Bar. 
 About three and a half years ago, I Coppi broke the spell when its owners approached the block association even before applying for their business permits. The property's bad karma preceded it and so, apparently, did the block association's reputation. The two sides negotiated a written accord. Under its terms the restaurant agreed to serve only beer and wine and to limit seating in its "whispering garden" to parties of two. 
"I live on Fourth Street between A and B, so I understand their point of view 100 percent," said Lorella Innocenti, who owns I Coppi with her husband, John Brennan. "We tell our customers at the door to please be quiet, to respect our neighbors."
Gone are the huge, cantankerous meetings and publicity-seeking rallies that marked the block association's work during the 1980's and early 90's. Those were times when the 400 block of East Ninth Street was so rife with brazen drug dealing that the block association once recruited the Guardian Angels and tried to organize around them, recalled Alan Jacobs, one of the group's founders.
Today, like patrons of I Coppi, the block association whispers more than it shouts. Tightly focused political actions have replaced flirtations with vigilantism, and the group acts only when necessary to protect its street of towering gingko trees and humble early-20th-century row houses. If Sarah Wilkins, the association's mainstay, spots something troubling -- an empty storefront or a request for a liquor license -- the response is mostly behind the scenes.
Typically, she will mobilize a network of building captains who in turn will alert their neighbors, who will call public officials in a never-ending effort to control noise, traffic and crime. Drug dealing has subsided, but the East Village's rowdy night life and gentrification continue to plague residents and small-business owners, as they do throughout the city, where quality of life issues have replaced crime as block associations' main concerns. So, like a creature that looks dead but is only resting, the Ninth Street A-1 Block Association will rouse itself from dormancy when necessary.
"Basically, I find out what's going on and shoot the starter pistol," Ms. Wilkins said. "And they all show up for the race."
Like East Ninth Street, New York has grown cleaner, safer and richer. And block associations, once a staple of neighborhood life, may be part of the price of prosperity, the earnest victims of their own success. Block associations have not become extinct; new ones are born all the time in response to one problem or another. And many, like the 20-year-old East Ninth Street group, remain guiding forces in their neighborhoods. But as middle-class stalwarts are frozen out of the housing market by rising prices, many block associations have slipped into hibernation.
The intangible sense of small-town security they lent New Yorkers, with their common causes and roll-up-your-sleeves ethic, is more elusive.
"It takes so much work to live in Manhattan, to work at our jobs and to pay our rent, people don't have the time to spend on community affairs," said Gerard Schriffen, a co-chairman of the Manhattan Neighborhood Council, a congress of local groups.

Once-Combative Associations Are Now Less Visible
At one time in the city, not so long ago, crises erupted so regularly that block associations seemed to multiply in biblical proportions. They were the dot-coms of the 70's and 80's, groups of go-getters, often young, ready to plant gardens, preserve housing, save the city. Who doesn't remember all those Neighborhood Watch signs, which promoted both public safety and camaraderie?
"What I believe, through a block association, is that I can change things in New York," said Marilyn Appleberg, the longtime president of the 10th and Stuyvesant Streets Block Association, which restored parks, started a concert series and successfully opposed high-rises, drugs and prostitution. "That's a very romantic notion."
Today block associations have a more tenuous, less visible role. Mr. Schriffen noted that membership in his umbrella group has grown from seven or eight block associations nine years ago to 150 now, but that the same people rarely attend the council's monthly meetings more than once as their concerns wax and wane. The Citizens Committee of New York City, a nonprofit group that promotes block associations with financing, awards and workshops, maintains a list of 7,000 active associations, said its president, Michael Clark. Mr. Clark maintains that block associations are as vital as ever. But even Mr. Clark, who calls block associations "the building blocks that keep civilized society working," acknowledges that they have been buffeted by new challenges in a growing economy.
Immigration, he said, has turned many neighborhoods into mini-United Nations, making it tough to unite residents from different cultures and income levels who speak different languages. Others cited pressures on small volunteer groups, including big corporations redeveloping swaths of land, which are Goliaths compared with even the savviest local groups. Business improvement districts have become important civic players, and co-op boards have supplanted block associations in some of the most expensive neighborhoods.
Old-fashioned block parties, with their satisfying sense of community and shared purpose, are less frequent. More common now are cloned street fairs run by professional vendors selling the same merchandise at every event. As Mr. Schriffen observed, "The city is improved, but it's losing some of its character."
The Ninth Street A-1 Block Association, which takes its name from the boundaries of the group's turf, Avenue A and First Avenue, has mellowed along with its neighborhood. Formed in 1982 in response to the area's drug bazaar, the group has dispensed with regular meetings, elections and even block parties, though core members cling to a crucial list of names and phone numbers. Ms. Wilkins, a social worker, patiently pounds out correspondence on the computer she has set up in the tiny living room of her immaculate walk-up apartment.
"We're sort of in preventive mode," said Ms. Wilkins, who favors khakis and similar conservative clothing. "Our mission is the same, but our approach is different now."
Like Ms. Wilkins, who arrived on Ninth Street in 1979 as an aspiring dancer from Ohio, other core members found their way to the old immigrant neighborhood as young artists and students seeking cheap rent. Today, when two-bedroom apartments on the street rent for more than $2,000 a month, some longtime members are property owners and landlords themselves, and several are active in other community groups.
All share the war stories of veterans who survived battle and made it to middle age.
Jim West, a lawyer who has donated countless hours of free legal advice to the block association, now laughs about having seen the same drug dealer so often that the two used to wave to each other during chance meetings at the courthouse. "She would always say, 'Hey! I saw you down on Centre Street today,' " he said.
Marlene Palacios, an assistant principal in the Bronx, remembers moving to the block as a single mother and being repulsed every time she took her daughter to Tompkins Square Park. "It was scary just crossing from Avenue A to B," Ms. Palacios said, recalling the homeless encampments that used to dominate the park.
One of the block association's few critics, David McWater, a bar owner, cited the group's informality as evidence that it is no longer a legitimate representative of the street. In 1993, the association unsuccessfully opposed Doc Holliday's, Mr. McWater's saloon-style bar and restaurant at Ninth Street and Avenue A, as it prepared to open. The group also publicly criticized his appointment last year to Community Board 3. "They're just a glorified little clique," Mr. McWater said.
Another neighborhood fixture had a more benign view of the group's lower profile. "It doesn't mean that they're not there anymore," said Katharine Wolpe, board president of the 122 Community Center. "It just means maybe things have gotten better."

The Bad Old Days Of Drugs and Crime
There is general agreement that drug dealing has largely disappeared from the block, though no one seems able to pinpoint what finally nailed it.
"It was there for 15 years or more," Ms. Wilkins said, "and then one day, like a miracle, it was gone."
In its earliest years, the block association conducted "street sweeps" to pick up trash, plant trees and generally make its presence known, all to no apparent avail. It staged anticrime rallies and strung huge banners from street to street, including one across First Avenue that said, "Mayor Koch, Close Down the Drug Drive-Inns!" 
Many residents set aside their political beliefs and risked their own safety by providing the police with information about the drug dealers at their door. Ms. Zaborowski recalls that some residents received training and special identification numbers to use when they called the police so that their information would automatically be given special credence. Barbara Ingram, the recently retired director of the Children's Liberation Daycare Center, remembers when police surveillance cameras were installed on the roof of the building that houses the day care center and how teachers were trained to check for discarded needles when they took children out to play.
Then, in 1988, the block association initiated a lawsuit against the ringleaders at two crack locations within an apartment building at 406 East Ninth Street. Forty residents as well as two day care centers, a bakery and a palm reader participated. 
"Taking drug dealers to court was a scary, scary thing for us," Ms. Wilkins said, noting that neighbors regularly found guns in their hallways and bullets in their backyards. "But on the day we had to show up in court, at least one person from all 22 apartments in the building were there."
The case, which led to the evictions of the dealers and substantial legal costs for the landlord, was one of the first in the city to use the Bawdy House Law, a once-obscure state statute enacted in the 1800's to fight prostitution. By enabling neighbors within 200 feet of a bawdy house to start eviction proceedings and by holding property owners responsible, the law has become a major tool against drug dealing.
"What was going on was that landlords were making huge profits because they rented space to drug dealers at very substantial premiums," said Douglas Kellner, a prominent tenants' rights lawyer who filed the early Bawdy House lawsuits and represented the Ninth Street A-1 Block Association in its case. "What these prosecutions did was make it expensive for the landlords, because they had to pay the legal fees for the block association and they'd lose the rent income after the place was shut down. 
"The fact that the neighborhood was willing to organize around the issue, I believe, was critical in shutting down the drug dealing on Ninth Street," Mr. Kellner said. "But it also had a big impact on the commitment of the D.A. to institute the big drug sweeps on the Lower East Side."
Even after that milestone, the problem persisted for another decade. 
On Ninth Street, a series of investigations culminated as recently as January 2000 with a grand jury indictment of 26 accused members of a drug gang, Top Notch Crew. The gang not only sold small amounts of heroin to users on the street, the police and prosecutors say, but also used the corner of Ninth Street and First Avenue as a distribution point for dealers. A spokeswoman for the Manhattan District Attorney's office, Barbara Thompson, said all the indicted gang members remain in custody while their cases are pending and some could face prison sentences of 25 years to life.
As for the role of the Ninth Street A-1 Block Association, Connie Cucchiara, the Manhattan district attorney's director of community affairs, said: "Many balls were rolling at the same time. But the credit they deserve is unique and special. They took over ownership of the block. They're very active people."

The Paradox of Success: Higher Rents and Gentrification
The current concern over liquor licenses and backyard cafes may seem mild, even petty, compared with the worries of the past, although newly outraged residents have taken to calling the neighborhood an "alcoholic theme park" and "inebriation central." But the change also reflects the paradox of the association's success.
I Coppi and a string of quirky boutiques have replaced seedy markets, wild bars and vacant storefronts. Luxury housing is going up a block away, and a psychotherapy office occupies the ground floor of what was once a notorious crack den. But growing commerce also erodes their quality of life, residents say, while soaring property values and the ever-present threat of lost leases jeopardize their very claim on the street.
Business owners are also at risk. After 15 years of hummus and hospitality at Habib's Place, his Middle Eastern cafe, Habib Belkadi is looking for a new space. When his lease expired last summer, Mr. Belkadi said, his monthly rent jumped from $2,000 to $3,000, even though his restaurant is so small that it can accommodate only 10 patrons at a time and the priciest item is lamb couscous at $8.95.
"I'm going to find a different place, take a little vacation, come back fresh," Mr. Belkadi told Ms. Wilkins recently over fragrant cups of steaming mint tea.
"That makes me sad, Habib," she said.
Later, Ms. Wilkins noted that an adjacent thrift shop had closed. "I'm wondering what's happening down there," she mused.
Her answer came a week later in a calendar of meetings from Community Board 3. Among 51 requests for liquor licenses in the area was a notice that a new restaurant, Mexico Magico, wanted to serve beer and wine at 438 East Ninth Street, the current site of Habib's Place.
Ms. Wilkins has alerted her building captains, who in turn have called their neighbors. As many as 20 Ninth Street residents plan to attend a meeting tomorrow night before the community board committee that screens liquor license applications.
Even before word of Mexico Magico's plans had spread, and the Ninth Street association had found its latest cause, City Councilwoman Margarita Lopez warned that block associations must stay vigilant.
"If they dismantle, they're making a big mistake," she said, "because the economy never stays the same way, resources never stay the same. It goes up and it does down. And right now we're looking at a city that looks pretty good. But we don't know what tomorrow holds."

Why Dealers Are Putting a New Shine on Used Cars

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD 

 BODY:
EACH day, more than 70,000 motorists on Interstate 57 drive past Cub Shaver Mitsubishi in Matteson, Ill., just outside Chicago, getting a full view of the long rows of gleaming new Galants, Diamantes and Monteros. It is a dream location for the dealership, which moved there a month ago from a nearby suburb. But standing amid his showroom's fleet of new vehicles, Anthony Kernagis, the general manager, says he would be just as happy if those potential customers took home a used car.
 He says profits on used vehicles, whose prices the dealership sets, are often higher than those on new vehicles, which carry the manufacturer's list price. Cub Shaver now sells 25 used vehicles a month, versus 50 new ones; Mr. Kernagis would like the ratio to reach 80 used to 60 new. Although he is not abandoning the new-car business, he says a big supply of used vehicles helps capture passing motorists' attention -- and also helps him sell new Mitsubishis. 
 This is certainly good news for bargain-hunting consumers. Mr. Kernagis represents a recent shift in thinking among auto dealers, echoing a new mind-set at the automakers themselves. The industry once paid little attention to used vehicles, preferring to focus its resources on the hottest and most up-to-date new ones. 
But in a slowing economy, the industry now sees increased opportunity in "pre-owned" cars and trucks, whose sales nationwide outstrip new autos by more than two to one. Last year, when a record 17 million new cars and trucks were sold in the United States, more than 41 million used vehicles also changed hands. Two-thirds were sold independently by the owners, with dealers handling the rest.
A growing number of showroom transactions involve what the industry calls certified used vehicles -- part of a marketing strategy introduced in the mid-1990's. Led by Lexus, Mercedes-Benz and Saturn, such autos have proved popular with buyers nationwide. Certified vehicles are those that have undergone thorough inspections by dealers, and are sold with extended warranties.
Statistics on the total number of vehicles sold through the programs are not available, because dealers are required only to state a vehicle's year when it is registered. But this month, Toyota announced that it had sold its 500,000th certified used vehicle since its program began in 1996. The buyer, James Allen, 58, a retired schoolteacher from Winthrop, Me., took home a 1998 Toyota Camry. Mr. Allen said he had looked at several brands before selecting the Camry, which he picked in large part because of the certification. (Mr. Allen paid $14,995 for the car, but Toyota later sent him a check for the purchase price to commemorate the milestone.)
The certified programs have given "some legitimacy to the used-car market," said Vincent Goulette, general sales manager at Emerson Toyota in Auburn, Me., where Mr. Allen bought his car. Six months ago, his sales were 60 percent new vehicles to 40 percent used; now the ratio is 50-50.
Other dealerships are seeing used-vehicle business climb, too. At Howard Cooper Honda in Ann Arbor, Mich., the used-car business now accounts for 25 percent of total sales, up from 10 percent three years ago, when the dealership began selling certified used vehicles. "We love it," said George Davis, the general manager. "It allows us to put a better car on the front line."
Honda, in fact, is running a national advertising campaign promoting its dealers' supply of certified used vehicles.
BUYING a used car in the past often meant kicking the tires, raising the hood and crossing your fingers as you drove off the dealership lot. Under the certification plans, dealers take low-mileage used autos, generally no more than five years old, and give them a multiple-point inspection, from under the hood to inside the glove box. The vehicles' warranties often run as long as 10 years or 100,000 miles -- sometimes longer than for new autos -- and cover exterior sheet metal as well as the engine and transmission. Free roadside assistance is often thrown in, too. And the dealers complete all the tedious paperwork -- like registration, title and license tags -- that can be time consuming for private buyers and sellers.
George Borst, the chief executive of Toyota Financial Services, said the certification programs offered advantages for auto companies, dealers and customers alike. "It's very strategic," Mr. Borst said.
Like the finance arms of other automakers, Toyota Financial Services picks up business by offering used-vehicle loans often at the same interest rates available on new-vehicle financing. Banks and credit unions, by contrast, typically charge more for used-vehicle loans.
Dealers make money two ways: first, from the profit they earn on each vehicle, whose price they set, and then from the cut they receive from a financing company if a consumer takes out a loan. 
Consumers, meanwhile, get some peace of mind. They also pay much less than they would for a brand-new auto. For example, a certified 1999 Toyota Camry LE sedan with a V-6 engine generally sells for about $17,000, according to Edmunds.com, a consumer-focused Web site that provides prices on a wide range of new and used vehicles. A new 2001 Camry, similarly equipped, goes for $20,300.
"If you look at the numbers, you're just going to be better off" buying one of these used vehicles, said Robert Kurilko, Edmunds.com's executive director for brand management.
Mr. Borst of Toyota says used vehicles allow buyers on budgets to buy bigger or more luxurious vehicles than they can afford new. "Not everyone comes to the market as a 23-year-old looking for an Echo," Toyota's smallest and cheapest car, he said. 
Dealers' favorite used vehicles these days are those that are coming back from leases, since their annual mileage is often restricted and consumers must return the vehicles in clean condition. Last year, 3.43 million vehicles were returned to dealers upon the completion of leases lasting two to five years, the biggest supply ever, according to CNW, a consumer research firm in Bandon, Ore., that tracks buying trends. This year, the supply is expected to be just under that, at 3.32 million.
The supply of these gently used vehicles, however, is expected to fall over the next few years. Automakers have been backing off on their previously generous lease deals, burned financially when the vehicles' resale values did not meet the companies' projections, in part because there were so many of those autos on the market. Collectively, financial institutions, including finance companies owned by the automakers, face $11.1 billion in lease losses this year, according to a CNW estimate. That means certified vehicles may well climb in price in coming years. 
FOR now, however, their prices remain attractive, as do those on used vehicles in general. Last year, the average used vehicle sold for just over $9,000, compared with $22,000 for the average new car or truck, according to CNW.
The Internet is likely to help hold down prices. As companies and dealers have waded deeper into the used-vehicle business, so, too, have online shopping sites like Edmunds.com, Carpoint.com and Autobytel.com. Just as they can do for new cars and trucks, Web surfers can enter the color, body style, options and approximate price they would like to pay for used vehicles, along with their ZIP codes, and find dealers in their areas with vehicles that match their criteria.
Such sites are helping consumers understand the vagaries of the used-vehicle market. Unlike the prices for new vehicles, which remain more or less steady through the year, except when incentives are offered, used-vehicle prices fluctuate greatly, rising during the summer, when demand is highest, and falling in the winter. 
Supplies also vary by region: Florida is the best source for recent rental vehicles, while the Detroit area has a large supply of lightly driven company cars. Prices vary even among states within a region. 
Because of such variables, consumers need to do extensive research before buying, weighing their need for convenience against their desire for the best deal. But given the plentiful supply and the various ways to buy, Mr. Kurilko said, "I think this is going to be a great year for used cars."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
Employers Dodge a Bullet That Their Workers Can't

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
EXCRUCIATING. That's the best way for many Americans to describe this tax season. Enduring the most pain are many midlevel employees who exercised stock options in 2000. 
 On most options, workers must pay ordinary income tax on the difference between the price they paid for the options and the price of the stock on the day they exercised the options. At the same time, their company takes a tax deduction equal to this amount, known as the spread. In recent years, this has significantly reduced or even eliminated tax bills at immensely profitable companies like Microsoft and Cisco Systems. 
 While stocks were roaring higher, individuals viewed these tax bills as a relatively low price for potential wealth. As stocks have plunged, many employees have found themselves in the ninth circle of tax hell. Those who kept their shares instead of selling when they exercised are paying huge taxes on stock gains they never realized and that have turned into losses. Many have been forced to file for bankruptcy. 
Adding to these tax woes is the alternative minimum tax, a cancer placed in the code in 1986 to ensure that wealthy people and profitable corporations did not use deductions to evade taxes. Because the tax has not been changed in 15 years -- it does not take into account tax credits put in effect in recent years -- it hits more Americans all the time, even those with modest incomes. Many who exercised incentive stock options are now unable to pay their alternative minimum taxes.
But even as middle-income Americans are impaled on the tax, the likelihood that a company will incur the tax has been greatly reduced. A little-noticed ruling from the Internal Revenue Service on Jan. 18 ensures that many companies will escape what could have been the reach of the tax. 
The ruling, notable for its two-sentence length, seemed to come out of nowhere. It stated that companies with employees who exercised stock options would not be liable for alternative minimum tax related to the tax deductions the companies received on those option exercises. It said a company's earnings and profits -- which are its taxable income for alternative minimum tax purposes -- were diminished by the deduction, reducing vulnerability to the tax.
Such rulings are issued for a reason. Asked about this one, an I.R.S. spokeswoman said it was issued "for clarification." Clarification is usually needed only when there are alternative points of view on an issue. So what were the different opinions and who held them? The I.R.S. would not say, but the Treasury Department said the difference of opinion originated at the I.R.S. 
One tax expert in the private sector said that a case could be made that the alternative minimum tax ought to kick in as a result of option exercises. After all, the company's earnings were not actually reduced because option grants represent no economic outlay. 
The recent ruling essentially precludes any agent from making that argument. And it makes options even more appealing to companies than they were. That is not good news for shareholders.
Corporations had already been incurring alternative minimum tax bills much less often than individuals. Robert Willens, a tax analyst at Lehman Brothers, said that the tax was generally limited to companies in capital intensive industries that reduce their tax bills by taking heavy depreciation expenses. 
Today, companies are cutting or erasing their tax bills by deducting the spread on their employees' stock option exercises. Happily, for them anyway, the alternative minimum tax will not undo these tax breaks.
Memo to Congress: For the Treasury Department to reduce the vulnerability of corporations to the alternative minimum tax while individuals continue to be eviscerated by it does not pass the smell test. Why not just rid all Americans of this cancer?

HEADLINE: In Municipal Bonds, A Searchfor Diversity 

BYLINE:  By GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
JUST when investors thought municipal bonds were a haven in a chaotic stock market, Pacific Gas and Electric filed for bankruptcy -- a sign of the escalating energy crisis in California.
 Investors worried that the state's credit could be impaired by huge energy-related costs at a time when its bonds might also be vulnerable to a general economic downturn. 
 But while these fears helped depress the prices of California municipal bonds, several experts said last week that the overall market was still quite healthy. "Right now is a good time to buy municipal bonds because of the declining interest rate environment," said Robert E. Veasey Jr., president of the Rhode Island chapter of the Financial Planning Association. "Considering income and total return, it is not too late." 
But Mr. Veasey is a stickler for diversification -- and for paying careful attention to the health of the underlying borrower.
For example, he said, he would not buy Providence, R.I., issues unless insured because a dwindling tax base over two decades had resulted in its securities being downgraded. He advised investing through bond funds -- and only high-quality ones.
Investors must also consider the tradeoff between the length of time to maturity and the yield. Long-term bonds typically pay more than short-term ones, because there is more time for untoward events, like default or inflation, to occur. 
Long-term bond funds, according to the Lipper Group, returned 10.41 percent in the 12 months ended March 31 as investors were rewarded for longer commitments. The average for intermediate funds was 9.03 percent. "We are recommending intermediate-term municipals," said Scott Kahan, president of the Financial Asset Management Corporation, a financial planning group. "The yields may be lower than the long-term bonds, but you will have less volatility. We figure that for every 1 percent change in interest rates, a long-term bond fluctuates 10 percent in the opposite direction."
Worriers can ease their fears by buying insured bonds, to guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest, noted Christopher Ryon, head of the municipal bond unit at the Vanguard Group.
About half of municipal issues carry insurance. "This is definitely something for the timid of heart," Mr. Veasey said. Among his current picks is the Smith Barney Insured Municipal Bond fund. 
Some investment advisers also say it helps to diversify by buying bonds in different states, although a bigger tax advantage typically goes to people who buy bonds issued by their own state or city.
But taxes are only one factor in the decision. Investors who live in low-tax areas may be better off spreading their risk. "A lot of people buy bonds in the state they are in," said Deena Katz, a partner at Evensky, Brown & Katz, a financial planning company in Coral Gables, Fla. "Theproblem is that you are concentrating in one area. If you are not regionally diversifed, there is more risk." 
For investors who are putting less than, say, $50,000 into municipals, Ms. Katz says a bond fund, which gives investors better diversification at a reasonable cost, is the best idea. Others set the threshold higher for individual bonds, at perhaps $100,000.
But funds are no guarantee against losing money -- in 1994 and 1999, for example, interest rates rose sharply, driving down bond prices; Mr. Veasey noted that the Oppenheimer California Municipal bond fund lost 8.54 percent of its value in 1994, partly reflecting a declaration of bankruptcy by Orange County, which lost $1.7 billion on wrong bets on the direction of interest rates.
INDIVIDUAL bonds allow investors to retain control over decision-making instead of delegating it to a portfolio manager. Investors who suddenly need cash, for example, can choose which bond to sell for maximum tax advantage -- probably the one with the highest cost. Or, if they could use a loss to offset gains from the sale of stocks, they might sell one that had lost value.
One of the most popular ways to evaluate bonds is to compare their returns with those of Treasury securities. Sheila Amorosa, co-director of the municipal bond department at Franklin Templeton Investments, which runs $47 billion in municipal bond funds, said that "if municipal bonds are yielding more than Treasuries on an after-tax basis, it is a good time to buy them."
An investor can now buy five-year municipal bonds that are yielding 3.85 percent, compared with five-year Treasuries yielding 4.77 percent. For an investor in the 28 percent tax bracket, that means an after-tax yield of 3.43 percent, making the tax-free munis more attractive.
Mr. Ryon said a reason for bonds' appeal is abnormally high yields, reflecting how much municipals lost favor during the bull market in stocks. And huge supplies have kept returns up, even as the fixed-income group has regained favor.

About-Face: Investors Find Reasons to Buy

BYLINE:  By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN 

 BODY:
The bulls came out of hiding last week, despite continued signs of an economic slowdown.
 Two key measures of economic activity -- retail sales and consumer confidence -- fell, while new jobless claims rose. 
Two widely followed companies, Yahoo and Motorola, reported first-quarter results that fell short of expectations.
 But investors, apparently deciding that things cannot get much worse, chose to focus on the good news. A report that producer prices fell last month showed that inflation remains in check. And Amazon.com said it had its smallest loss ever in the first quarter, suggesting to some investors that dot-com retailers' prospects may be improving. 
 Technology stocks led the way up. The Nasdaq finished a holiday-shortened week at 1,961.43, up 241.07 points, or 14 percent. The broader market also did well, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ending at 1,183.50, up 55.07 points, or 4.9 percent. The Dow Jones industrials climbed to 10,126.94, up 335.85 points, or 3.4 percent. With so much money going into stocks, bonds took a beating. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond ended the week at 5.16 percent, up from 4.89 percent the previous week. DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

HEADLINE: Urge to Splurge Is Taking a Back Seat to Window Shopping 

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo., April 14 

 BODY:
Single, 41, childless and the owner of a business consulting firm, Kurtis M. Ruf says he feels immune to recessions. But a year of a tumbling stock market has persuaded Mr. Ruf to make do with the two 33-foot, $100,000 speedboats that he keeps on the Lake of the Ozarks. The market, he said, "decreases the chances that I'll be as aggressive with my spending." He added, "I won't buy any more boats." 
 Ingrid Heisel, 24, with whom Mr. Ruf was having a salad at Country Club Plaza, Kansas City's leading upscale shopping area, is not so secure. Ms. Heisel is a well-paid office administrator for Cisco Systems, a company that fell prey to the stock market's bears and is preparing to lay off 5,000 workers, including, perhaps, her. "I don't go shopping as much," she said. "You don't have to have things from Restoration Hardware." 
 Economists say it is too soon to say whether the economy is slipping into a full-blown recession or merely taking a dip after an extraordinary boom. In this big mid-American city and its sprawling Kansas suburbs to the south, unemployment, though rising, is below 4 percent.
But signs are flashing of a flagging economy. Krigel's, a 91-year-old local jewelry chain with 20 stores in shopping centers in thriving suburbs well beyond Country Club Plaza, fell into bankruptcy in January in the face of dismal winter sales and could liquidate this month. 
To figure out where the nation is heading, economists pay closest attention to consumers because they account for two-thirds of all buying and selling. Mostly, they watch the rich and the rich aspirations of the not-so-rich. The current economy's two signifiers -- the stock market and layoffs -- are telling these consumers they can do without another speedboat and a $38 watering can from Restoration Hardware. 
"We feel it most in our six-figure sales," said Harold Tivol, the chairman of Tivol Jewels, which caters to the city's well-to-do with brands like Cartier and Rolex.
Nancy Lombardino, general manager of the elegant Mark Shale clothing store at Country Club Plaza, said: "We're definitely off to a slower start. I don't see as many out-of-towners." She was talking about affluent visitors from Iowa, Nebraska and Oklahoma for whom Kansas City is the place to splurge. 
Joanne Warren, 50, is going ahead with her plan to move back home to Kansas City from Nashville and open a franchise store for Hubcaps Master International of Nashville. But in her personal spending, she said: "I feel like we're on hold because of the stock market. I feel that that money is tied up and can't be touched." 
Ms. Warren wanted to buy a new, $40,000 Land Rover but settled on a used one for $25,000. "We're going to be buying less of a house than we would otherwise," she said. 
She said that she would stick with her hobby of buying and restoring houses, "but I'll buy houses in the lower-income range."
At Salon Sophia on Country Club Plaza, Ron Aramoon, the owner, said he was booked solid for three weeks with women who pay $120 for a haircut and tinting, a high price for the Midwest. He said women seemed oblivious to the downturn in the economy, but not men.
Linda Curp, who styles male executives there for $25, said: "They're having to work harder. I call them when I haven't seen them for a month, and they can't talk to me. It's pulling teeth to get them to come in."
At Aristocrat Motors, people smitten with luxury cars can indulge the full spectrum of their passions. It is the only dealership around here that carries Mercedes-Benzes, Porsches, Land Rovers and Jaguars. Daniel J. Shearman, the sales manager, has picked up mixed signals.
"January was a record month," Mr. Shearman said. "February was a very poor month, one of the worst. March was a record. This month started out halfway decent but slower than last April." Among customers, he said, "Confidence is still strong, but cautious." 
Mr. Shearman attributed resilient Jaguar sales to well-off women. "Women are the reason Jaguar is in business," he said. "Period. Period. Period. Man's very Porsche and very, very Mercedes-Benz." 
Many other affluent-trade businesses are clearly hurting. Thomas Kinkade, a California painter, operates a chain of galleries selling his work for $900 to $14,000. His specialty is lithographs of landscapes, waterfalls and country cottages, all so luminous they seem to glow. "He's called the 'Painter of Light,' " said Sandy Brandt, director of Mr. Kinkade's Country Club Plaza gallery. 
"I'm seeing a difference from last year, absolutely," Ms. Brandt said. Now and then, Mr. Kinkade comes to town to sign the backs of his prints. "The last time he was in Kansas City, in '98 or '99," Ms. Brandt said, "we did a phenomenal business." She added, "People were lined up." He will be coming again on May 13, she said, but no one is lining up. "This year it's been rather slow," she said.
Crystal and porcelain objects, too, are popular among consumers in Kansas City who have extra money to spend. At the Oak Park Mall in the Kansas suburb of Overland Park, Marianne Foster is the owner of Ashley Avery's Collectibles. She sells Lladro glazed statuettes for an average of $300, Hummel figurines for $150 and Swarvoski crystal figurines for $75.
"This is not a necessity," Ms. Foster said. "People are slower to buy. We're decidedly down from a year ago." 
These merchants sink or swim with consumers who have the money to buy luxury items they clearly do not need in order to survive.
Two of them, Dennis Dolenshek, 46, and Diane Teal, 48, are middle managers at AT&T in Kansas City. They were caught in the company's downsizing at the start of the 1990's. Ms. Teal accepted a transfer here from New York to save her job, and Mr. Dolenshek was moved from Wisconsin.
Single, they have money to burn, but once burned themselves, they are cautious. Betting that the stock market now can only go up, Mr. Dolenshek said, "I've increased my participation in my company's 401K plan."
Ms. Teal said that last month she tucked away her credit cards. "I operate only in a cash mode," she said. Faced with the temptation to spend, she said: "The question now is not so much do I want it. It's do I need it."

HEADLINE: No Time to Put Your Feet Up As Retirement Comes in Stages 

BYLINE:  By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH 

 BODY:
Tom Griffiths retired as a telephone repairman at the end of his shift at the New York Stock Exchange one Friday last fall, "just as if I was going home to put my feet up on the porch," he said. Come Monday morning, though, he was back on the trading floor, fixing the same telephone lines, this time as a part-time worker, with his pension making up for the lost income.
 "I was a little leery" of accepting the offer to "sort of" retire, admitted Mr. Griffiths, a 52-year-old Staten Island resident. But his employer, Avaya -- a recent spinoff of Lucent Technologies -- offered cash bonuses to encourage older workers to exchange their job security and full-time compensation for a novel blend of work and retirement. 
 "I had a lot of bills," Mr. Griffiths said. "That was the driving force for me to take it." His incentives included $10,000, two years' salary and the chance to win future bonuses. 
Time was, when Americans retired, they retired in earnest, to the golf course, to Florida, to consultancies, to volunteer work -- to just about anything except their old jobs. Besides, tax laws generally prohibit companies from distributing pensions to working employees.
But a number of large companies, including Avaya, Monsanto, PepsiCo and Lockheed Martin, are now finding ways to work around the legal obstacles and offer phased retirement.
Phased retirement can take many forms. At universities, it is used to clear out elderly tenured professors. But in the private sector, it is being promoted as a way to keep valued older workers in a tight labor market. Workers in their 50's who would otherwise take advantage of early retirement provisions in their pensions are offered the chance to work reduced hours -- something surveys show many want to do -- and supplement their reduced incomes by tapping those pensions.
Employers and some retirees praise the arrangements, and business groups have been lobbying Congress to clarify their use by amending the respective laws. A phased-retirement bill died in the last Congress, but it is expected to be reintroduced soon.
Others view the push for phased retirement with concern, however, worrying that if the pension laws are relaxed, employees might be induced to tap retirement benefits in middle age and end up with less to live on late in life. 
"I'm very suspicious that some companies are reducing the overall pension benefit that they would have to pay out," said Allen C. Engerman, co-founder of the National Center for Retirement Benefits, a Chicago law firm that offers assistance to retirees who suspect they are being shortchanged.
These concerns arise because phased retirement is being aimed at employees in their 50's, the age when workers in traditional pension plans begin to accrue their greatest benefits. Advocates for older workers fear that some companies will devise phased retirement plans that tempt 50-ish workers to cash out pensions as lump sums, at the moment they would gain the most by retaining their plans' conventional provisions.
G.T.E. offered such a deal last year as it prepared to merge with Bell Atlantic to form Verizon Communications. Its reduced pension liabilities flowed through to the bottom line as a $487 million pretax gain in the first quarter.
Other analysts wonder whether phased retirement is not just a new way of turning America's veteran employees into contingent workers, allowing corporations to subsidize their compensation costs by drawing down surplus pension assets.
"These are highly skilled, functional people, and they're being converted into part-time workers," said David C. Howard, a St. Louis lawyer who has represented former Monsanto workers in age-discrimination suits. "There's a whole across-the-board range of benefits that they're being excluded from. They're not getting merit-pay increases, advancements, promotions."
At Avaya, Michael A. Dennis, a vice president who negotiated his company's program, argued that phased retirement is a tool for preserving good jobs with benefits. 
As a corporate descendant of the old Bell monopoly, Avaya was heavy with tenured union employees accustomed to lifetime job security, Mr. Dennis said.
By persuading about 1,500 older technicians to try phased retirement, he said, Avaya has pegged its labor costs to market cycles, while protecting the jobs of about 3,500 technicians who keep full-time hours, job security and union benefits. 
For the phased retirees, Avaya pays only wages and mileage, he said. The cost of their retirement benefits was charged to Lucent during the spinoff.
The company's unions accepted the plan, Mr. Dennis said, on the thinking that a strong Avaya would be more likely to prosper and, eventually, add more union jobs. A number of Avaya's corporate clients have been in touch to find out how they, too, could create such programs, he said.
Employees in their mid-50's tend to present big liabilities -- pension accruals, wages buoyed by seniority, rising health care costs. For those reasons, it was popular in the 1980's and 1990's to urge costly 55-year-olds to the door. Even after paying them cash incentives to retire, companies could replace them at lower cost with younger workers.
Now, though, after a decade of economic expansion, many companies find it hard to find skilled employees. Compensation consultants say retaining older employees is becoming more attractive, particularly as America's 76 million baby boomers age. The oldest boomers are turning 55 this year, an age at which most big companies with traditional pensions offer early retirement.
Worse, it has become apparent that when early retirees leave, they often take new jobs at other companies. And then they no longer look so expensive; many will work for wages only, because they already have health insurance and pensions.
Avaya's Mr. Dennis said this was on his mind as he drafted the company's phased-retirement plan. "We didn't want these folks retiring and going around and working for other companies that would be competing against us," he said. The breakthrough, he said, was finding a legal way of giving the older workers their pensions and keeping them in-house.
Other companies are offering similar arrangements on a smaller scale, said Anna Rappaport, who surveyed 232 private and public-sector employers for the William M. Mercer consulting firm. She found that 36 percent were hiring back retirees as consultants and independent contractors without benefits, and 37 percent were hiring them back for part-time and temporary assignments.
But the legal obstacles to such programs are formidable, said Judith Mazo, research director at the Segal Company and a member of the Labor Department's working group on phased retirement. She cited the rules against distributing pensions to workers under the normal retirement age and rules that require companies to distribute pensions equitably. Some companies fear that if they offer packages only to their most desirable early retirees, they will violate the law, she said, possibly jeopardizing their pension plans.
"What you're seeing now are ad hoc arrangements," said Eric Lofgren, global director of the benefits consulting group at Watson Wyatt. "What is really needed is a legislative fix."
Lynn Puckett, former manager of the Red River Valley Rural Electric Association, knows all this firsthand. Seasoned managers and linemen are not exactly thick on the ground in the sparsely populated Oklahoma ranchland where his company provides electricity. Mr. Puckett qualified for full retirement when he turned 52, but Red River instead let him take his pension and spend the next eight years as a phased retiree, recruiting and training a successor.
During that time, Red River allowed Mr. Puckett to accrue a second pension, a rare and costly feature that Mr. Puckett called "a great benefit to me and my family." He said he doubted many big companies would be willing to offer such a plan.
Indeed, Monsanto, which began its phased retirement program after work force reductions in the early 1990's, makes sure that its 600 phased retirees work no more than 999 hours a year, a limit that keeps them from becoming eligible for new pension benefits.
Kenneth A. Raskin, an executive compensation and benefits lawyer at the firm of White & Case in New York, expressed surprise that any company was openly limiting workers' hours to keep them from becoming eligible for pensions. He said discharging employees just before they become eligible for benefits might violate federal law, depending on the circumstances.
Wilma K. Schopp, who oversees Monsanto's compensation and benefits, said that the program was created to retain the best older workers, not to reduce benefit obligations.
"It provides a flexible work force for Monsanto, and it provides work for the retirees if they want it, according to their own schedules," she said. "I wouldn't think this would be the route a company would take if it were just trying to get people to work without benefits."

China Issues Warning On Arms Sales to Taiwan
China is warning the United States that a sale of advanced weapons to Taiwan would endanger already strained relations. Beijing hopes that the imbroglio over the spy plane collision will make Washington more receptive to its concerns. 1

China angrily described as "irresponsible" the statements by senior American officials that a Chinese fighter jet caused the collision. Members of the crew gave their first public account of the collision at a news conference at Hickam Air Force Base in Honolulu. 10

Cheap Labor at a High Price
Bangladesh has experienced a significant economic boost from offering the global economy some of the world's cheapest labor, but also the horrors that arise from some of the worst sweatshops ever to taunt the human conscience. 1

Kremlin Gains NTV Control
Workers at Russia's independent NTV television network ended 11 days of resistance and ceded control to the state-dominated monopoly Gazprom. What that will mean for press freedom is still under debate. 4

Real I.R.A. Leader Arrested
Ireland has arrested Michael McKevitt, who is alleged to be the leader of the Real I.R.A., the splinter group that blew up the market center of Omagh three years ago. 7

Turkey Push to Revive Economy
Turkey's economy minister unveiled a package of austerity measures aimed at winning $10 billion to $12 billion in new foreign loans. 14

Kosovo Peacekeeper Killed
British peacekeepers on patrol near a Kosovo village bordering Macedonia struck an anti-tank mine, killing one soldier and injuring two others, a NATO spokesman said. (AP)

Navy Panel Urges No Trial For Submarine's Skipper
The three admirals on the Navy's court of inquiry into the collision between an American submarine and a Japanese vessel near Honolulu have unanimously recommended that the submarine's skipper not be tried by a court martial, senior Pentagon officials said. 1

Grief and Fury at Ohio Funeral
A mixed mood suffused the funeral of 19-year-old Timothy Thomas, fatally shot April 7 by a white police officer pursuing him with a sheaf of misdemeanor traffic warrants. 16

Bush Lowers California Status
President Bush appears to have relegated California -- where former Vice President Al Gore won decisively in 2000 -- to political purgatory, reflecting his advisers' judgment that he cannot win there in 2004. The approach troubles some Republicans in the state, who say it is too risky to eliminate California from the party's national base. 20

Little Remedy for Prison Rape
Rape is accepted as a fact of prison life, but the subject has received little serious attention and legal remedies are rare. Few prison rapists are prosecuted, and most prisons provide little counseling or medical attention for rape victims, or help in preventing such attacks. 1

Firms Phase In Retirement
Large companies are finding ways to work around legal obstacles and offer "phased retirement," in which older employees can work reduced hours and tap into their pensions. 1

Mauling Case in Spotlight
The case of a woman mauled to death by dogs her neighbors were caring for has become a public spectacle in San Francisco. 16

NEW YORK/REGION 25-30

Sunday News Vacuum Helps the Not-So-Magnetic
In go-go New York City, where the celebrities never seem to sleep, Sundays offer a vacuum for aspiring and not-so-magnetic politicians to grab a headline or a sound bite or two. 25

Training New Principals
To help cope with a nationwide shortage of school administrators, a nonprofit group will offer a program to train teachers and leaders from the private sector with previous teaching experience to work in public schools in New York and Chicago. Twenty fellows will be selected for the first year of the program, which begins in July. 26

 Re "Bankruptcy Filing of California Utility Tests the Limits of the Court" (Business Day, April 9): 
 Inside California, there is outrage about the energy crisis. Outside California, the reaction ranges from "it serves them right" to glee. Those who believe that the energy crisis is a California problem should consider this: California represents the sixth-largest economy in the world. 
If you think that the United States economy can recover without California, think again. But don't take my word for it; call your stockbroker, or the company that holds your retirement fund.

 President Bush is making plans for expanding fossil fuel prospecting and has used the California utilities mess as justification. 
Yet California's troubles are purely financial, brought about by the deregulation of wholesale power pricing and the selling of generating stations to private owners (Business Day, April 9). 
 There is no energy crisis in California, only a financial crisis caused by privatization. A solution is for the electric infrastructure to be publicly owned, just as roads and bridges are.

REVIEW OF DELAWARE DREDGING

BYLINE:  By John Sullivan 

 BODY:
 The federal General Accounting Office has agreed to accelerate a review of a $311 million dredging project in the Delaware River planned to deepen the 106-mile shipping channel for the Port of Philadelphia. 
While port officials say they need the deepening to maintain a competitive port, opponents have said the work is a waste of money and could be environmentally damaging. The G.A.O., the investigative arm of Congress, had said it would look into the economic benefits and environmental impact of the project, but originally assigned the investigation a low priority. It agreed to explore the matter sooner when Senator Jon S. Corzine added his name to the lawmakers requesting the study. John Sullivan

HEADLINE: WEDDINGS: VOWS; 
Alisha Tlumacki and John Head

BYLINE:  By KATHRYN SHATTUCK 

 BODY:
FOR Alisha Jean Tlumacki, the dark, smoky films and love songs of prewar Europe have always held a special attraction. She's fond of the emotion they convey, and of their heartfelt tales of love gone wrong, and right. 
 But in April 1999, as a pummeling rain turned Manhattan's Lower East Side into a veritable lagoon, love was the last thing Ms. Tlumacki had in mind. She had a plan with a capital P. And according to family and friends, when Ms. Tlumacki, 26, has something in mind, she goes after it with a sort of mythological force. 
 "She will make these casual pronouncements," said Broc McMakin, an old friend. "Something like, 'I think I'll go to Europe.' And two days later you call her and she's boarding a plane with her backpack."
Ms. Tlumacki is also known to her friends as "a marvelous vegetarian cook" and an amateur playwright who has gained a kind of infamy for passionately arguing about politics into the wee hours. 
On that April night, as she waded along Avenue D with an out-of-town friend, on their way to a James Bond theme party, Ms. Tlumacki was planning on sunnier days at Claremont Graduate University in California, where in August she would begin studying for a master's degree in modern European history. Until then, she was killing time.
But then, Ms. Tlumacki, who had dressed for the party in a loud orange shirt and clunky platform boots, spotted John Eric Head wearing Beatnik glasses and smoking a clove cigarette.
"She had been describing John, or as close as you can get to John, for more than a decade," said Mr. McMakin. "She knew it was him almost from the moment she saw John."
Friends and family describe Mr. Head, 35, as a spirited individualist who finds solace in family bonds and childhood friends, who studied classical voice in Nashville, before attending the University of St. Andrew's in Scotland, where he majored in philosophy and religion.
And so Ms. Tlumacki and Mr. Head, an editor at the Conference Board, an economics and management research firm, did what came naturally: they talked. They discussed her feminist politics, his interest in 20th-century art and their mutual admiration of Hillary Clinton. As night became morning, they also discovered common ground: they both owned the same Edith Piaf CD.
Within days, they were inseparable. And as the weeks wore on, they explored their shared passion for French and German cabaret music of the 1930's and 40's -- the world-weary voices of Dietrich, Piaf and Lotte Lenya. The songs' tales of yearning and loss grew ever more poignant as summer waned and Ms. Tlumacki prepared to leave for California.
Once at Claremont, it took all of six weeks for Ms. Tlumacki to decide to reverse course. By early October 1999 she had repacked her belongings, faxed her resume to the International Rescue Committee, a refugee relief organization, and journeyed back to New York, where, she said, "I got my perfect man and my perfect job in the same week." (She is a public education specialist at the I.R.C.)
On April 7, the couple were married at Leon on East 12th Street, a vaulted-ceiling bistro with the atmosphere of a wine cellar. As 20 family members and longtime friends sat shoulder-to-shoulder in a single row against the back wall, it was revealed that Ms. Tlumacki and Mr. Head would adopt a new surname created from letters of their own: Lumea, a name that evokes the Latin word for light. 
As they walked arm in arm down a makeshift aisle, the bride in a boned ecru gown and carrying a bundle of calla lilies, Gina Leishman put on her best Piaf voice and accompanied herself on the accordion as she sang:
Give your heart and soul to me
And life will always be
La vie en rose.

HEADLINE: China and the United States 

 BODY:
As George W. Bush has discovered early in his presidency, relations with China can be exquisitely intricate and challenging. The two nations are nascent military rivals with incompatible political systems. They are also trading partners that can imagine an era of expanding and mutually beneficial economic cooperation in the decades ahead. 
 Before the next series of important decisions about China tumble onto Mr. Bush's desk, he and his aides should settle on a long-term strategy that protects American interests while encouraging China to play a constructive role as it assumes its natural place as a great power. Mr. Bush outlined a reasonable approach after the release of the American crew members when he said the United States and China "have different values, yet common interests" and that both nations "must make a determined choice to have productive relations." 
 The United States and China need not become enemies, though historical and political forces could push them in that direction. The governing principles of American democracy and Chinese Communism guarantee a degree of friction. The demise of the Soviet Union has removed a powerful strategic incentive for Washington and Beijing to work together in some areas as a means of isolating Moscow -- the motivation for the triangular diplomacy introduced by Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger three decades ago. 
Geography and national pride are also driving the two nations apart, as China looks to assert its influence in the Far East, a region where American military and political power has been predominant since World War II. China is acutely sensitive about real or even perceived infringements of its sovereignty, not a surprising instinct for a nation that long suffered abuse at the hands of foreign powers. As the spy plane incident demonstrated, the Chinese military is especially wary of the United States. 
But there are powerful unifying forces that can overcome these factors, none greater than mutual economic interests. This is not just a matter of the growing trade between the two countries, though America is the biggest market for Chinese exports with over $80 billion in annual sales and China, with its 1.3 billion people, could someday be a large market for American goods. 
What makes trade so critical is its role in modernizing China. Many Chinese, for now, seem willing to accept Communist rule on the condition that it provide a steady improvement in living standards. That improvement has been fueled in part by foreign investment and revenues from exports, with the United States being a chief source of both. Though economic reform has brought dislocation and the migration of millions of people into already overcrowded cities, two potential sources of instability, it has lifted hundreds of millions of Chinese out of poverty and turned their country into a consumer society. Beijing can ill afford a rupture in relations with Washington and can benefit greatly from expanded commercial cooperation.
For the moment, Washington holds the advantage in the overall relationship. The American economy far exceeds China's in size and relative prosperity, and American military firepower and technology are unmatched. The appeal of democracy is rising around the world while the attraction of Communism is contracting. International tolerance for the suppression of human rights is diminishing. But America will make a fateful mistake if it tries to overpower or isolate China. 
President Bush and his aides seemed to understand that in their handling of the spy plane incident, a troubling affair that Mr. Bush correctly said had not helped relations. The administration's measured response showed respect for Chinese sensitivities and the conflicting internal pressures that President Jiang Zemin had to weigh in deciding when to free the 24 American crew members. Though Chinese rhetoric was often belligerent, Beijing ultimately yielded without the apology for the collision that it had demanded. In the end, Mr. Jiang acted as a statesman, not an ideological combatant.
A new generation of leaders will assume power in China next year. But short of the installation of an aggressively anti-American regime intent on confronting the United States, which seems unlikely, American policy should seek to build a stable, productive relationship with China that does not paper over the serious differences that will continue to divide the countries.
Bill Clinton, in his eagerness to develop a "strategic partnership" with China, too readily overlooked China's suppression of democracy. That error should not be repeated. The price of increased trade with China must not be American silence about China's brutal treatment of its own citizens and intolerance for dissent.
Nor does a stable relationship require Washington to subordinate its strategic interests in the Far East and Western Pacific by reducing the presence of American military forces or curtailing intelligence-gathering operations. The American role has brought a measure of security to the region that has benefited many countries, including China. 
But the assertion of these American interests need not threaten China's sovereignty, and can leave ample room for cooperation in other areas and a healthy respect for China's independence. Even the volatile issue of Taiwan can be managed in a constructive way if Washington and China do not see each other as antagonists. Taiwan's young democracy and robust economy deserve American support, including a reasonable level of military assistance. But Washington must be mindful of maintaining the political and military equilibrium that has sustained the uneasy peace between Taiwan and the mainland. If China would drop its threats to use force to absorb Taiwan, and instead rely on the long-term political dialogue that some Chinese leaders outlined recently, the issue might cease to be a potential flashpoint between China and the United States.
In its complexity and overlapping political, economic and military aspects, the relationship with Beijing is unlike almost any other the United States faces. Mr. Bush has a chance to make it work in the interest of both nations. His management of the spy plane affair suggests he and his foreign policy team have the right instincts to achieve that difficult but vital goal.

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: Crash Course; 
A New President Bumps Up Against Asia

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
FOR a man who has occupied the White House for just 12 weeks, George W. Bush has already had more than his share of bad luck in Asia.
 So far there has been a mid-air collision with China, a maritime collision with Japan and a diplomatic collision with the two Koreas. "The only thing we've missed is a nuclear confrontation between India and Pakistan," one of Mr. Bush's senior foreign policy advisers said dryly, watching on television as the 24 crew members of an American spy plane returned to Hawaii. "But we've still got plenty of time." 
 The China collision was an accident waiting to happen. A Navy submarine's sinking of a Japanese fishing boat was a freak occurrence. And the bitter arguments over whether to isolate North Korea or engage it China style reflected a deep split among Mr. Bush's advisers. 
All three incidents have exposed some serious gaps in the Bush administration's thinking about Asia. They posed questions of how to balance engagement and containment, how to defend American interests without trouncing Asian sensibilities and how to protect American trade without compromising security. The crisis broke out before the new administration had time to draw a road map for the region -- never an easy task in territory that mixes rich and poor, chip plants and water buffalo, ancient enmities and an absence of security alliances. And the president's own chairman-of-the-board style has left leaders in the region uncertain how much of what they are seeing is his own policy, or indeed which of his advisers has his ear. 
The three collisions were reminders of a few realities of life in the Oval Office. One is that how a president responds to the unforeseen is often more important than how he plots policy. Another is that real life is much more complicated than those easy campaign-trail bromides. (Mr. Bush often denounced his predecessor last year because he "went to China and ignored our friends in Tokyo and Seoul.") The third is that of all the world's cauldrons of brewing trouble, none is bigger than Asia and few can boil over faster. 
Mr. Bush basked in considerable praise last week for his handling of the spy plane crisis, from both Republicans and Democrats. 
In fact, the happy outcome obscured many interesting questions. Did the stalemate drag on because Mr. Bush followed his initial, sound-tough instincts before fully consulting some China experts (who are hard to find in this administration) about what words an increasingly nationalistic China needed to hear? Was it wisdom or weakness when someone -- it's unclear who -- stopped the Navy from sending the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk steaming up the Chinese coast? Now, as Washington's relief gives way to analysis, the big question is: How should Mr. Bush and his team handle China and its neighbors from now on? 
Almost any step Mr. Bush takes will affect another part of the Asian balance. A tough line with China could weaken America's alliance with Japan, which is deeply ambivalent about appearing to team up against a country it once occupied. It would almost certainly end the behind-the-scenes cooperation between Washington and Beijing in talking sense to North Korea. Mr. Bush understands that China and Russia are putting aside their differences and talking about ways to undermine America's global power -- talk he does not want to feed.
But appeasement is also not a palatable option. "The Chinese have been testing Bush, looking for his limits," said Ashton B. Carter, a Harvard professor and co-author of a 1999 study that examined whether China's real goal was to expand its economic and military influence in the Pacific the way Japan did in the 1930's. 
In fact, the engagement crowd -- which includes many of the Bush campaign's biggest contributors -- is already arguing that the lesson of the past few weeks is that China is a country of 1.2 billion raw nerves, and that doing something like selling Taiwan the most sophisticated destroyers with Aegis radars will only inflame tensions.
The containment crowd, well represented in the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill, says the lesson is that China is a hostile power that, more than ever, needs to be faced down. 
"George Bush has been given a crash course in Chinese nationalism and sensitivities," said David Shambaugh, a China scholar at George Washington University. "For the first time he's encountered the hostility of the People's Liberation Army for the United States. He's gotten a brief taste of what it's like to deal with a divided Chinese leadership. The question is what lesson has he drawn from this?" 
So far Mr. Bush isn't saying -- he has been protected from questions. But any president's early foreign policy traumas color what comes next. 
In the one highly visible clash in the Bush administration thus far -- over how to handle North Korea -- Mr. Bush sided with the hawks. The issue was whether to continue the Clinton administration's bargaining to defang North Korea's missile capability in return for economic incentives. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell thought it was worth a try; he lost out to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and his deputy, Paul Wolfowitz, who advocated a complete review of options -- including trying to push the North over an economic cliff. 
This argument took place while South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung, was here, and Mr. Kim, architect of the openings to the North, went home angry and humiliated. The peace process with the North has since been frozen. Whether that's what the Bush White House intended, or what it stumbled into, is still a mystery. Either way, it strained the alliances Mr. Bush came to office saying he would reinvigorate.
BUT as Mr. Bush showed last week, it's one thing to take on the poverty-stricken North Koreans, another to mess with China. North Korea doesn't have much of a constituency in the United States. China and the United States define interdependence. 
Those economic links appear to have contained the reaction on both sides this month. Mr. Bush could publicly remind the Chinese how much of their own prosperity was at stake -- starting with American investments. And President Jiang Zemin could tell the Chinese military that after they finished making their point about the evils of American hegemony in the Pacific, they should release the crew and focus on China's efforts to get the 2008 Olympics.
Yet, as Christopher McNally, a China specialist at the East-West Center in Hawaii, notes, "growing economic interdependence doesn't guarantee the relationship will grow." There was plenty of interdependence in Europe before both world wars, and it didn't stop either of them.
For its part, the rest of Asia is interested chiefly in a policy that keeps commerce flowing. Japan, the Philippines and others have their own problems with an aggressive China. But their precarious economies are bound up in China's continued, rapid growth. So it should be no surprise that they balk at many of the Bush administration's priorities -- a missile shield or a more robustly defended Taiwan. To Asian ears, those ideas sound like a prescription for instability, likely to prompt China to lash out.
Moreover, they question whether the Bush administration has been a bit tone deaf. The South Koreans were shocked that their president, a Nobel Peace Prize recipient, was sent home unable to say that Mr. Bush would be a partner in peace. The Japanese are still bitter about Mr. Bush's slowness to personally apologize for the submarine accident.
For their part, Mr. Bush's aides worry that Japan, their No. 1 ally, will not recover after a decade of economic decline and political paralysis. Pentagon officials complained that Japan's first reaction to the spy plane incident was to complain that it highlighted the fact that America uses its base on Okinawa to spy on China.
Over time, Mr. Bush will undoubtedly get an Asian policy, and over time he is likely to end up engaging China. But he may have to get there on his own -- forced to make some hard choices about China without many China experts around the Oval Office, without much help from his allies. 
"We could be in for some very rough months," Mr. Shambaugh said.
Asked about China in an interview in January, Mr. Bush said: "I would like to see some predictability when it comes to people with whom we are dealing." The lesson of the last two weeks is that he isn't likely to get much of that. The Chinese probably feel the same way about him.

HEADLINE: Reporter's Notebook; 
Achy Joints and All, Aging Loan Sharks Still Talk Tough

BYLINE:  By ALAN FEUER 

 BODY:
Like many septuagenarians, John Faraci and Anthony Geraci kept working well into their golden years. But their jobs were a little different from those of most men their age: they were loan sharks for the Bonanno crime family.
 On Thursday, Mr. Faraci, 78, and Mr. Geraci, 76, appeared in Federal District Court in Brooklyn to plead guilty to charges of extorting nearly $15,000 in loan payments from a Brooklyn restaurateur, with interest rates of 3 percent to 5 percent a week. After the restaurateur told the government last year that the men had threatened him, federal agents placed an eavesdropping device in his establishment and caught Mr. Geraci on tape saying colorful things like: "You need a beating. I'm tired of saving you." 
 Prosecutors have described the white-haired Mr. Faraci as "a large-scale loan shark with numerous loan-shark victims." At his sentencing, he stood in court in a cardigan sweater and told Judge Reena Raggi that although he had drunk six Scotches the night before, his mind was clear enough to enter a guilty plea.
It is common practice for judges to ask defendants whether they are receiving medical care, and might be mentally or physically incapacitated, before pleading guilty to federal crimes. When Mr. Faraci was asked the question, he told Judge Raggi, "Well, I visited a cardiologist." 
When it was Mr. Geraci's turn, he offered a laundry list of ailments that included problems with sleeping at night, bad nerves, a failed kidney, muscle pain and arthritis. "It didn't get any better," he told the judge, referring to his medical condition. "In fact, it got worse."
A man named Rudy Casale was also charged in the loan-sharking scheme, but he did not plead guilty on Thursday. Instead, Mr. Casale, 74, came to court in a snappy striped wool sports coat and asked the judge to dismiss the charges against him because of his failing health.
Mr. Casale is "in very poor physical condition and there is a strong probability that he could not survive a trial," his lawyer, Frank J. Hancock, wrote in court papers. "He has had quadruple open-heart surgery and at least 10 ulcer operations to repair stomach hernias. In fact, he will be required to have another."
As Mr. Hancock's motion put it, "It is doubtful that any jury would believe that an old, sick man like Casale would be used as an enforcer." 
Nonetheless, federal prosecutors say they have a tape of Mr. Casale describing to the restaurateur exactly how he treats people who fail to pay their debts on time.
"I got a nice baseball bat in my trunk, bust your legs up," he said, according to court papers.

Friends, Strangely
They say politics makes for strange bedfellows, but the intrigues of Washington have nothing on a good Brooklyn mob trial when it comes to forging bizarre relationships.
Take the case of Andrew Weissmann and Salvatore Gravano. Mr. Weissmann is a federal prosecutor in Brooklyn who once specialized in taking on the mob. Mr. Gravano is the gangland hitman-turned-informant better known as Sammy the Bull.
On and off, for nearly a decade, Mr. Weissmann and Mr. Gravano have worked together to prosecute a list of high-ranking New York mobsters that includes Vincent Gigante, the former boss of the Genovese family, and Victor J. Orena, the Colombo family's onetime acting boss.
Their relationship, however, was recently called into question by Mr. Gravano's lawyer, who wants to bar Mr. Weissmann from working on a new drug case against Mr. Gravano because, she says, the two men know each other all too well.
"Mr. Gravano viewed Mr. Weissmann as his attorney, protector and friend," the lawyer, Lynne F. Stewart, wrote in papers filed in Federal District Court in Brooklyn on April 5. "Mr. Gravano is entitled to the security of knowing that the secrets he shared with his attorney, Andrew Weissmann, will remain confidential." 
While it takes a skewed sort of logic to characterize a federal prosecutor who handled a high-profile Mafia turncoat as the man's "attorney," it is clear that Mr. Weissmann and Mr. Gravano have worked together closely since the early 1990's. 
As Ms. Stewart notes in her court filing, it was Mr. Weissmann who helped prepare Mr. Gravano to testify at several mob trials after his stellar turn on the witness stand led to the conviction of John J. Gotti, the jailed Gambino boss, in 1992.
And, the filing goes on, "As they worked together over the years, a relationship of deep trust and confidence developed" between them "so much so that Mr. Weissmann was chosen to fly to Arizona in 1997 to convince Mr. Gravano to testify voluntarily" at Mr. Gigante's trial. 
Mr. Weissmann is the chief of the criminal division in the United States attorney's office in Brooklyn, though he is not one of the two courtroom prosecutors directly assigned to Mr. Gravano's upcoming trial. He did not respond to phone messages left for him seeking comment on the effort to remove him from the case.
Mr. Gravano is accused of masterminding a multimillion-dollar drug ring that bought thousands of Ecstasy tablets in Brooklyn and sold them in suburban Arizona in 1999 and 2000. He is scheduled to go on trial in June. In his lawyer's motion to kick Mr. Weissmann off his case, Mr. Gravano comes off as strangely melancholy, as if by barring Mr. Weissmann from working on his trial he would lose a dear old friend.
"As a natural consequence of their relationship," the motion reads at one point, "Mr. Gravano shared many confidences with Mr. Weissmann, reasonably believing that they would remain confidential. In turn, Mr. Weissmann provided Mr. Gravano with advice and counsel throughout the years of their relationship."

Clandestine Serenade
Aside from trying to keep Mr. Weissmann off the case, Ms. Stewart is also trying to exclude many of the 40,000 phone calls that the authorities taped while conducting a wiretap investigation of Mr. Gravano.
While some conversations have been introduced by the government -- in one Mr. Gravano is heard telling a rival drug dealer: "I own Arizona; it's locked down" -- Ms. Stewart has argued that many of them have nothing to do with the life of crime.
She wrote in court papers, for example, that the authorities taped several innocuous conversations between Mr. Gravano and his ex-wife, Deborah. They also listened to Mr. Gravano reminiscing about the old days with his longtime friends in Brooklyn, she said.
They went so far as to capture at least one private moment Mr. Gravano was sharing with his pet. "They even listened to Mr. Gravano (on the bug) singing to his little dog, Duke," Ms. Stewart wrote.

HEADLINE: A Short History of American Indifference 

BYLINE:  By Josef Joffe; Josef Joffe is editor of Die Zeit, the German weekly.

DATELINE: HAMBURG, Germany 

 BODY:
Here is a classic dispatch from Europe: "Not even 100 days into his first term, the new American president has riled the Russians and alienated the allies with a series of high-handed forays in the areas of . . ." Which president? George W.? Bill Clinton? Ronald Reagan? Jimmy Carter?
 The correct answer is, of course, all of the above, and for good measure, all the other freshmen installed in the White House since the birth of the Atlantic Alliance 50 years ago. George W.'s repeated run-ins with America's friends and rivals is deja vu all over again (to borrow from Yogi Berra) for two classic reasons. 
 First, with the notable exception of Bush pere, any new occupant of the Oval Office starts out as a neophyte in foreign policy; it is strictly learning by doing and ruing. Second, the United States is the bull elephant of world politics. Whichever way he saunters, he will trample the grass. Naturally, the rest of the world wants a well-behaved beast, a paragon of New Age sensitivity and great-power responsibility. 
True to precedent, Bush the Younger has not (yet) delivered. "Europeans expected the smack of firm leadership from the new administration," notes The Economist, "but so far, it seems all smack and little leadership." In his first 100 days, George W. has acted as if he were Jimmy Carter reborn on the right.
An outlandish comparison? Within three months after assuming office in 1977, Mr. Carter had enraged friends and foes alike -- the Europeans with his antinuclear fervor, the Soviets with his human rights offensive. His was the "politics of goodness," but it was prosecuted with the same kind of obliviousness that has marked the early weeks of Mr. Bush.
In diplo-speak, the indictment then, as today, was "unilateralism," a polysyllabic shorthand for: "Hey, Mr. President, what about our interests and your obligations?" Except that the Bush administration is not into goodness, but -- if you pardon the expression -- into an "America uber alles" policy.
The antimissile shield? Damn the verbal torpedoes from Berlin and Paris -- full speed ahead! The Kyoto Protocol on the reduction of "greenhouse gases"? Sorry, friends, our own economy comes first, and we simply cannot afford to mend our profligate ways. The Balkans? Our troops may stay in or pull out, but the decision is up to us. Shepherding the two Koreas, which was as dear to Bill Clinton's heart as his intrusion into the Middle East peace process? We don't have a dog in that fight.
It is indifference added to injury that riles the European soul -- just like Jimmy Carter's famous habit of listening to classical background music when talking to European dignitaries on the phone. "I could have read the Bonn phone book to him," fumed Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of Germany, "and he would not have noticed."
Then as now, the new administration has sinned against the first commandment of diplomacy: Line up your ducks first. Take the recent row over the Kyoto accord on cutting the world's carbon dioxide output. There are good arguments the administration could have leveled against the accord: that its short-term goals are rigidly unrealistic; that it should give credit for carbon dioxide "sinks" like forests; that the European Union, too, cannot possibly meet the target. But the word from Washington was curt and dismissive: Kyoto was "effectively dead." In Diplomacy 101, that performance would get Mr. Bush an F.
But great powers can't afford to flunk out. In the end, every postwar American president, no matter how eager to please his domestic constituencies, has run up against the Vast Abroad. Indeed, every one of W.'s elected predecessors since Dwight Eisenhower has, in the end, been defined by foreign policy: John Kennedy by the Cuban missile crisis, Lyndon Johnson by Vietnam, Richard Nixon by detente, Mr. Carter by Iran, Mr. Reagan by the last chapter of the cold war, Mr. Bush Senior by the Persian Gulf war, Mr. Clinton by the Balkans and the Middle East.
All had to improve their grades by way of pain and penalty. So how is W. doing? Thirteen weeks into his first semester, his learning curve has gone up, up, up. He mastered the Chinese challenge over Hainan with aplomb -- just the right mix of firmness and creativity.
And let's not forget about the Great Banana War that has been raging between the United States and Europe for the last eight years. Patience and skillful diplomacy have finally paid off. The European Union is going to lower its protectionist walls; Chiquita, Dole et al. will be back in business; and Europeans will enjoy cheaper smoothies.
The point is not bananas, but getting your way without losing your friends. Even Mr. Big needs them. How else will he pacify the Balkans, discipline Saddam Hussein or keep China in check? Ask Jimmy Carter, W.'s hapless doppelganger from Georgia, whose allies, in the end, listened only to the classical Muzak dropping out of the Oval Office.

HEADLINE: The Nation; 
Going for Broke On the Budget

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
WHEN the political cognoscenti scrutinize a budget like the one President Bush sent Congress last week, they skip quickly over the myriad tables and specific proposals. They couldn't care less, for instance, about the $731 million to fight drug trafficking in South America or the $112 million to prevent accidents on airport runways, which may never become law. 
 "Budgets aren't about numbers," said John R. Kasich, a former Republican congressman from Ohio, who left Congress in January after six years as chairman of the House Budget Committee. "For presidents, budgets are about their game plan. It's a way to define themselves." 
 The way Mr. Bush has defined himself in this budget, to no one's real surprise, is as an ideological conservative. He called for deep tax cuts that would mostly benefit the wealthy and that would consume so much of the government's resources that most departments and agencies would have to go on a strict diet.
And his game plan, in Mr. Kasich's words, is to go for broke this year, to try to get his full $1.6 trillion, 10-year tax cut now, while his party controls both houses of Congress and while he is still in his honeymoon period with the public. No matter that two-thirds of the tax cuts would occur after 2006, and the budget says almost nothing about how spending would be reduced in those years.
"This is his best shot, this year," said Mickey Edwards, a former Republican congressman from Oklahoma who now teaches at Harvard. "Who knows how long they will control the Senate? He's got this window of opportunity to win in both houses, and he doesn't know if that's going to continue."
Another Bush ally, Damon Ansell, vice president for policy at Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative lobby, made a similar point. "Obviously," he said, "the honeymoon period allows you to do things you can't do after the fault lines appear."
A delicate point that everyone in political circles talks about is that the Republican majority in the Senate may not even last out the year. Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina is 98 and clearly failing. If he dies or becomes incapacitated, the Democratic governor of South Carolina, Jim Hodges, would doubtless name a Democrat to replace him. The 50-50 Senate with Vice President Dick Cheney breaking the tie would become 51-49 Democratic. Mr. Bush's goal is to sign a tax bill by summer.
"He's a president in a hurry who has to deal with the tenuous situation in the Senate," said Gene Sperling, a top economic and political adviser in the Clinton White House. "Their time in control of the government could be short, and virtually everything is designed around this one vast, hard push to get all their tax cut immediately."
Beyond the tax cuts, everything else is a sideshow, even those issues on which the president seemed to risk offending important interest groups and lawmakers whose help he will need. 
He would, for instance, restrict a range of corporate subsidies like Export-Import Bank financing. He proposed reducing loans for shipbuilders, a pet program of Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader. He would reduce payments to farmers, even though he carried the Midwestern farm states and the Senate's most important voice on tax policy is Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Finance Committee and himself a farmer. He proposed new fees for broadcast licenses, standing up to the powerful National Association of Broadcasters and Representative Billy Tauzin of Louisiana, chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee.
Democrats maintain that such unpleasant details explain why the president waited to submit the specifics of his budget until the House and Senate had approved budget plans and left town for a two-week recess. That may be, but the administration knows these measures probably won't make it through Congress and doesn't really care as long as the tax cuts survive. 
A top administration official said, for example, that everyone knows the government will spend more in farm aid than was budgeted for 2002, the next fiscal year. But if the money had been put in the 2002 budget, it would have had to be counted for subsequent years also. Projected surpluses for those years would have been smaller, and that would have damaged the case for tax cuts.
Mr. Bush's insistence on reducing taxes is anything but conservative fiscally -- conservative in the sense of being cautious. The Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office warned that their forecasts of $5.6 trillion in surpluses over the next decade were highly unreliable, but the president has nonetheless used them to justify his policy.
"No one who is prudent would ever do anything based on a 10-year forecast," said Stanley E. Collender, a managing director for budget consulting at the Fleischman-Hillard public relations firm.
THE last time large tax cuts were enacted was in 1981, Ronald Reagan's first year in the White House. The offsetting spending reductions he promised never materialized. And the consequence was 15 years of budget deficits.
But Mr. Bush's allies are willing to take the chance -- particularly those devoted to the supply-side principle that lower rates in the top tax brackets will generate new investment and strengthen the economy.
"This is a bit of a risky budget," said Stephen Moore, a budget specialist at the Cato Institute who is also president of the Club for Growth, a conservative political action committee. "It's a leap of faith. There's a big policy gamble. But I'm willing to bet with him. The stars are in line, and you grab for the gusto when you can."

HEADLINE: The Nation: The 'D' Word; 
Suddenly, Deficits Regain Their Luster

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
DEFICITS are respectable again. Until a few weeks ago, they were bad. Nearly everyone said so. But all of a sudden they have been resurrected as a lifeline that may be needed to avoid a recession. 
 The new thinking reverses a Clinton-era mantra. Budget surpluses appeared on President Clinton's watch, and he gave them credit for the booming economy. Surpluses stimulate growth, his economists insisted, ignoring long-established economic theory, which says just the opposite -- that when the government pays out more than it brings in, the economy gets an injection of wealth. 
 Restoring respectability to deficits comes in handy for Republicans. The Bush administration has been arguing that its tax-cut proposal, big as it is, would preserve much of the surplus. Now the president can argue that his tax cut will rescue a sinking economy even if the surplus gives way to a deficit.
Lawrence B. Lindsey, President Bush's chief economic adviser, is already edging in this direction. "I think the president has a very standard economic prescription, one that has 70 years of economic science on its side, that the government should act in a countercyclical way," Mr. Lindsey said.
"Countercyclical way" is the D word in other clothes. That is as close as politicians have gotten, so far, to praising deficits. But their allies in the economics profession are beginning to make the case for them -- preaching the curative powers of a shrinking budget surplus, even one that crosses the line into deficit. 
Listen, for example, to John H. Makin, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group in Washington that is very supportive of the Bush administration. "Wake up, folks," Mr. Makin said, "If we are going to have a weak economy, we are going to have to think about deficit spending."
More cautiously, Robert M. Solow, a Democrat, offers the same observation. He is a Nobel laureate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was an adviser to President Kennedy in the 1960's, when tax cuts came into their heyday as a fiscal stimulus -- the idea being that people would spend the windfall, helping to revive a failing economy. 
"In a recession, the budget surplus diminishes automatically, and this is not a bad thing," Mr. Solow said. "If you can do it quickly, you might even want short-run tax reduction to beef up aggregate spending, even if that means a dip into deficit."
There's that dreaded word again. Deficit spending is an old concept, formulated by John Maynard Keynes and favored until the 1980's as a standard tool for regulating the economy. 
The theory is straightforward. Surpluses hold back the economy. They represent money that people would have spent if the money had not been taken from them in taxes and then put on the shelf by the government. Deficits, on the other hand, are expansionary. The government spends tax money on all sorts of services and projects -- and then borrows more and spends that, too, to keep the economy humming. Or else the money is returned to taxpayers through tax cuts, and they spend it. 
These days, when so many politicians rail against big government, a tax cut, rather than public spending, has become the favored form of fiscal stimulus.
With deficits re-emerging as acceptable policy, a tax cut seems more likely than ever as a means to revive the economy. What is still unresolved is the timing of the cut, its size and who gets it. Mr. Solow, for example, has signed a petition calling for a "sizable" one-time rebate that would go out this summer in tens of millions of checks mailed to taxpayers.
The Bush administration's tax cut would be much larger, and permanent, which would promote consumer spending, Republicans argue. But critics say the Bush proposal would fail as stimulus because the tax cut would be spread over too many years and would put too much money into the hands of the wealthy, who are considered the least likely to spend it. 
Whatever the pros and cons, some in the old Clinton camp still keep the faith. Lawrence H. Summers, who was President Clinton's last treasury secretary, insists that budget surpluses work. "The old idea that deficits are stimulative was good economics in the 1930's and probably in the 1960's," he said, but not in today's world, where "interest rates are largely determined by the long-term bond market." The bond market, he argues, responds favorably to surpluses by lowering interest rates, which in turn encourages people to borrow and spend.
Other economists from the Clinton administration have a more complex view of the 1990's. Alan S. Blinder of Princeton and Janet L. Yellen at the University of California at Berkeley tell a more complicated story in a forthcoming research paper financed by the Russell Sage Foundation and the Century Foundation. The budget surplus was indeed expansionary in the mid-1990's, they write, but only because of special, fortuitous circumstances.
In their reading, interest rates fell when the bond market became convinced that the nation's chronic deficits would finally give way to surpluses resulting from the tax increases and expenditure-cutting of Mr. Clinton and his predecessor, George Bush. Throw into this mix the Federal Reserve's help in holding down interest rates, the wealth-creation from a rising stock market and the public's manic borrowing and spending. Deficit spending, in effect, shifted to the private sector. Put all this together, and a special, expansionary moment was born. A sow's ear turned into a silk purse.
"It was a literally once-in-a-lifetime event," Mr. Solow said, "But I really cannot see this as a new general theory of fiscal policy." Or, as Mr. Blinder put it: "To get a 'contractionary' fiscal policy to be expansionary, the stars have to be in alignment." 
For Mr. Makin, a modest deficit -- say $200 billion a year -- is insignificant in a nearly $10 trillion economy and can be carried indefinitely. Through most of its history, in fact, the government's budget has been in deficit. But Mr. Solow, Mr. Blinder and Ms. Yellen argue that over the long run, a surplus is necessary to pay for baby boomers' retirement, among other looming needs. 
So Keynesian theory has reasserted itself: deficits are O.K. in the short run in a downturn. The economists are convinced. The politicians probably are, too. And the public? Well, deficits never sat well with the public, and after years of being told that surpluses are wonderful, a rewrite of that message may not fly.
"We have never had an intelligent political debate over deficits and surpluses, going back to Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930's," said David C. Colander, an economics historian at Middlebury College. "Roosevelt opposed deficits totally, even as he was running them up."

HEADLINE: Bush's Energy Nonsense 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I am relieved to hear that the Bush administration considers our country's energy crisis over. Why else would it propose to slash the budget for energy efficiency programs (front page, April 10)? 
 The administration, dominated by oilmen and special interests, has once again led us down the road toward unnecessary fossil fuel exploration. Energy efficiency programs save consumers money, are good for the environment and help the economy. By reducing demand, they eliminate the need to drill in environmentally sensitive areas like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. And thousands of new jobs are created every year in the field. 
 Instead of bowing to industry pressure, the administration should be making energy efficiency our top energy policy priority.

HEADLINE: Attack of the Disruptive Disc; 
Sales of DVD's Are Challenging The Business Of Renting Movies

BYLINE:  By GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
Imagine going to your local cineplex and having to pay different prices for the tickets, depending on which studio produced the movie you want to see: $22.46 for Paramount's "Rugrats in Paris" $20.24 for Universal's "Erin Brockovich" and $18.89 for Warner Brothers' "Miss Congeniality." 
 The box office does not work that way, of course, because the theater owners set the ticket prices, not the studios. And for years, the home-video market has worked much the same as the theater business, with Blockbuster and other video store owners largely determining the rental fees for the movies on their shelves. 
 Now, though, as the DVD is quickly gaining on the venerable VHS videocassette as the videophile's format of choice, the studios are taking advantage of the technology shift to rethink the business model -- movie rentals -- that has dominated the home-video market for two decades. The DVD business is shaping up as a seller's, not a renter's, market. 
So far, in the four years DVD's have been on the market, sales have outpaced rentals by more than four to one in dollar terms. And pricing is far from uniform. (The movie prices cited earlier are actual retail DVD prices for "Rugrats," "Erin Brockovitch" and "Miss Congeniality.")
"The studios have different views of the market, so they are setting different suggested retail prices, and the stores are discounting those prices to different degrees," said Tom Adams, whose Adams Media Research tracks the home-video industry. 
In part, the studios are responding to a stagnating VHS rental market, in which revenue actually declined by 5 percent last year, to $16.9 million. But a strategic schism is also developing -- with the rift most apparent between Warner Home Video, which is owned by AOL Time Warner, and Blockbuster, which like Paramount Pictures is owned by Viacom. 
As a major cable company, AOL Time Warner plans to eventually offer video-on-demand movie service, giving consumers all the benefits of renting a movie, without having to visit a Blockbuster or other video store. The first weapon in this battle is the DVD. 
In the case of the DVD -- short for digital videodisc -- Blockbuster and the studios do not share rental revenue, as has been the practice with VHS tapes. Instead, the studios simply sell the DVD's outright to video stores -- for about $16 each on average -- and the video stores can then rent them or sell them. 
At the same time, in an even bigger shift of video economics, many of the studios are selling their DVD's to retailers like Wal-Mart and Target for about the same price they charge rental chains like Blockbuster. The DVD shift portends the film industry's becoming much less financially vested in the movie rental business, and growing less dependent on chains likes Blockbuster.
"Blockbuster is an endangered species," said Warren Lieberfarb, president of Warner Home Video.
Blockbuster, of course, is not ready to concede. 
Mr. Lieberfarb is "out to lunch," in the view of Blockbuster's chairman, John Antioco. "DVD sales will never replace rentals," Mr. Antioco said. "If Warner lowers the price, that will be the best news I have heard in a long time. We can lower our price somewhat to the renter and our margins would improve."
Over the last year, in fact, Blockbuster has done just fine, gaining market share at the expense of rival video store chains like Hollywood Video and Video UpDate. And like the mass-market retailers, Blockbuster has benefited from the sales surge in DVD's.
Analysts estimate that cash flow at Blockbuster in 2001 will rise 15 percent, to $600 million, and Mr. Antioco has no argument with the sanguine projections. "Our transactions are up, and we are going to keep growing," Mr. Antioco said. 
He also points out that DVD rental transactions are growing faster than DVD unit sales. That is true, although while rental spending for DVD's rose nearly 600 percent last year, to $747 million, the business remained far smaller than DVD sales, at $3.4 billion. 
Whether renting them or selling them, distributing movies on disc and tape is likely to continue to be a big part of the film studios' business. The home-video market represents an average of 40 percent of the revenue for a major movie release. And in years when a film studio does poorly at the box office, receipts from the continuing video sales and rentals of older films can help cushion a revenue decline. But it is clear that with this new generation of video technology, the studios are devising distinct strategies. 
Some of the differences can be seen in the prices. A recent release like Warner's "The Green Mile" DVD has a suggested retail price of $24.99, for example, while Dreamworks' "American Beauty" disc has a suggested price of $26.99. Meanwhile, Paramount has listed "Double Jeopardy," which underperformed both those films at the box office, at $29.99. Paramount, as Blockbuster's corporate sibling, is much less intent on disrupting the current rental paradigm. (Retailers often sell the discs below the suggested price.)
It was in February 1997 that the first DVD players went on the market. And since then, some 15 million American households have purchased the machines. That is still far behind the estimated 95 million, or 94 percent, of households with at least one VCR. But DVD players are quickly gaining ground, and by 2006 nearly two-thirds of households will have them, according to forecasts by Adams Media Research. 
Mr. Liberfarb, of Warner Home Video, predicted that as more people buy DVD players, disc prices will continue to fall, further enticing consumers to buy rather than rent. 
"We are trying to drive this to be a mass distributed, high-volume impulse purchase, like a trade softback or paperback book," Mr. Lieberfarb said. "Ultimately, DVD's will be distributed as ubiquitously as paperback books."
Sony's studios -- Columbia Pictures and Tri-Star Pictures -- have a pricing policy similar to Warner's. "Where Warner and Columbia share a point of view is that it is a mass-market product and for that to be, whether you are in blue jeans or khakis, you have to price within a range to make it a no brainer to buy," said Ben Feingold, president of the Columbia Tri-Star Motion Picture Group. 
And yet Blockbuster's sibling, Paramount, is not the only film company that declines to follow Warner's low-price policy. 
"I don't think it's good for the market to underprice," said Bob Chapek, president of Buena Vista Home Entertainment, the video distribution arm of the Walt Disney Company. Even at the current growth rate, he said, the DVD player is still a device of enthusiasts and early adopters. Like several other industry executives, Mr. Chapek said he believed that most of today's DVD customers were willing to pay higher prices for DVD's to enjoy their superior picture and sound quality.
Craig Kornblau, president of Universal Studios Home Video, said that studios that offer lower prices "are dumping their catalogs at ridiculous prices." While he acknowledged that prices would eventually fall, as DVD players become commonplace, he asked, "Why take it there now?"
And Patricia Wyatt, president of Fox Consumer Products, which distributes home videos for the News Corporation's 20th Century Fox, predicted that there would always be a role for movie rentals, because they give consumers a low-priced way to see a film without the commitment of making a purchase. 
But all the studios would benefit in the longer term if more renters become buyers. According to Adams Media Research, consumers spent $10.3 billion last year to rent videocassettes and DVD's. Of that total, the studios kept only about 26 percent, or $2.7 billion. But of the $10.8 billion that consumers paid to buy tapes and discs, the studios pocketed a full 75 percent -- or $8.2 billion.
But an industry consensus on marketing DVD's has proved far harder to come by than one for VHS videocassettes. The VHS tapes, after all, were introduced before most major film studios were part of giant media conglomerates with complex networks of entangling alliances.
Their corporate masters aside, the studios do have some common interests and a commmon gatekeeper. Blockbuster currently dominates the VHS rental business, with a 30 share of the market. And the studios have the same basic arrangement, under which Blockbuster pays an upfront fee of about $8 a cassette, then gives the studios roughly 40 percent of the rental revenue and keeps the balance.
Retail sales have always been part the videocassette business, too, providing much fatter profit margins for the studios, which keep an average of 75 percent of the price of each VHS version of a movie sold. But rentals still represent the larger part of the VHS market.
Against this legacy, one of the motives for the studios to make DVD's primarily a retail-sales business is to reduce their dependence on Blockbuster, said Mr. Adams, the research analyst. 
And among the studio owners, AOL Time Warner in particular has little motive to perpetuate the rental business. 
For one thing, in the mid-90's, well before the merger with AOL, Time Warner was involved in developing the digital video disc with Toshiba. The company holds 11 patents on the DVD format, which means that AOL Time Warner receives royalties for each disc and DVD player sold. Mr. Lieberfarb, of Warner Home Video, declined to reveal the size of the royalties, but he said that the money was not enough to dictate Warner's DVD strategy. 
Of more strategic importance may be AOL Time Warner's plan to eventually offer video on demand to cable customers around the country. With 12.7 million subscribers, AOL Time Warner is the nation's second-largest cable operator, just behind AT&T. Though still at least several years away, widespread video on demand -- offering libraries of movies that would start whenever the viewer dictated, and could be paused and rewound -- would compete directly for Blockbuster's rental market.
And yet, Mr. Lieberfarb said, video on demand would not necessarily compete with the DVD sales business. 
"Consumers will buy the ones they really want for the family," he said, "and there will still be room for a healthy video-on-demand business in films consumers only only want to see once. Discs are the stuff you really, really want or that the kids or wife want to watch. I think we will have two different businesses. A packaged media business with discs. And the video-on-demand rental business. 
"Both methods offer a more convenient and better quality experience than renting analog VHS tape," Mr. Lieberfarb said. "Blockbuster is finished." 
But Blockbuster's Mr. Antioco points out that video on demand is still in only a few hundred thousand American homes. Far more common today is pay per view, which offers films on several channels at staggered starting times. That gives viewers who pay to see the movie much more flexibility about when to watch. But pay per view is not a true alternative to a rental video -- or to future video on demand -- because once the film begins, consumers cannot stop and start it at will. 
But Blockbuster is clearly aware that rival technologies represent a threat to its rental business. It now sells dishes and receivers for DirecTV, the satellite service that offers a large number of movie channels. 
This summer DirecTV plans to rebrand its pay-per-view business to include the Blockbuster name. Mr. Adams considers this a smart strategy, because the DirecTV pact gives Blockbuster a way to extend its rental brand into the digital, interactive world. 
As for Warner Home Video and its emphasis on DVD sales, Mr. Lieberfarb says he continues to bet that "America is a nation of shoppers."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Bluefly, an online seller of discounted designer apparel, hopes to make a big splash with Vogue.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
DECADES ago, advertising for Macy's featured a slogan, "It's smart to be thrifty," that celebrated an attitude now known as cheap chic. Today, as the slowing economy leads shoppers to watch their spending more closely, an online seller of off-price apparel is teaming up with a magazine known for high style in an effort meant to encourage consumers seeking frugal fashion trophies. 
 The e-commerce company, Bluefly, (www.bluefly.com) which sells designer clothing, accessories and home furnishings at discount prices, will appear twice in the May issue of Vogue magazine, due out this week, in spaces typically reserved for upscale fashion brands. 
 There will be a 16-page catalog, printed in midnight blue and titled "Join the Shopping Revolution," inserted opposite the table of contents in selected issues sent to subscribers along with newsstand copies sold in California and New York. It's Bluefly's first such offline catalog.
Also, a complementary ad promoting a section of the Web site called Jetset@bluefly ("First class fashion. Coach class prices") will run on the back of all the May issues of Vogue.
The Vogue campaign, along with the mailing of an additional 350,000 copies of the catalog to women who are customers and potential customers of Bluefly, will account for a significant portion of the company's estimated marketing budget of $8.5 million for 2001, down 5.6 percent from the $9 million spent last year.
The Bluefly ads mark another chapter in the evolution of e-commerce as most Internet retailers struggle with financial and operational difficulties. Bluefly is moving aggressively to try to capitalize on the misfortunes of its competitors now that it has secured what it hopes is enough capital to last through the rest of the year.
Affiliates of Soros Private Equity Partners invested $40 million in Bluefly, giving them a 78 percent stake in the company, and they helped guarantee Bluefly a $10 million credit line last month.
"In this marketplace, where people are not getting a lot of money," said Alanna Richter, vice president for marketing at Bluefly in New York, "we want to maintain focus, grow our customer base and get credibility on the Street by building a strong brand."
"People say we should do TV ads; it sounds great and it would look great," she added. "But we need to be efficient, identify our target."
Until now, Bluefly has promoted itself primarily with image-building ads, created in-house, centered on illustrations by an artist, Stuart Patterson, tinted in light blue. The drawings show an attractive 30-ish woman, dressed modishly and accompanied by a hottie boyfriend. Her satisfied smile suggests she heeded the type at the bottom of the page promising "350 designers up to 75 percent off." An ad like that will run on the May Vogue's back cover.
"People know the Bluefly name and say, 'You're the blue ads,' " Ms. Richter said. "Now, we want to focus a bit less on branding and a bit more on educating customers, going from 'I know Bluefly' to 'I know what Bluefly is.' "
That's the rationale behind the catalog, which offers page after page of photographs of the kinds of designer dresses, sportswear, shoes, handbags, jewelry and home merchandise that can be found on the Web site. Vogue readers who shop on Bluefly can get 15 percent off on their orders if they enter a discount code found in the catalog; for test purposes, there will be a higher discount, 20 percent, for those who order from the mailed catalog.
The catalog "does not mention specific brand names like Prada and Gucci and Fendi, to preserve relationships with suppliers," said Tom Jarrold, Bluefly's creative director. "So how do you say 'designer fashion' without actual brand names?"
"The answer is a 'look book,' a catalog people can page through, saying we sell designer fashion at discount prices, but created to be sophisticated, like nothing you'd see from a discount retailer," he added. "That's why it's an elegant, deep blue, which was difficult to print to get the blue just right."
Bluefly advertises in magazines like Harper's Bazaar, InStyle, Vanity Fair and W in addition to Vogue, where it has bought space since 1998. Bluefly is believed to be the first off-price retailer, online or off, to be accepted by Vogue as an advertiser.
"Since its inception, Bluefly has been a consistent advertiser," said Richard D. Beckman, vice president and publisher at Vogue in New York, part of the Conde Nast Publications division of Advance Publications.
"Despite the ails of e-commerce, let's face it, the Internet is not going anywhere," he added. "When the smoke clears, some people will be standing strong."
"Though Internet advertising has contracted enormously, market share is there to be gained," Mr. Beckman said. "Bluefly seems to be building a nice business."
"I've dealt a lot with Internet companies the last 12 months," he added. "A lot had adept strategies for how to raise venture capital, but had very little sense how they could raise consumer money." E-commerce is "a viable business," Mr. Beckman said, adding: "It was overhyped, and now it's underhyped. Somewhere in the middle lies the truth."

Several kitchen inventions try to save time and space and reduce guesswork with automation.

BYLINE:  By Sabra Chartrand 

 BODY:
THE typical American kitchen hasn't changed much in the last 50 years. A stove, an oven and a refrigerator were appliance mainstays for most of the 20th century; then the dishwasher became commonplace, followed by the microwave oven. Once each of these machines was introduced, it did not change much, except perhaps to become more economical and quieter.
 Now they are often run by computer chips, which are changing the way these universal appliances do their jobs. 
 The next time the milk is low in the refrigerator, the grocery store may deliver a new gallon before it is entirely gone. Masahiro Sone, who lives in Raleigh, N.C., has won a patent for a refrigerator with an inventory processing system that keeps track of what is inside and what is about to run out and can ring up the grocery store to order more.
Mr. Sone thinks convenience stores and the rise of Internet shopping mean people are looking for more ways to trim time from their shopping responsibilities. He hopes his invention will eliminate the need for a person to go to the store or even take the time to place an electronic grocery order.
The invention also tracks nonperishable items in cupboards. Both the refrigerator and cupboard sections have an array of sensors, an inventory processor with a display, and a telecommunications system. The sensors interpret the quantity or weight of food items.
For example, the weight of a carton of milk can be used to determine how much is left, and thus when milk should be reordered, Mr. Sone writes in his patent. Other sensors may simply detect an item's presence.
Mr. Sone says weight sensors work best with items like milk and laundry detergent, which diminish over time, and presence sensors work best with canned goods, which are removed in their entirety.
As soon as the weight or quantity falls below a particular level, the sensor transmits that information to the processor, where a list of "desired items" is compared with the list of "actual items." Anything from the desired list that is missing from the actual inventory goes on the grocery list.
The telecommunications system uses a modem to place the grocery order directly to a store or through a World Wide Web site.
The processor can also add food like eggs, butter or milk to the grocery list if the ones in the refrigerator have been there so long that they have spoiled. Users can modify their "desired list" at any time or create a list for special orders.
Mr. Sone won patent 6,204,763 for the Japanese company Jujitsu.
Hate microwave cooking directions? Two inventions are intended to make microwave ovens smart enough to figure out how to cook food so that users don't have to bother with instructions.
Ford Bowers, who lives in Zephyrhills, Fla., has won a patent for a microwave that reads bar codes printed on prepared food packages.
The bar-code reader is set inside the microwave and aimed over the center of its turntable. With a push of a button, the turntable rotates until the bar-code reader detects the symbol.
"Once the bar code is detected, the microprocessor controller loads preset cooking instructions corresponding to the particular product codes of food items and operates the microwave oven according to those instruction," Mr. Bowers writes. The microwave automatically sets the power level and timer. Mr. Bowers won patent 6,124,583.
Four inventors have been granted a patent for a microwave oven that can detect how much food is inside and cook it appropriately.
The invention means a person "does not need to determine the amount of the food by himself," or set the cooking time or microwave level.
"The food is cooked under the exact conditions set by the microwave," the inventors write in their patent. Those are determined by starting the machine and then measuring the voltage produced by the magnetron, the energy-generating element in a microwave oven. The voltage produced indicates the volume of food inside the oven, and the processor controlling the cooking conditions adjusts them accordingly.
Chul Kim, Tae-soo park, Kwang-seok Kang and Won-woo Lee won patent 6,215,112 for the Samsung Electronics Company.
A sink is not an appliance, but designers at the Maytag Corporation think it could be. They have patented a cooking system that turns a sink into a boiling basin. The patent says it has a "water inlet and a water outlet" -- otherwise known as a faucet and drain -- and "an energy source for heating water introduced into the basin." It comes with its own custom colander for holding the food while it cooks.
The inventors point out that poultry, shrimp, eggs, pasta and vegetables are often cooked in boiling water, sometimes in a microwave, but most often in a pot of water on a stove burner.
"Obviously, the use of a surface element to perform this operation makes this surface element unavailable for another cooking operation to be performed at the same time," they write in perfect patent application language.
They did not design a dedicated boiler, like a steamer or deep-frying cooker, because that would have created just one more small appliance to store. Instead, they wanted their invention to be "integrated into a kitchen counter top."
The sink is filled with water, and the heating element is switched on. Once the water boils, food in a colander is submerged. When it is cooked, "the container can simply be lifted out of the basin, with any water dripping from the food items being simply caught in the sink," the inventors say.
Sage Baker, Simon Potter, Jody Goodman, Michael Cattaui, Jeremy Howard, Luke Michas, Michael Lye, Marc Harrison and Jane Langmuir designed the "boiling sink cooking system" for Maytag in Newton, Iowa, and won patent 6,192,791.

HEADLINE: New Economy; 
A Curdled Musical Romance Gets Couples Counseling

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL 

 BODY:
There are some 70 million music-consuming Napster users, and many of them say they don't trust the recording companies. The music companies lash back, complaining that Napster users have no appreciation of their hard work. Each party accuses the other of not listening. Both feel betrayed.
 The music industry and the music-consuming public, in short, are like a dysfunctional couple. They have been torn apart by a younger, alluring, amoral suitor -- Napster -- which tempted listeners into promiscuous infidelity, swapping music files with total strangers outside the sanctity of copyright. What is more, Napster did not force listeners to commit to entire albums, but freed them to pursue the singles life. 
 Now, having sued Napster for alienation of affection, the recording industry sees the error of its old ways and wants to reconcile with consumers -- while giving them some of the new thrills they have learned with Napster. But the industry also now has serious questions on whether it could ever again trust consumers to not indiscriminately copy the music they buy and give it away free to friends and strangers. 
At this point, the recording companies and their customers do not need more lawyers. They need couples counseling. 
Presented with this situation, John Gottfried, a psychologist in Silicon Valley, said that the dynamic between music companies and their formerly loyal customers had many parallels to a rocky relationship, with the delicate trust between buyer and seller on shaky ground. He offers the same advice he would give a troubled couple: the two parties need to start listening to each other, to hear each other's needs.
"They're playing brinksmanship," Mr. Gottfried said. "There has to be some middle ground they can both live with."
The major recording companies, which even by their own admission have only slouched toward middle ground for two years, assert they took a great leap forward in the last two weeks. Three of the majors -- EMI, BMG, and AOL Time Warner -- recently announced a new venture, called MusicNet, through which they plan to license their content to Web sites that would offer it by subscription. Several days later the two other majors, Sony and Universal, announced plans to roll out their own subscription service, allowing customers to pay a flat fee to "stream" music on a listen-as-you-go basis or to download it for at least temporary storage.
Both announcements were thin on details, like when the services will make their debuts, what they will cost and what music will be available, in what form, and whether consumers can store it on their own CD's or portable music devices. Nonetheless, when the Sony deal was announced, the chief executive of the Sony Corporation of America, Howard Stringer, deemed it a watershed. "Music companies have finally heard and understood the cries of customers," he said.
But is this a real breakthrough? Are the two parties at last resolving their differences? Or does much work remain ahead to salvage a bond between seller and buyer?
To answer these questions, it may help to hear where both sides are coming from. And remember: For this part of the exercise, it is important not to judge, but simply to listen, and try to empathize.
How Napster users feel. Some Napster users say they no longer want to be tied to buying full-length albums. They want to buy singles, and not just the most popular ones sold in record stores. They want the ability to buy all music a la carte, artist by artist, track by track. 
"On some albums a lot of the songs stink," said Keith Frostad, a 34-year-old Napster user in San Francisco. (It's O.K., Keith. Just let it out.)
Other Napster users say they don't like paying for music -- period. Some just don't like paying for it in stores, in album form. Downloading music online is more practical and more fun. A recent survey by Mercer Management Consulting, found that one third of 1,800 college students would be willing to pay for an online music service. 
But many Napster users feel conflicted. The act of downloading a copyrighted song brings up some feelings of guilt, mainly about the fact that the artists do not get paid. But others also see the record companies as greedy middlemen whose interests aren't necessarily aligned with those of musicians anyway. "I just don't trust the record industry," said Barrie Gordon, 19, a George Washington University in Washington. "I don't really know what they do."
How the record labels feel. The record labels feel that their long-time customers have been stealing from them. They complain that they do much more work in finding and developing musical talent than Napster users recognize. And they resent that Napster users do not appreciate that far from being greedy, they earn only modest returns by corporate standards. 
Jay Samit, senior vice president for new media at EMI, noted that prices for albums are lower in real dollars than they were in the 1960's and 70's. And industry revenue has basically stagnated, said Michael B. Nathanson, a media analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.
Mr. Nathanson noted, for instance, that EMI's operating margins were 13 percent in the mid-1990's, but have slipped to 10 percent. And he said some other music companies had fared less well.
The industry asserts it has tried to move its business online, that its latest proposals embrace the idea of selling songs piecemeal by subscription. But, they say, Napster users don't appreciate the licensing and technology challenges when online music goes from free love to free enterprise. In the end, the bottom line is the bottom line: the music labels want to make money. Otherwise, they say, what's the point?
"I wish every music fan could learn to play an instrument," EMI's Mr. Samit said. "Anybody who plays an instrument and recognizes the blood, sweat and tears that goes into making music wouldn't steal that from an artist."
Of the relationship between consumers and music companies, he said, "We're madly in love with each other, we're just not communicating."
The counselor's take. Presented with these themes, Mr. Gottfried, the therapist (himself an admitted Napster user), said he did not necessarily see a doomed relationship. It could be a "win-win," he said, but both sides would have to work on it. 
Mr. Gottfried said he thought the music industry remained in denial about the impact of technology. He said he understood that consumers were frustrated and said "their distrust is coming from the record labels' lack of empathy."
The industry probably has farther to go to make this relationship work, Mr. Gottfried said. "The music industry is not listening to what the consumers are saying," he said.
The labels, he said, should think hard about compromising by changing their business model. He proposed selling songs for less than a dollar, and making up in volume what would be lost on full-album sales.
"Music should be like an A.S.P.," he said, referring to application service providers, which offer software and support services via the Internet. (Hey, in Silicon Valley, everyone has a technology solution.)
But he said that consumers needed to be more realistic about the relationship. "There has to be a reasonable fee," said Mr. Gottfried, who himself charges $250 an hour for counseling. Otherwise, he said, the only available new music will be from amateurs. 
The prognosis. Whether the parties can work out their differences, one thing becomes clear: the people who consume music -- not necessarily who buy it, but who consume it -- have a new sense of empowerment in their relationship with the publishers and distributors of music. (From a moral perspective they may be wrong to download files. From a legal perspective, they are almost certainly wrong, at least according to the latest court decisions). 
But for now consumers have the upper hand. If the industry is to bring the relationship into balance, it must learn to appreciate the technology, embrace it, harness it -- without making it a straitjacket. 
If the industry can do this, it will be up to consumers to use the technology responsibly. If listeners continue to exploit technology to consume music with little regard of the other side's needs, the recording industry will have little incentive to hang around.

HEADLINE: What's Not for Sale 

BYLINE:  By Joseph Venafro; Joseph Venafro is a journalism student at Columbia University.

 BODY:
I had known him as the Pineapple Man until that Easter morning. For months, I'd seen him nearly every day outside the gates of Tanghu Middle School, the Communist Party boarding school where I taught English in Sichuan Province, China. He husked and cut the pineapples while his wife skewered their halves and placed them in a bucket filled with salted water. He was proud of his fruit and even prouder that I, an American, could appreciate it. Every time I bought a pineapple, he would stop husking, wait for me to take a bite, and ask, "Is it delicious?"
 The pineapple was delicious, and after I gave my nod of approval, he would continue: "Do you have pineapples in America? How long have Americans eaten pineapples? Where do they grow them? How much do they cost?" And before I had to run to class, one final: "Is it delicious?" 
 The slight man would then smile broadly and place the one yuan, or about 13 cents, that he charged into a weathered shoebox. He and his wife took turns holding their cherry-cheeked daughter, who looked about 3 years old. When the weather turned cold, I didn't see the Pineapple Man anymore. He seemed to have disappeared with the season of his fruit.
Then, on Easter morning, a cold, steady rain fell. I was on my way to the pay phone at the post office, one of the few phones in the village capable of making an international connection, to call my parents in Virginia to wish them a happy holiday. The normally bustling street in front of the school was quiet. The students were on their weekly leave to visit their parents. There were no bicycle bells ringing, no zooming mopeds to dodge. But in the distance there was a child's cry. On the corner, under a makeshift tarpaulin, the Pineapple Man and his family stood before his wooden cart. As I approached, he smiled faintly, taking only a moment to look up from the pineapples he hastily cut. The pineapples were small and hard.
I looked at the crying child, the mother whispering in her ear, and was about to ask why he was out so early in the rain when I saw his weathered shoebox: empty.
I wanted to buy them some food, to give them some money, but I didn't want him to lose face in front of his family -- face, or honor, seemed one of the few possessions he had. A craving for pineapples came over me: could I please have six, no, let's make it seven, and do you have a bag?
"You don't want my pineapples," he said quietly, still looking down. "They are not sweet. There has been too much rain."
"Don't be silly," I said. "Your pineapples are tastier than the sweetest I've ever eaten in America."
Before cutting the seventh one for me and wrapping it with the others, he raised his head and said, "My name is Feng Jin." At the post office, as I waited for my call home to be connected, I saw Feng Jin run across the street to a sidewalk kitchen and buy a bowl of rice porridge and a bottle of warm soy milk. From then on, pineapples became an important part of my diet.
One day my boss, Mr. Chen, the international affairs director at Tanghu Middle School, approached me after class and said he had been informed by some of the other teachers that I had befriended Feng Jin.
"Mr. Joe, I'm sure you will understand that it is not safe for you to talk with that man," he said after my students left the room. 
"Why? Because he is poor?" I asked. I was not supposed to see the poor in China, let alone become friendly with them. Mr. Chen's cheeks flushed. He forced out a chuckle. "There are no poor in the motherland," he said. But his embarrassed response revealed to both of us a truth that he could not deny.

Octogenarian Futurist

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The most important unknown forward thinker in America today is Andrew Marshall. Pentagon brass shuddered when Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld named this legendary shatterer of shibboleths to be his adviser on "net assessment" and made him a key player in the review that will reshape our armed services.
 The freshest mind in the Puzzle Palace belongs to a man whose next birthday will be his 80th. He began going against the grain in 1949 at the RAND think tank when that acronym stood for "research and development"; since then, two generations of Pentagonians have tolerated Marshall's iconoclasm on the off-chance that he may be right. 
 "Andy is a thoughtful person," says Rumsfeld, "who's had a pattern of finding brilliant young people to assist him in assessing what the world will look like. His program is still up at 20,000 feet and we'll need to work out operational concepts, but we're getting there."
Marshall's group is one of a dozen at Defense taking new looks at everything from "acquisition reform" (we've doubled the years it takes to produce new weapons systems, guaranteeing obsolescence on delivery) to "spectrum studies" (Jim Schlesinger finds we had one-tenth as many people in Kosovo as in the Persian Gulf war but they used one hundred times the bandwidth).
Because the study groups have not yet been connected, expect only a tweaking of defense budgets this year: "We can't spin this thing on a dime," says Rumsfeld, "everyone has to have his chop." Best guess is that coordinated changes in strategy and armament will be presented this winter and furiously fought out next year over the 2003 budget.
Asked for an inkling of its direction, the defense secretary replies: "We're moving from a threat-based strategy to a capability-based strategy." In unhyphenated English, that means scrapping the old idea of readiness to fight two conventional wars simultaneously, and substituting a new ability quickly to project a force powerful enough to win a conflict anywhere in the world. 
" 'The key words are 'dissuade' and 'reassure,' " says Rumsfeld, the former everything. "If our goal is to dissuade (not 'deter' -- that's associated with nuclear) adversaries, we must have sufficient capability to reassure allies that they need not be blackmailed into accommodating pressures on their borders."
It's no secret that the greatest need for "dissuasion" is shifting eastward -- from the old Soviet threat to the new threat posed by an unstable, oil-hungry, adventurist China. In the other-cheeked Bush response to China's reckless endangerment of the U.S. reconnaissance aircraft, Rumsfeld took a back seat. Even now, asked about the costs to be imposed on such aggressive conduct, he adverts only to an economic impact: "When business executives and academics, in Japan and Taiwan and here, see a country seize 24 people and not allow a phone call, they have to ask -- do I want to invest there?"
In the short term, I think a much stronger answer is required, including resumption of surveillance flights by Defense, denial of M.F.N. by Congress, and arms for Taiwan's self-defense from the White House. 
Long term, the response will be found in our new strategy: top priority is missile defense, based on land and sea and directed from space. Projecting power across the Pacific will require more stealthy long-range bombers like the B-2, fewer interceptors like the F-22 or the Joint Strike Fighter.
We'll see fewer vulnerable large carriers, more small ones; lighter tanks and laser artillery; more high-altitude robot reconnaissance planes and low-level photo-drones. With fewer overseas bases, tilt-rotor cargo planes will be needed to airlift mobile forces to remote airfields.
Today's layered military establishment has almost as many inspectors as our army has shooters. Tomorrow's military intelligence will have to anticipate cyberterrorists and germ warriors, and our psywar teams must interpret Asian cultures and behavior patterns that Westerners find hard to fathom. 
Asked what the new strategic approach would be named, Rumsfeld told the octogenarian futurist Andy Marshall: "If it's good, we'll call it the Bush Doctrine. If it's not, it's Marshall Plan Two."

HEADLINE: For Texas Now, Water and Not Oil Is Liquid Gold 

BYLINE:  By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Tex. 

 BODY:
The dirt road winds through the gray hills of T. Boone Pickens's sprawling Mesa Vista Ranch when an unlikely swath of green grass appears like an emerald in a sandbox. It is a lushly irrigated two-hole golf course, a playpen for a wealthy man, and a reminder that beneath this bleak, isolated terrain lies one of the prime untapped reserves of water in Texas.
 And Mr. Pickens, the former oilman and corporate raider whose takeover bids once struck terror in boardrooms, has more in mind for the Mesa Vista than golf. At a time when nearly every major city in Texas is desperate for more water to meet runaway population growth, Mr. Pickens is proposing to pump tens of billions of gallons -- to the highest bidder. 
 "Water is the lifeblood of West Texas," said Mr. Pickens, 72, who is courting Fort Worth, Dallas, San Antonio and El Paso as potential customers and estimates that a deal could reap $1 billion. "They've got to get it somewhere." 
For decades the gold beneath the ground in Texas was oil. But if oil built modern Texas, water is now needed to sustain it. 
Water has become so valuable that a complicated scramble is under way for the rights to underground aquifers, reminiscent of the days when "land men," among them a young George W. Bush, solicited rural landowners to drill for oil. There are even "water ranches" popping up around the state.
The unanswered question is whether all this activity will skew who gets water and who does not in the future, or influence how much it will cost. In many parts of the country, water is considered a life-sustaining public resource. So there are already public policy concerns about whether pumping water for profit could threaten supply in some areas. Rural officials fear that large cities could simply outbid them in a profit-driven market. And Texas law offers few restrictions; groundwater is considered private property, and any landowner can pump the water out even if it leaves neighbors high and dry. 
"You're going to devastate a large part of the state of Texas," said Tom Beard, a rancher who said he feared that arid West Texas could be pumped dry by water ranches owned by distant cities. "I'm not sure we can afford to treat water like cotton or cattle. And certainly not like oil. The approach to oil was to pump it up, use it up and do something else. We can't do that with water."
Throughout the country, drought and population growth have placed a premium on water. Such demand is amplified in Texas after four droughts in five years. The state's population is 20.8 million, second only to California's, and demographers predict that it will double in 50 years. Already, El Paso must find new sources of water or it could run out in 20 years. The Rio Grande, a primary water source for counties along the Mexican border, is so dry that this month it failed for the first time in 50 years to reach the Gulf of Mexico, stopping 50 feet short.
Until now, Texas has largely avoided the contentious political fights over water familiar to Western states like Arizona. But the Texas Legislature is considering a sweeping piece of legislation known as Senate Bill 2 that could determine how water is regulated and what is done to meet demand in the state for the next half-century. Regional water planning groups have proposed $17 billion in public works projects, conservation efforts and irrigation improvements. Lawmakers say it could cost at least $80 billion to upgrade the state's aging municipal water systems.
The political debate is complicated. Environmentalists want more conservation and tougher regulation, as opposed to new dams and aggressive pumping of groundwater. There are the competing demands of agriculture and urban areas. There are also differing needs and climates in the state's various regions, some of which depend on reservoirs and other surface sources while others depend on underground aquifers. The divide is starkly rural versus urban, particularly over who should have priority in times of drought when a water source is shared.
A major sticking point in planning is the difficulty in passing taxes to pay for any major water projects. Legislators have already stripped Senate Bill 2 of a tax increase on water and sewer bills that would have raised several hundred million dollars a year. This lack of political will is one reason some lawmakers say water marketing -- essentially allowing private companies to sell and move water like electricity -- is the best solution. 
"We can't pay for all of it -- the state," said State Senator J. E. Brown, the influential Republican who is sponsoring the water legislation and who favors encouraging private efforts. "Either you've got to let the price of water go up, or we're going to have to collect fees."
State Senator David E. Bernsen, a Democrat who represents Beaumont, agreed that a fund-raising mechanism was needed for future water projects. But he warned of the potential consequences of privatization in a state where nearly 55 percent of the population depends on groundwater for drinking.
"It's kind of like the golden rule: those with the gold make the rules," Mr. Bernsen said. "If individuals like T. Boone Pickens are going to control groundwater, and water is already more valuable than oil, then they will set the economic policy for where Texas is going to grow. And that is a dangerous situation."
Here in Miami (pronounced my-AM-uh), which is tucked in a remote stretch of the Texas Panhandle, the equivalent of a water rush has been under way for more than year, though no major pumping has begun. Roberts County, which includes Miami, has fewer than 1,000 people and is hardly affluent. An acre of land costs only $250 because the rugged terrain makes farming difficult at best. But it does sit atop a mostly untouched section of the immense Ogallala Aquifer, which stretches as far north as South Dakota.
On a recent Saturday afternoon, about 60 ranchers in dusty jeans gathered inside the Roberts County Courthouse as Mr. Pickens explained the latest developments in his deal. One rancher had already signed a contract to sell water to Amarillo. Another group was looking for a customer to lease water rights on 190,000 acres. The regional Canadian River Municipal Water Authority, which provides water for much of the Panhandle, will next month become the first to actually start pumping in Roberts County.
The flurry of activity can be traced to both profit and fear. While there is water farming in most Western states, the level of regulation is relatively tight. In Texas, all surface water is considered public, while groundwater is private. Under the "rule of capture" in Texas law, a landowner can pump without regard for his neighbors. This can create a race to pump water before the aquifer goes dry, particularly with so much demand for it.
"All of us in the back of our minds are asking, 'Is this the right thing to do?' " said Salem Abraham, the landowner who made the deal to sell water to Amarillo, albeit not for 25 years. "But you know you've got to do it or you'll get zero." 
The safeguards to protect groundwater are local conservation districts, though their ability to restrict the pumping and export of water is limited. For example, Mr. Pickens's plan calls for building a pipeline and pumping enough water for a million people a year. Panhandle Ground Water Conservation District No. 3, which oversees Roberts County, initially tried to cut that volume in half. But Mr. Pickens prevented reduction by arguing that his proposed pumping level was the same as that already granted to the Canadian River authority, and that by law he should be treated equally.
C. E. Williams, manager of the conservation district, said the district's current policy allowed a landowner to pump the equivalent of 326,000 gallons annually for every acre. The Canadian River project controls 43,000 acres. Mr. Pickens controls 150,000 acres and is looking for 50,000 more, meaning that he could conceivably pump more than 60 billion gallons of water a year.
"We haven't ever seen any huge projects like this," Mr. Williams said, adding that the district could suspend pumping of all projects if the aquifer shows signs of undue depletion. "So it's kind of a fear of the unknown. If we make a mistake on this one, we affect generations to come for a long time. That's what makes me lay awake at night."
Mr. Pickens said his project would not endanger the aquifer. He noted that his proposal represented only a fraction of the amount of water already pumped by farmers in the Panhandle (more than 80 percent of the groundwater pumped in Texas is for agriculture). He also called his decision to sell a protective measure to ensure that the Canadian River authority's deal did not pump the water from beneath his land.
"When you hear people say Boone Pickens is going to turn Roberts County into a Dust Bowl," he told the ranchers, "well, that's wrong. We're never going to be without water." 
That is a matter of debate. Mr. Pickens's projections, which jibe with estimates by the local water district, show that his project would reduce the water in Roberts and three surrounding counties by 50 percent over the next 100 years. But state statistics show that the section of the Ogallala beneath the entire Panhandle is very stressed. There is little rainfall, and at the current consumption rate the Ogallala could be depleted in Texas in 70 years.
These sorts of regional water wars are percolating across Texas. El Paso has angered rural ranchers by buying or leasing several water ranches for possible future pumping. A private company, Metropolitan Water, is actively leasing water rights across central Texas. There are scores of such deals being cut or discussed. In response, at least 40 localities are asking the Legislature to create new groundwater districts. 
"People are going after groundwater because it's a lot quicker and cheaper than having to develop a reservoir project, which can take 30 years," said Paul Sugg, a government liaison with the Texas Association of Counties, which represents all 254 Texas counties.
Mr. Sugg said some farmers in West Texas were talking about forming co-ops to sell water rights and, as a result, stop farming. 
"What happens to land values, to local and regional economies that are often based on agriculture?" Mr. Sugg asked. "What happens to the tractor dealer and the local car dealer when a farmer says, 'Heck, I can make more money selling my water and stopping farming'?"

HEADLINE: MARATHON; 
The Boston Favorites Begin Kicking Early

BYLINE:  By FRANK LITSKY 

DATELINE: BOSTON, April 15 

 BODY:
Last year, when the Boston Marathon was run for the 104th time, history was made. Never before had three runners at the head of the pack rounded this last turn together.
 The finish was stunning, rough and the closest ever here. Elijah Lagat, a 33-year-old Kenyan who took up running because his doctor told him he was too fat and might die, won in 2 hours 9 minutes 47 seconds. Gezahenge Abera of Ethiopia, only 21, was inches behind in the identical time. Moses Tanui of Kenya, 34, a two-time Boston winner, slipped to third, three seconds back. 
 Minutes later came angry charges of kicking and elbowing, illegal contact in a supposedly noncontact sport. Now comes Abera's chance for revenge and Lagat's and Tanui's chance to prove the superiority of the Kenyans because the three runners will meet again Monday in the 105th Boston Marathon.
As an added twist, Abera became the ranking celebrity of road racing when he won last summer's Olympic marathon in Sydney, Australia. But of the 11 fastest men here, six are Kenyan and only one -- Abera -- is Ethiopian.
The two fastest women -- Catherine Ndereba (last year's winner) and Lornah Kiplagat -- are Kenyan. The third fastest is Fatuma Roba, the Ethiopian who won three consecutive times here beginning in 1997.
Of the 10 women listed as elite, none are American. On the other hand, 5 of the 24 elite men -- Dave Morris, Rod DeHaven, Mark Coogan, Josh Cox and Scott Larson -- are Americans, an encouraging development considering the two-decade stagnation of American distance running.
The mostly downhill race will cover the standard 26 miles 385 yards from suburban Hopkinton to the Back Bay section of Boston. As many as 40 male and female runners and 10 wheelchair athletes will share the prize money of $525,000. The men's and women's open winners will get $80,000 each. Win or lose, most of the 34 elite runners will receive promotional fees ranging as high as $150,000 for Abera, Tanui and Roba.
Much of the prize and promotional money will go to the Kenyans and Ethiopians, almost mortal enemies in a sport in which camaraderie is the rule. Listen to what the three principals said about last year's physical finish.
Abera now: "I was very much disappointed last year. It was two Kenyans against one Ethiopian, and I lost the race at the finish. One Kenyan -- the winner -- elbowed me. I hope the ganging up will not happen this year. As competitors, there has to be some kind of discipline. Last year, the Kenyans were creating this kind of problem."
Lagat after that race: "Those who were watching might say that it was he who was kicking me, but I didn't think of it as being intentional. I know that when somebody is concentrating on following rather than sharing the lead, these things can happen."
Lagat now: "When Tanui spurted at the end, Abera followed him. I stayed wide because when I passed, I didn't want anybody to follow my steps, so I don't know how I could have elbowed him."
Tanui after the race: "He kicked me two or three times when I was in front. He's the one who was doing it, and it is his problem."
Tanui now: "The Ethiopians are giving us problems every time. They never do that to other athletes, just Kenyans. They complain for nothing. They have people who cause the problems."
Abera said he was disappointed that elite marathon fields had so many Kenyans and fewer Ethiopians.
"That gives an advantage to the Kenyans," he said, "and they can take me out of a race."
If the Ethiopians are upset by Kenyan superiority, perhaps runners from other nations are, too. "I don't think so," Abera said. "After all, this is friendly competition."

FINISH LINES
The Boston Marathon is run on Patriot's Day, commemorating the skirmishes at Lexington and Concord that led to the Revolutionary War. To residents of Massachusetts, Patriot's Day means a legal holiday that this year provides an extra day to file tax returns. To the marathon's 500,000 spectators, it means a day's entertainment. To baseball fans, it means a Yankees-Red Sox 11 a.m. game at Fenway Park, a 15-minute walk from the marathon finish line. To the local economy, it means $68.3 million in revenue, according to the Greater Boston Convention and Visitors Bureau. To charities that benefit from how many miles certain runners finish, it means $5 million, according to the Boston Athletic Association, the race sponsor. To the 15,641 male and female athletes from every state and 52 nations, it means being a part of marathon lore.

Racial Unrest in Cincinnati Echoes Decades of Distrust
It was not just the report of a policeman's gunshot, but also its echo, that incited unrest in Cincinnati last week. When a white officer killed an unarmed black man on April 7, it revived the lingering distrust that has riven this city's black community from its mostly white police force for more than three decades.

National Spotlight For Vermont Paper

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
Want to ferret out the romantic in the most sardonic, cynical journalist? Ask about his first newspaper. Ask about her first editor. Like first love or first betrayal, first journalism jobs are remembered intensely. Like old newsrooms, these memories are cluttered with paste pots and balky carbon paper, not to mention the importunate bells of the wire-service machines and the smell of exasperation.
 If memory serves, the editors at these newspapers killed paragraphs like that one. Keep it short, they said. Hemingway did. 
 The Rutland Herald, circulation 22,000, is such a newspaper. Last year the Vermont daily showed that it was not only a fondly remembered collection of characters, like the photographer who walked or got a lift to his assignments because he had never learned to drive. Last year the paper reaffirmed its role as a leader among Vermont newspapers by making a plain-spoken case in its editorials for legalizing gay unions. In so doing, The Herald put itself in contention for one of the Pulitzer Prizes to be awarded today.
Whether it is called gay marriage or civil union, same-sex unions, which were sanctioned by state law in the spring of 2000, were the focus of the most emotional political debate in Vermont (population 608,000) in a generation.
In December 1999, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples should receive the same legal benefits that married couples do, but left it to the Legislature to figure out how to proceed. This meant that Vermont newspapers, and their editorial writers, had a chance to frame the divisive debate that ensued. 
Editorials in The Burlington Free Press, the state's largest newspaper, with a circulation of 51,400, said little about the core of the issue. A few days after the court ruling, the paper called for "Leadership. Civility. Open Debate." It did not say in which direction the leaders should lead.
The choices facing the Legislature were to pass a law in response to the court's ruling, or to do nothing. If they did nothing, the burden would be on the court to decide whether and under what circumstances to extend legal benefits to gay couples. If legislators passed a law, they would take the heat.
Political careers were at risk. Vermont politics has been defined by lawmakers like Senator James M. Jeffords, a Republican who is a moderate on social issues. But the state also has culturally conservative Catholics, clustered in areas like Burlington, Rutland and the Canadian border. And it has a generally liberal group of transplants -- known as flatlanders -- who are clustered in the south but also scattered throughout the state.
David R. Moats took the job as editorial page editor of The Rutland Herald in the early 1990's, a position that had been held by the newspaper's late editor and publisher, Robert W. Mitchell. Mr. Moats is a flatlander; he arrived in Vermont from San Francisco in a Volkswagen van 25 years ago. His first look at us-them politics came at town meetings where newcomers would ask for school repairs and natives, fearful of new taxes, would oppose them.
In the 1990's, the big statewide issue was schools -- who should pay for them, and with what tax revenue. Then on Monday afternoon, Dec. 20, 1999, Mr. Moats got a copy of the State Supreme Court ruling. He wrote an editorial for the next day's paper saying that "the court was bold in declaring that the extension of legal protection and security to same-sex relationships was, at its core, 'a recognition of our common humanity.' "
It unleashed a flood of angry letters that lasted for more than five months. The proposed law, The Herald argued, was "based on the premise that it is not ours as a state to judge the morality or immorality of private relationships," as an April editorial put it. "We are all free to form our judgments about sexuality, love and family and to live our lives as we see fit."
But Mr. Moats also argued against dismissing as bigots the opponents of the the bill to legalize civil unions. He wrote: "It is beyond the power of the Legislature to resolve the moral differences that exist today about gay and lesbian relationships and will continue to exist even after same-sex partners gain legal recognition. Those moral differences are for all Vermonters to wrestle with in the privacy of their spiritual domain."
Voters convening at town meetings in March 2000 largely opposed civil unions in a series of nonbinding votes. At The Rutland Herald, a few advertisers indicated their discomfort at the paper's editorial stance as did some readers, but there was no organized boycott.
"It certainly annoyed a lot of people," said R. John Mitchell, who is the publisher and owns the newspaper along with his brother and sisters. "But I don't think we were all that shrill."
Did The Herald take a risk, given that civil unions did become state law? Perhaps, said Ritchie Berger, a lawyer in Burlington with ties to the Rutland area. "To stake out the position they did I thought did involve risk," Mr. Berger said. "It is going to be disagreed with by far more of its readers than agreed with. Whether that translates into an economic risk is less clear. It is a monopoly. People who need to get their message out through advertising in the Rutland area don't have another option."
Advertisements, in fact, were a vehicle for opponents of the legislation. In the heat of the debate last year, The Herald published an advertisement from a group called Who Would Have Thought Inc., which opposed civil union. It attacked Gov. Howard Dean's support of the civil union legislation, implying that he supported pedophilia.
Governor Dean, who called the ad preposterous, won re-election. Other supporters of the law did not. A tally by The Associated Press showed that 7 state senators and 29 House members who supported the civil union law retired or were defeated last fall.
The Herald weathered the tirades. It remains anchored in this squat, unlovely city in otherwise lovely central Vermont, where the paper has been published for 210 years. Its news columns are still concerned with pollution and school finance. Reporters still go on to write for newspapers like The Wall Street Journal and The Boston Globe. Anthony Marro, a Rutland native and Herald alumnus, is the editor of the Long Island daily, Newsday. (His brother Albert, the formerly ambulatory Herald photographer, now has a driver's license.)
Jane Mayer, a correspondent for The New Yorker, started at The Herald covering births and deaths, then wrote about the marble quarries being taken over by multinational corporations. What was The Herald like 20 years ago? "We worked all afternoon and early evening," Ms. Mayer said. "Then we broke to go swimming in the quarries and eat hash browns in the diner until dawn."

Chief of Webvan Resigns As Dot-Com Allure Fades
George T. Shaheen resigned as the chief executive of the Webvan Group, an online grocer, ending an 18-month tenure that symbolized both the allure and ultimate disappointment of Internet start-ups for established executives.

A Detour From McVeigh Execution
ABC News has decided to make a statement with the way that it plans to cover the execution of Timothy J. McVeigh, left, scheduled for May 16. The network said that it would send its main anchor in the field that day, Charles Gibson, to report from Oklahoma City -- where Mr. McVeigh bombed a federal office building in 1995, killing 168 people -- rather than from the site of the execution, Terre Haute, Ind. By doing so, ABC says it will emphasize "that the more important message is still with the survivors and the victims," Mr. Gibson said. The network will have correspondents reporting from Terre Haute as well. C7.

HEADLINE: Venezuela Military Bristles at Role Ordered by President 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, April 13 

 BODY:
Ever since he took power two years ago, President Hugo Chavez has pushed for what he calls a revolutionary alliance between the military and the masses. But officers are chafing at the politicized role being thrust upon them. 
 The sources of the unhappiness begin with Mr. Chavez's friendship with Fidel Castro and his flirtation with Colombian guerrillas, but go on to organizational worries about military promotions and corruption. 
 The discontent was galvanized by the installation of Jose Vicente Rangel, a left-wing journalist with a long history of tense relations with the armed forces, as minister of defense. In February he became the first civilian to hold that position in more than 70 years, giving up his job as minister of foreign affairs.
Mr. Rangel's "antimilitary trajectory and his personal economic interests have led to a virulent nationwide reaction within the armed forces," said Mario Ivan Carratu Molina, a retired admiral and former director of the Institute for National Defense Studies. Choosing Mr. Rangel "is seen as part of a plan to destabilize the armed forces, and transform them into a partisan militia." 
From 1960 to 1985, when most of South America was ruled by military dictatorships, the Venezuelan armed forces were regarded as a model of subordination to civilian authority and political restraint. 
But that pattern was broken in 1992, when Mr. Chavez, then an army colonel, led a failed coup that made him a national figure and presaged the collapse, in 1999, of the two-party system. Both parties have since collapsed, and under Mr. Chavez, the Congress and the Supreme Court have been remade. 
Mr. Rangel has described his move to the Defense Ministry as a way of carrying out Mr. Chavez's goal of forging "unity between the people and the barracks." He has acknowledged the resistance against him, but maintains that his criticisms "were not against the institution, but only some of its members." 
Mr. Rangel replaced Gen. Ismael Hurtado, who was moved to the Infrastructure Ministry after an embarrassing incident in which he went on television to complain that 140 pairs of women's underwear were mailed to senior officers along with a message accusing them of lack of valor by failing to revolt.
General Hurtado had also been criticized for ordering the arrest of a civilian who sent a letter to a newspaper criticizing the military.
Mr. Chavez has implicitly recognized the risk by opening an office of his own at military headquarters. He has tried to bring the military under a unified command structure beholden to him, and has sent senior officers whose loyalty seemed in doubt to diplomatic posts abroad.
At the same time, Mr. Chavez has stepped up his policy of naming current or retired soldiers to powerful government posts normally held by civilians. Military officers now run the state oil company and its American affiliate, Citgo, and the main economic development corporation, along with other agencies and ministries.
In addition, legislation pending before the National Assembly, which Mr. Chavez controls, would extend the length of service allowed military officers by 10 years. That, in theory, would let the current crop of generals loyal to the president stay in their posts, but would clog the career paths of younger officers.
As a result, the officer corps increasingly worries about "being forced into areas that go far beyond their traditional responsibilities," said Fernando Ochoa Antich, a retired general who has been minister both of defense and of foreign affairs. The officer corps fears "the loss of institutional prestige" that comes from involvement in government corruption, he said, and "the political use that Chavez is now making of the armed forces."
Former President Carlos Andres Perez, living in exile, has gone so far as to predict that the "dispute within the army, the air force and the navy will end with Chavez's ouster." Most other political and military analysts say that talk of a coup is exaggerated, but agree that the divisions within the military will intensify.
The keystone of Mr. Chavez's plan to push the military deeper into national life has been a vast civic action program he calls Plan Bolivar 2000. Military detachments have been put in charge of lavishly financed food supply programs, clinics, construction efforts and even schools.
But millions of dollars have been pilfered from that and a related plan, according to a preliminary investigation by the government comptroller's officer that was leaked to the press. Both programs expanded greatly last year, and both bypass the military high command and state governors by funneling money directly to local military commanders.
"The middle and lower ranks know that generals are stealing and being corrupted," Francisco Arias Cardenas, once Mr. Chavez's closest comrade in arms, said in an interview last year.
Mr. Rangel has denied accusations of corruption directed at three generals, saying that "officials of such quality" are "incapable of such acts of dishonesty." 
But Mr. Chavez is now moving to cut funds made available to local commanders and to impose stricter accounting measures, even as he courts the rank and file by opening a military bank offering low-interest loans and mortgages.
Privately, officers have complained that the civic action program has diverted deployments and funding from the historically tense border with Colombia. And since Mr. Chavez is widely viewed as favoring left-wing guerrillas opposed to the Colombian government, that feeds resentment among officers who "remember that the guerrillas have killed their comrades," Admiral Carratu Molina said.
Mr. Chavez has insisted he will not tolerate paramilitaries. Yet he has talked of forming a "people's militia" of a million strong. His critics say he wants to create a parallel military force in case the military's loyalty were ever to come into doubt.
General Ochoa Antich said, "The military is respectful and obedient, but it does not like to see its members genuflecting excessively to political power."

HEADLINE: Mr. Bush's Caspian Diplomacy 

 BODY:
Although President Bush has spoken sourly of his predecessor's enthusiasm for trying to solve foreign conflicts, he met recently with the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan, two nations locked in a seemingly intractable ethnic dispute. Mr. Bush's involvement in negotiations over Nagorno-Karabakh -- an ethnic Armenian enclave inside Azerbaijan -- is undoubtedly in part due to the extensive oil and gas reserves in the Caspian region. Nevertheless, it is a welcome move, which we hope signals that Washington will remain engaged with troubled regions of the globe. 
 In close coordination with Armenia, residents of Nagorno-Karabakh went to war to break away from Azerbaijan when the Soviet Union disintegrated. Ethnic Armenians now effectively run Nagorno-Karabakh and occupy an area around it and a corridor connecting the enclave to Armenia. The 800,000 Azeris driven out of the area live in miserable refugee camps around Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan has maintained a blockade against Armenia, where the dismal economy has provoked the emigration of nearly half the nation. The Armenian community in America, in turn, persuaded Congress to prohibit American aid to Azerbaijan. 
 Past talks have foundered on disagreement over Nagorno-Karabakh's legal status. Heydar Aliyev, Azerbaijan's president, says he would allow the region wide autonomy if it remained part of Azerbaijan. Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh seek full independence for the enclave. But some Bush administration officials now seem optimistic that Armenia may become more flexible. They express hope that Armenia's president, Robert Kocharian, a Nagorno-Karabakh native who was leader of the enclave, could convince Armenians -- and especially the powerful military -- to abandon their claim for independence should he determine to. 
A major reason for Mr. Bush's involvement is that peace would speed the development of the Caspian oil fields and the construction of a pipeline to carry the oil from Azerbaijan to the West. The favored route would avoid Russia, where the oil flow could be hostage to political events, but it is nevertheless seen as vulnerable because it passes very near to Armenian-controlled territory. In a region dominated by Russia, and by British and French oil companies, Mr. Bush no doubt hopes to increase American influence. It is welcome that he is doing so by furthering the possibility of peace.

MANHATTAN: CAB FARE TO J.F.K.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said Saturday that he had "no reason to interfere" with a possible increase in the city-regulated taxi fare from Kennedy International Airport to Manhattan. An internal study by the Taxi and Limousine Commission said a $5 increase, to $35, might be necessary. The mayor said the increase, which requires approval by the commission, would bring the fare more in line with rates in other cities. Allan J. Fromberg, a commission spokesman, said the study found that the current fare, set in 1996, did not cover costs for the increasing number of trips to Lower Manhattan, which is farther from the airport by the major highways than Midtown is. Diane Cardwell (NYT)

MANHATTAN: COMMUTER TAX PROPOSED
State Senator Thomas K. Duane has introduced a bill that would reinstate the city commuter tax, which the Legislature abolished two years ago. The repeal reduced city revenues by more than $450 million a year and was opposed by city officials, including the mayor. The bill sponsored by Mr. Duane, a Manhattan Democrat, would re-establish the tax, to be paid by people who work in the city but live elsewhere. Eric Lipton (NYT)

MANHATTAN: DIALLO'S MOTHER OPPOSES HIRING
The mother of Amadou Diallo called on the Fire Department yesterday to reverse its tentative decision to hire Edward McMellon, a police officer involved in the shooting death of her son two years ago. The mother, Kadiatou Diallo, said that Officer McMellon, who was acquitted of criminal charges, panicked in shooting her son, an unarmed black man. "Suppose another incident happened in the Fire Department, and he panicked and did something wrong," she said. Mr. Diallo's father, Saikou Diallo, and a black firefighters' group also oppose the hiring of Officer McMellon, who fire officials said had one of the highest scores on the firefighter test.

ALBANY: COMMENT PERIOD ON PCB'S TO END
The four-month comment period ends tomorrow for the Environmental Protection Agency's plan to dredge nearly three million cubic yards of PCB-contaminated sediment from 40 miles of the Hudson River. The agency held 11 public meetings about the plan. "This is unprecedented as far as public participation goes," said Anne Rychlenski, an agency spokeswoman. General Electric discharged an estimated 1.3 million pounds of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB's, into the river before the chemicals were banned in 1977. G.E. opposes the $460 million cleanup plan. The agency will decide in August. (AP)

CONNECTICUT

HARTFORD: STATE TAX REVENUE UP
Connecticut's income tax revenue this year is expected to be $4.7 billion, an 11.5 percent increase over last year's revenue. The tax accounts for 40 percent of all revenue collected by the state this year and is expected to help create a surplus of about $585 million. Ten years ago, the tax was opposed by many state officials, including the current commissioner of revenue services. A strong economy last year and a booming stock market showered capital gains on investors, raising incomes -- and taxes. (AP)

HARTFORD: TEACHER SALARIES TO RISE
A shortage of teachers and the need to retain them will propel an average salary increase of 5 percent in the fiscal year that begins July 1, according to the Connecticut Education Association, the state's largest teachers' union. The average starting salary for a teacher in the state is $30,788, while those at the top of the scale make about $63,640, according to the Connecticut Association of Boards of Education. The salary increases worry officials in financially troubled towns. (AP)

NEW JERSEY

JERSEY CITY: JOB CUTS AT HOSPITAL
St. Francis Hospital announced last week that it will lay off 231 employees, mostly nursing assistants, technicians and registered nurses, as it plans to merge with St. Mary Hospital in Hoboken and Christ Hospital in Jersey City. St. Francis will still be open for physical rehabilitation and emergency room services, a spokeswoman said, but the company that owns the hospital, Bon Secours and Canterbury Partnership for Care, said most patients would be better served in more modern buildings rather than a "half-full hospital." The job cuts will take effect in June. (NYT)

JACKSON TOWNSHIP: STATE WANTS TIGERS MOVED
A Texas wildlife preserve is ready for two dozen tigers the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection wants to take from Joan Byron-Marasek's preserve, officials there said. "We're prepared to go," Carol Asvestas, vice president of the nonprofit Wild Animal Orphanage, told The Asbury Park Press. Ms. Byron-Marasek, known as the Tiger Lady, has refused to allow authorities to take the tigers. The state agency announced Thursday that it sought a court order to send the tigers to Texas. (AP)

TRENTON: SCHOOL ELECTIONS
Voters in 552 school districts will be asked tomorrow to approve a total of $7.7 billion in budgets and $29.9 million above state caps for other expenses. More than 1,500 school board seats will be voted on. Many schools are on spring break, and officials are worried about low turnout. (AP)

HEADLINE: The Trouble With Airlines 

BYLINE:  By Richard Freeman; Richard Freeman is a professor of economics at Harvard.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Do airline strikes threaten to ruin America's summer vacation? Mechanics at United and flight attendants at American are wrangling over labor contracts. Delta pilots will be legally able to strike -- under the Railway Labor Act, the arcane federal law that controls airline labor issues -- at the end of April. More than 1,300 pilots are already on strike at Comair, Delta's regional commuter airline. And in March President Bush appointed a presidential emergency board to help avert a strike by mechanics at Northwest.
 The threat of airline strikes seems to loom every year for anxious travelers, but there were actually just six in the 1990's, and they declined decade by decade to that low: 47 in the 50's, 36 in the 60's, 43 in the 70's, 17 in the 80's. In fact, 97 percent of airline labor disputes are resolved without strike action. 
 But this does not mean the airlines have good labor relations. In fact, the industry's very structure and the disagreement between labor and management about who runs the enterprise create persistent tensions -- even when the employees own the airline, as is the case with United. Some time ago, I spoke with an airline executive who compared pilots with bus drivers, the difference being that pilots don't have to deal with the stresses of traffic. Many pilots, for their part, see management as extraneous and themselves as indispensable.
Currently, employees who made wage concessions in the early 90's, when airlines were in financial difficulty, want to recover their losses. Record industry profits in the past two years, full flights and pilot shortages give unions power to win sizable increases in wages. In this context, some union leaders interpreted President Bush's promise to prevent strikes at major carriers this year as a heavy-handed effort to help management keep wages down and unions on the defensive.
Beginning with the Nixon administration, the federal government has tried to avoid intervening in airline labor relations. But Bill Clinton broke this tradition when he invoked emergency dispute proceedings to stop the 1997 strike of American Airlines pilots minutes after it began.
In recent years, the airlines have become a bellwether industry for labor relations, even though few others are subject to this level of government intervention. The vast majority of airline employees are union members, compared with fewer than 10 percent of employees in other private sector industries. Developments in the airlines in the 1980's defined the labor climate in that decade. President Ronald Reagan's 1981 victory over the Patco union in the illegal air traffic controllers' strike emboldened management's opposition to unions. And unions adopted many of the strategies that were developed in the battle with Frank Lorenzo over control of Eastern Airlines. 
A key reason for labor tension with pilots is the fact that seniority plays so large a role in determining the type of aircraft and the routes pilots fly. If a senior pilot loses his job, he would have to start out on the least desirable route on some other carrier -- a situation that makes the pilot highly sensitive to and critical of management decisions about routes and mergers. At the same time, employees have considerable power to exercise without striking. When employees refuse to work overtime, as did the mechanics at United last fall, they can bring about crippling flight delays and cancellations. A pilot sickout in 1999 cost American an estimated $250 million and produced a court judgment against the union of some $40 million.
Federal law makes it unlikely that planes will be grounded by strikes. But the Railway Labor Act does too little to prevent labor disputes, and by creating a process that allows them to drag on for months and years, it actually contributes to poor labor relations. To ensure better airline service, the administration should consider doing more than stepping in on the eve of strikes. It should bring airline executives and unions together to find ways to reduce the perennial conflict. Bad weather will always be with us. Bad labor relations can be improved.

HEADLINE: E-Commerce Report; 
Television shopping channels may become the big winners in the competition for online sales.

BYLINE:  By Bob Tedeschi 

 BODY:
WHEN Disney, NBC and other media companies were gobbling up Internet properties in the late 90's, more than a few onlookers predicted that these high rollers, and not the World Wide Web start-ups, would ultimately dominate e-commerce. After all, no business plan was so ugly that it couldn't be made presentable by a network brand name and a dose of prime-time exposure.
 Now, of course, paper shredders are choking on that theory, after both Disney and NBC have dismantled their Web portals. 
 But before one writes an e-commerce epitaph for the television networks, it is worth keeping in mind that many analysts still see potentially successful TV-Web synergies in some efforts, like Disney's ad-supported ESPN.com or NBC's MSNBC.com. And then there is the television company that has demonstrated a true flair for online transactions: Barry Diller's USA Networks. 
USA Networks, among other things, is the parent of the Home Shopping Network. Via television, the network expects to sell $2 billion worth of goods in 2001, executives said, while also helping its HSN.com Web site sell $97 million worth. USA also has in its online stable Ticketmaster.com, Hotel Reservations Network and the dating service Match.com, all three of which are profitable.
Like its larger competitor, QVC, Home Shopping had an advantage over entertainment television companies in that it was a merchant from the start. But for many entertainment executives, that seemed irrelevant just two years ago. 
Josh Bernoff, principal analyst with Forrester Research, an Internet consulting firm, remembers a conversation in 1999 with executives at one network. "They asked me what they could do to capitalize on e-commerce, based on the fact that they're a network," Mr. Bernoff recalled. "I said, 'You can't do that.' And they were like, 'What do you mean, we can't do that?' "
"Channels like QVC exist to get people to buy things," Mr. Bernoff said. "NBC is set up to get people to watch it. So what we tell them now is that unless you're an extremely practical destination like QVC or H.S.N., every dollar spent promoting your Web site instead of your television channel is a dollar wasted."
Mr. Diller, chief executive of USA Networks, said that unlike other media companies, his business emerged from the dot-com shakeout "having considerably advanced our lives." 
"But that's because we started with direct selling with our feet very much on the ground," Mr. Diller said. "That led us instead of to Jobs.com" -- a CBS-backed site that recently filed for bankruptcy protection -- "to Ticketmaster, and to H.R.N. and to Citysearch." USA's Citysearch is a collection of online city guides, with links to Ticketmaster, while H.R.N. refers to the Hotel Reservations Network.
USA Networks promotes most of its Internet properties through television, primarily through its cable services, the Sci Fi Channel and the USA Network, and its 13 broadcast stations. Together, USA's various television properties reach 78 percent of the nation's households. And the biggest online beneficiary of USA's airtime is HSN.com.
In addition to Home Shopping Network's on-air hosts and celebrities mentioning the Web site frequently as they pitch products -- with an HSN.com graphic on screen -- the network has begun to more deeply integrate its televised and Internet activities. Earlier this month, the network created the Chat Cafe, where celebrities and on-air hosts can continue hawking goods through an online chat room after their televised segments are finished.
For example, Mark Burnett, the executive producer of CBS's "Survivor" and USA Networks' "Eco-Challenge," repaired to the the Chat Cafe immediately after his recent 30-minute stint on television promoting merchandise related to "Eco-Challenge." Executives at HSN.com said Mr. Burnett sold about $40,000 worth of merchandise during his 90 minutes online, and they said that the number of chat participants was roughly 30 percent of the total number of buyers during Mr. Burnett's televised appearance.
Mark Bozek, chief executive of Home Shopping Network, which is based in St. Petersburg, Fla., said the Web site offers the same inventory as the channel. But the sheer number of products is almost immaterial, "because this is more about impulse buying," Mr. Bozek said.
"If the 10 items in my plan work on TV and online, I make my day," he said. "The rest is just gravy."
The dot-com side of the network's business can track the effectiveness of its on-air promotions fairly well, he said, because HSN.com does little advertising. As for initial concerns that the Web site would steal customers from the television channel, Mr. Bozek said that 45 percent of those who shopped on HSN.com had never before bought anything from the network. And those who shop via both the television channel and the Web site, he said, spend 25 percent more than those who shop at only one.
QVC has seen similar patterns among its online and offline customers, W. Stephen Hamlin, vice president of iQVC, QVC's online arm, said. His company, too, is using the Web to send more customers to the television station, and vice versa, he said.
For instance, Mr. Hamlin said, iQVC recently introduced a feature dubbed "61st Minute," in which QVC viewers are encouraged to go online immediately after a given product showcase. There, viewers find a Webcast continuation of the product pitch. In one such Webcast in February, Mr. Hamlin said, 1,000 people logged on, and 100 of them bought the featured goods. "That's a smaller audience, obviously," he said, "but it's still a very good sell-through."
Mr. Hamlin said the company's online sales accounted for about 6 percent of QVC's $3.6 billion in sales in the last 12 months, and that helps explain why iQVC is careful not to step on its parent's toes. Last year, for instance, the Web site stopped disclosing QVC's daily lucky number -- a staple on-air promotion. Executives did not think the Web benefit justified any siphoning of viewers from the television network.
By the same logic, if QVC is showcasing framed artwork, the host does not tell viewers there are more samples of photographs to see on the Web site until the waning moments of the broadcast. "You've got to love both channels for this to work well," Mr. Hamlin said.
Mr. Bozek, of Home Shopping Network, said he expected the sales from the Web site and the television channel to remain strong despite the economic slowdown. But Mr. Hamlin said QVC's post-Christmas sales had not quite kept pace with expectations. 
"We're still quite pleased," Mr. Hamlin said. But given the economy, and that QVC and iQVC tend to attract impulse buyers more than other merchants do, "people are pulling back their pocketbooks a little."
Because so many consumers are warming to the idea of shopping through television and the Web, it is not surprising that QVC and Home Shopping Network face an increasing amount of competition. One of the competitors is NBC -- its recent abandonment of NBCi notwithstanding.
NBC owns 40 percent of Value Vision, a home shopping channel that is broadcast to 43 million homes. According to ValueVision's senior vice president, Kevin Hanson, the company's Web site, www.vvtv.com, is profitable, accounting for $28 million of ValueVision's $385 million in revenue last year.
This summer, the channel's name is to change to ShopNBC. It is not yet certain how much the NBC television network will promote ShopNBC or its Web site. But "with all the alternatives to view and shop coming in the future," Mr. Hanson said, "we needed that name to help differentiate us."

Independents Take Chances in Fickle TV Arena

BYLINE:  By BETH PINSKER 

 BODY:
Danny DeVito is a high-class film producer these days. You can tell by his insouciance as he sat at the Oscars and munched snacks from his pocket while Julia Roberts picked up her statue for "Erin Brockovich."
 But don't think he's getting smug. Mr. DeVito is deep into making one more hard-fought transformation, this time from television actor turned movie star/director/mogul back to glory on the small screen. 
 Mr. DeVito's 10-year-old Jersey Films started a television division two years ago to expand the reach of the company's edgy, quirky humor that is not quite mainstream but not quite avant-garde.
The TV arena is notoriously fickle, but while independents are being squeezed out in favor of corporate synergy, the slacking economy is killing profits and the potential of writer and actor strikes this summer is scaring everyone, Jersey TV is thriving. Out of a dozen projects in development, four were bought by networks this year to be turned into pilots, and Mr. DeVito's television division has its first tangible success on the air right now, "Kate Brasher."
That show, a CBS Saturday night family drama starring Mary Stuart Masterson, Hector Elizondo and Mr. DeVito's wife, Rhea Perlman, has averaged a respectable 10 million viewers for its first few episodes.
But this is how things can turn on a dime: Jersey TV's financial arrangement with 20th Century Fox, in which Fox pays the bills in exchange for a first look at Jersey projects, is up in June, about the time the writer and actor strikes could cripple Hollywood. The test is if these new shows pay off with series commitments in May and then actually are made.
Fox is developing "Emma Brody," a one-hour drama about a young American in London, and "Reno 911," a "Cops" spoof. In the works are two other shows for ABC: "UC," a thriller about an undercover police force led by Grant Show and Jon Seda; and a project from the writer Charles Randolph about life in Silicon Valley. 
Can Jersey TV, with only five employees, handle filming a show in Los Angeles while also shooting pilots in Vancouver and London and starting two other projects in California?
That is more than most of the other independent television production companies have on tap for next year. In these days of vertical integration, the networks mostly develop shows through their own studios or ones their parent companies own, like NBC's NBC Studios or Disney's Touchstone TV for ABC.
Independent companies depend on these same studios to finance their deals, and they have to stay in the studios' good graces. In Jersey's case, it is Fox. In the case of a competitor, Imagine, owned by Ron Howard, it's Universal. For Miramax TV, it's Disney. And for Brad Grey TV, it's Columbia-TriStar.
Only a couple of companies, like Michael Ovitz's Artists Television Group, try to finance the development and production of shows on their own. As it has found, the danger is that when too many pilots fail, or new series are canceled after three episodes, the bank accounts dry up.
The reason these companies survive is that they work hard to bring something to the table that the studios cannot necessarily do on their own -- capitalize on relationships with talent or on an aura of coolness.
Jersey TV has both of those assets thanks to Mr. DeVito, his partners Michael Shamberg and Stacey Sher and the reputation of the 13 films they have produced that have been nominated for 17 Oscars.
But if any of the new shows make the fall schedule, don't look for an infusion of cartoon violence a la "Pulp Fiction" or acerbic humor like that in "Get Shorty." Jersey knows it cannot indulge its penchant for pushing the cinematic envelope, at least not right now. So it is determined to start out in television with accessible, G-rated fare.
"I want it to be broadly commercial," said John Landgraf, the president of Jersey TV. And he adds, "So does Danny."
Mr. Shamberg said that all his programming would still be distinct, and distinctly Jersey. "The hallmark of our company is that we try to do something that's fresh, but we don't want to pull it so far away that nobody wants to see it," he said.
Sounds simple, but it is not so easy. During the same time that Jersey TV was beginning, Miramax, with its stable of talent and corporate connections, also attempted to go from making innovative movies to reaching 20 million people every week through a television division. So far, Miramax has placed only two shows, "Wasteland" and "Clerks," on a network schedule -- at ABC, a sister company.
And neither show made it to a third episode.
Jersey's most drastic step came during pilot season last year. The budget for one of last year's two pilots, "Celebrity," wasn't big enough, so Jersey threw the production fee it gets from Fox into the pot. The pilot was never picked up, but its creator is back this year, working on "UC." And Mr. Landgraf says the company is also tossing in its fee on two of its four pilots this year.
It might hurt Jersey financially to throw its cut into the projects, but Mr. Landgraf says: "You don't get anywhere by half-measures. You have to go forward with as much passion and creativity and hopefulness as you can muster."

HEADLINE: Where G.I.'s Were Consumed By the Holocaust's Terror; 
A Filmmaker Helps Thaw Memories of Wartime Guilt

BYLINE:  By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: BERGA, Germany 

 BODY:
Four plain wooden crosses stand in the cemetery above this quiet town in eastern Germany. One of them is inscribed "Unknown Allied Soldier." He is unlikely to be an American, because the G.I.'s who died here were exhumed after World War II and taken home. But the mystery of this soldier's identity is only one of many hanging over Berga and its former Nazi camp.
 On a cold, late March day, with snow falling on the graves, a thin, soft-spoken American stands filming in the cemetery. He has hired some local volunteers, one of whom is portraying a Nazi guard, as two others turn the earth in preparation for the burial of the simulated corpses whose limp feet dangle out of sacks. The scene has an eerie luminosity in the silence of the snow. 
 The weather is cinematographically perfect. It is also unseasonably cold and infernally damp. The American, Charles Guggenheim, shivers as he says: "This is a slow business, filming something like this. Sort of like watching grass grow." 
But for him the fate of the American soldiers imprisoned and worked to death more than a half-century ago in Berga has become something of an obsession.
Time may be needed for an obsession to take hold, time for the half-thoughts, nagging regrets and suppressed memories to coalesce into a determination to act. Mr. Guggenheim, a documentary filmmaker who has won four Academy Awards, waited a long time to embark on this movie. His daughter, Grace Guggenheim, has a theory as to why. "This is sort of a survivor's guilt story," she said.
In September 1944 Mr. Guggenheim, now 77, was with the American 106th Infantry Division, preparing to go to Europe. But when the other soldiers embarked, he was immobilized with a foot infection. He remained in Indiana while his fellow infantrymen were plunged, within weeks, into the Battle of the Bulge; two regiments were lost. Thousands of American soldiers were captured, and several hundred who were Jewish or who "looked" Jewish ended up in Berga. Up to now their fate has received relatively little attention, partly because the surviving soldiers long tended to repress the trauma.
"I could have been among the captured or the killed," Mr. Guggenheim mused. "I never wished I had come to Europe. Anyone in the infantry who wishes for war has something wrong with them. But I've thought a lot: why in the hell am I here and they not? Perhaps in the next life they'll get even. I'm trying not to believe in a next life." 
Even this life seems incredible enough when gazing at little Berga, a place outside time. It was exploited by the Nazis before being taken over by the Russians, who mined uranium in the area. In 1990 it was made part of a united Germany. 
Unemployment here stands at about 24 percent, so Mr. Guggenheim had no problem finding volunteers for his film. To conjure an atmosphere of desolation was not difficult either: beside the unused red-brick textile factory of a vanished Jewish family (named Englander), stray cats wander through junkyards, watched by old men standing huddled against the cold. Germany's ghosts, its myriad secrets, are almost palpable in a place like this.
Among the onlookers near the cemetery is Sabine Knuppel, a municipal worker. She says she has photographs of the "old days" in Berga: a lighted swastika glowing among trees heavy with snow. None of the old people in town like to talk about those days, she says, when the Nazis set up a satellite camp to Buchenwald in the middle of town and used the slave laborers imprisoned there to dig tunnels into the rock cliffs bordering the Elster River.
All that, she continues, constitutes a "lost world." But once there were perhaps 1,000 prisoners working in the tunnels, where the Nazis planned to install a factory producing synthetic fuel. But until now, nobody in the town knew there were Americans among the prisoners, Ms. Knuppel says.
After the war the Russians blew up many of the tunnels. In their vestiges bats established a vast colony now officially designated as a German nature reserve. Along the wooded banks of the Elster, a dozen entrances to the tunnels may still be seen; they are barred with steel doors.
Layer upon layer of German secrets: more tangible in a place like Berga than in the west of the country, where postwar prosperity wiped away most traces of tragedy. Mr. Guggenheim, whose award-winning documentaries include "J. F. K Remembered" and an account of the civil rights movement called "A Time for Justice," has been digging into the secrets for two years now. He has interviewed 40 American survivors of Berga for a documentary tentatively titled "G.I. Holocaust."
The film, a co-production of Mr. Guggenheim's company and WNET, the public-television station in New York, centers on what happened to a group of American soldiers captured by the Germans after the Battle of the Bulge (which began on Dec. 16, 1944) and later transported to Berga.
This group of about 350 men was selected from among the more than 2,000 American prisoners initially taken to the Stalag 9B prisoner of war camp at Bad Orb, 50 miles north of Frankfurt. Among them was William Shapiro, now a retired doctor living in Florida. A medic attached to the 28th Infantry Division, he was captured on Dec. 17, 1944, the day after the battle began.
"On arrival at the prisoner of war camp, we were interrogated," Dr. Shapiro said in a telephone interview. "With a name like Shapiro, it was quite evident I was Jewish. I was then pushed into a particular barracks, mostly for Jews and other undesirables. Our job was to clean the latrines. We were guarded by the SS with dogs, rather than the Wehrmacht. I'd never even trained with a gun. I thought the Geneva Convention would protect me as a medic. At that time I knew nothing of Auschwitz or the planned extermination of European Jewry, although of course I knew of Hitler's hostility to Jews."
In the special barracks he was eventually joined by the other 350 Americans who would go to Berga. Their identities had not been as immediately obvious. Many were selected in a grim process recalled to Mr. Guggenheim by several soldiers of his own 106th Division.
They described how prisoners were ordered to stand at attention in the parade ground. The commandant then gave the order for all Jews to step forward. "Nobody moved," said Joseph Littell, one of the survivors. "He said it again. Nobody moved. He grabbed a rifle butt and hit Hans Kasten, our leader, with a blow you couldn't believe. Hans got up. He hit him again. The commandant said he would kill 10 men every hour until the Jews were identified."
The group of 350 was eventually assembled of some Jews who identified themselves under pressure; some soldiers, like Mr. Kasten, who volunteered; and some who were picked by the Germans as resembling Jews. Mr. Kasten, an American of German descent, suffered repeated taunts, being told that the thing worse than a Jew was a German who turns against his country. After several weeks the group was loaded into boxcars without food or water, arriving at Berga on Feb. 13, 1945.
The Nazis had a policy, "annihilation through work," and these Americans learned what this meant. Housed in a barracks beside the prison camp, fed only on bread and thin soup, sleeping two to a bed in three-level bunks, deprived of water to wash, urinating and defecating into a hole in the floor, regularly beaten, the soldiers were herded out to work 12 hours a day in the dusty tunnels.
"The purpose was to kill you but to get as much of you before they killed you," Milton Stolon of the 106th Division told Mr. Guggenheim. Gangrene, dysentery, pneumonia, diphtheria did their work. In the space of nine weeks about 35 soldiers died.
The persecution of American prisoners at Berga has remained little-known because many of the victims, like Dr. Shapiro, chose not to speak of it for a half-century after the war. With the cold war to fight and West Germany a postwar ally, the United States government had little interest in opening its archives and inflaming conflict between Americans and Germans. 
In recent years, however, the research of an Army officer, Mack O'Quinn, who investigated the events at Berga for a master's degree thesis, and a 1994 book by Mitchell Bard, "Forgotten Victims" (Westview Press), have thrown light on the treatment of the G.I.'s. Still, many of the soldiers said they spoke about their experiences for the first time to Mr. Guggenheim; the notion that American prisoners of war were persecuted as Jews or Jewish sympathizers has not received broad attention.
Mr. Guggenheim said it was still a shock that this happened to Americans, bringing home the realization that if the Nazis had won the war, "they would have gotten us, too." 
A descendant of German Jews, he grapples with ambivalent feelings about the country, unable to forget what a "civilized nation" did to its Jews even as he is surprised by how civil postwar German society is.
He also grapples with how to find an appropriate treatment of a Holocaust movie, troubled by what he sees as the frequent trivialization of the Holocaust in film. Too often, he said, Hitler's crimes have become a "quick fix for involvement" and a good fix for raising money from Jewish families. Like sex and violence, the Holocaust "demands people's attention, even if they do not feel good about it."
His answer to the ethical dilemma is the sobriety of his research and treatment: painstaking interviews, careful reconstruction of a little-known chapter in the war, attention to detail. The scenes filmed in Berga will supplement a core of archival film, photography and interviews. "What is most moving to me is the way the survivors have talked about themselves and about each other, often for the first time," he said. "In many instances they had never talked about this before."
Dr. Shapiro was among those who suppressed his memories. "It took 50 years for all of us to begin to come to terms with this," he said. In early April 1945, with the American and Soviet armies closing in, the camp at Berga was ordered evacuated, and a death march began for hundreds of prisoners. At least another 50 Americans died in the ensuing days before advance units of the American 11th Armored Division liberated the prisoners on April 22, 1945, near Cham in southeastern Germany.
The rate of attrition -- more than 70 American dead in just over two months after arrival at Berga -- was among the highest for any group of G.I.'s taken prisoner in Europe. Dr. Shapiro weighed 98 pounds on his liberation; he cannot recall the last days of the forced march despite repeated efforts to do so. "I had become a zombie," he said.
Time has passed, but Dr. Shapiro's voice still cracks a little as he thinks back. Periodic nightmares trouble him. "I traveled the same road as an American prisoner of war as the Jews of Europe," he continued. "I was put in a boxcar, starved, put on a death march. It was a genocidal type of approach."
That road might also have been Mr. Guggenheim's. After the war he asked a returning member of the 106th Division about a Jewish soldier he had known and was told the man had died in a German mine. But where, how, why? 
The questions lingered in his mind for more than a half-century before taking him where an infected foot prevented him from going in 1944: to a remote town in Germany where the bat-filled tunnels are now sealed and snow falls on a cemetery where an "Allied Soldier" lies.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about the making of a documentary film about a group of American soldiers imprisoned in 1944 in a Nazi camp at Berga, Germany, misstated the title of an earlier work by the filmmaker, Charles Guggenheim. It was "R.F.K. Remembered," not "J.F.K. Remembered."

HEADLINE: It's a Blah Market in Eastern Europe 

BYLINE:  By PETER S. GREEN 

DATELINE: PRAGUE, April 16 

 BODY:
Nearly a decade ago, as emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe shifted business and industry to private hands, stock markets began to sprout across the region. Now, a dearth of issues, stagnant trading volumes and investor apathy have analysts and traders warning that unless these markets combine and grow, they will have no future.
 Since foreign investors have bought out the most promising listed companies and bankruptcies have scuttled a rash of others, only half a dozen actively traded stocks remain in most markets. Small investors and local institutions prefer the safety and returns of bonds and foreign equities. Companies find it easier and cheaper to raise capital from private equity investment, bank loans and bonds. Foreign investors interested in regional stocks favor buying them through American or global depository receipts listed in London, New York or Frankfurt, where there is more liquidity. 
 Traders say many regional markets are too opaque for their clients and the costs of maintaining offices are too high for the low returns.
The only market vibrant enough to exist independently in a shakeout is Warsaw's, because Poland's mandatory private pension funds have become major investors in local stocks, analysts say.
"The demands of liquidity, transparency and low transaction costs mean it is clear there will be fewer national markets in the future," said Willem H. Buiter, chief economist of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
Additionally, although economies may be growing across the region, the markets have been battered by fallout from the slump in the United States and the flight of investors from emerging markets. Prague's main index is down more than 30 percent the last year, and Budapest has fallen around 28 percent. Even Warsaw has slid, around 27 percent. Trading volumes have also collapsed.
Prague and Budapest, the region's largest markets after Warsaw, are the markets whose futures many economists are most concerned about.
Prague opened in 1993, with 200 stocks figuring in its main index. Now, the chief index lists 50 shares, but only about 6 are actively traded. The lack of turnover has prompted dozens of local brokers to close up shop the last three years, including the Dutch investment bank ABN Amro, which shut down its Prague stock-trading arm in January.
The Prague bourse must change if it is to survive, said Miroslav Nosal, a Czech equities analyst at Merrill Lynch in London. "I do not believe that it has a very long-term future in its current shape," he said.
In Budapest, analysts say, the market is permanently bearish. They blame complex listing regulations and the government's decision to privatize large companies in the hands of strategic investors rather than float them on the bourse.
"You have to have investors to buy the stocks, and stocks for the investors to buy," said Frances Cloud, senior East European analyst at Nomura International in London. "If that doesn't happen, I can see the Hungarian market becoming more of a backwater until it decides to merge with another regional market and throw in the towel."
Bourses in smaller countries, like Slovakia, Croatia and Yugoslavia, may have only one or two issues that attract real interest, and across the region, excluding Russia, there have been fewer than 100 initial public offerings, analysts say. Most stocks are former state companies transferred to the market for privatization.
"The exchanges mirror the problems of the companies in these small countries," said Dominic Hughes at Commerzbank Securities in London. "None has the critical mass to attract significant flows of international capital."
Over the years, Prague, Budapest and other exchanges have discussed many plans to merge or coordinate with one another, to link up with big exchanges like London or Frankfurt, or to form a regional superexchange. But much like bourse merger talks in Western Europe, they have mostly gone nowhere.
Estonia's tiny Tallinn bourse moved last week to shore up its future by selling the exchange to the Helsinki Exchanges Group, which owns the Helsinki bourse, with volume 198 times that of Tallinn. The sale makes trading in the 30-odd listed Estonian stocks just one click away for traders on Helsinki's vibrant stock exchange, and Tallinn is already harmonizing settlement and disclosure rules with Helsinki.
Other exchanges are taking smaller steps, for now. Prague's directors said last month that they wanted to revive plans for a derivatives market. The Budapest bourse's chief executive, who laid off a third of her staff and cut costs last year, said her bourse would survive by attracting companies too small to be floated abroad.
Still, analysts say, it will be tough to draw the large foreign institutional investors whose money is so vital.
"All my investment universe has G.D.R.'s and A.D.R.'s," said Urs Antonioli, who manages $300 million in Eastern Europe for UBS Asset Management in Zurich. "I don't need a third or fourth exchange. I need one exchange that offers me sufficient liquidity."

HEADLINE: Official Sees Stability for Argentina in Currency Move 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, April 16 

 BODY:
The economy minister, Domingo Cavallo, sought today to allay concerns over a plan to include the euro in the Argentine currency's peg to the United States dollar, saying Argentines' savings were not at risk. 
 "People need not be anxious," Mr. Cavallo said. The proposal, he said, "will mean a more stable currency and wipe out not just inflation but also deflation, which is just as bad." 
 On Saturday, Mr. Cavallo said that he would send to the legislature this week a bill that would end the Argentine peso's 10-year-old one-to-one peg to the dollar, attaching the currency instead to a 50-50 average of the dollar and the euro. 
The move would not take place until the values of the dollar and euro reached parity. The euro traded late today at 89 United States cents. 
Some economists have worried that the plans could cause confusion and delay Argentina's exit from nearly three years of economic doldrums.
"Cavallo's trying to be original, but he's gone too far," said Aldo Abram, an economist with Exante consultancy. "A currency basket will increase the perception of risk since in the minds of investors and ordinary Argentines, only the dollar can guarantee stability." 
Buenos Aires shares closed down 2.81 percent today, the first trading day after Mr. Cavallo's announcement, though the thin trading volume indicated that the concern was minimal. 
Most private and corporate debt in Argentina are in dollars. For years, Argentine exporters looking to make headway in European markets have complained that the currency peg to the dollar makes their exports uncompetitive compared with their neighbors. 
Exporters praised Mr. Cavallo's plan today, saying that it would help soften the blow of wide swings in the value of either currency.
"It's a great cushion for the Argentine economy," said Enrique Mantilla, president of the Argentine Chamber of Exporters. "It gives Argentina the flexibility to absorb external shocks better." 
Mr. Cavallo has been credited with stemming hyperinflation when he established the dollar peg 10 years ago during an earlier stint as economy minister. He returned to the post last month. 
But American fund managers said that they were worried that introducing the idea now, during a period of financial uncertainty, could do as much harm as good.
"The most worrisome thing is not that they are thinking about changing the monetary system, but that they are doing so during a period when tensions are particularly high over the near-term manageability of Argentina's financing," said Mark Siegel, an emerging market fund manager with D. L. Babson & Company.
Mihail Dobrinov, sovereign analyst at Principal Capital, said: "The main issue in Argentina is that fiscal spending is not disciplined. That's where the emphasis should be."

HEADLINE: Amid Gloom, Continental Beats Forecast 

BYLINE:  By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Continental Airlines yesterday was the first major carrier to report first-quarter earnings and if analysts are correct, it will be one of the few.
 All the other large airlines, with the exception of the low-fare giant Southwest Airlines, are expected to post losses for the period as a result of declining business travel, labor disputes and higher wage and fuel costs. 
 The industry over all is expected to show a net loss of $570 million for the quarter, its first such loss since early 1995, according to Michael J. Linenberg, an airline analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York.
Continental's earnings declined 36 percent, to $9 million, or 16 cents a share, from $14 million, or 21 cents a share, in the first quarter of last year. The airline widely exceeded the average estimate of Wall Street analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call of 5 cents a share. Revenue rose 7.6 percent, to $2.45 billion, from $2.28 billion last year. 
"Our performance once again proves that all airlines aren't just alike," said Gordon M. Bethune, Continental's chairman and chief executive, in a conference call with analysts.
The carrier's revenue per seat rose 4 percent while the industry as a whole is expected to remain flat, said Samuel C. Buttrick, an airline analyst with UBS Warburg in New York. That suggests that Continental is winning a greater share of the softening business-travel market, which is crucial to airline profit. Business people are most likely to pay higher fares for last-minute travel and for first- or business-class seats at premium prices.
Amid winter storms, the airline canceled a smaller percentage of its flights than competitors in the quarter. And it was rated near the top in on-time performance by the Transportation Department.
"Continental is running a more reliable airline," Mr. Buttrick said. "Passengers know it and it shows."
It also managed to contain its costs. Expenses for the quarter, including fuel, rose 2.4 percent from the period a year earlier, which was less than expected. Higher fuel costs and added seat capacity were offset by a decline in fuel consumption resulting from the addition of newer, more efficient jets over the last year.
In trading yesterday, Continental Class B shares declined 76 cents, to $45.36.
Financially challenging conditions are unlikely to ease soon, Continental executives said. While advance bookings are currently around the same levels as they were last year, the number of business passengers will continue to decline, reflecting the slowing economy, said Greg Brenneman, Continental's president.
Continental has managed to avoid some of the more serious difficulties afflicting the rest of the industry. The regional economies supporting its two biggest hub airports, Houston and Newark, remain relatively strong. Businesses there are considered less likely to trim travel budgets than businesses based in other parts of the country.
Continental is also enjoying labor peace, a luxury in the airline industry these days. It will not enter a major contract negotiation until next year, and most of its organized employees are paid less then their counterparts at other airlines.
Among competitors, Delta could face a strike by its pilots later this month and pared its schedule during the first quarter because many of its pilots refused to fly overtime. Northwest Airlines recently reached a tentative agreement with its mechanics, who must still vote on the deal. United Airlines and American Airlines face the possibility of strikes later this year.
Such uncertainties have sent passengers to Continental. "Continental has been a net beneficiary of labor troubles at United, Delta and Northwest," Mr. Buttrick said.
Some analysts expressed concern that Continental's costs would rise after next year, when its unions are likely to ask the airline to match the raises now being sought at rivals.
Last week, Continental pilots voted to merge their independent union with the Air Line Pilots Association, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. affiliate that represents about 60,000 pilots at 50 airlines in the United States and Canada. The move is expected to give them more leverage in contract negotiations beginning next year.
Asked what would happen to Continental's labor costs as a result, Mr. Bethune replied, "When was the last time you saw labor costs go down?"

HEADLINE: Cargill's Earnings Tumble 48% in Quarter 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: MINNETONKA, Minn., April 16 

 BODY:
Third-quarter earnings at Cargill Inc. fell 48 percent because of weak economic conditions in many of the company's markets, the company said today.
 For the three months ended Feb. 28, Cargill earned $99 million. 
Earnings for the first nine months of fiscal 2001 totaled $445 million, an 8 percent decrease from last year. 
 The privately owned company did not release other quarterly performance figures, its usual practice.
"Continued weak economic conditions in many of Cargill's markets slowed the steady earnings pace set during the first half," said the chairman, Warren Staley. "However, the company's beef processing and financial businesses generated solid earnings, and despite the weakness in agricultural commodity markets, our grain and oilseeds businesses also delivered good results."
Mr. Staley said increases in energy costs hurt the company's energy-intensive processing businesses.

PHILIPPINES: WARRANT FOR EX-PRESIDENT -- A special anti-graft court issued an arrest warrant on corruption charges for former President Joseph Estrada, who was booked, photographed and fingerprinted. Mr. Estrada, who has insisted that he is innocent, posted bond and remained free. Seth Mydans (NYT)

VIETNAM: POISON ATTACKS -- Sixty-five more children and teachers were reported to have fallen ill in chemical poison attacks in schools in Dak Lak Province. More than 600 children and teachers have been sickened in recent weeks in Dak Lak, which has been hit by political unrest. Seth Mydans (NYT)

THAILAND: WAR LOOT -- Troops and excavation experts began digging in a jungle cave where a senator announced last week that he had found evidence of billions of dollars' worth of gold hidden by Japanese troops during World War II. The report has been taken seriously enough for Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra to visit the site and sanction the official exploration. Seth Mydans (NYT)

NORTH KOREA: FAMINE PERSISTS -- After the worst harvest in four years, North Korea has just two-thirds of the food it needs this year. David Morton, the World Food Program representative in North Korea, said the autumn harvest of corn and wheat was three million tons, almost 40 percent short of its target. Conditions have improved since the darkest years of 1996-97, but Mr. Morton said hunger would persist until North Korea's economy revives. (Associated Press)

INDIA: KASHMIRI REJECTS TALKS -- The main separatist alliance dismissed a government announcement that it had begun a political dialogue on Kashmir's future. "It is nothing more than an eyewash," said Abdul Gani Bhat, chairman of the All-Party Hurriyat Conference, an amalgam of two dozen separatist groups. India's new negotiator, K. C. Pant, has invited several regional groups for talks, but Mr. Bhat responded, "The main parties to the talks are only India, Pakistan and the Hurriyat Conference." (Agence France-Presse)

THAILAND: DEADLY FESTIVAL -- The toll from traffic and other accidents during the water festival rose to 628, the highest on record and far higher than the 164 deaths last year. Like Thanksgiving in the United States, the water festival, Songkran, is a time when millions of Thais travel to visit families. Seth Mydans (NYT)

IRAN: RUSSIAN COMMITMENT TO N-PLANT -- Russia's atomic energy minister, Aleksandr Rumyantsev, committed Russia to completing the Bushehr nuclear power station, but was noncommittal on plans to build a second. The United States opposes the sale of nuclear technology to Iran. But Mr. Rumyantsev repeated Russia's view that the 1995 contract did not violate Moscow's treaty obligations because the plant is strictly civilian. (Reuters)

BRITAIN: EXPLOSION CLOSES REFINERY -- An explosion and fire closed most operations at a Conoco oil refinery in Humberside, in northeastern England. The blast, at the Killingholme refinery, which processes 200,000 barrels a day, shook houses four miles away and shot flames 200 feet high. The cause of the explosion, at a saturate gas plant, was not immediately known. Two people were injured, and it remained unclear how long the damaged units would be closed. Alan Cowell (NYT)

ITALY: BRIEF VACATION FOR POPE -- A weary but cheerful John Paul II recited a public prayer today at his villa south of Rome and then told the crowd to get out of the rain. "Go home," he said with a smile. "It's cold at Castel Gandolfo." The pope, 81 next month, is on a two-day rest after arduous Easter services. Alessandra Stanley (NYT)

FRANCE: CLOSER LOOK AT EUTHANASIA -- Responding to surveys showing unexpectedly wide support for mercy killing, Health Minister Bernard Kouchner called for a public debate on the subject. Dr. Kouchner, a physician who helped found the aid group Doctors Without Borders, plans a visit soon to the Netherlands, which last week became the first country to endorse mercy killing.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS; 
Bond Sell-Off Continues as Investors Reel In Expectations of Fed Cut

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Bond prices dropped sharply yesterday and yields rose as investors continued a selling spree that began slightly more than a week ago. The sell-off came as the stock market rallied and as many investors lowered expectations for interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.
 In the last six trading days, the yield on the Treasury's two-year note has jumped a third of a percentage point and is approaching 4.5 percent. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note has also jumped a third of a percentage point and is now at 5.25 percent. Despite the sell-off, interest rates remain relatively low. 
 The decline in Treasuries has also lowered other fixed-income markets, with investment-grade bonds and high-yield, or junk, bonds dropping sharply. The rising yield of the Treasury's 10-year note, which is the benchmark rate for many home mortgages, has also put a damper on refinancing in that market. In the last three weeks, the rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage has jumped to 7.07 percent from 6.83 percent.
Analysts do not attribute the flight from the bond market to any significant change in the outlook for the economy. In fact, new economic data released last week, including initial unemployment claims and consumer confidence, all pointed to slow growth, which is usually a positive for the bond market.
Instead, the sell-off came because the expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts got out of hand, analysts argued. After three rate cuts, of half a percentage point each, in January and March and after the stock market plunged into bear market territory, many investors decided that the Fed would continue to cut its short-term interest rate benchmark aggressively.
After the Fed's cut in March put the federal funds rate at 5 percent, some analysts predicted that the Fed would cut the rate again before its scheduled May meeting and then add another reduction in May and June that would bring the federal funds rate, which is the interest charged on overnight loans between banks, to 4 percent. Interest rates dropped in anticipation of such an event.
Now those expectations are being reeled in. "I think we were ahead of ourselves," said Thomas Connor, head government trader at J. P. Morgan Securities. The thought of another interest rate cut before Fed policy makers meet on May 15 has been dismissed. And investors, based on various market barometers yesterday, seemed to think that the Fed would eventually lower the federal funds rate to 4.25 percent instead of 4 percent.
A couple of other things have contributed to the shift. One is that the stock market, at least recently, has seemed to stabilize. And when stocks have rallied recently, bonds have been sold as some investors moved back into stocks. In addition, members of the Federal Reserve have made some relatively positive comments recently.
But after the stock market closed yesterday, Cisco Systems announced that its revenue for the quarter ending April 28 would plunge 30 percent compared with results in the period a year earlier. The company also said it would lay off 8,500 workers. If that news pushes stocks lower, it may rekindle interest in the bond market. 
But more important, interest rates had dropped so low -- with the Treasury's two-year note at 4.08 percent and the 10-year note at 4.78 percent -- that buying meant that an investor would have to bet that the Fed was going to be even more aggressive than the already overblown expectations and that the economy would slow more and the stock market would drop even more than expected.
"I don't know how much betting you want to do from the 4 percent level," Mr. Connor said of the previously expected 4 percent federal funds rate.
Ian C. Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, said he still expected disappointing economic news ahead as well as another drop in Treasury interest rates. He said Treasury yields were now "probably going too far in the other direction."
He said he expected that consumer confidence and consumer spending would decline further and that the housing market would soften.
In the Treasury market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 5.25 percent, from 5.16 percent on Thursday. The price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 22/32 , to 98 3/32 . The yield on the 30-year bond rose to 5.68 percent from 5.60 percent. Its price fell 13/32 , to 95 19/32 .
The yield on the Treasury's two-year note, which is a good indicator of investor expectations for Fed rate cuts, rose to 4.42 percent from 4.33 percent and is implying a fed funds rate closer to 4.25 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Port-au-Prince Journal; 
A Haitian Bank Takes Its Money to the Streets

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti 

 BODY:
Fritz Gerald Piquion may one day get that corner office at Sogebank, especially since his grandfather was one of the bank's founders. But he is intent on making it on his merits and not because of his relatives. For now, he has settled for the street corner as an office, making dozens of small loans to the vendors that pack Haiti's streets selling everything from pots and pans to shoes and food.
 Mr. Piquion is among several dozen loan officers at Sogesol, a division of Sogebank, Haiti's leading commercial bank, which has aggressively expanded into microfinance as it courts the struggling, self-employed people that make up more than 80 percent of Haiti's work force. The fact that someone with the connections and the options of Mr. Piquion, who has a finance degree from Bryant College in Rhode Island, chose to take to the streets and work with clients once shunned by banks indicates a huge shift as lenders realize the untapped potential in financing small entrepreneurs. 
 "I truly believe that is where the money of Haiti is, with the people," said Mr. Piquion, 23. "It's a reality check to sit in those chairs in the client's home and hear them tell you their problems and how this loan will help. I did not expect this at all. I came from college very young and full of ideas. Right now, I'm faced with reality."
Sogesol is not the first commercial bank to enter the field. It had been preceded by three other banks who themselves had built upon the success of smaller lending programs pioneered by nongovernmental organizations. Banks jumped in when Haitian regulators removed the cap on interest rates in the mid-1990's.
"Sogebank's involvement is confirmation that banks can do microlending and be profitable," said Robert Dressen, a consultant to the United States Agency for International Development. "The informal sector is so big and plays such a big part of the economy that the banks see it as something that they cannot ignore." While the small vendors trying to eke out a living were long overlooked, the fact that they still set up their wares in Port-au-Prince's jam-packed markets was a sign of hope and opportunity in Haiti's economic and political upheaval.
"So many people are unemployed in strict economic terms," said Fabrice Bosom, a consultant with Accion International, a network of microlenders in the United States and Latin America, which is advising Sogebank. "When you are unemployed you live out of opportunities, and living out of opportunities is being an entrepreneur. These are people who have survived the whole system collapsing. The fact they are standing shows they know how to manage stuff."
The loans start at about $100, and can work their way up to $3,000 over time as long as the borrower repays on time. Loan officers visit clients not only at the markets, but also at home to see how people live and what collateral they may have. Most put up appliances, inventory or even their beds for loans, since producing the necessary papers to prove home ownership would be difficult.
Most of the borrowers use the loans to buy merchandise, slowly expanding into new products. For some, one result has been increased business and a better life.
"I can feed my family better and help them," said Ghiselaine Ynelus, a former factory worker who sells wooden knickknacks at the Iron Market near Port-au-Prince's waterfront. "I take care of my sister and brother and send them to school."
For the bankers, the hours are long and the work difficult, but they are given incentives to enlist more clients. Many of them see the job as a steppingstone to more traditional banking jobs.
"This work is about character and the ability to communicate," said Laurette Orelia, who has the most clients of any Sogesol banker. "You should not be too nervous or reluctant to speak to somebody because they are dirty. You have to speak to anybody."
Most of the loan officers are women.
"They tend to be good communicators and tend to be more observant," said Valerie Kindt, a consultant with Accion. "We hire accountants. The problem is they tend to look only at the number at not at the client."
Pierre-Marie Boisson, the chief economist at Sogebank who shepherded the creation of Sogesol, said that while the donor-financed lending programs showed the potential, they did not have access to sufficient capital and were also not vigilant in making sure loans were repaid. That, he said, led to overly optimistic estimates of low default rates that were masked by donors covering up loan losses.
"We went into this to make a profit," he said. "When you get into this business with a so-called social approach, borrowers become aware of this. They believe you will have to understand them if they cannot pay because you are a social actor, and they will more easily default than with a commercial institution. You have to consider them as clients the same way as any commercial client."
Sogesol has yet to tally the success of its lending, but executives said it was the fastest growing division of the bank. They speak of ambitious plans to expand from their current 700 clients to 10,000 by the end of 2002.
"The key word is scale," Mr. Boisson said. "And to have scale you have to have the money. To have money, you can't stay in an NGO, you have to have access to funds."
Another advantage, executives said, was that with the backing of the bank, they could expand into other financial services, including insurance. 
By doing so, Mr. Boisson said, the bank was also sending a message to the business community.
"This is a revolution," he said. "By showing the rest of the private sector we can do business with small people in the street, this is a good sign of hope for the country. We can make money and be partners with them."

HEADLINE: HEALING A HOSPITAL: A special report.; 
Alternative Medicine for Ailing Institution

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

DATELINE: KITTANNING, Pa. 

 BODY:
Surgeons, the medical masters of the universe, are not noted for their willingness to cooperate. So it is no surprise that the operating room at Armstrong County Memorial Hospital used to stock five different hip joint implants, a favorite model for each of its orthopedic surgeons. Implant prices could range widely, from $4,000 to $6,000, and for years, no one seemed to care. 
 But that was before Armstrong, the only hospital in this rural and coal mining county 38 miles north of Pittsburgh, slid into a financial black hole and faced the likelihood of closing or being sold to outsiders. 
 After much discussion, the surgeons were persuaded to agree on one implant for nearly all procedures. The hospital was then able to get a discount and save $34,900 last year. A small step, but it was typical of the measures everyone at Armstrong has taken over the past several years to save the 186-bed hospital. 
There are thousands of small suburban and rural hospitals like Armstrong all over the country. They are integral parts of their communities -- and often the largest employers. When community hospitals close, hundreds of people in a small town can lose their jobs, town residents may defer important preventive care, and emergency care is often far less accessible.
But most community hospitals are in crisis, faced with decreased payments from insurers, weak management and inefficient technology. Two-thirds of the nation's hospitals are so financially feeble that they are unlikely to get financing for new technology that will be essential to their survival, said Richard Wade, vice president of the American Hospital Association. With the economy weakening, the picture is likely to darken.
More than 450 community hospitals closed in the 10 years from 1989 to 1998, about 8 percent of the total, according to the most recent count by the federal Department of Health and Human Services. Even so, most of the 4,900 that remain, including Armstrong, run with at least one in three beds empty, suggesting that still more will close. 
Armstrong stands out as a rare example of a hospital that has tackled these problems. Its story is a template for hospitals struggling to stay alive.

The Setting
Managed Care Arrives Late
Managed care came late to Armstrong, but the effects were seismic. Beginning in the early 1990's, insurance companies lowered payments and pressed for patients to be sent home from the hospital more quickly. Meanwhile, the number of patients admitted to the hospital declined as coal mines and factories closed and the Moonshine Mushroom Company, a major employer, shut down for several years. Some residents left in search of jobs; others put off obtaining care after they lost their insurance.
Adding to the pressures on the hospital's management, the United Steelworkers of America won elections in June 1994 to represent more than 600 nurses' aides, housekeepers and other nonprofessional employees at a time when there was no money for higher wages.
Worse yet, Medicare, which pays 61 percent of the hospital's bills, reclassified Armstrong County as a lower-cost area and reduced annual payments to the hospital by $1 million.
Management was slow in adjusting to the new pressures. Patients stayed 6.9 days, on average, in 1994. It would take three years to shorten stays to under five days, the national average, according to the Ingenix/ Center for Healthcare Industry Performance Studies. 
By mid-1994, the hospital found itself in violation of its debt agreements, forcing the board to call in an outside financial expert for help. Armstrong fired its chief executive, who had taken the job just as the bad news was snowballing, and hired a turnaround expert as an interim chief.
"I got there at Halloween 1994 -- it was an appropriate time," said George Hartnett of Modern Management Inc., a human resources consulting firm in Graylake, Ill., that was originally hired to try to stave off the unionization drive. 
"They were at death's door, frankly unable to continue," he said. "There were only a few days of cash left. The medical staff was unhappy. The board was dysfunctional. They were coming apart, and the community wanted to make sure their hospital stayed alive." 

The Cuts
Bitter Medicine For the Staff
In a matter of months, Mr. Hartnett cut all salaries 5 percent, dismissed 106 workers, including 50 registered nurses, and reduced employees' time off by one vacation week, one holiday and one personal day each. The Steelworkers union objected to the cuts at first but accepted them after a group of worried employees petitioned the National Labor Relations Board for withdrawal of recognition of the union. 
Mr. Hartnett also started a search for a new chief executive. Jack D. Hoard, a veteran of the Shriners' hospital chain, took over in December 1995. 
In turn, Mr. Hoard recruited Richard W. Szymkowski, a financial analyst with the New Jersey Hospital Association, who was brought in as chief financial officer in 1996 to clean up the hospital's books. "They hadn't put out a financial statement in three years," Mr. Szymkowski said. "I was the eighth C.F.O. in eight years," he said, including one in 1988 who was sentenced to six months in jail for skimming cash from the snack bar in the lobby.
The numbers were ugly. "We had no cash flow," Mr. Szymkowski said. "The balance sheet was weak; we had an operating loss of $2.2 million in 1995" on revenue from patients of $45 million. But from 1994 to the end of 1996, the hospital managed to reduce costs by $5.3 million, cutting payroll costs 15 percent and materials and supply costs 7.5 percent, even as the flow of patients picked up.
Contracts with doctors were reviewed and tightened to make sure they provided the consulting and other services they were supposed to. Bills to Medicare and managed care companies were checked for accuracy and completeness, eventually cutting more than five weeks from the average time the hospital waited to receive payments. The number of board members was cut to 13 from 27, and those remaining were given a training course in governance and strategic planning. 

The Plan
Trying to Cater To Rural Needs
Building on a survey of county residents' health needs, the new board drafted a strategic business plan. Rural hospitals need to provide a broader array of services than small suburban hospitals, but they cannot offer everything a major medical center has. "We try not to go outside our core competency," Mr. Hoard said -- primary care, general surgery, routine cancer therapy, cardiology, and CAT and M.R.I. scans.
So the new board decided to withdraw an application for state approval to conduct open-heart surgery. "You need high-powered technical people, follow-up caregivers," he said. "It's a big gamble, a different ballgame."
Armstrong broke off merger talks with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in the mid-1990's, insisting on keeping local control. "We were afraid we would end up just a first aid station," said Elizabeth White, a businesswoman -- mining and livestock -- with deep family roots in the county who later became chairwoman of the board. 
But Dr. Kathy Selvaggi, an award-winning oncologist recruited to run the cancer center at Armstrong, brought expertise and prestige as a faculty member of the Cancer Institute of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. 
Expanding local services, the hospital hired salaried doctors to operate primary care centers around the county. Those doctors wound up referring many of the sicker patients they saw to Armstrong.
One was Dr. Joseph A. Cippel Jr., a family physician who is medical director of the hospital's primary care center at Elderton, a hamlet 18 miles away. "I see 25 patients a day," he said, "nuts and bolts family medicine, lots of diabetes, heart disease, mental health issues, depression, alcoholism. A lot of farm people, mining accidents. 
"Yesterday, I had a guy who was putting in roof bolts in a mine and a big boulder fell on his hand." 
Tawni Samosky of Rural Valley, Pa., drives 12 miles with her three young children to the Elderton clinic, even though the hospital is closer. "We know all the nurses here," she said. "If I have questions, I can get right through." 
Just as Ms. Samosky prefers Elderton to the hubbub of Kittanning, population 4,838, many local people "have never been to Pittsburgh and have no desire to go," Dr. Selvaggi said. 
At Armstrong itself, the hospital recruited three obstetricians, including the first woman obstetrician on its staff. "They brought the obstetrics wing into the 21st century," said Dr. Harold Altman, a pediatrician. 
Sandra Falsetti, whose son Anthony was born two years and eight months ago, before the makeover, was delighted with the changes when she returned to Armstrong in February to give birth to Katheryn. 
"The difference is astronomical," she said. "Now it's like your own bedroom: hardwood cabinets and floors, dim lighting from regular lamps, the TV in an entertainment center." 
Armstrong also renovated its emergency room, opened a center for elderly diabetes patients who often need special care for wounds and started a pain clinic operated by anesthesiologists.
A group of pulmonary specialists was recruited to treat former coal miners for black lung disease. "People tend to be ill but they tend to live forever here," said Mrs. White, the board chairwoman.

The Future
Economic Worries And Other Problems
There is still much to accomplish. Now that it is no longer so short of cash, the hospital, a sprawling three-story complex in an industrial park on the edge of this Allegheny River town, is reviewing bids for a new $4.5 million electronic system to handle billing and, it hopes, link with a new system to transmit patients' medical records from the hospital to doctors in their offices. 
Armstrong's current information system was not designed to deal with managed care or to keep track of the hospital's home care and clinic patients. So there are three separate systems that "don't talk to each other," Mr. Szymkowski said. 
"We live and die by the quality of our information systems," Mr. Hoard added.
But like those in every hospital, the new system must meet new federal privacy and security standards, a requirement that is expected to cost Armstrong as much as $2.5 million.
Prescription drugs, medical devices and hospital supplies remain nagging problems. "Pharmacy costs are killing us," Mr. Szymkowski said. "In some cases we had to tell physicians that we can't afford the new drugs they want." In an attempt to slow the spiral, Armstrong Memorial joined a Pittsburgh medical center purchasing group in 1996, but that proved largely unsuccessful. The hospital is now considering hiring a doctor of pharmacy to attack the cost problem. 
Standardizing supplies is another cost-cutting target. Although Armstrong has simplified its purchases of hip replacements, it is only now merging the operating room's supplies into the hospital's central supply room. 
The economic outlook is a worry for Armstrong and other hospitals. If the slowdown increases, the number of uninsured patients could increase, raising costs.
Relations with doctors have improved over the last several years, according to Dr. D. Wesley Minteer, a family practice osteopath and quality control specialist. "The major battles are fairly well over," he said. 
But the nursing staff, the essential heart of any hospital, is still feeling stress, according to several physicians and a union of registered nurses affiliated with the Pennsylvania State Education Association. The nurses held a one-day strike March 22, forcing the hospital to temporarily shut down almost two-thirds of its beds.
Most employees who were dismissed in 1995 were rehired, and revenue from patients climbed back to $53.8 million last year from $45 million that year. Cuts in pay and vacations were gradually restored and nurses have had two further raises. Earlier this month, the nurses ratified an agreement with the hospital that called for 3 percent raises for each of two years, some higher increases for more senior nurses, and limits on mandatory overtime in return for reduced family health coverage. The agreement will add $380,000 to operating costs.
But keeping nurses is still a problem. Armstrong recently hired a nurse recruiter, but offers of signing bonuses and retention bonuses "were not effective," said Joyce A. Shanty, a registered nurse who is the hospital's vice president for patient services. 
Improving relations with walk-in patients is another "work in progress," Mr. Hoard said. "The lobby is a zoo at times," he said. To try to "make it more user-friendly," Mr. Hoard said, two "greeters" were hired to check on patients' appointment times and help with directions.

The Street
Financial Rating Has Bounced Back
Armstrong's improvements have been noted as far away as Wall Street. In 1994, when the hospital was running out of gas, Moody's Investor's Service, the Wall Street credit rating firm, reduced Armstrong's rating to junk bond status and pushed it lower still in 1995. Then, as the turnaround took hold and cash flow improved, Moody's raised the rating in 1996 and again in 1998. Last November, it restored Armstrong's debt to investment grade. 
Chris White, a hospital analyst at Moody's, said Armstrong was one of only 12 hospitals in the country whose ratings were raised last year, while 56 had their ratings lowered. 
In 1995, Armstrong County lost $2.2 million running the hospital; in three of the last four years, there were surpluses, Mr. Szymkowski said. Profit margins rose to 4.2 percent in 1999 and 2000, healthy for many hospitals, although well below the 8.9 percent average for the nation's strongest rural hospitals.
Mr. Szymkowski is not ready to let up. With the national economy weakening, a new administration in Washington and Medicare again an issue in Congress, "the rate of change is rising," he said.
"We're trying to stay ahead of that curve."

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 While it is vital to promote economic cooperation between China and the United States (editorial, April 15), critical factors in solidifying a stable and lasting relationship are mutual respect and understanding between the people of the two countries. 
 One of the most effective ways to achieve these goals is through the appreciation of the arts and cultures of the two nations. Both sides should significantly increase efforts in that regard through education, entertainment, mass media and exchanges. The United States, with its superior economic means, should lead this initiative.

HEADLINE: WARNING BY CISCO, AN INTERNET TITAN 

BYLINE:  By By ALEX BERENSON and CHRIS GAITHER 

 BODY:
Offering fresh evidence that economic growth is slowing notably, Cisco Systems said yesterday that its sales and profit were falling far short of expectations. Cisco, whose startling success in the 1990's mirrored the rise of the Internet, blamed a worldwide economic slowdown for its problems.
 The boom in communications and information technology spending, which powered the United States economy in the late 90's, has ended in painful retreat for Cisco and other technology companies that a few months ago could seemingly do no wrong. 
 Cisco's equipment undergirds much of the Internet, and over the last decade it has grown from a tiny start-up in San Jose, Calif., to a corporate titan. At its peak a year ago, Cisco, which leads the market for routers, computers that manage data traffic on a network, was briefly the world's most valuable company. In March 2000, its market capitalization reached a peak of $560 billion, more than those of General Motors, Citigroup and Wal-Mart combined. 
But now Cisco, which as late as last fall was reporting quickly rising sales, is shrinking faster than it grew.
The company estimated yesterday that its sales for the quarter ending April 30 would be about $4.7 billion, 30 percent lower than in the previous three months. And Cisco warned not to expect a quick rebound, predicting that sales would fall again next quarter, ending July 31.
With revenue declining so rapidly, Cisco has been caught with big surpluses of its equipment. The company said that for accounting purposes it would reduce the value of inventory by $2.5 billion this quarter, including $500 million in partly completed equipment and $2 billion of raw materials like computer chips. The accounting procedure, known as a write-down, reflects Cisco's belief that it will not be able to sell the equipment for as much as it once expected.
"This may be the fastest any industry our size has ever decelerated," John Chambers, the company's chief executive, said in a statement.
In a conference call later, Mr. Chambers compared the slowdown to a 100-year flood, adding that the economic challenges confronting the network equipment industry are proof that "a 100-year flood can happen in your lifetime." 
"We never built models to anticipate something of this magnitude," he said.
Shares of Cisco, which ended regular trading yesterday down 78 cents, at $17.20, with the announcement fell as low as $15.90 after hours. Other big technology stocks, like Sun Microsystems and Intel, also fell in late trading, indicating that the Nasdaq composite index may well open sharply lower this morning. Cisco has now fallen about 80 percent from its all-time high, erasing more than $400 billion in wealth, actual or on paper.
Most of Cisco's sales are in the United States, where the recent economic slowdown has been most pronounced. But the company said that problems appeared to be spreading worldwide. 
"Cisco is seeing weakness in Korea, Taiwan, Australia and Japan," the company said in its statement. "In Europe, Cisco is also experiencing weakness."
In addition to the inventory writedown, Cisco will set aside $800 million to $1.2 billion to cover the cost of laying off employees, closing offices and marking down other assets. The company, which said in March that it would lay off 8,000 employees, raised the figure to 8,500 yesterday. Cisco now employs about 44,000 workers, Mr. Chambers said.
Cisco said that its profit for the current quarter would fall well short of expectations. Excluding the one-time charges, it said it would report only a small profit. Analysts had expected the company to earn about $700 million.
Including the various write-offs, Cisco will lose about $3 billion in the current quarter, more than it made in all of last year.
Last year, Cisco lost sales because it could not keep up with demand for its products, Mr. Chambers said. To make sure that it would not miss out on more sales, the company rapidly built up its inventories last fall, just as demand from customers slowed sharply, he acknowledged. 
"When demand dropped this year, what might have been a four-month supply suddenly became 12 months," Mr. Chambers said.
Just a few months ago, Wall Street analysts estimated that Cisco would sell almost $9 billion in equipment in the May-July period. Now the company expects sales of $4.2 billion to $4.7 billion.
Underlying Cisco's problems is a broad slowdown in business spending on capital equipment, especially information technology equipment. Communications companies like AT&T and Qwest, which have spent hundreds of billions of dollars since 1995 to build fiber optic networks capable of carrying vast amounts of data and Internet traffic around the world, have found themselves locked in fierce price wars and are cutting back on spending.
At the same time, many big corporations have already built internal communications networks, and with economic growth slowing, they are not rushing to upgrade.
"There's been a slowdown in capital spending," Mr. Chambers said. "As their business begins to decrease, they've got to bring their expenses in line with their revenues."
He said he expected spending on communications equipment to hit bottom eventually, then begin rising again by 30 to 50 percent a year, its growth rate for the last decade. But he could not predict when that might happen.
Paul Sagawa of Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, one of the first Wall Street analysts to predict that the bubble in technology investments might burst, offered a gloomier outlook, saying that he saw no near-term reason to expect improvement.
But Richard Shannon of Epoch Partners, an investment bank in San Francisco, said some of Cisco's competitors, like Juniper Networks, were more focused and might be able to escape Cisco's problems.

HEADLINE: ING Closes Operation in Venezuela 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, April 16 

 BODY:
ING Barings, the investment banking arm of ING Groep, the largest Dutch financial services company, shut down its trading desk in Venezuela today.
 The Venezuelan office's three traders, who bought and sold currency and bonds, quit last week and more employees may be laid off, said Bert Denkers, ING's country manager for Venezuela. 
 "The Venezuela office will now only focus on corporate finance and advisory services," Mr. Denkers said. "We won't do local business anymore." 
ING Groep said in January said that it would lay off 1,000 people at ING Barings, half of them in London, 200 in the United States and 300 in the rest of the world, because of competition from Wall Street firms like the Goldman Sachs Group and Merrill Lynch & Company. 
"Venezuela is part of the implementation of a new global strategy," Mr. Denkers said. "We've had to do this in Ecuador, Chile, Colombia and a number of countries in the Far East." 
Mr. Denkers said the poor performance of the Venezuelan economy, which contracted 6.1 percent in 1999 before rebounding last year with 3.2 percent growth, also played a part in the decision to scale back operations. 
"The economy of Venezuela has not done well over the last two to three years," Mr. Denkers said, explaining the company's decision.

HEADLINE: Bank of America's First-Quarter Profit Decreased 17% 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: CHARLOTTE, N.C., April 16 

 BODY:
The Bank of America Corporation said today that its first-quarter profit fell 17 percent as the company increased its bad-debt reserve and wrote off more uncollectible loans.
 Profit dropped to $1.87 billion, or $1.15 a share, compared with $2.24 billion, or $1.33 a share, in the period a year earlier. 
 Analysts had expected Bank of America to earn $1.12 a share, according to Thomson Financial/ First Call. 
As the economy has slowed over the last year, more customers have been unable to pay back debt, prompting the bank to write off the bad loans and increase its cushion against further losses.
The falling stock market also cut into the bank's profit as it posted a $416 million decline in its equity investments.
"We do expect to see higher levels of nonperforming assets at least over the next couple of quarters," James Hance, the company's chief financial officer, told investors and analysts on a conference call. "We think we have adequate reserves to deal with what's coming at us."
The company's loan-loss provisions almost doubled, to $835 million from the $420 million it set aside in the first quarter last year. In the fourth quarter, the company set aside $1.21 billion after a handful of large corporate customers ran into financial trouble.
Bank of America wants to lift profit by increasing investment-banking business 20 percent in the next two years. As part of the plan, the bank is reducing less-profitable lending by turning down requests to renew $20 billion of loans over the next 18 months.
Mr. Hance said the bank was able to sell $350 million in bad loans in the quarter.
The bank wrote off $772 million in uncollectible loans, up from $420 million in the first quarter last year. It wrote off $1.08 billion in bad loans in the fourth quarter in 2000. The bank said $243 million of the first-quarter increase in those losses came from its United States commercial loan portfolio.
Bank of America said it had $5.6 billion of bad loans in the first quarter, compared with $3.3 billion a year earlier.
The company, which is based in Charlotte, said that net interest income -- the money the bank makes from lending -- rose 3 percent, to $4.72 billion on a fully taxable basis from the period a year earlier.
Noninterest income, which Bank of America collects on service charges, investment banking fees and equity investments, fell 7 percent, to $3.78 billion from the first quarter last year.
Consumer and commercial banking earned $1.09 billion in the first quarter, up 14 percent from $954 million in the period a year earlier.
Shares of Bank of America fell 50 cents, to $52.45.

PERSON: Frank Annunzio 

HEADLINE: Frank Annunzio, 86, Longtime Chicago Democratic Congressman 

BYLINE:  By IRVIN MOLOTSKY 

 BODY:
Former Representative Frank Annunzio, who championed such diverse causes as the survival of the neighborhood savings and loan and the minting of commemorative coins to raise money for civic projects, died on April 8 at his home in Lincolnwood, Ill., a Chicago suburb. He was 86.
 Mr. Annunzio, a Democrat, represented Chicago for 28 years in the House, first the Seventh Congressional District and then the 11th. He rose to leadership positions on the former Banking Committee, which he used to support savings and loan associations, even as they ran into financial problems in the 1980's that caused many of them to fail. 
 In an interview in Crain's Chicago Business in 1988, Mr. Annunzio said the institutions were essential providers of home mortgages, adding, "Whatever it takes to save the industry we have to be prepared to do."
Curtis Prins, who was his principal aide for many years, said Mr. Annunzio played important roles in arranging the financial package that helped New York City weather its financial crisis in the 1970's, in granting federal loans that assured the survival of the Chrysler Corporation and in minting commemorative coins that helped finance the restoration of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island.
Mr. Annunzio was born in 1915 in the Little Italy section of Chicago to parents who had come from the region of Calabria, in Italy, and in his career in the House he advocated many Italian-American causes, including the declaration of Columbus Day as a national holiday. 
In his youth, he was a shoeshine boy at Hull House, the social services institution founded by Jane Addams, to help support his family.
In 1935, Mr. Annunzio married Angeline Alesia, who died in 1996. He is survived by three daughters, Jackie Lato, Linda O'Donnell and Susan Annunzio, all of Chicago; seven grandchildren; and 11 great-grandchildren.
Mr. Annunzio taught civics and history in the Chicago public schools and worked on the staff of the United Steelworkers Union.
Before being elected to Congress in 1964, he served as director of the Illinois Department of Labor.
Representative Jim Leach, the Iowa Republican who served on the Banking Committee with him, said that Mr. Annunzio was "one of the last true characters in Congress."
Mr. Leach recalled a hearing on red-lining, the practice that banks use to block off neighborhoods where they will not grant mortgages. Arthur F. Burns, then the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, was the main witness.
"I'm sitting there," Mr. Leach said, "and all the sudden Frank is screaming at Burns, 'You're guilty of red-lining! Stop red-lining Italy!' I didn't know Frank Annunzio at the time and I didn't know he wasn't serious."
Mr. Leach added: "Congress is a body of more homogeneity than one should expect, and Frank stands out as one of the real characters -- an individual who spoke his piece in his own way, which generally involved a greater twinkle than a reading of any script would seem possible."
Another example of Mr. Annunzio's eccentricity came in a committee meeting in which he was trying to gain approval of an amendment. He had an aide turn on a recording of "Stars and Stripes Forever," Crain's Chicago Business reported, while he waved an American flag.
"We passed the amendment," Mr. Annunzio noted.

HEADLINE: Germany and Its Leader Achieving New Stature 

BYLINE:  By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: BERLIN, April 16 

 BODY:
Michael Naumann, a former member of the German cabinet, was dining recently with Chancellor Gerhard Schroder when a newspaper was placed on the table. Above the headline, "When Dwarfs Grow," was a photograph of the chancellor. Seeing it, Mr. Schroder joked, "I'm not that small, am I?"
 In fact, the dwarf in question was not the chancellor, who is of modest stature by his country's standards but far from that short. Rather it was his country, a nation long referred to in the postwar years as "an economic giant but a political dwarf." Germany, under Mr. Schroder, is indeed assuming a new dimension. 
 Entering the last 18 months of his four-year term, the chancellor has established a reasonable claim to be Europe's most successful politician of the moment. He has changed Germany's political landscape, governing as a center-right leader on a center-left ticket and thus disarming both the conservative opposition and the labor unions. 
His ascendancy, helped by Berlin's position at the center of an undivided Continent, has been furthered by the travails of Prime Minister Tony Blair with the outbreak of mad cow disease, and the growing political paralysis in France caused by the rivalry between the Gaullist president, Jacques Chirac, and the Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin. Of the three major European powers, Germany appears the most agile and dynamic.
A Social Democrat, Mr. Schroder has forsaken -- in public, at least -- the big Havana cigars that were a symbol of his first troubled months in office. He has advertised the fact that he will give up his big villa in Berlin for a small apartment in the new Chancellery while working hard to modernize the country. His image now -- and it plays well -- is of a man of the people.
Most important, perhaps, Mr. Schroder has come to symbolize a new German way of looking at the world, that of the so-called "Berlin Republic." It is, in the words of Claus Leggewie, a sociologist, "a little more assertive, a little less in America's pocket, driven by Realpolitik rather than romantic ideas about Atlanticism or Europe."
Former Chancellor Helmut Kohl's increasingly aloof style and hymns to European unity are gone. In their place, there is a chancellor who regularly deploys his seductive voice to considerable advantage on television and calls, as he did this month, for Germany to engage with Russia "without illusions, without sentimentality" and "without denying our considerable respective interests."
No illusions, no sentimentality, a clear avowal of German interests: Schroderism at work. Germans, if polls are to be trusted, like this new and less self-effacing image. Mr. Schroder is regularly voted the country's most popular politician; the Social Democrats lead the Christian Democrats by about five percentage points.
Last week, between visits to the United States and Russia, he took aim at the country's generous welfare system, declaring that Germans had "no right to laziness." It was the comment of man confident that he has a new political base in the business-dominated right as well as in Social Democracy's traditional bastions of labor and public employees.
Clouds could still gather. The economy is slowing and is now expected to grow about 2.1 percent this year rather than the 2.7 percent predicted earlier by Mr. Schroder. That will make it difficult for the government to reach its target of reducing unemployment to 3.5 million from the current 3.8 million (9.3 percent of the labor force) by the election in the fall of 2002.
Young German professionals who had discovered the Nasdaq and its German cousin, the Neue Markt, have taken a big hit. Their mood has soured. Even modest German families that, encouraged by the government, had ventured into the stock market have suffered.
"Some people saw Deutsche Telekom as a kind of guaranteed state obligation," said Frank-Walter Steinmayer, the chancellor's chief of staff, referring to Germany's largest privatized telecommunications company, whose stock has plunged. "Now they say there were exploited."
Such bitterness could alienate voters from Mr. Schroder. The electorate here, as elsewhere in Europe, is more volatile than ever because traditional structures that dictated voting patterns -- families, the church, unions -- have loosened or faded.
"This is now an individualistic electorate," said Mr. Leggewie, the sociologist. "They're not just bowling alone; they're voting alone."
But the Schroder team is confident that it can hold its lead. Mr. Steinmayer, a lawyer and the man responsible for imposing discipline on a government whose first year in office often seemed wildly erratic, noted that the Christian Democrats, still in disarray after the revelations that they received huge secret donations during Mr. Kohl's tenure, had not yet decided who will lead them into the next election.
Some of that confusion stems from Mr. Schroder's artful occupation of traditional conservative terrain: tax cuts, a measure of deregulation and the importance of the family, highlighted in a recent series of speeches. And not least is the definition of a new German power whose central position in Europe is no longer a burden but a boon because the country, for the first time in its modern history, is surrounded by allies.
In an article published this month in the weekly Die Zeit, Mr. Schroder gave an interesting insight into the outlook of this new Germany. He described its very active relations with Russia -- the chancellor and President Vladimir V. Putin have met four times in the last nine months -- as "European Ostpolitik."
Ostpolitik was the policy, initiated three decades ago by Chancellor Willy Brandt, of detente toward Communist East Germany and, where possible, its masters in Moscow. By extending the term to Europe in a post-cold-war setting, Mr. Schroder indicated that Germany would act in Europe's name in reaching out to Mr. Putin's Russia and preventing any new division of the Continent.
Scarcely the foreign policy of a "dwarf" -- especially when Mr. Schroder made clear in the same article that he saw himself acting as a mediator between the new American administration and Mr. Putin.
"Russian-American relations may find themselves in difficult waters as a result of the missile shield debate," he wrote in Die Zeit. "Reason enough for Germany to take up a clear position in its Russian policy."
If Germany's NATO commitment is not in question, it is equally certain that the chancellor feels a personal empathy with Mr. Putin -- who speaks excellent German -- that he has not yet established with President Bush, several aides close to Mr. Schroder said.
To observe his recent discovery of the pleasures of foreign policy, after an initial two years dedicated mainly to domestic questions, has been to observe a typically Schroder-like dance: three steps to the left toward Mr. Putin, two steps back to Mr. Bush and Atlanticism, a nod to German "national interests," a quick deferential bow to Germany's European obligations.
In truth, Germany has a leader who increasingly has revealed himself as a very adept manager, alert to the need to press the right buttons in an image-driven age. On his visit this month to Russia, he defended press freedoms in an interview on Ekho Moskvy, a sister radio station to the embattled NTV media group.
But then he added that in his views on liberty of the press, "I agree with President Putin." It was a bamboozling performance, but not ineffective, and representative of a chancellor whose nobler instincts are always tempered by an intense pragmatism.
Mr. Steinmayer, who has worked with Mr. Schroder since his days as governor of Lower Saxony in Hanover, says it was the chancellor's "embrace of modernity" that was most striking and fascinating. As governor, Mr. Schroder served on the board of Volkswagen, based in the state, and clearly learned much there about management, the global economy and making decisions.
But what is "modernity" in a German context? Mr. Steinmayer suggested that it was "saying goodbye to the idea that the economy is shaped above all by the ideas of labor unions -- a difficult process that we are still in; a certain charisma combined with a closeness to the people; quick thinking."
Not a bad summary of Schroderism, perhaps the most clinical of modern political philosophies. Mr. Naumann, the former top cultural official and now editor of Die Zeit, added that the chancellor was masterful in co-opting opponents.
It is indeed notable that in two delicate fields -- negotiations on compensation for Nazi-era slave laborers and on a new immigration law -- Mr. Schroder has reached out to a Free Democrat, Otto Lambsdorff, and a Christian Democrat, Rita Sussmuth, to lead the discussions. He likes to have friends in many places.
At the end of this month, Mr. Schroder will move into the vast new chancellery built on the banks of the River Spree. It is not a place built for a dwarf. Nor is it unrepresentative of Mr. Schroder's Germany and his own subtly articulated ambitions.

HEADLINE: Learning What Fuel to Burn 

BYLINE:  By Burton Richter; Burton Richter, director emeritus of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1976.

DATELINE: STANFORD, Calif. 

 BODY:
Like nearly all scientists, I believe that global warming is the most serious environmental threat on the horizon for our grandchildren, and that carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning is a major contributor to it. Yet I agree with President Bush that we must go slow on regulating carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. That is why we have to fall back on research on alternative energy sources and on energy conservation -- the two approaches that will help us achieve some reductions in carbon dioxide emissions in the near term. But Mr. Bush's proposed budget cuts for research and conservation move in precisely the wrong direction.
 It is clear that the earth's temperatures are rising, and world energy use is projected to double in the next 50 years, making the problem much worse. But something else is also evident: We are simply not ready to regulate carbon dioxide from power plants -- the leading source of industrial carbon dioxide emissions. There is no technology to do it with our present mix of fuels, despite the fervent wish of many environmentalists. What we need instead is a long-term strategy to reduce the use of carbon-based fuels. 
 Only nuclear power generation, which does not emit carbon dioxide, is available now as a large-scale alternative. Hydropower and wind and geothermal energy are clean but naturally limited. Biomass energy from growing and burning plants emits no net carbon dioxide (carbon in the plant comes from carbon dioxide in the atmosphere), but will be limited by the availability of water for growing crops. Solar energy is useful at the moment only for small-scale applications because no practical system yet exists for storing it for use at night or in bad weather. Natural gas, more efficient at producing energy than coal, is currently in short supply.
Given these existing constraints, government should support research and development of new ways of producing and using energy -- more efficient power sources for transportation, like fuel cells, for example; carbon-free energy sources, like more advanced nuclear power plants and effective solar power systems; underground gasification of coal. We should also be promoting efficiency regulations on things that use energy -- for example, air conditioners. The Bush administration's decision to reduce air conditioner efficiency goals last week was a senseless reversal.
The president has also promised a long-term energy strategy, and it is in the long term that the government can make a greater difference. The fundamental, harder job is to tilt the economic playing field in our market economy to make carbon-free energy more attractive to both producers and consumers. The genius of the market system lies in its ability to mobilize the best of our industrial capacity to pursue new approaches in the hope of economic gain.
A sensible way to tilt the field is with a carbon tax that would decrease the profits of users of carbon-based fuels and increase them for users of alternatives. An added excise tax on vehicles based on their fuel efficiency would also help achieve this goal. In fact, expanded economic incentives, like tax breaks, for the deployment of more efficient systems of all types would help us move faster toward curbing our dependence on carbon-based fuels.
Some say such policies would damage our economy. I doubt it. Some businesses would be hurt, but when the automobile replaced the horse, livery stables, blacksmiths and buggy manufacturers were hurt while the economy boomed. But in a democracy like ours, it is hard to do anything that goes against vested interests until a crisis is upon us.
The scientific community knows the global warming crisis is here, and the longer we wait the harder it becomes to fix the problem. The effects will be felt more strongly by our grandchildren than by us, and they are too young to do anything about it. It will require effective political leadership to get us moving in the right direction. Mr. Bush's cuts for both conservation and research on carbon-free energy are not a good sign. The government needs to reverse course before more crucial time is lost.

HEADLINE: Despite Appearances, Whitman Says She and Bush Agree on Environment 

BYLINE:  By MELINDA HENNEBERGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 16 

 BODY:
The Environmental Protection Agency's new administrator, Christie Whitman, had no trouble connecting with her audience at a recent meeting of the Business Roundtable, a group of corporate executives, as she promised that the agency's history of "banging heads" was a thing of the past.
 And her bluntly antiregulatory message undercut the notion that Mrs. Whitman was at least a moderately gung-ho green who had been hung out to dry by her president. 
 That impression had taken hold after President Bush, responding to pressures from the energy industry, broke a campaign pledge to put a cap on power plants' emissions of carbon dioxide, right after she had talked up his intention to control that greenhouse gas. Then, after she urged him "to appear engaged" on controlling global warming, the administration decided instead to write the obituary of the Kyoto Protocol, the international treaty on climate change. 
Even some environmental advocates were starting to pity Mrs. Whitman's supposed isolation.
"It's been a pretty rough ride," said Greg Wetstone of the Natural Resources Defense Council. "She's probably suffered one of the most immediate and embarrassing eviscerations of a new cabinet secretary ever."
Mr. Wetstone said he had been willing to re-evaluate the Bush administration if it regulated carbon dioxide, "which is amazing because I'm a little cynical from doing this for a long time."
"I felt like such a fool," Mr. Wetstone said.
Like other environmentalists, he seemed to assume that Mrs. Whitman felt the fool, too. But in a recent interview in her office, she argued that she had felt nothing at all after learning of the president's reversal.
"It had nothing to do with me personally," she said. Conceding that she "had been in a different place" at first, she said she had come to accept the president's view that such regulation would be too costly to the economy and to consumers.
"He was right, all things considered," Mrs. Whitman said. "We're in an energy crisis, no two ways about it."
She never considered resigning, she said.
"New Jersey was good training; we've got a lot of cranky people," she said. "I just decided to do the best I could on the facts and stay away from reading the columnists."
Yet she would leave, she said, if she ever truly felt "out of sync" with the president; "that hasn't happened yet," she said firmly.
Allies in New Jersey say she differs with the president less on policy than on the politics of decisions that have been viewed as unfriendly to the environment. And friends suggest that Mrs. Whitman is in general far less liberal than her reputation, earned mainly on the basis of her support for abortion rights.
"She's done some very socially conservative things; her record is not liberal," said her best friend, Nancy Risque Rohrbach, director of the National Museum of Women in the Arts, who has known Mrs. Whitman, 54, since their first year out of college, when they were both working for the Republican National Committee. "She defies labels."
Environmentalists in New Jersey would agree; groups pushing for more environmental regulation generally considered her "good on the green, bad on the brown," because she expanded the state's open space, but cut enforcement of air and water quality standards, abolished an environmental prosecutor's office and eased reporting rules for companies that handle toxic materials.
In the interview, she defended a proposed 6.4 percent cut in the Environmental Protection Agency's budget, though environmentalists say it will probably mean layoffs among those responsible for enforcing environmental standards. "We haven't been cut," she said. Only superfluous congressionally mandated programs were being trimmed, she said.
At the meeting of the Business Roundtable, a closed event that a reporter seemed to have been invited to by accident and then was asked to leave before a question-and-answer period began, Mrs. Whitman seemed completely comfortable echoing Mr. Bush's pro-business philosophy.
She opened her chummy talk this way: "I hope you all had a successful day today and did the appropriate lobbying with the right senators."
"When the president says he wants to look at government as a partnership" with private enterprise, "he really means it," she told the executives, though it is hard to imagine who among them might have remained unconvinced of his sincerity on this point.
She sounded thoroughly opposed to regulation when she said, "While it's true that mandatory controls may have been necessary in the beginning, attitudes have changed, and we recognize that at the E.P.A."
Of her decision to review the Clinton administration's regulations cutting the amount of naturally occurring arsenic that would be allowed in municipal drinking water, she said she "did that with no pressure from the White House, no pressure from interest groups." The Clinton rule, which environmentalists say is necessary to protect the public's health, was opposed by the mining industry and some municipalities, which argued that its costs were prohibitive.
Mrs. Whitman has said elsewhere that once the administration studies the matter, it may well adopt a more stringent arsenic standard than the one adopted under Mr. Clinton.
But at the Business Roundtable, she said explicitly that she was concerned about how cutting arsenic levels might affect business: "The impact is enormous on small and mid-sized water companies. We are going to take another look and see what it is we have to do to avoid unintended consequences."
Environmentalists are increasingly disillusioned. As Dan Weiss, former political director of the Sierra Club, put it: "Another day, another environmental standard wrecked. This is worse than under Reagan."
Paul Begala, a former Clinton aide who worked for Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey in his losing campaign against Mrs. Whitman in 1993, said he had not been surprised by decisions. "She always struck me as the consummate country club politician," Mr. Begala said. "I never had a sense she had any passion except for tax cuts, so I guess she fits right in with this administration. It's, 'Let them drink Perrier.' "
But Ms. Rohrbach suggested that the former governor was not only tough enough but also ambitious enough to handle the criticism.
"Long ago, when we were young, she knew she wanted to be governor," Ms. Rohrbach said. 
Though she is naturally reserved, it was Christie Todd who asked her future husband, John Whitman, out on their first date, because she needed an escort to the Nixon inauguration. Mr. Whitman's grandfather, Charles S. Whitman, became governor of New York in 1915. And both John and Christie were so sure of her political future that Mr. Whitman's drive to succeed in business was in part fueled by a desire to "put the kids through school and still be able to fill in for Christie when she ran for office," Ms. Rohrbach said.
In the interview, where Mrs. Whitman was crisp and correct, keeping on her wool jacket after noting that it was 89 degrees outside, the worst part of her job now, she said, was actually "being away from my husband after 27 years." Mr. Whitman is a financial consultant in New Jersey.
Asked to characterize her tenure so far, she had to laugh. "A roller coaster, shall we say?"
In nearly every talk she gives, Mrs. Whitman says she grew up caring for the environment because she was reared on a farm -- an extremely lovely farm, in Oldwick, N.J. Her father, Webster B. Todd, was a wealthy Republican state chairman and her mother, Eleanor Schley Todd, was vice chairwoman of the Republican National Committee.
Though it is unclear where Mrs. Whitman expects to go next, for now she seems determined to stick around and figure something out.
Meanwhile, she is asking environmental advocates to wait and see what proposals this administration may yet come up with before judging it, and her, too harshly. "He desperately wants to be proactive," she said of the president. "He hates being on the defensive."
As, of course, does Mrs. Whitman. For the record, she is not accepting condolences for her career just yet. "If one more person says, 'You have the toughest job in the cabinet, . . .' " she says, near the end of an hour-long interview. And for the first time, she showed real exasperation.

Cisco Issues a Warning On Its Sales and Earnings
Offering fresh evidence that economic growth is slowing sharply, Cisco Systems said that its sales and profits were falling far short of expectations. Cisco, whose stunning success in the 1990's mirrored the rise of the Internet, cited a worldwide economic slowdown as the reason for its problems.
 "This may be the fastest any industry our size has ever decelerated," John Chambers, the company's chief executive, said in a statement. In a conference call later, Mr. Chambers compared the slowdown to a 100-year flood. "We never built models to anticipate something of this magnitude," he said. Page A1. 

Citigroup Posts 8% Decline in Profit
Citigroup, the nation's largest financial services company, reported an 8 percent decline in first-quarter earnings as it failed to cut expenses fast enough to offset the sinking value of its investments and a rising level of loans going bad. But Citigroup's results surpassed analysts' expectations. C2.

Bank of America said that its first-quarter profit fell 17 percent as the company increased its bad-debt reserve and wrote off more uncollectable loans. C2.

The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.82 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,179.68. C10.

Eli Lilly Earnings Increase 17%
Eli Lilly said that its first-quarter profit rose 17 percent, just above expectations, as sales of its Zyprexa schizophrenia drug, which has overtaken Prozac as the company's largest product, jumped by more than a third. Net income rose to $806.8 million, or 74 cents a share, compared with profit from operations of $692.3 million, or 63 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Sales rose 10 percent, to $2.81 billion. Shares of Lilly rose $1.56, to $79. C8.

PG&E Posts $4.12 Billion Loss
The PG&E Corporation said it had a fourth-quarter loss of $4.12 billion because of a charge related to losses at its Pacific Gas and Electric utility, while Reliant Energy, the owner of Houston's utility and a power supplier in California and other states, said that its first-quarter earnings more than doubled.

Moving the Accountants Out of the Building and Onto the Web

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
LAST spring, the Frank Russell Company, a midsize mutual fund manager in Tacoma, Wash., decided that it was time to get rid of some 10-year-old computers and programs that handled human resources and payroll.
 But it did not buy new ones. Instead, Frank Russell turned to the Internet, signing with an applications service provider that transferred the company's data to a new Web site. The move gave Frank Russell's administrative staff access to the latest software whenever they logged on. 
 By contrast, when BP Amoco, one of the world's largest corporations, decided to turn its accounting operations over to an outsider, PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Internet had little to do with it. The accounting giant simply took over BP's staff, cutting costs through the economies of scale it could apply. 
BP executives will be able to check on financial information through an Internet connection, but otherwise the arrangement represented what outsourcing has meant for decades.
Between them, Frank Russell and BP Amoco represent the state of Internet outsourcing, a movement that has neither lived up to the expectations of a year ago nor gone away and died. Services offering Web-based software to handle mundane back-office work and allow companies to concentrate on the products and services that produce revenue are growing. But for the most part, these services are still on the fringe of corporate America.
"By any measure, there is more outsourcing going on now than a year ago," said Charles Rutstein, a director of Forrester Research, an Internet consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. "It is not going to be a big bang kind of thing but a gradual shift."
The barriers that have kept Internet outsourcing from exploding are not likely to disappear overnight. 
The global giants who could benefit most from Internet outsourcing are likely to be the slowest to make the transition, mostly because of bureaucracy and the issue of trust, analysts say. Many of the biggest companies have technology divisions that are bigger than many of the outsourcing companies. They have the latest, fastest equipment, and they feel more confident when they are completely in control of vital company functions. 
Moreover, analysts say, it is often difficult to get technology executives at corporations to advocate efficiencies that would shrink their staffs and their influence.
So far, more small and midsize companies, with revenues in the millions or hundreds of millions rather than in the billions, have tried Internet outsourcing. But they also worry that confidential information may somehow be nabbed by competitors once it is accessible by computer.
They worry, too, that an Internet contractor may not be as dependable. With plenty of recent failures, they are concerned that new companies with dazzling ideas and programs may not be able to build a customer base fast enough to make the transition from burning money to earning profits.
"We're advising clients who are buying these services to make sure the providers have 18 months of cash before they sign up," said Dean Davison, a specialist on Internet outsourcing at the Meta Group, a technology research company in Stamford, Conn. "I know of providers with good products that have had to close their doors because they ran out of money. That left their customers in a bit of a lurch."
Mr. Davison estimates that there are about 700 fairly new companies whose business is Internet outsourcing. 
"We see 60 percent of these people getting acquired or going out of business," he said. "That's not because they don't have the right idea, but simply because supply is ahead of demand."
Most of these application service providers are setting up programs to handle tasks like payroll or health and pension benefits. Or they are running Web sites or e-mail systems. 
The outsourcing companies create a site on the Internet, and clients are given access. The Internet operation replaces all or part of a company's technology center.
In contrast to the legions of upstart companies, huge proven outsourcing companies, like Electronic Data Systems in Dallas and I.B.M. Global Services, are solid. But they are criticized as expensive and lacking in spontaneity and inventiveness, which leaves room for new companies to step in. 
"If you're trying to do something really new and different, you typically go to a newer outsourcing company," said Todd Eyler, a senior analyst at Forrester Research. "With the bigger, older companies like E.D.S., it's less new ways of doing things and more just being very reliable."
For its part, E.D.S. is trying to demonstrate that it can be as innovative as its dot-com rivals.
After several years of building and running companies' Web sites, E.D.S. began broadening its Internet services in mid-1999. It now takes over all or part of a client's technology operations, providing consulting services, hardware and software in unlimited combinations. The company's Internet customers include a few dot-com start-ups and many midsize and large companies, said Brad Rucker, an E.D.S. senior executive. The Internet business accounted for more than 5 percent of E.D.S.'s nearly $20 billion in revenue last year and is the company's fastest-growing division, said John Clendening, a company spokesman.
OTHER big players are scrambling to grab a part of the business. Large software makers, like Microsoft and Peoplesoft, are no longer merely selling software but setting up and running Web sites using their software. Peoplesoft, for example, began Internet outsourcing a year ago and has built Web sites for 30 clients.
Peoplesoft did the work for Frank Russell as well as the accounting programs for the Juniper Bank, an Internet start-up that went online in November. Though Frank Russell had been in business for decades, it did not have a large technology department devoted to human resources and payroll. So there was little or no internal resistance when it shifted to an Internet system that could easily be expanded as the company grew, said Gene Johanson, an executive at Frank Russell.
Juniper was in the classic position of a start-up company. "We had to concentrate our resources on launching Juniper rather than on our back-end accounting system," said Andy Arnold, a technology executive at Juniper. "By going with Peoplesoft, we didn't have to ramp up all the hardware and infrastructure and hire a staff of professional folks."
Executives at service providers argue that security fears are overblown. And some experts say that outsourcing public Web sites and e-mail services can actually enhance security. "By having virus protection and all the screening occur somewhere else," Mr. Johanson said, "it is easier to protect the company and our local area network."
Some Internet outsourcing is reliable, the analysts say, but still unappealing because it is not tailored to customers' needs. "The problem for the providers," Mr. Davison said, "is taking a piece of software and making it work just the way a law firm with 50 people wants it to work."
Even for companies willing to outsource something as straightforward as payroll, going on to more complicated operations that would be even more financially rewarding is often beyond the pale. There is still too much mystery to the Internet for too many potential customers. 
"It's really easy to outsource something like the payroll, which is easily understood and just a pain in the neck and nobody wants to do," said Christine Ferrusi Ross, an analyst at Forrester. "But start talking about an Internet-based connection to a trading partner. Well, you hear, what does that cost? And how should it work? And what kinds of things should I expect? There are a lot of psychological barriers because companies don't understand these things. They are afraid to go out and ask questions for fear of being mistreated. Or that they'll ultimately get something they don't understand. So they just don't do it."

HEADLINE: You Want Repeat Customers? Try E-Mail 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD STAMLER 

 BODY:
IT'S cheap and it's fast. Customers respond to it and read it. They buy.
It's e-mail.
 E-mail? 
 Sure. Although it has earned a bad reputation among people who call it spam -- ignoring, blocking or deleting it -- many others like e-mail and actually read it, especially if they have agreed to receive it in the first place. Indeed, a consensus seems to be building among those who send it to their customers: that is, when it comes to retaining customers and building loyalty, e-mail works.
"E-mail is the most effective way of driving existing customers to a company's Web site," said Shar Van Boskirk, an analyst with Forrester Research. That is especially important today as companies, which see a landscape littered with the corpses of failed Internet merchants, are directing much of their energy toward keeping the customers they have. 
E-mail can be an inexpensive way to reach regular customers. A catalog mailing can cost $1 a customer, but e-mail can cost as little as 5 cents, according to a report issued by Forrester last year. Though fewer and fewer people "click through" on banner advertisements, about 10 percent respond to e-mail, according to Forrester, and a quarter of those buy something.
Still, attention spans for e-mail are limited, just as they are with other promotional material. Customers become jaded once the novelty of electronic messaging wears off. That means "you have to make your e-mail extremely relevant and timely," Ms. Van Boskirk said. "The more personalized, intelligent and well organized" the message, she said, the better. 
Logical enough. But are companies doing that?
It seems so, in distinctive ways. At least that is the conclusion to be drawn from a recent anecdotal review of the e-mail promotions of three different companies selling three different products.

The Saturn Corporation
Saturn, based in Spring Hill, Tenn., is part of the General Motors Corporation. Its first car was sold in 1990, and about two million Saturns are on the road in the United States.
Saturn has always styled itself as a different kind of company. Its vehicles are designed to compete with Japanese imports and appeal to drivers who would never consider putting a Buick or a Cadillac in their driveway. Consequently, the company has always de-emphasized its connection to Detroit and cultivated a reputation for doing the unconventional. It uses the Internet to reinforce its corporate identity.
What makes Saturn different? Its cars are supposed to be sold at sticker price, no haggling. Customer loyalty to individual dealers is stressed. And Saturn owners and drivers are supposed to be treated like family, not just customers, said Tom Folger, Saturn's director of relationship marketing and Internet.
As a result, Saturn has created a customer base that is exceptionally loyal. If this makes Saturn customers seem like natural targets of e-mail retention marketing, Saturn could not agree more. But the company is nevertheless wary of overkill and of burying Saturn owners with too much information at once.
So, for now, the e-mail is simple and limited. (There is still snail mail.)
"E-mail itself is a part of how we speak to our customers," Mr. Folger said. "But it's not the only part." 
Saturn has about 20,000 e-mail subscribers, all customers who have agreed to receive the messages. There is no schedule for sending the messages; instead, they are transmitted when the company has something specific to say about itself or its Web site, or when it wants to announce a new product.
The messages are straightforward and relatively simple. They are sent in plain text with links to relevant Web sites, and not in rich media format, with audio, animation or video, or in HTML, the format in which Web pages are displayed.
The company has not established a formal system for "what we are trying to achieve in loyalty with e-mail," Mr. Folger said. But the anecdotal results are favorable.
"We get lots of visits from people after we e-mail them to look at something on our site," he said.

Eddie Bauer
The same is true at Eddie Bauer, a subsidiary of the catalog company Spiegel Inc.
Like Saturn, Eddie Bauer, based in Redmond, Wash., is a big company, with $1.7 billion in sales last year. But the two businesses have little else in common. Eddie Bauer's products are clothing and home furnishings, which are not sold only in stores or through dealers, as is the case for Saturn, but through catalogs and online as well.
As a result, Eddie Bauer has done much more electronic marketing than Saturn has. It also sends e-mail messages to many more people.
"Over the years, we have grown a subscriber base in the millions," said Mark Staudinger, the vice president for direct media at the company. As at Saturn, e-mail is directed only to those who agree to receive it, either online, at the stores or elsewhere. But at Eddie Bauer, e-mail is sent about once a week. And e-mail messages are sent in whatever format the recipient's system can handle, including HTML, plain text and AOL-optimized, which allows America Online subscribers with older software to receive graphically enhanced messages, said Bridgette Boudreau, Eddie Bauer's e-mail manager.
To do all this, Eddie Bauer uses an outside e-mail vendor, Digital Impact, an online direct marketing company, to help the company determine what kind of e-mail to send and to whom, and to create the mailings as well.
"We generate the creative, decide on the content and then hand it over to them," Ms. Boudreau said. "They do all the creation on the technical side, the analysis and reporting."
How does Eddie Bauer decide what e-mail messages to send to whom, and how does it decide what is effective?
So far, the company is analyzing simple criteria like click-through and click-to-buy rates to differentiate among its customers, Ms. Boudreau said. And it is playing with different words and offers in its messages -- "sale," for example, or "free shipping" -- to see what kinds of responses they elicit and whether they drive customers to the Eddie Bauer Web site. There is a definite sense that the e-mail is working.
Still, while the company has "very advanced" segmentation with its catalog sales -- hardly surprising given the 56 years the 81-year-old company has been selling by mail -- its Internet marketing is not as advanced. 
"We want to begin simply and proceed logically," Mr. Staudinger said. 
Ms. Boudreau added, "We are doing a lot of testing." 
That, of course, is something that a large business like Eddie Bauer can afford to do.

Esperya.com
The opposite is true at Esperya .com, a small Internet food merchant that specializes in Italian delicacies. The company does not test its e-mail -- not yet. But it still sends messages to its customers, said Beatrice Ughi, who is in charge of United States business for Esperya, the parent company in Loreto, Italy. Like the e-mail of bigger companies, the notices get results.
Esperya was founded in 1997 by Antonio Tombolini, whom Ms. Ughi described as a man with a technical background who created the site to indulge his passion "for food you cannot find through standard distribution channels." The company's products include Sardinian gray mullet roe, Sicilian capers, Tuscan chestnuts and Venetian rice. The United States Web site has been online since July 2000 and has about 2,000 "members" who agreed to receive e-mail.
The messages, titled The Italian Experience, are in plain text with hypertext links to parts of the Esperya site. They are written like letters, addressed "Dear" to each recipient and signed by Ms. Ughi. They go out every two weeks or so, although a month may pass if Ms. Ughi does not have anything important to share.
"We don't just send out an e-mail because we've got a new recipe," she said.
When she does write, the tone is personal and conversational, with the focus on new products. One recent e-mail message discussed aromatic lentils from Umbria, aged tallegio cheese from Lombardy and Tuscan fruitcake.
"A lot of people reply and send comments," Ms. Ughi said. "We establish a personal relationship with our customers through the e-mails."
Does that help business?
"It's extraordinary," she said last month. "We just sent one out yesterday, and today we have three times the normal number of orders."

For the Stock-Weary, Online Bond Trading

BYLINE:  By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
STEPHEN CALARDO, a lawyer in Cincinnati, has been buying and selling stocks online for years, but he does not remember when he last bought a bond before this year. Bonds issued by government agencies and corporations have been available for electronic trading for a few years, but the idea is just starting to catch on with investors now that the stock market is in a funk.
 Having watched the value of their stock-heavy portfolios hurtle toward earth like the Mir space station, investors are looking for safer places to put their money. Some, including Mr. Calardo, are finding that they can buy other securities online almost as quickly and inexpensively as they can trade stocks. 
 Mr. Calardo has used his account at the Charles Schwab Corporation, the online brokerage firm, to participate in two recent electronic offerings of corporate bonds. They were not his first bond purchases, but they were his first without the help of a live broker and his first since he switched to managing most of his family's investments on the Web.
"For most people who have traded online that I am familiar with, it was stocks and money market funds," said Mr. Calardo, who is 45 and feels his children's college years approaching. "Now there is more demand for fixed income, and people who would not have thought about it in the past are finding there are bonds available online."
During the stock-trading boom of the 1990's, brokerage firms were in no hurry to set up online trading systems for slow-moving 10-year corporate bonds. There was no urgency to bond trading except among institutional investors and traders on Wall Street. Individual investors did not get excited about the chance to log on to a Web site and get in on the latest turnpike bond offering.
Once they had their Internet systems set up for trading stocks and mutual funds, brokerage firms turned to stock options, which appeal to active traders. But few ventured into more exotic products, like currencies or commodities, because of their limited appeal and complexity. For the masses, bonds are complex enough.
So far, individual investors do only about 1 percent of their bond trading online, said Andy Nybo, a senior analyst with Tower Group, a research firm in Needham, Mass. Almost all the sales and trading of bonds online is between institutions. Investment banks have distributed entire issues of some corporate bonds electronically, reducing the cost of underwriting significantly.
Mr. Nybo said his firm projected that individual investors would make a similar switch in the next few years. By 2005, he said, about 40 percent of their bond trading will be done online. That migration will be fueled by improved access through brokerage firms and much better information about prices, he said.
ACCORDING to John Ladensack, a senior vice president of Schwab Capital Markets in Jersey City, the driving force behind the growth of online bond trading will be demand from baby boomers who want to reduce the risks in their investment portfolios as they approach retirement. Also, many firms are realizing they need to modernize the way bonds are sold, even at the risk of their profit margins.
"It started slow because the industry didn't care about bonds -- it was a country-club type of product that was sold over the counter," Mr. Ladensack said. "When you shine light on an over-the-counter product, margins go down."
But that bottom-line concern was offset partly by the recognition that investors who buy bonds are desirable customers: they tend to be older and wealthier than the typical online investor, Mr. Nybo said. "Allowing those investors to buy bonds online tends to enhance a relationship the firms have with these clients," he said. "Among other things, it lets them keep their assets -- stocks and bonds -- in one account."
At Schwab, online bond trading activity doubled from December to January and increased about 25 percent more in February, Mr. Ladensack said. He expects continued growth but acknowledges that trading bonds online will never be as alluring as trading stocks.
While Wall Street firms were competing for the masses of online investors who wanted to trade stocks, they left the frontier of online bond sales open for the federal government. For a few years now, the Treasury Department has been selling bonds and bills and what may be the least dynamic of all investments -- savings bonds -- over the Internet.
Through its Treasury Direct service, the Treasury Department has been selling bonds online for about 18 months. It allows investors to set up accounts and participate in offerings and auctions of long-term bonds and shorter-term bills.
Pete Hollenbach, a spokesman for the Bureau of the Public Debt in Washington, said the agency had noticed that sales of its bonds tend to rise when the stock market is falling and when the Federal Reserve is lowering interest rates, as is happening now.
Through a separate Web site, the government sells savings bonds and inflation-indexed bonds, whose interest rates are tied to fluctuations in consumer prices. But there is a twist to savings bonds online: they can be bought only with MasterCard, Visa and Discover cards because "the credit card right now is the currency of the Internet," Mr. Hollenbach said. But, he added, "We absolutely would discourage anyone who carries a balance from buying a bond on a credit card."
Between a typical credit-card interest rate of more than 15 percent and the relatively low rate earned on a savings bond, he said, "You have a pretty significant negative arbitrage."

HEADLINE: WINE TALK; 
Diners Discover Life After Chardonnay

BYLINE:  By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
TO winemakers, the only thing better than getting you to buy in a shop is getting you to buy in a restaurant. Many small wineries concentrate their marketing on restaurants. And when it comes right down to it, where did you first get interested in wine? 
 There are more restaurants for trying good wine these days. In New York, more than 300 new restaurants were added to the Zagat Survey for 2001, as against 89 restaurants that closed. The interest in wine is national, with restaurants in places like Las Vegas and Kansas City boasting cellars to make bicoastal sophisticates envious. In other words, restaurants play a crucial role, perhaps the most crucial role, in determining what we drink. 
 Every year around this time, Wine & Spirits magazine surveys top restaurants around the country, as determined by Zagat, to learn what wines people are drinking, what they eat with them and what the wines cost.
Quickly, what we eat in restaurants is fish. Steak is second. And we drink mostly chardonnay, to go with all that fish, then cabernet sauvignon, to go with the steak. What are we drinking less of these days? Merlot and, yes, chardonnay. 
And what do we spend on all this restaurant wine? A bundle. Bordeaux madness is a thing of the past, thanks probably to the uncertain economy. The average price of the best-known Bordeaux dropped last year to about $73 a bottle, from $161. But the average price American diners paid for a bottle of wine was well over $40. And, despite what can only be called outrageous prices, more than 80 percent of the restaurants polled said wine sales increased last year. 
The winner of the wine popularity contest in 2000 was Sonoma-Cutrer Vineyards in Windsor, Calif. We are nothing if not consistent: Sonoma-Cutrer led the poll in 1992, 1994, 1998 and 1999. No. 2 was Kendall-Jackson in Santa Rosa, Calif., which was first in 1993, 1995, 1996 and 1997. The wine, in both instances, was chardonnay. Sonoma-Cutrer makes nothing else. Kendall-Jackson is best known for its Vintners Reserve Chardonnay. 
So is chardonnay still king? Yes, but its crown is shaky. For the first time since the survey began 12 years ago, chardonnay dropped below 25 percent of total restaurant consumption. More significant, the percentage of chardonnay in the total of wine sold at high-price restaurants has dropped almost 20 points in recent years. In 1991, chardonnay accounted for 43 percent of the wine sold in those restaurants. Now, it's down to 25 percent.
Are consumers finally tiring of wine that tastes like sugary vanilla? One sign that they are is that white Burgundy, in which wood aging is still subordinate to the grape, has been gaining. So have French and New Zealand sauvignons blancs with their lively acidity. Who knows? We may even rediscover Chablis one of these days.
The most popular sauvignon blanc was from Ferrari-Carano in northern Sonoma. But more exciting, to me anyway, was the fact that Cloudy Bay, from Marlborough, in far-off New Zealand, was second. Once almost a cult wine, Cloudy Bay is now widely available and has generated worthy imitators like Brancott, also from New Zealand. Good French sauvignons blancs are better known as Sancerre and Pouilly-Fume.
Though chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are the most popular white wines of the moment, there is no lack of other good choices. Pinot grigio is popular, but I find much of it watery and bland. Riesling is too subtle for most diners. But worth a try are pinot blanc, chenin blanc -- from France or the United States -- and Italian wines like Orvieto. They can easily be found on the wine-by-the-glass list. 
And while chardonnay may still be in the lead, as they say at the track, red wine, particularly cabernet sauvignon, is coming up fast. Of the 381 restaurants polled by Wine & Spirits, 23 were steakhouses, up from 12 the year before. And steak means cabernet. Almost 17 percent of all the wine consumed in white-tablecloth restaurants last year was cabernet. That's up from just over 15 percent in 1999. 
Merlot, destiny's tot in the early 90's, has been on a downward slope since 1997. It still accounts for 14 percent of the restaurant market, but as one Las Vegas sommelier told the survey: "To sell a $90 merlot is a struggle. But a $200 cabernet isn't even an issue." Chez Panisse in Berkeley, one of California's most famous restaurants, has dropped merlot from the wine list. "Merlot is useless," Jonathan Waters of Chez Panisse told Wine & Spirits. 
I would rather say that it has served its purpose. It gave wine newcomers another name to toss around, and being less tannic, it may even have been easier to drink. In practice, of course, few people can tell cabernet from merlot. 
Makers still add merlot to cabernet to soften it, and cabernet to merlot to give it "backbone." 
Pinot noir, the survey found, does well as an all-purpose wine: if two people at the table are eating fish and two are eating meat, pinot noir is seen as a workable compromise. Zinfandel is growing popular as another worthy companion to red meat. 
Restaurants like the Tasting Room, which is also a wine bar, at 72 East First Street in Manhattan, encourage diners to explore and discover wines new to them.
One thing that the Wine & Spirits survey doesn't show is any real drop in prices, but then it acknowledges concentrating on the top end and justifies that decision by saying the entire market "continues to take its cues from the top."
For many restaurantgoers, the fun will always be in seeking out little-known, and lower-priced, wines, even in expensive restaurants. Wine buying has always been about brands. Connoisseurs have always sniffed at people who "buy labels," but as the Wine & Spirits survey shows, everyone does it; it's safe. 
It's a lot more fun to go in under the radar and pick off good wines at half the price that some name brands command. It isn't always easy, but sticking with the least expensive on the list and consulting the wine steward or waiter can often lead you in new directions.

HEADLINE: The Urgency of Constructing Peace 

BYLINE:  By Yossi Beilin; Yossi Beilin was Israel's justice minister in the government led by Ehud Barak.

DATELINE: TEL AVIV 

 BODY:
The past few days once again remind us of the thin layer of ice on which the architecture of the Middle East peace process is constructed and the unbearable ease of escalation of violence both in the North, with Lebanon and Syria, and in the West Bank and Gaza, with the Palestinians.
 Even more tempting is the desire to depart from the herculean task of peacemaking and return to the familiar arena of polemical point-scoring. Perhaps here Israel may feel it has registered a meaningful victory. Among many observers in the United States, there may be a sense that Yasir Arafat overplayed his hand when he refused the most far-reaching peace proposal, preferring instead to ride the tiger of demonstrations and violence after Ariel Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount six months ago. 
 Prime Minister Sharon, perhaps buoyed by this feeling of success in the media war, was apparently in a candid mood when being interviewed last weekend in the Israeli papers. Reverting to type, he took refuge in a narrow national pride, indicating that there is actually no chance for peace, that limited nonbelligerency is the great new hope, and displaying almost no room for compromise with either the Palestinians or Syria.
However, we are not in the arena of polemics, and Mr. Arafat's diminishing popularity in the world does not make Israel a happy country. The continuing violence, the fear for personal safety, the recall of the Egyptian and Jordanian ambassadors from Tel Aviv, the decline in foreign investments, the harm to the economy and tourism -- all these oblige Israel to continue with a substantive political process and not to return to a struggle over public relations.
The dream that established Israel is that a nation of Jewish people will be able to live a normal life, to develop Jewish culture, to live in peace with our neighbors and to be a safe haven for the Jews of the world. Israel, which has reached impressive achievements in spheres like the military and science, is still not a safe haven for Jews. It is not yet a "normal" country, and the peace process, which opened with the agreement between Israel and Egypt, was severed a few months ago.
The Oslo agreement brought peace between Israel and Jordan, the development of ties between Israel and countries of North Africa and the Persian Gulf, and a drawing together of Israel and the Palestinians that almost achieved a peace between them. The so-called Al Aksa intifada halted the process and thrust the Middle East into reverse: violence, hate, a lynching atmosphere, futile struggles in the United Nations, unemployment and distress, incitement, renewed alienation of Israel from Arab countries and a feeling of going back to square one.
There are those both in and out of Israel who will say that this is fate, that Israel cannot integrate itself into the Middle East, that by nature it is an alien seedling and it is better for Israel to fortify itself as a democratic-Western outpost in the region and to give up its dreams for peace.
Should this approach, which characterizes the Israeli right wing led by Ariel Sharon, take root, Israel may become an episode in history. Israel won six wars because its leaders had convinced the people that they were doing their utmost in order to reach peace. Without the hope for peace, without the endeavors for peace, it will be impossible to maintain a viable Jewish state for long. Not many will want to live by the sword, to endanger themselves and their families without any hope of normalization. Those who tell us that we cannot make peace with our neighbors bring us Job's tidings; they do not make it easy for us.
The Palestinians live with us, alongside us, and there is no real reason why we shall not live with them in peace. We know them well, are aware of their suffering and know that many of them want peace and are even ready to pay the price to achieve this.
We were so close in the Camp David discussions in July 2000 and even closer in discussions that we held in Taba, Egypt, in January 2001. The outline for a workable settlement was sketched by President Bill Clinton last December.
Palestinians as well as Israelis well understand that sooner or later that settlement -- or some approach very like it -- will be the solution and the only questions are how much time it will take and how much blood will be spilled, on both sides, until we return to these concepts. Chairman Arafat confirmed to me when I met with him in Ramallah last week that the Palestinian response to the Clinton ideas was acceptance with reservations -- a response similar to the Israeli cabinet's decision on Dec. 28, 2000, under the government of Ehud Barak, to accept these ideas with reservations.
The war of attrition and escalation that continues with the Palestinians is bad news for them and for Israel. Unilateral separation -- that is, fixing a border between Israel and the Palestinians without a negotiated agreement -- can be realized only if Israel is willing to uproot about 100 settlements, a prospect that is unrealistic in the absence of a peace accord. Without such an accord there can be no guarantee of demilitarizing the Palestinian state. Most important, there can be no agreed resolution of the refugee issue and no closing of claims in this regard, a matter of vital Israeli interest. I can testify that some resolution to the refugee question was within reach at Taba without in any way compromising the demographically Jewish nature of the state of Israel.
The only practical way forward is to renew security cooperation, and immediately thereafter to negotiate how to implement the series of agreements that have been signed by the parties but not executed. Prime Minister Sharon's determination that no negotiations will be conducted as long as violence continues sounds justified, but it is erroneous.
One dare not give a veto to the extreme radical holding the pistol. It is necessary to distinguish between violence that stems from the Palestinian Authority, which the authority must end, and violence and terror that are not connected to it and that can be stopped only as a result of security cooperation between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Bearing in mind this distinction, we must find a path to negotiations now; there is no substitute.
Whoever believes in the Jewish right to a nation, to peace and to a normal life must make a true effort to resume political dialogue, to reach a permanent settlement, to set permanent borders for Israel and not to give up the chance to live in peace with all our neighbors. They are here, we are here, neither of us chose the other as a neighbor, and neither is going anywhere.

HEADLINE: Conventions in Chicago 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Conventional Business: A Warning" (Big City column, April 6):
 John Tierney says McCormick Place is "empty much of the time." 
In fact, it currently operates at full practical occupancy. There are only 12 days scattered between March and October of this year when McCormick Place does not have a major show or convention in its buildings either moving in, moving out or conducting events. We are now even forced to turn away business because of our crowded calendar. 
 Mr. Tierney says Chicago's share of the convention market is declining. But "big" shows represent only 5 percent of the overall trade show market. McCormick Place's share of the small to midsize shows has progressively increased over the last decade. 
Conventions and trade shows are huge economic engines for Chicago and Illinois.

HEADLINE: Reports on Prices and Output Offer Some Signs of Stability 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17 

 BODY:
Cheaper energy kept inflation tame in March while manufacturing perked up modestly, separate reports showed today.
 A series of government and industry reports indicated some stability was returning to a few economic sectors after a volatile first quarter in which natural gas prices soared and many manufacturing industries continued to struggle. 
 Prices as measured by the Consumer Price Index edged up a scant 0.1 percent last month after an increase of 0.3 percent in February as energy prices declined 2.1 percent, the Labor Department said. Excluding food and energy, so-called core inflation in March increased 0.2 percent after a rise of 0.3 percent in February. 
A sharp increase in car assemblies pushed industrial production up 0.4 percent in March -- its first increase in six months -- after a 0.4 percent decline in February, the Federal Reserve said.
Also, the plant-use rate, which measures industrial capacity in use, rose last month for the first time since August, to a rate of 79.4 percent from a revised 79.3 percent in February.
Nonetheless, output for the first quarter was off 4.7 percent, the weakest performance since the first quarter of 1991, just as the last recession was ending.
Analysts said that the reports meant that the Fed was unlikely to cut interest rates again between its regular policy-setting sessions but was nearly certain to do so at the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which is scheduled for May 15.
Joel Naroff, an economist at Naroff Economic Advisers Inc. in Holland, Pa., noted that some prices were still climbing sharply including the costs of medical care and telephone bills, but he said that would not keep the Fed from reducing interest rates further.
"The slow economy is the war that has to be fought, and at least for now, the F.O.M.C. can push inflation to the back burner," Mr. Naroff said.
Another report from the Commerce Department said housing starts fell for a second consecutive month during March, dropping 1.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.613 million units after a 2.2 percent drop in February.
But that was still only 1 percent below levels a year earlier, when the economy was roaring ahead and starts were at a rate of 1.63 million a year.
Cheaper interest rates since the start of 2001 have kept a floor under the housing sector by lowering mortgage payments and reducing the interest costs on goods like furniture and appliances needed to furnish homes.

HEADLINE: The Dynamo at the Heart of N.Y.U.'s Fund-Raising 

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Naomi Levine was reading about Alberto W. Vilar, the arts philanthropist, last year and noticed that he had studied economics at New York University. Mrs. Levine, a senior vice president at N.Y.U., knew that he had given millions of dollars to the Metropolitan Opera, Carnegie Hall and an array of other organizations. Why not N.Y.U., she asked herself.
 She urged N.Y.U.'s longtime former chairman, Laurence A. Tisch, to invite Mr. Vilar to breakfast. After a few proposals that went nowhere, the university hit pay dirt with a plan for a Rhodes scholarship-type program named after him for foreign students in the arts. Mr. Vilar recently pledged $23 million. 
 "That's typical of how we do fund-raising," Mrs. Levine said. "You find someone you think would be interested in what you are doing, and you go after them." 
Some universities have armies of fund-raisers, as many as 100. N.Y.U. has a development staff of 25 (including three people in alumni relations). It is a lean operation that spends about 6 cents for every dollar raised, one of the lowest spending rates among major universities. And at its heart is Mrs. Levine, a straight-talking, no-nonsense, 78-year-old dynamo, who helped the university raise $2 billion over 15 years and $335 million last year alone, more than all but a handful of other universities.
"The Roosevelt administration had a saying: 'Clear it with Sidney,' " N.Y.U.'s chairman, Martin Lipton, said recently, referring to President Roosevelt's close adviser, the labor leader Sidney Hillman. "Here it is. 'Clear it with Naomi.' " 
Mrs. Levine came to N.Y.U. in 1978 to handle public relations, government relations and a little bit of fund-raising. (N.Y.U. was raising $30 million a year then.) But she gradually cut back on the other roles and focused more and more on the money. 
She had a knack. She thought strategically, capitalizing on the connections between ego, tax considerations and imaginative ways to spend money. She knew the university well. And in a business that depends heavily on personal relationships, she had many, both inside and outside the university. 
She presides over N.Y.U.'s fund-raising apparatus in much the same way she held sway over the campers and counselors at Camp Greylock, the girls' camp she once ran in the Adirondacks. She calls on people daily and lets them know what she needs and expects.
Her office is only a few doors down from N.Y.U.'s president, L. Jay Oliva, and they chat with each other several times a day about ideas and prospects. Dr. Oliva came up with what he called an "amorphous idea" for the Vilar scholarships, but Mrs. Levine helped structure it. 
"We're like a songwriting team," Dr. Oliva said. "I'm the composer; she's the lyricist. I have the idea for the music, and she makes the words."
She talks daily to H. Dale Hemmerdinger, a real estate executive who is chairman of N.Y.U.'s development committee. She also relies heavily on Mr. Lipton and Mr. Tisch to open doors to prospective donors. "Once you open the door," she said, "hardly anyone says no."
And she leans freely on other well-heeled trustees. Trustees who have recently made significant donations include Helen Kimmel and her husband, Martin, who gave $15 million for a new student center, and Michael Steinhardt and his wife, Judy, who gave $10 million to the School of Education. Yet another trustee gave the medical school $100 million last year but asked to remain anonymous. In all, the trustees gave N.Y.U. $173 million last year, more than half of the $335 million in total gifts.
As Mrs. Levine put it, in her typically blunt fashion: "Our trustees are brought on to give money or to get money. To be crass, if you can't do those things, you get off the board."
There is no embarrassment in her voice. She believes deeply in the product she is selling. She quotes her close ally, Mr. Tisch, as saying, "This is a poor place and we have to work at getting money for it."
She works to get to know the trustees and to strengthen their ties to each other and the university by taking them on trips -- to France, to London, to N.Y.U.'s villa in Florence. Earlier this year, much of the board gathered in Palm Beach, Fla.
"There is nothing like living with each other for a few days for bonding," she said.
She also ropes in others with little or no previous connection to the university, always looking for intersections between their interests and the university's. Edgar M. Bronfman, for example, whom she knew in her previous role as executive director of the American Jewish Congress, has endowed N.Y.U.'s Jewish life center as well as a professorship. 
N.Y.U. officials say that she thinks big, dreaming up ideas like a $1 billion fund-raising campaign in 1985. "At first we were all a little taken aback by the idea," Mr. Tisch recalled. "Then we got to like it. There was a shock value in a billion dollars."
But Mrs. Levine also focuses on detail. She acknowledges spending hours -- and nights -- figuring out who is going to sit next to whom at a dinner. "One little detail can ruin a deal," she said in a schoolmarmish tone. "A letter with bad grammar. Or spelling a name wrong."
She admits that N.Y.U. has failed to cultivate the university's broader alumni base. Most universities try to cultivate donors of smaller gifts soon after they graduate because it is hard to predict who will be successful later on. But with alumni who were mostly commuter students, that did not become a priority until recently. 
Perhaps the biggest questions for N.Y.U. is what will happen to development when Mrs. Levine moves aside. She recently announced her intention to cut back and run a philanthropy institute at N.Y.U.'s School of Continuing and Professional Studies. (Later this month, she plans to lecture on her approach to fund-raising.) 
Mr. Tisch suggests that she may be indispensable. "The most important thing for the university is to keep her active for another 15 years," he said. "There is no after Naomi."

HEADLINE: Pat Robertson Remarks on China Abortions 

BYLINE:  By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

 BODY:
The religious broadcaster Pat Robertson told a CNN interviewer on Monday that the United States should not interfere with population-control policies in China, but yesterday, sounding a note of regret, he said he should have emphasized his anti-abortion views.
 In a statement about the comments he made on the CNN program "Wolf Blitzer Reports," Mr. Robertson said, "I regret that my unrehearsed comments on 'Wolf Blitzer' were not spoken with sufficient clarity to communicate my lifelong opposition to voluntary and forced abortion as a means of population control." 
 In the interview, Mr. Blitzer had asked Mr. Robertson how he reconciled his support for close relations with China with complaints by conservatives that China was promoting "so-called forced abortions."
Mr. Robertson said he would not agree with such a policy. "But at the same time, they've got 1.2 billion people, and they don't know what to do," Mr. Robertson said. "If every family over there was allowed to have three or four children, the population would become completely unsustainable."
After saying China risked political upheaval if unemployment made its population restive, Mr. Robertson said: "So, I think that right now they're doing what they have to do. I don't agree with forced abortion, but I don't think the United States needs to interfere with what they're doing internally in this regard."
A moment later, Mr. Robertson seemed to contradict himself. Asked whether conservatives might accuse him of "justifying abortions in China," Mr. Robertson said, "Well, I just think they need to get involved in what's happening."
Gary L. Bauer, a former Republican presidential candidate who is president of the conservative organization American Values, said he welcomed Mr. Robertson's statement yesterday.
"The original statement was so shocking and depressing that I'm gratified that he has clarified it," Mr. Bauer said. "But the fact remains that a number of people that ought to know better, including some good American capitalists and too many conservative leaders, have been willing to make excuses for reprehensible behavior by Beijing."
In the CNN interview, Mr. Robertson also said that the Chinese were courting "a demographic catastrophe" by selecting female infants "for the slaughter, and they're allowing only males to be born." 
Mr. Robertson said Chinese men would eventually "have to be importing wives" from outside China.
A spokeswoman at Mr. Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network said he was traveling yesterday and unavailable for further comment.
While officials at some organizations opposed to abortion declined to comment on Mr. Robertson's remarks, Richard Land, president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, said, "It is a caution that we need to be very careful and very precise, lest we leave the wrong impression." 
Mr. Land added that he was delighted that Mr. Robertson "has clarified and re-emphasized his historic position of being strongly pro-life."

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Roundup; 
Justices Return to Commercial Speech Quandary

BYLINE:  By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17 

 BODY:
For the past 11 years, under the Mushroom Promotion, Research and Consumer Information Act of 1990, the Agriculture Department has required mushroom growers to contribute to an advertising program that encourages American consumers to eat more mushrooms. Most of the mushroom industry supports the program enthusiastically.
 But United Foods Inc., a Tennessee company that sells mushrooms under the brand name Pictsweet, emphatically does not. It has refused since 1996 to pay the assessment, going into federal court to argue that the program was a form of compelled speech that violated its rights under the First Amendment. 
 In a lively Supreme Court argument today, the question was where to draw the line between permissible economic regulation and an infringement of a corporation's right not to speak.
"Sometimes what you don't say is as important as what you do," Laurence H. Tribe, representing the dissident mushroom producer, told the court.
Mr. Tribe said United Foods objected to being forced to pay for a generic advertising program that contained an implicit message with which it strongly disagreed, namely: "Brands don't make a difference, and if you've seen one mushroom, you've seen them all."
In a 5-to-4 decision four years ago, the Supreme Court upheld an advertising assessment program for the growers of California peaches, plums and nectarines. The government is now arguing that under that 1997 decision, Glickman v. Wileman Brothers, the mushroom program is clearly constitutional.
But the federal appeals court in Cincinnati did not see it that way when it ruled in 1999 that the mushroom assessments violated the First Amendment. That court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, held that while the assessments for the California fruits were a valid part of a broader regulatory program -- a federal marketing order that governed the size, grade and maturity of the fruit that was sent to market -- the mushroom program dealt essentially with just advertising and so could not be justified on the same terms.
Arguing the government's appeal today from the Sixth Circuit ruling, Barbara B. McDowell, an assistant solicitor general, said the appeals court made a mistake in treating the two assessment programs differently. Both served the same "legitimate nonspeech purpose" of "strengthening and stabilizing the market for an agricultural commodity," Ms. McDowell said.
The assessments, which range up to a penny per pound, depending on the quantity of mushrooms, "do not abridge the freedom of speech of any mushroom producer," Ms. McDowell told the court. No producer is "compelled to speak," she said, adding that producers are "simply required to contribute to a program that furthers the interests of the industry."
"Not in their view," Justice Antonin Scalia observed of United Foods.
The government's position is that the First Amendment stakes in the case are minimal because the speech involved is purely economic, without an ideological component.
"Sometimes the court has recognized that money can be speech, but here it's just money," Ms. McDowell told the justices.
But Justice Scalia, a dissenter in the California fruits case, said it was not necessarily easy to define ideology. Suppose, he said, that he belonged to an organization called People for the Ethical Treatment of Mushrooms, whose members believed that mushrooms should not be eaten.
Ms. McDowell replied, "Then presumably you wouldn't be a mushroom producer." 
Justice Scalia rejoined, "I produce them to make them happy." 
The bantering tone of much of the argument, which had the courtroom audience chuckling appreciatively, did not conceal that the court has serious work to do in this case, United States v. United Foods Inc., No. 00-276. It is part of the justices' continuing effort to arrive at a coherent theory of commercial speech, a goal that has eluded the court in a series of recent cases. 
Next week, the court will hear arguments in another commercial speech case with potentially broader implications than this one, a tobacco industry challenge to restrictions on outdoor and indoor cigarette advertising imposed by the state of Massachusetts in an effort to deter smoking by teenagers.
By their questions today, the justices probed for the implications of the mushroom case beyond agricultural assessments.
"Suppose the government thought kids were spending too much money on designer clothes," Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said to Ms. McDowell. Could the government require fashion designers to contribute to advertising urging consumers to buy generic clothes?
That would be a "somewhat more difficult question," Ms. McDowell said, because the designers would be required to support a program that was against their own interests.
As a fallback position, the government is arguing that the advertising program does not involve speech by the mushroom producers at all. Ms. McDowell said it was the government itself that spoke through the promotional activities of the Mushroom Council, the industry group set up under the law to run the program, and that consequently the program in no way violated the First Amendment rights of any participants.
Mr. Tribe, on behalf of United Foods, objected vigorously. "The idea that the Mushroom Council is somehow the voice of America is not plausible," he said. That a message "is permitted by the government does not mean it is the government's voice," he continued, adding that true government speech "should be funded from general revenue, not from special assessments on targeted groups."
There were also these other developments at the court today:

Back Pay
The court ruled 9 to 0 that when employees win back pay awards, employers are liable for the federal unemployment, Social Security and Medicare taxes as of the date of payment, rather than the earlier date when the wages were originally supposed to have been paid.
The decision, United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co., No. 00-203, resolved a dispute among the lower courts. It will cost the Cleveland team some $100,000 in taxes on more than $2 million in back salary it paid in 1994 to settle a dispute with members of the Major League Baseball Players Association over players' free agency rights. The pay covered salary due to 22 players in 1986 and 1987. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote the opinion for the court, overturning a decision by the Sixth Circuit and upholding the Internal Revenue Service's interpretation. 

Contract Dispute
The court ruled unanimously that a contractor on a public works project whose pay is withheld without a hearing cannot sue in federal court for a violation of due process if the state provides a remedy for a breach-of-contract claim of this sort. California law provides such a remedy, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote for the court in Lujan v. G & G Fire Sprinklers, No. 00-152, overturning a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco.

SPRINT SAYS EARNINGS PLUMMET 72% AND WARNS ON 2001

BYLINE:  Reuters 

 BODY:
 Sprint said yesterday that its first-quarter net income fell 72 percent, and its 2001 profits may fall 15 percent below Wall Street's already reduced forecasts because of lower voice sales, slim data growth and the slowing economy. 
Sprint, which is based in Kansas City, Mo., said it earned $315 million, or 36 cents a share, compared with $1.12 billion, or $1.25 a share, a year earlier. Revenues slipped to $4.36 billion from $4.4 billion. Sprint PCS, the company's wireless telephone arm, added about 875,000 customers, which included 826,000 direct customers and 49,000 resale customers. Net operating revenue at Sprint PCS surged 68 percent to $2.05 billion.

HEADLINE: Mississippi Votes by Wide Margin to Keep State Flag That Includes Confederate Emblem 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: JACKSON, Miss., April 17 

 BODY:
Faced with a choice between the Old South and the New, Mississippi voters today overwhelmingly selected a 107-year-old state flag that contains the Confederate battle cross in its upper corner, leaving their state the only one to display the divisive symbol on an official banner.
 With 94 percent of the ballots counted late tonight in the statewide referendum, 456,113 voters, or 65 percent, favored keeping the current flag and 246,220 voters, or 35 percent, favored a new flag with a circle of white stars replacing the cross. The flag with the cross had been considered the state flag since 1894, but last year the State Supreme Court ruled that technically it had not been an official symbol since 1906. 
 In choosing the current design, voters rejected the argument of many political and business leaders that it was retarding the state's economic progress, limiting outside investment and tourism by projecting a retrograde, backwater image. Many black lawmakers and community leaders have worked for decades to rid the state of the flag design, a Civil War relic they consider a coded emblem of support for racism. 
Many voters, in fact, said they supported the current flag precisely because it was opposed by outside interests, fearing that surrendering to such demands would inevitably lead to erosion of what they consider to be the region's heritage.
"I like the old flag," said Norma Patton, 58, of Flowood. "It's silly to change something that's not broke. Changing it would just hurt race relations. I don't think anything helps that stirs it all up."
Supporters of the new design said they did not think the vote would be the last effort for change, although many believed it could be many years before Mississippi joined the rest of the South in putting aside emblems of its Civil War passions.
"It wasn't a real surprising vote," said Blake Wilson, president of the Mississippi Economic Council, which helped lead the effort for a new flag. "This is a long-term issue, and the people of Mississippi just need more time to get there."
Former Gov. William F. Winter, who led the commission that designed the new flag, said that while he was disappointed in the result he was encouraged by how many voters had supported what he called "a symbol of unity" for the state.
Passionate debates over the use of Confederate symbolism have roiled the governments of several Southern states in recent years, after black leaders assembled their growing political power and used the threat of boycotts and legislative stalemates to prod white legislators into action. Within the last year alone, the governments of South Carolina and Georgia have voted to reduce, but not fully eliminate, the official presence of the Confederate symbol. Both did so without consulting voters.
The use of a referendum, in fact, was proposed by battle-flag supporters in both of those states as a way to keep the symbol alive by taking advantage of every Southern state's white and generally conservative majority. But only in Mississippi did the Legislature choose to let the voters decide. At the time of that decision, in January, both sides acknowledged that the Legislature would have voted to keep the Confederate symbol, so supporters of change decided to take their chances at the ballot box.
The campaign that was waged in favor of the new flag, however, deliberately shied from the issues of racial history surrounding the Confederacy, and focused instead almost entirely on the economic argument.
"It's not right that our kids can't find good jobs close to home because companies won't locate in our state, but it's a fact," said one flier mailed by a pro-business political action committee. "They have the wrong idea about Mississippi. A state flag that includes the Confederate flag just adds to those false opinions."
But polls repeatedly showed that voters did not accept the argument that the state's economic future was tied to its banner. The main reasons cited by supporters of the old flag were its place in Mississippi history and pride in their Southern heritage.
"The economic argument didn't work because they could never name a single business that left the state of Mississippi or didn't come here because of the flag," said Greg Stewart, a lawyer from Tunica who helped lead the campaign to keep the Confederate symbol. "And the racism argument didn't work because all these white liberals were lumping all black people together as helpless victims, and that didn't go over too well with anyone."
Blacks represent only about a third of the state's electorate, and their support alone would not have been enough to select a new flag. Several counties in the predominantly black Delta area voted heavily for the new design, while suburban counties and those in white rural areas provided the solid majority against it. 
And despite the rallying efforts of the state's N.A.A.C.P. branch along with many black preachers and political leaders, there were persistent indications throughout the campaign that many black voters did not feel particularly energized about changing the flag and would not turn out in great numbers to the polls. 
Hezekiah Watkins, 53, the owner of a small grocery store in Jackson, said he was discouraged that many young voters, black and white, seemed to lack interest in the issue.
"I'm from the old school," Mr. Watkins said. "I was a freedom rider. The other side would hold the rebel flag. It was always a sign of segregation and hatred." 
The need for change was endorsed in recent weeks by editorials in many of the state's largest newspapers, in comments made by Gov. Ronnie Musgrove, and endorsements from well-known figures like the actor Morgan Freeman. In a statement tonight Mr. Musgrove called on the state to accept the majority vote and move on.
'We must now put aside our differences as we continue to create a state that provides a good quality of life for our people," he said.
Many of the same groups that defended the Confederate symbol in other states also worked hard to keep the flag in Mississippi. And older residents, in particular, expressed a sense that a symbol they honored while growing up should not be wrested away.
"I just think the flag we've got now served its purpose well for the last 100 years," said Shelby Patterson, 64, who is retired and lives in Jackson. "I don't see any reason to change it. The flag they want -- it's got no sentimental value to nobody."

CITY'S ECONOMY STILL THRIVES

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton 

 BODY:
 New York City's economy slowed only slightly in the first two months of this year, but the stock market's steep decline could mean trouble for the city in the future, according to a report released yesterday by H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller, who is running for governor. The city added 16,700 jobs in January and February, down only slightly from last year, when 17,400 jobs were created in the same stretch, according to the report. 
Both figures were adjusted for seasonal factors. "The city has so far felt only a slight echo of the nation's slowdown in 2001," the report says. But, it warns, "the effects of both slowed national growth and the reductions of wealth stemming from the last year's slide in stock prices will slow economic growth in the region later in the year."

Those Interactive Britons Are Turning On Their Tellies

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
DEBBIE DRAKE, a 32-year-old studio manager for a graphic design firm in London, would not describe herself as a high-tech junkie. She does not own a computer at home, and until January, she relied on only five network television stations for entertainment.
 But since January, when she anted up about $39 a month to subscribe to British Sky Broadcasting's interactive digital television package, she has been shopping, banking and even betting online. 
 Ms. Drake is planning to bet on a horse race this weekend, using an interactive service from BSkyB, something she said she would not do if she had to visit a bookmaker in person. "I wouldn't want to walk into a betting shop on my own," she said. 
Ms. Drake is hardly an isolated case in England, where 23 percent of households are expected to use some form of interactive TV this year, according to Jupiter MMXI in London. That far outpaces the 9 percent of households that are expected to use these services in Europe, and the 7.5 percent predicted in the United States.
The term interactive TV is broad enough to encompass everything from sending an e-mail message through the television to playing along with quiz shows. And in England, people are used to viewing their televisions in a broad way, allowing for multiple uses. Yet Britons have an uneasy relationship with the personal computer. This year, only 35 percent of households in Britain are expected to connect to the Internet through a PC, compared with 57 percent in the United States, according to Jupiter. Such statistics lead some experts to predict that, at least for Britons, interactive TV will soon outpace the computer as the preferred way of connecting with the digital economy.
"Because PC penetration is lower, content providers and broadcasters thought that digital TV would be a way to wire homes," said Therese Torris, the director of research for Forrester Research in Amsterdam.
Britons have long been conditioned to expect more from their television sets than a sitcom, thanks to a service developed two decades ago that provides subtitles for the hearing impaired. Teletext, as the one-way text messaging service is called, is used throughout Europe, allowing people to check on sports scores and weather reports at a glance.
Even more important in terms of setting the stage for interactive services are competitive dynamics in Britain that forced companies to offer these services quickly. The satellite operator BSkyB galvanized cable competitors when it vowed in 1998 to swiftly switch its customers to digital from analog, a process to be completed by summer. It now has 4.7 million digital subscribers, more than it ever had on analog, said Julian Eccles, a company spokesman.
In the more geographically far-flung United States, one cable operator can lay claim to an entire region, muting competitive calls to action, said Lydia Loizides, an analyst with Jupiter Research in New York. "That slows the process down."
Significantly, many operators are offering interactivity at no extra charge, a strategy that has fostered these nascent services. About 60 percent of BSkyB's digital subscribers venture into its Open interactive network at least once a week; 12 percent have bought online; and 8 percent have made repeat purchases.
"The key to making this work is having it look, sound and navigate like a TV," Mr. Eccles said, explaining why many Britons shy away from the computer. For instance, when Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer, introduced his national budget several weeks ago, BSkyB viewers were able to vote on the proposals in a poll by clicking a button on their remote control or their mouse. Mr. Eccles said 10 times as many people voted using the TV as they did using the PC.
All of which has encouraged broadcasters to develop rich content for this new medium. When the second season of "Big Brother" begins in May, for instance, Victoria Reel, a digital media company, plans to adapt the show for Internet-enabled mobile phones and interactive TV's, allowing viewers to download personal information about the participants and to vote on who should be kicked off the show next.
Viewers watching Wimbledon this June will be able to receive live action from several different matches simultaneously. William Hill, a betting shop in Britain, is testing a system with Telewest, a cable operator, in which viewers can bet on almost anything, including soccer matches and the Academy Awards. "We see it as a viable way of increasing our business," a company spokesman said. Meanwhile, Boots, the largest drugstore chain in Britain, has joined Granada Media to form a Wellbeing, which integrates a health and beauty TV channel into a Web site.
Some of this interactive entertainment is spreading outside the home. Leisure Link, a British supplier of electronic game machines, has begun supplying 250 pubs with an Itbox, an interactive console that allows customers to download videos, play games and even buy new ring tones for their cell phones. Although the technology for the consoles was developed by Ecast in San Francisco, demand in Britain is higher than in the United States, where the entertainment boxes have been installed in 50 places, said Rebecca Eisenberg, the vice president for new market development.
Ecast tries to play down the computing side of its entertainment, a strategy Ms. Eisenberg said appealed to Britons, who tend to be more averse to technology than American customers. "We serve the tech novices, people who haven't had much practice operating computers," she said.
For now, most interactive content is either adapted for the TV or run in conjunction with a Web site. But later this year, networks will begin rolling out enhanced TV, in which interactive elements will be embedded in the programming. This development will swing the balance even further, analysts say.
One result may be that customers, like Ms. Drake, will expect these services rather than view them as a novelty. "No way could I go back to regular TV," Ms. Drake said, when interactive TV has "everything I need to save me moving from my couch."

One Oil Company Takes a Big Dip

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
DAVID BOULTER did not pay much attention when BP Amoco -- the oil giant formerly known as British Petroleum -- began exploring electronic commerce more than a decade ago. 
 And when BP took its first major step onto the Internet with a Web site (www.bp.com) in 1995, Mr. Boulter was in Bogota, planning BP's newest oil fields in Colombia. 
 "My background isn't information technology," Mr. Boulter said with classic British understatement. 
Nevertheless, in a telling sign of the times, it was Mr. Boulter, and not an experienced computer manager, whom BP named to head its e-business development in December. 
Having invested billions of dollars to adapt its technology to an Internet-driven world and having completed a yearlong process emphasizing experiments with e-commerce potential, BP has progressed to what it calls "living on the Web."
"In the early days, our decision to move out on to this frontier was in part an act of faith," said John Legatte, who is BP's group vice president for digital business and Mr. Boulter's boss. "Today it's an act of business as we dig in and stake out new territories for profitable growth."
These days, BP says it has a relatively clear picture of how e-business will transform the company and its industry, even if the timetables are in doubt. That is partly because the oil industry, with its global reach, heavy reliance on data and experience with supercomputing, has been among the most aggressive adopters of the computing and communications innovations associated with e-commerce. But it helps that BP has become a pacesetter within the oil industry.
Though its evolution is far from complete, an examination of BP's efforts sheds light on how some companies are trying to apply Internet successes, and lessons from setbacks, to their business. 
"We're through the discovery phase," Mr. Boulter said, referring to the period of mid-1999 to the middle of last year, when BP pushed its 150 operating units to think about what the Internet had made, or would soon make, possible.
"They generated thousand of ideas," Mr. Boulter said. "We started and killed things on a fairly frequent basis. We helped them weed things out."
During that time, for example, BP set up Getutility.com to be a brokerage for midsize gas and power utilities trading energy supplies, then pulled back after the lack of response showed that BP had nothing unique to offer. The company is now trying to sell the site.
The recent discovery phase came years after BP groups had dabbled in early forms of Web-based e-business and was complicated by the company's wave of acquisitions, including Amoco, Atlantic Richfield (ARCO) and Burmah Castrol. 
The technology groundwork for moving forward on a corporate basis had been laid by such moves as standardizing its desktop computers on Microsoft software in 1996 and, in 1999, paying MCI WorldCom $650 million over five years to create a global communications network.
Mr. Boulter said that an important part of the process was sending hundreds of BP executives to Silicon Valley and other technology hotbeds to study "new economy ideas." Executives like John T. Chambers of Cisco Systems, Lawrence J. Ellison of Oracle and Scott McNealey of Sun Microsystems were invited to London to talk to Sir John Browne, BP's chairman and chief executive, and other senior managers about technology. BP also sponsored e-commerce-related programs at several universities, including Stanford, Sir John's alma mater, to gain exposure to academic thinking.
Most of what BP learned has been funneled into internal projects, like equipping 70 percent of its nearly 100,000 employees with laptop computers and other mobile equipment that allows them to plug into the company's intranet and the Web. 
The company is also loading its intranet with the data, teleconferencing packages and other services that help employees do their jobs. And it is encouraging employees to visit its Virtual Village site, where a screen depicting a downtown shopping district connects employees to Web sites that can help them with personal tasks like shopping or banking. The vendors on the Village site vary by country and city, depending on the location of the employee. 
"We're recognizing that the barrier between work and life does not exist," Mr. Boulter said.
On the business-to-consumer front, BP has gone beyond providing static product information and financial data. A project in Australia allows customers of Wishlist, a Melbourne-based electronic retailer, to pick up orders of consumer products at local BP service stations rather than wait at home for a delivery. Customers can also drop off products they are returning.
Under a $200 million worldwide program called BP Connect, BP has begun to install Web-linked gasoline pumps at 28,000 stations so that drivers can use the time spent filling their tanks to view news headlines, check weather and traffic reports or order food at the station's convenience store. Inside the stores are Internet kiosks where drivers can send and receive e-mail and shop on the Web. (In the United States, the kiosks are being tested in Indianapolis and in Atlanta.)
Analysts say that BP's gasoline prices will have far more impact on where drivers fill up than the availability of such e-business innovations. Mr. Boulter said that the new stations were "getting a phenomenal amount of traffic" but conceded that there were still kinks.
"One often has to overcome cultural and regulatory barriers," Mr. Boulter said, "even when the technology is ready." 
Unlike in the United States, for instance, regulations in Britain currently restrict the types of information BP can put on electronic screens at the pumps. In business-to-business applications, BP was an early supporter of Internet-based exchanges to trade oil and chemicals, charter ships and buy supplies. 
Some of the highest-profile ventures, like Trade-Ranger, the Houston equipment-procurement exchange started a year ago by BP and 13 other petrochemical companies, may never be successful. 
Trade-Ranger is not only competing with traditional procurement practices but also with PetroCosm, an Internet exchange formed by Chevron, Texaco and technology vendors like Ariba and Requisite Technology. Some of its business overlaps with more focused sites like Network Oil, which auctions surplus oil field equipment, as well as private business portals where parts of BP trade directly over the Internet with a particular supplier.
Similarly, BP's chemicals division is in the early days of using the World Chemical Exchange (www.chemconnect.com) or Elemica (www.elemica.com) to buy and sell chemicals. It is simultaneously developing Chemicals Choice, a private BP portal for customers who want to buy directly over the Internet from the chemicals division.
Mr. Boulter said he expected many such marketplaces to develop small but viable niches or consolidate in the next 18 months to two years. He also foresees BP's participation escalating. 
"Only 1 percent to 2 percent of the potential traffic goes through these marketplaces now," he said. 
BP has accelerated its move onto the Internet by giving large parts of the job to partners. That strategy, known as outsourcing, started well before BP completed its exploration phase of the Internet. For instance, BP outsourced its human resources operation in 1999 to Exult, a start-up company in Irvine, Calif., that is setting up a Web system dubbed myHR for BP's employees. MyHR will allow BP employees in about 100 countries to track their benefits, follow company job listings and update their records. 
BP took a 10 percent stake in Exult as part of that $600 million deal, one of several investments in start-up e-businesses. Last year, BP set aside $20 million for venture investments that give senior executives exposure to e-businesses and other new technology, Mr. Boulter said, but the focus has increasingly been on ventures like Trade-Ranger, in which BP expects to participate as well as invest.
That sits well with Mr. Boulter's interest in bottom-line results. "My job," he said, "is steering things together that make sense."

HEADLINE: Citing U.S. Slowdown, Philips Will Cut 7,000 Jobs 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON, April 17 

 BODY:
Scrambling to react to an economic slowdown that has spread swiftly to Europe from the United States, Royal Philips Electronics N.V. said today that it would eliminate up to 7,000 jobs and that it would probably lose money in the second quarter.
 Analysts and money managers said they were shocked by the suddenness and severity of the erosion in the company's profits. Many had expected Philips, with its diversified business lines, to weather a slowdown better than competitors. Moreover, Philips derives more than half its sales from Europe, making it much less dependent on the United States than many rivals. 
 "The weakness in the telecommunication and personal computing industries is now worldwide," said Ben Geerts, a spokesman for Philips in Amsterdam, adding that the company was also taken by surprise.
Philips is suffering from generally slackening demand for mobile phones and for chips used in personal computers. But the company also experienced a sharp decline in its consumer electronics division, worrying analysts. 
"In certain areas, such as digital products, they are technologically behind," said Navdeep Sheera, an analyst with Schroder Salomon Smith Barney.
Philips also said today that excluding one-time charges, it earned 53 million euros ($47 million), or 0.04 euro a share, in the first quarter, a sharp fall from 614 million euros ($542.1 million), or 0.46 euro a share, in the quarter a year earlier. 
Sales declined 1 percent, to 8.2 billion euros ($7.24 billion).
Philips warned last month that its profits would be low, but the figures were much worse even than the revised forecasts by analysts; the consensus before the announcement had been 275 million euros ($242.8 million) or 0.21 euro a share. Disappointed investors bid the stock down 9.8 percent, to 29.14 euros a share.
In offering a tempered outlook, Philips joins a growing list of technology companies. Some of the hardest hit have been European and American makers of mobile phones, leading several analysts to suggest that the current shake-out will reshape the industry and pave a path for Asian companies to play a greater role.
Motorola recently said it would cut its mobile-phone manufacturing payroll by a third. Alcatel S.A. of France and Siemens A.G. of Germany have announced cuts of thousands of jobs. And Ericsson A.B., the Swedish mobile-phone equipment maker, is expected to provide additional details of its cuts on Friday, when it reports first-quarter results; analysts say the new cuts could bring the total number of jobs that Ericsson has eliminated to 20,000, or just under a quarter of its work force.
For Philips, the root of its problems have also been in its mobile- phone division, which lost 118 million euros ($104.2 million) in the three months ended March 31, in contrast to profits of 24 million euros a year ago. The jobs Philips is cutting, amounting to 3 percent of its work force, will come from its mobile handset and consumer electronics divisions, Mr. Geerts said.
The sharp reversal revived speculation that Philips plans to sell the division, a possibility that Mr. Geerts confirmed, though he said the company was also considering other options, like a partnership or a deal to farm out production.
Philips has struggled to live up to its ambitions of global leadership in mobile phones. It made a big push into the United States by partnering with Lucent, but the venture was scrapped in 1998.
Now, with demand for mobile phones waning, Philips and other smaller players are finding it harder to compete with the leaders, Nokia and Motorola. Philips might find a buyer for its handset business among European rivals or in an Asian player eager for a foothold in Europe, according to Scott Searle, an analyst with SG Cowen.
The just-completed quarter is the last for Philips' chief executive, Cor Boonstra, who is retiring. He is credited with expanding the company's medical equipment and semiconductor divisions while shedding unprofitable units. But more recently, he was the subject of a Dutch investigation into possible insider trading. He will be succeeded May 1 by Gerard Kleisterlee.
"It's a question of where do we go from here," Mr. Sheera of Schroder Salomon Smith Barney said. "The new C.E.O. will have to make a difference."

Intel Reports Sharp Drop In Chip Sales

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 17 

 BODY:
The Intel Corporation reported today that sales dropped sharply from the quarter a year earlier, but the company slightly beat its lowered earnings forecasts. Company executives said they were seeing signs that economic factors had begun to stabilize.
 At the same time, the company is engaging in an aggressive price-cutting strategy, an effort industry analysts said could degenerate into a price war with Advanced Micro Devices, its chief rival in the business of making microprocessors. 
 For its first fiscal quarter, which ended March 31, Intel reported earnings of $1.1 billion, or 16 cents a share, a figure that does not include costs related to acquisitions. The earnings per share represented a decrease of 63 percent from the first quarter last year, and of 58 percent from the final quarter of 2000, the company said. When acquisition charges are included in the accounting, Intel posted earnings of $485 million, or 7 cents a share, a drop of 82 percent from the period last year. 
The consensus among industry analysts who cover Intel was that the company would earn 15 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.
Shares of Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., finished regular trading at $26.04, off 26 cents, but after the company announcement, shares rose to $28.99 in the after-hours session. Intel's earnings came on revenue of $6.7 billion. The revenue is 16 percent lower than the first quarter a year ago, and 23 percent lower than the fourth quarter of last year.
Still, the revenue was around $200 million higher than the company warned it would be on March 9, when it lowered its earnings forecast, blaming order cancellations in all segments of its business.
"There are some bright spots toward the end of the quarter," said Andy D. Bryant, the company's chief financial officer, who noted, for example, that customers had begun ordering microprocessors for immediate shipment, which he said typically was a sign of increased demand, not merely an effort to replenish inventories. "We have found a new low level and now we expect to see normal" seasonal variances, he said.
Over all, Mr. Bryant said the first quarter in general was characterized by "rapid deterioration of business in all segments and in all geographies." The company said business was notably slow in North America and Europe.
Intel said it expected revenue for the second quarter to be $6.2 billion to $6.8 billion, a unusually large range for a revenue forecast. Mr. Bryant said that while the company felt that larger economic factors affecting the business appear to have bottomed out, the company's comfort level making precise revenue forecasts "remains low."
The company expects its gross margins, which fell to 52 percent from 63 percent last quarter, to drop to 49 percent in the second quarter. Mr. Bryant said the continued decline was a result of lower prices and higher costs in producing its next generation of processor.
The company cut prices on several of its Pentium 4 chips on Sunday, with the prices on several chip lines falling 19 percent. Such drops are a part of Intel's business model, which revolves around dropping chip prices as the company introduces faster, more powerful processors.
Intel is set to introduce its next generation of the Pentium 4 chip, which has a speed of 1.7 gigahertz, next Monday, people within the industry said. Analysts who follow Intel said the price on the chip would probably be immediately dropped from $700 to $500, and possibly as low as $350.
"If it debuts at $350, that's a big, big drop," Eric M. Ross, a research analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners, said. Mr. Ross, who said such an initial price was nevertheless plausible, said Intel found itself in intense price competition from Advanced Micro Devices, which, he said, had begun to make a name for itself among consumers as a viable, reliable alternative to Intel. "We're going into a pricing war," he said.
Mr. Ross said the tough economic conditions had fueled the competition because consumers had become price sensitive and were wary of how much value they were getting. "What's driving the market is price to performance, not just performance," he said, adding the price competition could lead to deals on computers that make this "the best time for consumers in five years."
Max Baron, editor in chief of Microprocessor Report in Sunnyvale, Calif., said the price wars, while they might take a bite out of revenue, would probably not pose a long term threat to Intel's business stability.
Intel said it was spending $7.5 billion this year on capital investments, including research and development, and Mr. Baron said Intel's continued commitment suggested that the company was taking the steps necessary to help define the future of processors and of their architecture.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 20, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Wednesday about Intel's quarterly earnings misstated the amount the company said it was spending this year on capital investments and research and development. It is $7.5 billion for capital investments and about $4.2 billion for research and development, not a total of $7.5 billion.

HEADLINE: Some Suffer Tax Hangovers From Microsoft Option Spree 

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
During the 1990's, Seattle echoed with tales of Microsoft millionaires, ordinary workers who became wealthy from stock options the company had awarded.
 Now that Microsoft's stock has fallen to about half its peak, Seattle is abuzz with other stories, those of Microsoft employees deep in debt and filing for bankruptcy. 
 Mike Fitzgerald, the trustee overseeing Chapter 13 bankruptcy filings by individuals in the western district of Washington, estimated recently that he had seen 25 cases filed by Microsoft workers related to options. "These stock options looked so good that people lost track of what they were intended to do," he said. "They were a second-tier excuse for Microsoft instead of paying them a real salary. It's really a world of hurt." 
As at other technology companies, the woes of workers at Microsoft stem in large part from tax bills incurred when the options were exercised. Worse still, some people who were experienced engineers and programmers yet naive about the stock market turned their options into stock and then borrowed against those shares to pay their taxes. The high-risk practice, known as a margin loan, is more often a tool of speculators aiming to buy additional stock without additional money. As the stock fell, these workers' shares were sold, leaving them broke.
One midlevel Microsoft employee said that a broker at Salomon Smith Barney, the firm hired by Microsoft to administer its option program, pushed him to take such risks. At the peak, his shares were worth about $1.5 million. But last fall, when the stock began to dive, the firm began selling shares out of his account to pay off the loan. Now most of his stock is gone and he owes $100,000 in taxes, more than he makes in a year and more than he has. His only remaining asset is a modest Seattle home, which he and his wife fear they will lose.
His tale and those of others who say they unknowingly took on risks raise questions about whether brokers have failed to live up to regulatory requirements, including the need to determine if an investment or strategy is suitable for a client. The brokerage firms profited from the interest on margin accounts, while investors suffered.
Lena Diethelm, an enrolled agent at the tax preparation firm Numbershuffler in Palo Alto, Calif., said she had heard many similar stories from workers in Silicon Valley and faults brokers for urging employees to borrow to pay taxes.
"I think these practices are predatory," Ms. Diethelm said. "The brokerage firms have conflicts of interest, but the employees don't understand the relationship the companies have with each other. They don't understand the risks, and the brokers minimize the risks."
When a brokerage firm oversees a corporate option program, it has two masters: the company that pays it and the company's employees, who are often steered its way for financial advice. The brokerage firm is paid to help employees exercise their options, and it profits when employees bring it additional business. Likewise, the company that issues options reaps tax breaks and can get other financial benefits when employees exercise them.
Microsoft and Salomon Smith Barney, which is now part of Citigroup, maintain that there was no conflict of interest because their contract extended only to the exercise of options and employees were free to approach any firm for financial advice.
Any advice comes from a division of Salomon separate from the one it pays for administration, Microsoft noted. Susan Thompson, a Salomon spokeswoman, said, "They're actually entirely separate businesses that serve different clients and different client needs." 
But it is no surprise that many Microsoft workers wind up taking financial advice from Salomon. In company documents, Salomon is identified as Microsoft's "preferred broker" and employees are told they can "take advantage of additional products and services" by opening a full-service account at Salomon.
When asked whether Salomon has a policy governing its customers' use of margin, the firm declined to comment. But its Web site says "margin accounts can be very risky, and they are not suitable for all investors." Among the risks described, "you can lose more money than you have invested" and "you may be forced to sell some or all of your securities when there is a decline in your account equity value." 
Microsoft recognized early on that options allowed it to attract talented employees and keep salaries in check. The company and its workers benefited as the stock surged.
The Microsoft worker who told his story on the condition that he not be identified said he had not planned to turn the options into stock for some time, believing Microsoft's price would continue to rise. Because the difference of the price of the option from the market price of the stock on the day of purchase, known as the spread, would be taxable as ordinary income, the couple would have a big tax bill. Most people sell shares immediately to pay the taxes, as the couple had done in the past.
The couple was persuaded to buy some 20,000 shares with options in 1999 and 2000 by Salomon Smith Barney, they said, and advised to put the shares in a margin account to generate cash for taxes and other expenses like home improvements.
Larry Feinstein, a partner at the law firm of Bortman & Feinstein in Seattle, has a handful of Microsoft employees as clients who borrowed against their shares to pay taxes. "These are middle-management people that all of a sudden have to file bankruptcy," he said. "The brokers are more than happy to loan you the money and charge interest on it."
Having borrowed against the shares, the programmer and his wife received calls for cash from their broker when the stock fell last year. Although rules at brokerage firms vary, a customer who pledges stock for a margin loan may have to put up more money when the shares decline to 40 percent of the value of the loan. 
When the couple could not put up more cash, their shares were sold to meet repeated margin calls. They now have a looming tax bill and virtually no equity.
Salomon, they said, did not fully explain the risks of margin. "They should have been a lot more forthcoming with the information," the programmer said. "We did not get into the stock market voluntarily. We were paid in stock and were forced into the stock market with stock options. We trusted our broker to have our best interests at heart." 
Lewis D. Lowenfels, an authority in securities law at Tolins & Lowenfels, a law firm in New York, said that the broker in this case might have run afoul of the suitability requirements of the National Association of Securities Dealers. "It does not appear to be suitable to take people with these limited means and to leverage them so that their entire net worth is at the mercy of fluctuations in the price of Microsoft stock," he said.
Salomon's profits on the margin loan taken by the Microsoft programmer were sizable. According to a computation by the worker's accountant, the annual interest charged by Salomon on his margin loan was $60,000 to $80,000 -- roughly his yearly salary. At one point the loan, which fluctuated based both on the level of borrowing and the stock price, approached $800,000.
Of course, there are times when it is wise to cash in stock options. Most employee options have a finite life. People who are convinced the stock is going higher may choose to exercise options before they expire, pay the taxes on the income that is generated and hold the shares so that any future profits are taxed at the lower long-term capital gains rates.
According to the couple in Seattle, the Salomon broker made this argument in late 1998. Roughly 40 percent of the programmer's options would begin expiring in three years, the broker said, so they should start turning them into shares. 
Initially, the couple rejected the idea because of the tax bill it would create. Then came a different pitch. 
"The stockbroker said one reason to exercise the options was because if I got hit by a bus, my wife would have no access to them," the programmer said. Only recently, when the couple reread the option plan did they find that the options would have gone to her if he had died.
The Salomon spokeswoman said: "We don't comment on anonymous allegations." 
The Microsoft programmer now acknowledges that it was a mistake to rely on his broker to the degree that he did and not to read the documents before deciding to exercise the options.
Like Salomon, Microsoft stood to benefit when its employees exercised their options. The company gets a tax deduction equal to the spread on which the employee pays income taxes. In fact, the tax break has greatly reduced and in some cases eliminated tax bills at profitable corporations like Microsoft, Cisco Systems and Dell Computer in recent years.
And when workers exercise options, they help their employer in another way, by reducing the number of options outstanding. Around the time the programmer and his wife say they were encouraged to exercise options, Microsoft was under pressure from institutional investors to reduce its options outstanding.
By 1999, the number of options that Microsoft had set aside for grants had ballooned.
Pat McGurn, president of Institutional Shareholder Services, said that the amount of Microsoft options, which dilute the voting power and value of existing shareholders, was roughly three times the recommended level in its industry. 
"The real problem is that these plans are growing so quickly," Mr. McGurn said. "So companies have made a conscious effort in recent years to get people to push more options through the pipeline."
Caroline Boren, a Microsoft spokeswoman, said the company had never tried to influence personal financial decisions of its employees.
"Microsoft cares deeply about its employees and wants them to be successful financially, even in a tough economic climate," Ms. Boren said. "The company makes it easy for employees to access and complete transactions regarding their stock options, but ultimately the decisions on how and when to utilize these benefits reside with the employee."
While employees receiving options typically have to sign a document to signify their acceptance of the plan's terms, as the programmer did, there is little regulation of such materials to ensure that the risks are clear. This contrasts with employee pension plans, which must disclose benefits and risks in plain English to employees, according to Christine Jolls, professor of law at the Harvard Law School. 
"Options are a whole new form of employee benefit that has grown up relatively recently," Ms. Jolls said. "It does seem to be a new development in the employee relationship that the law hasn't focused on."
Mr. McGurn said that the prospect of employees being forced into bankruptcy is an unforeseen consequence of the option boom. "We've given options to fairly financially unsophisticated individuals and to people who don't understand the risk inherent in them," he said. "You wouldn't allow these folks to invest in a hedge fund, but we allow them to make six-figure bets on stock options without the benefit of any independent financial advice."

Chip of Fools

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
At the level of bits and bytes, the most surprising thing about the advance of information technology has been the absence of surprises. Back in 1965 Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, predicted that the number of transistors on a chip would henceforth double every 18 to 24 months -- and Moore's Law has worked like digital clockwork ever since. But the translation of bits and bytes into dollars and cents is far harder to predict. And so it is no wonder, or cause for shame, when smart people get the economic impact of technology wrong. 
 For the last few years, the joke has been on those -- including me -- who were skeptical about the economic payoff to information processing. Now, alas, it is the optimists who look foolish. They thought the "new economy" would be not only faster-growing but more stable than the old economy. What we've learned in the last few months -- most recently in Monday's grim news from Cisco Systems -- is that they were wrong. 
 A brief history of the economics of information technology would go like this: From the early 1970's until the middle of the 1990's technology was a big disappointment. Nifty gadgets like the fax machine became widely available, yet seemed to do little or nothing for the overall productivity of the economy. Many of us glumly concluded that the U.S. economy was stuck with a disappointing long-run growth rate of around 2.5 percent. 
And then, around 1995, everything changed. For reasons that are still unclear, suddenly all that investment in information technology started to pay off. Those who had called the turn correctly -- like Alan Greenspan -- looked brilliant, while those of us who had been reluctant to change our views began to feel silly.
Meanwhile the optimists began to hail the new economy not just for its growth but for its stability. Articles with titles like "The End of the Business Cycle" started to receive favorable attention. Even sober analysts began to question the classic script for a slump, in which a slowdown in consumer spending and investment leads to a buildup of business inventories, and businesses are then forced into severe production cutbacks to work off those inventories.
No more, said the optimists. Here's how one starry-eyed observer put it: "The same forces that have been boosting growth in structural productivity seem also to have accelerated the process of cyclical adjustment. . . . New technologies for supply-chain management and flexible manufacturing imply that businesses can perceive imbalances in inventories at a very early stage -- virtually in real time -- and can cut production promptly in response to the developing signs of unintended inventory building." 
Whoops. In fact, as demand from consumers leveled off last year, American businesses were slow to cut production, and ended up with huge excess inventories. And some of the worst stories of excess inventory accumulation involve companies selling the very information systems that were supposed to make that "real time" management possible.
Cisco, whose equipment plays a key role in the Internet -- and which has presented itself as the very model of a modern e-business -- is the case in point. The company's woes aren't simply a matter of declining demand; it also failed to adjust, ramping up inventories just as the bottom fell out of sales. Now it has taken a $2.5 billion write-down on inventory that it expects to sell only at reduced prices. 
It may take some time to figure out what went wrong. Perhaps it was business strategy: Cisco used the Internet to become a "virtual company," with most of its products manufactured by others, reducing costs but perhaps also reducing control. And perhaps some of it was sheer hubris: technology may have given managers the illusion that they knew more than they did. One friend points out that high-tech managers insisting that they had everything under control sounded a bit like old-fashioned Soviet central planners.
What's important is that policy makers realize that some of the happier tales of the new economy were only myths. We must hope that comforting stories that we now know to be untrue haven't bred a sense of complacency. And that's where I get a bit nervous. For that romantic fantasy about "real time" adjustment was a quotation from Alan Greenspan's testimony on monetary policy, less than two months ago.

30 Employees Laid Off At Cohn & Wolfe

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott and Allison Fass 

 BODY:
 In another sign of the slowing economy, Cohn & Wolfe in New York, a public relations unit of Young & Rubicam, laid off 30 employees yesterday, about 8.6 percent of its American staff of more than 350. 
 Stephen Aiello, president and worldwide chief executive at Cohn & Wolfe, attributed the layoffs, to be spread among all the agency's American offices and practices, to the economic downturn, cautiousness among clients and some normal attrition. Cohn & Wolfe also laid off 10 employees in January. Young & Rubicam is part of the WPP Group.

Continents Clash on Content

BYLINE:  By AMY ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Courts in France, Germany and Italy rocked the cyberspace world in recent months with rulings banning content from their borders that does not meet their national laws. The ensuing uproar over certain cases -- most notably the French decision to prohibit the display of Nazi insignia and pro-Nazi remarks on Yahoo's auction site -- highlighted differences between Europe and the United States (and even differences within Europe) on the best ways to regulate the Internet.
 The New York Times asked Erkki Liikanen, a technology expert who is a Finnish member of the European Commission (an executive arm of the European Union), and Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat who is a co-chairman of the Congressional Internet Caucus, to discuss the issue. Their comments follow. AMY ZUCKERMAN 

COMMISSIONER LIIKANEN
I also believe in a free Internet. That's the E.U. position. It isn't the case that Europeans want to regulate everything, but there are cases where national law and online practice are in conflict. And there are problems where the offline content is illegal.
When it comes to criminal law, such as in the Yahoo case in France, that is a matter of national law. Criminal law is still under the jurisdiction of the 15 member states. The French court can rule as it likes.
One needs to understand French sensibilities in cases like Yahoo. You can't blame people for having strong feelings around Nazism. The issue is how can we create a consensus on Internet regulation while respecting each other's jurisdictions. 
Americans are in favor of a free Internet because of their history of First Amendment, free-speech rights, but can we find solutions that respect each others sensibilities?
It's our basic assumption that when you do business in an area, you have to respect local law just as you do offline. And the medium, because of the way it operates, presents certain difficulties that present a challenge to industry to resolve through self-regulation.
For now we want to make it very clear that we don't want to overregulate the Internet. But if we say it's illegal offline, then what's happening online should not be outside that jurisdiction.

SENATOR LEAHY
In some cases, it's like saying you're a commercial airline and you can't fly into our airport because passenger No. 312 has in her knapsack a book that we don't want in our country.
Governments, basically, should resist trying to develop special rules for the Internet. There are model ways of doing Internet regulation, but to think that government, any government here or in Europe, is going to develop a whole set of rules for the Internet, they're making a bad mistake.
The problem arose in this country with the Communications Decency Act. That said we're going to have special obscenity rules for the Internet that don't apply to bookstores, newsstands, libraries or even mail-order houses, but just the Internet. Well, that didn't work. Indecency rules just don't work, and the temptation of government is to apply rules on the Internet that they wouldn't do otherwise.
With so many countries over there, you're not going to get consensus by accident. We have to be technologically neutral the way we have with telephone lines and digital signatures, but when you get into the area of content there's a major problem because of the differences from country to country.
I believe the Europeans are making a mistake setting up a special case for the Internet. 
The bottom line is, if you have criminal content, nail the criminal. Don't close down the Internet.

HEADLINE: Battle of San Miguel Takes an Unusual Path 

BYLINE:  By WAYNE ARNOLD 

 BODY:
In an effort to topple a bitter political foe from the helm of the most important company in the Philippines, the three-month-old administration of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo is preparing to wage, of all things, a proxy fight.
 In full-page advertisements in Philippine newspapers this week, a government pension fund asked stockholders in the San Miguel Corporation to let it vote their shares at the company's annual meeting on May 3. Though the mechanics are murky, the aim is clear: to gain control of San Miguel's 15-member board and oust its chairman, Eduardo M. Cojuangco Jr. 
 The ploy is an extraordinary departure from the legislation, regulation and litigation that governments typically use to rein in corporations. But this is no ordinary political grudge, and San Miguel is no ordinary company. 
Its namesake beer, in distinctive squat brown bottles, is ubiquitous. It has food processing, beverage and packaging interests throughout East Asia. It posted $2 billion in sales last year and paid more taxes into the Philippines' deeply indebted treasury than almost any other private entity. By itself it is responsible for about 7 percent of the whole economy's output. 
Mr. Cojuangco gained control of San Miguel during the rule of his close friend, the former president, Ferdinand E. Marcos. After 13 years of boardroom exile after the fall of Mr. Marcos, Mr. Cojuangco regained control with help from another close political ally and former president, Joseph E. Estrada, whom Ms. Arroyo replaced after mass street protests in January. Now Mr. Cojuangco is helping organize the election campaigns of Ms. Arroyo's opponents.
But the government's effort to remove a man many Filipinos see as an icon of the cronyism that has kept economic power in the hands of a few powerful families is complicated by the praise he has earned from investors and analysts for the revival of San Miguel's bottom line.
Though they are aware of the political climate, many analysts and investors are anxious about whom the government might name to replace Mr. Cojuangco.
The battle also threatens to scuttle a widely hailed $1.25 billion deal for San Miguel and the Coca-Cola Company to buy the local Coke bottler from Coca-Cola Amatil of Australia.
The seeds of the dispute were planted in the 1970's, when Mr. Marcos imposed a tax on coconuts, a major cash crop, ostensibly to finance development and marketing for the industry. In fact, the money found its way into a bank controlled by Mr. Cojuangco, who used it to take over San Miguel. 
When Mr. Marcos flew to exile in Hawaii in 1986, Mr. Cojuangco went with him, and the new president, Corazon C. Aquino, ordered the coconut-financed stake in San Miguel placed in escrow until the courts could determine its rightful owner. Mr. Cojuangco returned in 1992 and ran unsuccessfully for president, with Mr. Estrada as his running mate. 
In 1998, Mr. Estrada became president, and the Supreme Court gave Mr. Cojuangco permission to vote a portion of the sequestered shares equal to 20 percent of San Miguel's outstanding stock. The ruling effectively gave Mr. Cojuangco three seats on San Miguel's board -- and the chairmanship.
Few analysts are willing to say much on the record about San Miguel these days because of the charged atmosphere. But they will say that Mr. Cojuangco has done an impressive job cutting costs and increasing sales. San Miguel's net income rose 82 percent in 1999, to 6.02 billion pesos ($120 million).
Left beyond Mr. Cojuangco's reach in the Supreme Court's decision, however, was a further 27 percent stake of sequestered shares, controlling five board seats. Mr. Estrada's government appointed those directors instead. 
Ms. Arroyo's administration has now asked the Supreme Court to let it replace those five with its own appointees at the annual meeting, even though the deadline for new board nominations passed on Jan. 20, coincidentally the day the new president took office. With two seats already held by government pension funds, naming those five would give the government seven board votes. San Miguel is opposing the move in court.
This is where the ads come in. If it musters enough proxies from other shareholders, the government can gain control of an eighth seat -- and have enough votes to dismiss Mr. Cojuangco.
Timing is crucial. Elections will be held on May 14 for most of the Philippine Senate and the whole House of Representatives, plus thousands of provincial positions.
Mr. Estrada's support among the poor remains strong despite accusations of corruption, perjury and plunder, and Mr. Cojuangco also remains actively involved in politics.

HEADLINE: Bush Says He'll Press Effort For Hemisphere Trade Pact 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17 

 BODY:
President Bush pledged today to intensify his efforts with Congress to win negotiating authority to build a free trade area from Alaska to Argentina just days before he travels to Canada for a summit meeting of leaders from the hemisphere. 
 In a speech before the Organization of American States, the central forum for 34 governments of the Americas, Mr. Bush said striking down trade barriers was critical to sustaining democracy and generating wealth throughout the region. 
 "There is a vital link between freedom of people and freedom of commerce," Mr. Bush said. "Democratic freedoms cannot flourish unless our hemisphere also builds a prosperity whose benefits are widely shared. Open trade is an essential foundation for that prosperity and that possibility." 
On Friday, Mr. Bush plans to join his colleagues from Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean in Quebec City. The politicians plan to commit themselves to meeting a January 2005 deadline to create what would be the world's largest free trade zone, encompassing 800 million people.
"Nothing we do in Quebec will be more important or have a greater long-term impact," Mr. Bush said.
Despite his statement, Mr. Bush has yet to submit legislation to Congress to seek trade-negotiating or "fast track" authority. Supporters of the free trade area say such authority, which lapsed in 1994 under President Bill Clinton, is essential because it requires lawmakers to vote for or against an agreement without amending it.
Mr. Bush said that he was devising a strategy with congressional supporters to win the negotiating authority and that he had personally pressed his case with more than 100 lawmakers. "Trade promotion authority gives our trading partners confidence that they can rely on the deals that they negotiate," he said.
But skeptics in Congress said they would not support the authority unless the president guaranteed that any agreement would include provisions to protect labor rights and the environment. "If we learned anything in Seattle, it's that both labor and the environment need a seat at the table," said Michael Siegal, a spokesman for Max Baucus of Montana, senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. "These concerns need to be addressed in the scope of the agreement."
Thousands of demonstrators are widely expected to converge on Quebec over the weekend to protest the effects of globalization on workers and the environment in a sequel to the protests in 1999 at the Seattle trade talks. At a news conference today in Quebec, labor, environmental and consumer groups criticized the proposed free trade area.
The president of the Sierra Club, Robbie Cox, called the North American Free Trade Agreement of 1994 among the United States, Mexico and Canada "one of the most highly irresponsible trade policies in U.S. history" and said it must not be the basis for a broader agreement.
Many Latin American governments oppose including labor and environmental rules in trade negotiations, saying they do not want other nations dictating their domestic laws. The issue was especially contentious with Mexico in the talks that resulted in Nafta. Negotiators ended up relegating labor and environmental standards to side agreements that have generally been viewed as inadequate.
On Monday, after meeting President Ricardo Lagos of Chile, Mr. Bush said that he would seek to conclude a free trade agreement with Chile by the end of the year. 
Lawmakers predicted that deal would go through regardless of whether Mr. Bush has the fast-track authority. At $6 billion a year, two-way trade with Chile is not too likely to affect the American economy significantly, and many members of Congress are eager to reward Chile for its economic growth and democratic reforms.
In an interview, Mr. Lagos said the challenge for Latin American governments was to show the connection between trade and growth on one hand and greater well-being for ordinary citizens on the other. "Progress has to mean you are going to have better schools, you are going to have drinkable water," he said.
Mr. Bush was warmly received in his first appearance at the O.A.S. After he ended his his remarks, diplomats stood to applaud. The president gamely spoke a few words in Spanish, among them, "I need to practice." By the time he leaves for Quebec, he will have met six presidents from the hemisphere and traveled to Mexico. President Clinton did not visit Latin America until his second term.
"There's a pretty good feeling that this administration knows about Latin America and cares about the region," said Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a forum of prominent officials and academics.
Mr. Hakim predicted that Mr. Bush would fare better than his predecessor at securing the trade negotiating authority, because unlike Mr. Clinton, he will not be undercut by leaders from his own party. Referring to Mr. Bush, Mr. Hakim said, "It's a more natural part of his luggage."

BELGIUM: NUNS IN GENOCIDE TRIAL -- Four Rwandans, including two Roman Catholic nuns, went on trial in Brussels charged with taking part in the killing of 5,000 people in Rwanda in 1994. The nuns are accused of helping Hutu soldiers track down people who had sought refuge in their convent during the massacres that left an estimated 800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu dead in the central African state. (Reuters)

GERMANY: RELIC OF WAR -- Chancellor Gerhard Schroder said he would soon visit the newly discovered grave of his father, a soldier who was killed in Romania during World War II. Mr. Schroder's elder sister recently traced the site in the village of Ceanu Mare near the northwestern Romanian city of Cluj, where their father, Fritz, was killed in action at the age of 32 on Oct. 4, 1944. Mr. Schroder was born on April 7, 1944, and never met his father.

GREECE: DIPLOMATS ATTACKED -- A car carrying an Israeli diplomat in Athens was doused with gasoline and set on fire, but no one was injured. Responsibility for the attack, followed by a similar strike against a Thai embassy vehicle, was claimed by the Revolutionary Violence Group, the newest addition to a list of cells raiding foreign missions and businesses.
 Anthee Carassava (NYT)

KOSOVO: TAX PROTEST -- Hundreds of Serbs blocked roads to protest a new United Nations-imposed tax on goods from the rest of Serbia, calling the measure a step toward secession. Yugoslavia's Interior Minister also complained, saying Belgrade had not approved the taxes in Kosovo, which is technically still part of the Yugoslav federation. The United Nations administration has been trying to rebuild the province's economy, in part by levying duties. (Agence France-Presse)

CUBA: BAY OF PIGS REMEMBERED -- President Fidel Castro reaffirmed his commitment to Communism as Cubans began celebrating the 40th anniversary of victory over United States-backed forces at the Bay of Pigs. Without American air support, more than 1,000 invaders were captured in the invasion. Another 100 invaders and 151 defenders died. (AP)

ASIA --

SRI LANKA: TRUCE VIOLATION -- The government and separatist rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam blamed each other for a violent clash on Monday between navy and Tiger boats. The Tigers declared a cease-fire four months ago and the government had announced one that was to last through the weekend until yesterday for the Sinhalese and Tamil New Year.
 Celia W. Dugger (NYT)

SRI LANKA: AMERICAN WOUNDED -- Marie Colvin, an American journalist working for The Sunday Times, the British newspaper, was caught in a firefight and hit by shrapnel as she tried to cross from territory held by Tamil rebels into a government-controlled area. The government criticized Ms. Colvin for venturing into rebel territory without authorization.

UZBEKISTAN: OPPONENT FORCED INTO HOSPITAL -- Government-affiliated human rights representatives said they agreed with the authorities' decision to force a leading political activist to enter a psychiatric hospital. The New York-based Human Rights Watch condemned the action against Yelena Urlayev, who had organized protests against the government, as Soviet-style repression. But the country's parliamentary human rights ombudsman and the head of the government-backed national rights center said the diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia supported hospitalization. Douglas Frantz (NYT)

INDIA: STALEMATE OVER BRIBERY INQUIRY -- Parliament reconvened after a three-week recess only to be paralyzed by opposition demands for a parliamentary investigation of a journalistic expose of corruption in military procurement deals. The opposition Congress Party is unwilling to settle for the ruling coalition's decision to seek an independent inquiry into the charges by a retired judge. Celia W. Dugger (NYT)

PHILIPPINES: ESTRADA CHARGES TRIMMED -- State prosecutors said they were dropping five of eight criminal charges filed against former President Joseph Estrada in the hope of winning a swift verdict against him for economic plunder, a crime punishable by death. Mr. Estrada, toppled in a popular revolt three months ago, is accused of abusing his position to amass more than $80 million. (Agence France-Presse)

MIDDLE EAST

IRAN, SAUDI ARABIA: SECURITY PACT -- Iran and Saudi Arabia signed an accord to combat terrorism and drug trafficking, calling it a "big step" in improving regional security and relations between the two nations. Relations soured after the 1979 Islamic Revolution brought a radical clerical government to power in Iran. (AP)

AFRICA

ERITREA: WITHDRAWAL ANNOUNCED -- Eritrea said it had completed a long-awaited withdrawal from a buffer zone as part of a peace deal to end its two-year war with Ethiopia. If confirmed, the move would represent progress in the effort to settle a border dispute between the Horn of Africa neighbors under United Nations supervision. (Reuters)

NIGERIA: SHARIAH VIGILANTES -- Islamic vigilantes burned down bars and restaurants in the capital of the northern state of Kano in a drive to enforce strict Muslim Shariah law. Residents said Shariah enforcers had been on the rampage since last week, attacking mainly at night. Kano, which adopted Shariah last November, is among half a dozen Nigerian states to have introduced it, but Islamic fundamentalists say enforcement has been lax. (Reuters)

HEADLINE: Bush Endorses Rule On Lead Emissions Proposed by Clinton 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17 

 BODY:
Facing criticism that it cares more about promoting industry than protecting the environment, the Bush administration announced today that it would go forward with a regulation proposed by President Bill Clinton to require thousands of businesses to make public the details of their emissions of lead into the environment. 
 The announcement, which could have been a routine event at the Environmental Protection Agency, was made in a relatively splashy fashion at the White House. It followed an announcement on Monday that the administration was leaving in place regulations expanding protections for wetlands. In both cases, the president himself issued statements applauding the decisions. 
 With environmental groups threatening protests on Sunday, the 31st anniversary of Earth Day, Mr. Bush's spokesman emphasized today what he said were the positive steps the president had taken on the environment. These include putting money in his proposed budget to clean up the national parks and nearly doubling the money for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. 
Some Republicans said that until this week the administration had been ham-handed both in its environmental policy and in its announcements, and urged Vice President Dick Cheney in a meeting on April 4 to make better public presentations of their case.
The announcement today -- supported by a broad array of environmental groups and opposed by small businesses -- allows a rule by the Clinton administration to take effect. It will require companies that handle as little as 100 pounds of lead a year to report to the Environmental Protection Agency how much is released into the air, soil and water. Until now, the reporting threshold had been at least 10,000 pounds a year. 
Officials estimated that the rule meant nearly 10,000 additional plants would have to report emissions.
The new rules, which businesses are challenging in court, will do nothing directly to curb emissions and, some environmentalists pointed out, fulfilled Mr. Bush's view that regulations should not be too costly to business. But the details provided by the companies will be available to the public, and businesses say that setting up a way to provide the information will cost them. 
The announcement on the lead reporting rules was made by Christie Whitman, the E.P.A. administrator, who said public scrutiny had helped reduce emissions of other toxic substances. "Information is power," she said.
In response to a question at a news conference, Mrs. Whitman sought to correct what she said was a false impression that Mr. Bush favored industry over the environment. "This president cares about these issues," she said. "This administration has an extraordinarily good environmental record."
The administration is expected to continue such announcements for the foreseeable future.
"There will be a series of new initiatives the president is launching," Ari Fleischer, the president's spokesman, said today.
Mr. Fleischer disputed suggestions that the decision was an effort to blunt criticism from environmental groups, who are planning Earth Day demonstrations in Washington and in Quebec, where Mr. Bush will be discussing trade policies this weekend.
The timing of this week's announcements was driven in part by the calendar. The administration had 60 days from the effective date of many rules approved in the final days of the Clinton administration to reject the rules or let them stand. 
Mr. Fleischer today denied that the recent announcements were being done for effect. "The president is not concerned about his image," Mr. Fleischer said. "The president is concerned about results." 
Still, the White House has clearly been stung by the reaction to many Bush decisions, which critics in the Democratic Party and leaders of private environmental groups contend place the health of the economy above that of the earth.
These decisions include Mr. Bush's opposition to a treaty on global warming, his reversal of a campaign promise to cut carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, his eagerness to drill for oil in Alaska, a decision to repeal tighter limits for arsenic in drinking water, his proposed budget cuts of 6.7 percent in environmental programs, his proposal to limit the ability of citizens to use lawsuits to protect endangered species, rolling back standards for air-conditioners even as he proclaims an energy crisis, and the lifting of a rule that limited chemical runoff from mines.
Today, a Gallup poll showed that Americans favored environmental protection over energy drilling and economic growth. It also showed that the public disapproved of the administration's decision not to adhere to the treaty on global warming. And a coalition of environmental groups is beginning a television advertising campaign on Wednesday denouncing the president's environmental policies and urging viewers to tell their legislators to restore money he proposes to cut from the budget for environmental programs.
Last week, Laura Bush, the first lady, gave an interview to USA Today in which she described at length the eco-friendly aspects of the Bushes' new ranch house near Crawford, Tex., where the couple recycle their rainwater and household water for irrigation and use a geothermal heating and cooling system so efficient that they scrapped plans for solar energy panels.
Deb Callahan, president of the League of Conservation Voters, said of the administration: "They know they're in political trouble on the environment, and they wanted to make a show about some positive action, so they came out today with modest forward action, not something bold and sweeping. The environmental community is still very skeptical and deeply concerned about the trajectory this administration is taking."
But it is not just the leaders of environmental groups to whom the White House is trying to appeal. Polls have shown repeatedly that the public places a high value on the environment and gives Mr. Bush low marks for his handling of it.
"His weakest issue-rating has been on the environment," said Glen Bolger, a Republican pollster.
A New York Times poll conducted last month showed Republicans more or less equally divided on Mr. Bush's handling of the environment. But Democrats, independents, women and suburbanites all lopsidedly favored protecting the environment over producing energy, regardless of the cost. Mr. Bush cannot afford to alienate independents, women and suburbanites, the majority of whom voted last year for Al Gore. The big states with important suburban voting blocs -- New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois and California -- all went to Mr. Gore.
"Bush won states like West Virginia because of Al Gore's environmental extremism," Mr. Bolger said. But, he said, the president cannot continue to count on that same dynamic. "It will be hard for Bush to win New York, New Jersey or Connecticut. Swing voters in the Northeast -- I'm not sure how important they are in terms of crass political calculations, but you don't want to be seen as anti-environment. You don't have to be as green as Al Gore, but there's a middle ground."
Representative Christopher Shays, Republican of Connecticut, said that in the meeting of moderates with Mr. Cheney, the lawmakers told the vice president: "The environment is the one area you aren't handling well." 
Mr. Shays said Mr. Cheney agreed. "They didn't argue with us," Mr. Shays said. "What they are changing now is their presentation."
That matters to other Republicans for whom the environment is an increasingly important issue.
Representative Clay E. Shaw Jr., a Florida Republican who squeaked into his 11th term last year with just 50 percent of the vote, said of Mr. Bush's handling of the environment: "As a Monday-morning quarterback, you can certainly see that the message could have been softened, it could have been eased out. The president is going to have to continue to make these announcements to let it be known that he is evenhanded. It's just smart politics."

HEADLINE: Government Signs Harlem Lease for Clinton Office 

BYLINE:  By SUSAN SAULNY 

 BODY:
After months of uncertainty and a high-profile search that took him from Midtown to Harlem, Bill Clinton finally has an office suite in Manhattan that he can call his own.
 Yesterday, officials from the United States General Services Administration signed a 10-year lease that makes the former president a tenant on the penthouse floor of the 14-story building at 55 West 125th Street in Harlem. The lease allows Mr. Clinton to occupy 8,300 square feet at the top of the building between Lenox and Fifth Avenues, paying $261,450 per year -- or $31.50 per square foot, said Viki Reath, a spokeswoman for the G.S.A. 
 The lease also includes just over 300 square feet for the Secret Service. The Treasury Department will pay for that space at the same rate.
Mr. Clinton, who is on vacation with his wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, in the Dominican Republic, was said to be "very excited" on hearing news of the lease signing.
"He's looking forward to doing his post-presidential work and being a good neighbor in Harlem," said Julia Payne, a spokeswoman for Mr. Clinton. "He's thankful for all the hard work."
Ms. Reath said the General Services Administration, which leases space for government employees and former presidents, prohibits discussion of lease negotiations. But she added that the landlord would contribute $337,060 toward tenant improvements in installments over the 10-year term of the lease. Electricity is also included in the rent.
The lease can be terminated at the end of the second, sixth or eighth year, Ms. Reath said.
Mr. Clinton is expected to move into the space in July. But before then, the neighborhood is planning a housewarming party of sorts, according to the man who is the unofficial organizer, Representative Charles B. Rangel, who first suggested that the president move to Harlem. 
"There were so many groups that wanted to do it individually, I said, 'Let's just put it on hold and make it one big event,' " Mr. Rangel said. "I'm so excited, because as I explained to the president, it's not just a great coup to our community to have a former president here. There is symbolic importance to the president working in an area that is going through an economic revival."
Faced with a barrage of criticism for his initial decision to rent lavish office space on the 56th floor of a Midtown skyscraper, Mr. Clinton turned his attention uptown, where his more modest space has equally panoramic views of Central Park and proximity to a number of cultural landmarks, including the Apollo Theater.
Mr. Rangel also said there was no stigma attached to being choice No. 2.
"It doesn't bother me a bit," he said with a laugh. "I can't tell you how many lasting marriages have been the result of second choices." 

CORRECTION-DATE: April 21, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about the signing of a lease for former President Bill Clinton's offices in Harlem gave an incorrect total from the General Services Administration for the annual federal payment to the landlord. It will be $346,128, not $261,450. Details appear today in an article on Page B4.

HEADLINE: Platform Built on a Divided City; 
Ferrer Courts Voters He Says Giuliani Left Behind

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
With a triumphant gait, Fernando Ferrer strode into the ornate auditorium at the Bronx Community College recently to deliver what was to be his final message as the Bronx borough president. His speech that chilly morning was somewhat valedictory, focusing on his list of accomplishments in the borough: the development of new housing, the upturn for the borough's small businesses, and the perception that the Bronx is no longer the city's laughingstock.
 Then Mr. Ferrer turned in a decidedly different, more politically charged direction as he offered a sustained critique of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's stewardship of the city. Adopting themes he would hone with crisper reproaches in the weeks to come, Mr. Ferrer described a city with two sets of inhabitants: those who have benefited from a better New York, and those who feel they have been left out of the city's resurgence. 
 "I don't believe the last eight years of city leadership need set the table for the four years to come," Mr. Ferrer said. "Measure what has happened during the past eight years. Measure it by the deep divisions in our city today -- the divide between our police force and the communities they serve; the educational divide that robs our children; the economic divide, prevalent in communities of color, a divide widened by the injustices and lack of opportunity in communities like the Bronx all across this town." 
He continued: "Across this city, entire communities have been demonized, ignored, shut out, shut down," Mr. Ferrer said. "And that is wrong. The policies of the past eight years must be challenged."
As Mr. Ferrer takes on his second campaign for mayor, he is using a far different approach from his three main rivals for the Democratic nomination. In his effort to become the city's first mayor of Puerto Rican descent, he is aiming squarely at what he considers the missteps and missed opportunities of the Giuliani administration, portraying it as tone deaf to the city's minority and less-affluent residents.
Running essentially as the anti-Rudy, Mr. Ferrer has been trying to tap into whatever is left of what was known as the Dinkins coalition: a bloc of Hispanic, black and so-called progressive white voters whose support narrowly elected Mayor David N. Dinkins, the city's first and only black mayor, in 1989. Mr. Ferrer seems to believe that these groups of voters, hardly monolithic in their beliefs or touchstone issues, can coalesce around a few basics: what he calls the abysmal record of the Giuliani administration on police brutality and what he sees as the pitiful condition of schools in the city's minority communities. 
Even his closest advisers say that his strategy carries enormous risks, because in attacking Mr. Giuliani's two-term record, he will no doubt alienate a sizable portion of voters who praise the mayor's efforts in fighting crime and in revitalizing the city. And Mr. Ferrer's tack gives the impression that he is consumed with constantly comparing his vision with that of the departing mayor rather than with establishing himself as distinct from the other candidates in the September primary.
"With this approach, you risk alienating white liberals who are quite happy with the city's economic rebound and the reductions in crime," said J. Phillip Thompson, an associate professor of political science at Columbia University. "And rightly or wrongly, they attribute some of that success to Giuliani. Ruth Messinger tried the anti-Giuliani approach," Mr. Thompson said, referring to the mayor's Democratic opponent in 1997, "and that just wasn't enough."
But Mr. Ferrer and his aides assert that his approach strikes a chord among a broad spectrum of New Yorkers who have been displeased with the conditions of the city's schools, with the lack of affordable housing for low- and moderate-income residents and with the relationship between the Police Department and some segments of the population.
Mr. Ferrer contends that black and Hispanic New Yorkers are not the only ones he views as having to contend with unevenly distributed city services. In a recent visit to Staten Island, Mr. Ferrer argued that he was speaking for those "who live in that other New York, the New York of overcrowded schools and inadequate mass transportation." He is seeking, he said, to represent, "the New York that's cut off from the rest of the city. I speak for that other city."
As evidence of the kind of coalition he is building, Mr. Ferrer points to the support he has already received from various officials. His most prominent endorsement has come from H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller, gubernatorial candidate and only black official to win statewide office in New York. And he has at his side Bill Lynch, the political strategist who was the architect of David Dinkins's 1989 mayoral victory.
In addition, Mr. Ferrer has picked up the support of several crucial black and Hispanic politicians, including City Councilman Guillermo Linares, who is the city's only elected Dominican immigrant, and Congressman Jose E. Serrano, a popular Bronx representative who has not always been on Mr. Ferrer's list of allies. In addition, he points to endorsements outside of the minority community, including from Ms. Messinger, from former Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro, and from the head of the Democratic Party organization in Staten Island, Assemblyman John Lavelle. But he has yet to prove that he has enough support among leading Democrats to propel him beyond his Democratic rivals, Public Advocate Mark Green, Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi and City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone.
And those alliances from the Dinkins era can be two-edged, erupting in feuds along the city's ethnic fault lines. Just last week, Bruce Teitelbaum, a Giuliani adviser and Hevesi supporter, caused a mini-firestorm by suggesting that Mr. Ferrer's links to the Dinkins camp should cause some concern among Jews. The mayor, in turn, defended Mr. Teitelbaum, pointing out that he was only reacting to Mr. Ferrer's comments that Mr. Giuliani's newly created decency panel was akin to life in Berlin 1939. Ratcheting up the exchanges even further was an editorial in The Amsterdam News, in which Wilbert A. Tatum, publisher emeritus, called on black residents to support Mr. Ferrer and pitted that constituency against Jews.
If Mr. Ferrer succeeds in sidestepping some of these issues, he still faces considerable challenges in seeking election citywide. He has never faced a tough election battle, and his record in the Bronx, now that borough presidents have little power, is relatively unknown in other parts of the city. Four years ago, in another campaign for mayor, Mr. Ferrer withdrew barely four months after entering the primary, saying he had failed to raise enough money to form a credible campaign. 
In fact, for months his new campaign for mayor was viewed as something less than a certain, with incessant rumors among politicians that as the hotly competitive primary drew closer, he would decide instead to run for one of the lower citywide offices of either public advocate or comptroller. "People who promoted those rumors were deluding themselves in wishful thinking," he said recently. "They didn't really know me or what I'm all about."
Mr. Ferrer, who is known by his nickname, Freddy, became interested in politics as a college student. He was elected to the City Council in 1982, and in 1987 the Bronx delegation of the Council selected him to fill the vacancy at borough president left by Stanley Simon, who resigned in the face of indictment in the Wedtech bribery scandal.
Mr. Ferrer said that during his tenure as borough president, much of the Bronx became an international model of urban revival. Mr. Ferrer has often boasted about the Bronx's award as an All-America City by the National Civic League in 1997.
"Together, you and I laid the foundation of a revival unrivaled in this nation," Mr. Ferrer told the crowd at his speech at Bronx Community College. He said that his administration "presided over an estimated $3.2 billion dollars in new construction -- commercial, institutional and residential. That's because we know economic development's about more than a Midtown address."
Mr. Ferrer also has called for increasing the salaries of teachers by 30 percent and for creating year-round teacher training and development programs. His interest in education also may be due in part to the fact that his wife, Aramina, is principal of a school in the Bronx.
While the Ferrers are well known at home, Mr. Ferrer has been noticeably trying to make up for being a stranger in the other boroughs by traveling nearly every day to other neighborhoods in the city. Always impeccably dressed, he speaks in a straightforward way, although his delivery is measured. Occasionally, he can excite the crowd. In offering his description of New York's "two cities," Mr. Ferrer recently roused a group of ministers in Harlem to their feet with his discussion of the need for improved relations with the police.
Despite the persistent questions of whether Mr. Ferrer can find broad enough support outside of the Bronx to be successful in his first hotly competitive campaign, the candidate himself contends that his message is resonating with an increasingly large group of New Yorkers.
"I know it because of the response I'm getting while standing on the sidewalks of New York City," Mr. Ferrer said. "There are residents who are white, who are African-American, Hispanic and Asian who come up to me every day and say that they like what I'm saying. They relate to it and understand it. I feel it's all coming together."

HEADLINE: Ballpark Figures 

BYLINE:  By Mark S. Rosentraub; Mark S. Rosentraub is the author of "Major League Losers: The Real Cost of Sports and Who's Paying for It" and dean of the college of urban affairs at Cleveland State University.

DATELINE: CLEVELAND 

 BODY:
Bud Selig, commissioner of baseball, wants fans to believe that eliminating a few teams will improve the quality of play and make the sport more profitable. Recently, Selig suggested that "contraction" -- a euphemism for getting rid of some teams by consolidating them with others -- is an option he is considering. Those who support Selig's position argue that having fewer teams would allow a better distribution of talent and the elimination of teams that have struggled financially over the past few seasons, like the Montreal Expos, Oakland A's, Minnesota Twins and Tampa Bay Devil Rays. 
 But will contraction really improve the sport or its bottom line? It's doubtful. Growth in the number of available players has so dramatically expanded over the last few years that there are more than enough good ones to keep currently existing teams competitive. Moreover, the financial problems of the teams in question can be attributed to marketing and political blunders that contraction won't solve. So why eliminate teams? It is the same old, same old. Communities are not agreeing to the terms dictated by teams that want new ballparks. 
 When the Twins claimed they could no longer play outdoors because of the weather, Minnesota taxpayers helped pay for a new stadium, the Metrodome. Now, less than 20 years later, the Twins say that to attract more fans to an "authentic" baseball experience, they need to play outdoors. The decision last week by the Minnesota State Legislature to table a vote on a new stadium could give Selig another reason to eliminate the Twins.
In Florida, taxpayers contributed about $200 million to build a facility for the Devil Rays. That domed stadium was used by Major League Baseball to leverage a better deal for the Chicago White Sox, who threatened Illinois that they would move to St. Petersburg without more taxpayer help. How are St. Petersburg and Florida rewarded for their subsidy? They are now told the ballpark is in the wrong place and that a retractable dome is needed.
When the Expos were successful on the field they drew more than 2 million fans a season, but now, after years of poor marketing -- not using French-language advertising in Canada or recruiting French-speaking players, not marketing the team strongly enough in New York State -- the team wants more subsidies. 
And Oakland, victimized by a football team that moved once, returned with new subsidies, is now threatened with losing its baseball team if it does not provide yet another subsidy.
None of these cities will fall into economic ruin if their teams move or are disbanded. But threatening fans with the loss of their teams is a tactic that ignores the investments already made by taxpayers and fans -- and is hardly a smart way to assure support of baseball in the long term.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
As agency executives gather for their yearly conference, one industry is conspicuously scarce.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

DATELINE: NAPLES, Fla. 

 BODY:
THE leaders of the nation's agencies are gathering for their annual management conference as the advertising and media industries confront what is shaping up as their worst year in a decade.
 The American Association of Advertising Agencies, known as the Four A's, began its 83rd conference yesterday afternoon at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Naples. There was already tangible evidence at the meeting of the sudden sharp deterioration of the national economy: a significant falloff in attendance. 
 In 2000, when the industry was enjoying its best year ever, almost 460 people attended the conference. That was the highest attendance since 1990, and it was significantly above the recent average of about 400. But for this conference, which continues through Saturday, only 326 attendees are expected. 
Tellingly, the decline has come not among executives of agencies that belong to the association, said O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive of the group, but among executives from media companies who attend the conference to network, mingle and schmooze with the top management of Madison Avenue.
"Member attendance is the same, which frankly surprised me," Mr. Drake said in a telephone interview as he offered a preview of the conference. "The whole falloff is in media."
"The media people who typically come aren't coming because of the state of their business," he added. Newspapers and television and radio networks have reported a widespread decline in ad revenue. "Everyone's concerned about the near term and maybe the whole year, but as of now, it's being felt more directly by the media than by advertising agencies."
For agencies, "business conditions are spotty," Mr. Drake said. "The West Coast, particularly San Francisco, is in bad shape, and Boston is not too good."
"But Chicago is not too bad," he added, "and New York depends on the accounts you have."
As uncertain as conditions are, Mr. Drake said, agencies are less at risk now "than in 1991, the last big recession." That is because they have "a lot more 'below-the-line' business, such as public relations, direct marketing and building Web sites," he said, than they did a decade ago, when more of their revenue and profit came from traditional advertising.
Even so, in remarks Mr. Drake prepared for delivery at the general session this morning, he asserted that "the state of the economy today and tomorrow is at the top of everyone's list" of concerns. That was underscored yesterday by a decision by one large national marketer, Delta Air Lines, to cut costs by eliminating tens of millions of dollars in advertising that was to have run in print and other media, a decision the company disclosed in a discussion with analysts.
In a section of Mr. Drake's speech devoted to diversity, in which he will call for member agencies to contribute $500,000 to expand a program offering "multicultural scholarships," he wrote: "Now some might say this is not a good time to be asking for money, no matter what the cause. Client spending is down for many of you, and the economy is clearly in a downturn."
"I know all of this is true, but I also know that diversity is an issue to which attention must be paid," Mr. Drake continued, "and it must be paid now if we are to flourish in the future."
Another executive looking to the future is Philip B. Dusenberry, chairman at BBDO North America in New York, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group. At the conference, he will complete his year as the 2000-1 chairman of the Four A's, a term that started with many member agencies unable to fill vacancies and ends with them making layoffs.
"In my speech, I mention 'what a difference a year makes,' " Mr. Dusenberry said in a telephone interview in which he offered a preview of his remarks at the conference.
"I know I'm a Pollyanna," Mr. Dusenberry said, "but there has never been a better time to crank up the volume of our work and sell our way out of this slump."
"We've been through this before, and worse," he added. "The stewards of the big companies see this as an opportunity to grow" by maintaining or even increasing ad spending, so that "the bad times become nothing more than bad memories."
Mr. Dusenberry said he also planned to review his work in the last year to encourage creativity in advertising. Asked whether that was less relevant because economic pullbacks typically lead anxious marketers to replace the soft sell with the hard sell, he replied, "This is the time to turn up the creative juices, not cut back, and make a real effort to make consumers feel more about brands and give them reasons to buy."
"In these times, advertising takes on a real responsibility," Mr. Dusenberry said. "If one brand pulls ahead with terrific advertising, it triggers the competition to suit up" and meet the challenge.
At a business session that opened the conference, the board of the Four A's elected officers for 2001-2.
Brendan Ryan, chief executive at FCB Worldwide in New York, part of True North Communications, was elected to succeed Mr. Dusenberry and will serve as the chairman for 2001-2. Mr. Ryan, 58, has been a director at large since 1998.
John J. Dooner Jr., the vice chairman for 2000-1, decided against standing for election as the chairman, the normal procedure. He cited the additional press of business since he became chairman and chief executive at the Interpublic Group of Companies in New York.
Ken Kaess, president and chief executive at DDB Worldwide in New York, part of the Omnicom Group, was elected vice chairman for 2001-2. Mr. Kaess, 46, has also been a director at large since 1998.
And Marsha Lindsay, 49, president and chief executive at Lindsay, Stone & Briggs in Madison, Wis., was elected secretary-treasurer for 2001-2. She served on the national board of the Four A's, representing the central region, from 1994 to 1997. J. Melvin Muse, chief executive at Muse Creative Holdings in New York, was the secretary-treasurer for 2000-1.

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Shrinks as U.S. Cuts Imports 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18 

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit shrank to its narrowest level in more than a year in February as imports declined, the Commerce Department reported today, indicating that the cooling economy had reduced demand for consumer products, oil and goods from abroad.
 The trade deficit declined to $27 billion from $33.3 billion in January, the largest drop since monthly record-keeping started in 1992, the department said. The month's deficit was the smallest since $25.7 billion in December 1999. Analysts had expected a February deficit of $33 billion. 
 The decline in imports, of 4.4 percent, also the largest drop on record, surprised analysts as well. "With the domestic economy slowing, import growth should slow, too, but this drop is too big to be sustainable," said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y.
A separate report suggested that growth would be restrained for most of 2001. The index of leading economic indicators, released today by the Conference Board, fell 0.3 percent in March after a drop of 0.2 percent in February and has risen only once in six months. The decline in the index, which measures economic activity over the next three to six months, was in line with expectations.
Analysts found some reasons for optimism in the trade figures. Because of the way the Commerce Department calculates the gross domestic product, today's report added to the possibility that the overall economy grew, rather than contracted, in the first quarter. The government is to issue the G.D.P. report on April 27.
A decline in imports is considered positive because it implies that domestic companies rather than foreign competitors provide goods.
Another encouraging sign was that exports rose for a second consecutive month in February. The 1 percent gain, after a 0.4 percent increase a month earlier, was led by aircraft, chemicals, telecommunications equipment and farm products.
The drop in imports of consumer goods sent the trade deficit with China down to $5.1 billion, the lowest since April 1999. Imports from China, at $6.4 billion, were the lowest since May 1999.
The deficit in goods with Japan widened to $6.1 billion in February from $5.9 billion in January. Still, a year earlier, the monthly Japan deficit had been $6.7 billion.
The deficit with Canada, the United States' largest trading partner, narrowed to $4.5 billion from $5.9 billion. The deficit with Mexico dropped to $1.46 billion from $2.1 billion.

HEADLINE: Fed's Statement on Action by Its Monetary Panel 

 BODY:
Following is the text of a statement by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's monetary policy panel, decided to lower interest rates: 
 The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points, to 4 1/2 percent. In a related action, the board of governors approved a 50-basis-point reduction in the discount rate, to 4 percent. 
 The F.O.M.C. has reviewed prospects for the economy in light of the information that has become available since its March meeting. A significant reduction in excess inventories seems well advanced. Consumption and housing expenditures have held up reasonably well, though activity in these areas has flattened recently. Although measured productivity probably weakened in the first quarter, the impressive underlying rate of increase that developed in recent years appears to be largely intact.
Nonetheless, capital investment has continued to soften and the persistent erosion in current and expected profitability, in combination with rising uncertainty about the business outlook, seems poised to dampen capital spending going forward. This potential restraint, together with the possible effects of earlier reductions in equity wealth on consumption and the risk of slower growth abroad, threatens to keep the pace of economic activity unacceptably weak. As a consequence, the committee agreed that an adjustment in the stance of policy is warranted during this extended intermeeting period. 
The committee continues to believe that against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future. 
In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco.

Hewlett-Packard Warns of Dismal Earnings and Job Cuts

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 18 

 BODY:
Hewlett-Packard warned today that it would report quarterly earnings that halve Wall Street's estimates, eliminate as much as 20 percent of its managerial staff and take a charge of $150 million.
 Offering a glimmer of hope for an improved second half of the year, the company said the sharp declines in consumer sales of its products in the United States had slowed and did not appear to be worsening. Carleton S. Fiorina, the president and chief executive, said she viewed the current quarter, which ends April 30, as "the bottom" of the downward cycle, with revenue flattening out next quarter. 
 Yet Ms. Fiorina acknowledged that the company's domestic troubles had been joined by troubles abroad, especially in Europe, leaving analysts and Ms. Fiorina herself wary of the company's ability to predict the future. 
"I say that with great caution because visibility remains limited," Ms. Fiorina said, referring to her prediction that the troubles have bottomed out. 
Hewlett-Packard, based in Palo Alto, Calif., said the slumping demand for its printers and personal computers would cause revenue for this quarter to decline 2 to 4 percent, compared with the period a year before. Consumer sales are down 10 percent, a sharp drop from the 5 percent gain the company forecast in December.
The company expects to report earnings of 13 to 17 cents a share, a steep drop from the 44 cents it earned in the period a year earlier. The consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call, a market research firm, was for 35 cents a share this quarter.
Hewlett-Packard said it would trim its management-level ranks to 11,000 from 14,000 within 60 days, to bring its manager-to-employee ratio more in line with its competitors. A spokeswoman for Hewlett-Packard said some managers who lost jobs might move to other positions within the company. 
To cut more costs, employees will be asked to use up accumulated vacation days, though the company intends to resume paying bonuses and granting pay raises this year. Both programs had been suspended.
Buoyed in large part by the Federal Reserve's cut in interest rates, Hewlett-Packard gained $2.65, to $31.90, in trading today. In July 2000, it was trading at $68.09. The stock may also have ridden on the coattails of Intel, which said Tuesday that its microprocessor sales to computer makers had stabilized.
"It may not be that their business has stabilized," said Laura Conigliaro, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Company. "But investors are so interested in hearing something that is positively biased that that became a very easy word to glom onto."
Ms. Conigliaro said Hewlett-Packard could have saved itself some headaches by better reading the market for its inkjet printers. Ms. Fiorina acknowledged today that sales were now strongest in the lower end of the market, which competitors like Canon and Lexmark have staked out, and said her company would soon begin aggressively to push less expensive models.
As a result, Hewlett-Packard said it would cancel a planned expansion of its inkjet line and write off the costs for $50 million. To clear out the higher-end and midrange items, Hewlett-Packard said it would write off $100 million in excess inventory, which includes inkjet printers, hand-held organizers and scanners.
John A. Carey, manager of the Pioneer Fund, which owns 2.98 million shares of Hewlett-Packard, said the company was caught in the downdraft of the high-technology sector. At the same time, he said Ms. Fiorina, who was hired from Lucent Technologies in 1999, had failed to give investors confidence that her management team could shine within its industry as it once did.
"The jury is out," Mr. Carey said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Dow and Nasdaq Soar After Rate Cut by Federal Reserve

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
Stock prices rose early yesterday morning and then roared higher after the Federal Reserve unexpectedly cut interest rates.
 Investors were already celebrating a better-than-expected earnings report from Intel that came after the market closed on Tuesday. They also took solace from statements by Abby Joseph Cohen, the market strategist for Goldman Sachs, who reiterated her view that stocks are undervalued and that corporate profits would pick up later this year, even as she slightly reduced her stock market targets for the end of the year. 
 Then the Fed, about 90 minutes into the trading day, electrified the rally by cutting its key rate half a percentage point. 
By cutting rates as stocks rose, Fed policy makers delivered a surprise cut ahead of their next scheduled meeting, on May 15. And it was in stark contrast to its last cut, which it delivered on Jan. 3, a day after the Dow Jones industrial average had dropped more than 140 points, suggesting that equity prices were of great concern.
For the moment, investors ignored the darker implication that the economy was deteriorating so much that the Fed felt the need to take a rather extreme action. The Nasdaq composite index, which is loaded with technology stocks, recorded its fourth-largest gain in percentage terms, soaring 156.22 points, or 8.1 percent, to close at 2,079.44. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 399.10 points, or 3.9 percent, to 10,615.83. And the broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 46.35 points, or 3.9 percent, to 1,238.16.
The New York Stock Exchange had its second-busiest day, with about 1.89 billion shares traded. The Nasdaq stock market had its busiest day, with 3.19 billion shares traded.
The Fed cut its target for the federal funds rate, which banks charge one another for overnight loans, to 4.5 percent from 5 percent. Recent trading in futures contracts tied to the federal funds rate indicated that many on Wall Street were not expecting an interest rate cut until the Fed's meeting on May 15.
"It's important that Greenspan has retained the element of surprise to get the most bang for his buck," said Peter McTeague, a strategist at Greenwich Capital Markets, a bond brokerage firm in Connecticut, referring to Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman. 
Market strategists cautioned that the prospects for corporate profits remained unclear and that investors also initially celebrated the Fed's rate cuts in January before stock prices began a steep decline.
"We have a slew of earnings to get through," William C. Gourd, vice president of J. P. Morgan Private Bank, said. "There's a lot of opportunities for the market to give back the gains it made today."
The Fed's move came in time to jolt markets in Europe, where investors have been incensed that the European Central Bank is ignoring pleas to cut rates. In London, the FTSE 100-share index jumped suddenly to close up 129.1 points, or 2.2 percent, at 5,890.2. In Germany, the DAX index surged, to close up 229.30, or 3.86 percent, at 6,164.88.
Investors seemed to believe that "all the bad news has finally gotten out of the way," said Charles Pradilla, chief investment officer for SG Cowen. "What could doom this to be just a bear market rally would be if people start talking about a profit recession going into 2002."
The stock market has already withstood a dismal financial forecast from Cisco Systems. Intel raised spirits late Tuesday by slightly exceeding sharply lowered earnings expectations. In response, Intel, a Dow component, rose $5.24, to $31.28.
I.B.M. was among the stocks leading the Dow industrials higher, gaining $6.80, to $106.50. After the close yesterday, I.B.M. reported a 15 percent rise in net income that met Wall Street's forecasts but reminded investors that it was "not immune to broad cutbacks in customer spending." In after-hours trading, I.B.M. rose to $113.50, according to Instinet.
Apple Computer rose $2.39, to $22.79, while Advanced Micro Devices gained $4.85, to $27.85. Both reported earnings after the close that exceeded Wall Street's targets. In after-hours trading, Apple's stock jumped to $26.11, while A.M.D. rose to $29.75.
Hewlett-Packard gained $2.65, to $31.90, even though it warned of a profit shortfall and said it would cut as many as 3,000 jobs. AOL Time Warner rose $5.10, to $49, after it reported stronger-than-expected financial results, with its net loss narrowing from a year earlier.
Merrill Lynch was up $5.65, to $66.25 after it reported declining profits that still exceeded analysts' estimates.
"Management teams are just saying things aren't getting any worse, and that gives you a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel," said Bryan T. Piskorowski, market analyst at Prudential Securities. --------------------

Treasury Prices Rise
By The Associated Press
Bond prices rallied yesterday after the Federal Reserve surprised Wall Street by cutting short-term interest rates half a percentage point.

HEADLINE: New Zealand Trims Key Rate 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, Thursday, April 19 

 BODY:
The central bank of New Zealand cut its key overnight lending rate to 6 percent from 6.25 percent today.
 In taking the action, the Reserve Bank governor, Donald Brash, cited slowing economic growth among the country's main trading partners and the adverse effects of sluggish global growth. 
"Our commodities remain robust," Mr. Brash said, adding that "significant parts of the economy are operating near to capacity and the labor market is relatively tight." The bank, he said, is cautiously moving its rates lower in line with other countries including the United States, Australia and Canada. 
 The move was intended to preserve confidence, said Annette Beacher, a Salomon Smith Barney/Citibank economist here. The New Zealand bank, she added, is likely to ease rates again next month.

HEADLINE: International Paper Posts $44 Million Loss 

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The International Paper Company said yesterday that it had lost $44 million in the first quarter, blaming a struggling economy and higher energy costs.
 The company, the world's largest paper company, said it had earned $24 million, or 5 cents a share, before special and extraordinary items. 
 That matched the expectations of analysts, but is a drop in earnings of more than 90 percent compared with the period a year earlier. 
"The continuation of a dramatic slowdown of orders due to a very weak U.S. economy and strong U.S. dollar hammered domestic profitability and export competitiveness," the company said. International Paper, which is based in Purchase, N.Y. but will move its headquarters to Stamford, Conn., next month, also cited higher energy costs, lower production volume and pricing pressures for its problems, compounded by short-term operating difficulties at some of its larger mills.
But John Dillon, the chairman and chief executive, said the company was working to hone its focus in anticipation of an eventual turnaround in the economic climate.
"We are matching our production to our orders, which has led to reductions in inventories. We are focusing on our three core businesses -- paper, packaging and forest products -- and are reinforcing relationships with our customers," Mr. Dillon said. "And our continuing internal improvement effort will give International Paper a superior competitive position when the business outlook improves." The first-quarter net loss contrasts with net earnings of $378 million, or 91 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.
First-quarter sales improved to $6.9 billion from $6.4 billion in the 2000 period.
Increased competition and weaker demand for bleached board cut into earnings in its consumer packaging business, although prices remained steady, the company said. A slowdown in orders also resulted in 20 cutbacks in production, which hurt earnings in the industrial packaging business.

Hewlett Warns on Profit And Plans to Cut Some Jobs
Hewlett-Packard warned that its quarterly earnings would fall short of Wall Street's estimates by at least 50 percent. It said it would eliminate as much as 20 percent of its managerial staff and take a charge of $150 million.
 But the company offered a glimmer of hope for an improved second half of the year, saying the sharp declines in consumer sales of its products in the United States have slowed and do not appear to be worsening. Page C4. 

G.M. Profit Surpasses Expectations
General Motors announced that it had earned 87 percent less in the first quarter than it did a year earlier, as its shipments to North American dealerships dropped sharply and the prices of new vehicles eroded. But G.M.'s profit was still nearly twice what Wall Street expected, and its stock jumped even before the Federal Reserve cut interest rates. G.M. shares closed at $56.80, up $3.17. C6.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place; 
The Fed Gets a Case Of the Nerves

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve is growing more worried about the economy. Investors figure that means everything will work out fine.
 That seemed to be the Wall Street reaction yesterday to the Fed's surprising decision to cut the key federal funds interest rate by half a percentage point. 
 Unlike the last such unexpected cut, on Jan. 3, this one came when the stock market was already showing resilience in the face of bad economic news. As such, it was an indication that the Fed was more worried than it had been about the economy. 
"They are more nervous about the economy than they have been letting on," said William Dudley, the chief United States economist for Goldman, Sachs. "The investment boom is turning into a bust."
But that fear did not alarm investors. The Nasdaq composite index rose 8.1 percent, as it gained 156.22 points, to close at 2,079.44. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average each rose nearly 4 percent.
Until recently, the Fed's public comments focused on the idea that the economic weakness was largely a matter of an inventory correction that could end relatively quickly. But more recently it has begun to refer to other factors.
Yesterday the Fed conceded that it was worried about the plunge in business spending. "Capital investment has continued to soften, and the persistent erosion in current and expected profitability, in combination with rising uncertainty about the business outlook, seems poised to dampen capital spending going forward," it said in its statement, which indicated more concern about capital spending than previous statements had shown.
The Fed also referred to "the possible effects of earlier reductions in equity wealth on consumption" as one factor that "threatens to keep the pace of economic activity unacceptably weak." In its statements accompanying the first two of its three earlier cuts, the impact of the stock market on consumer spending had not been mentioned. It was referred to less prominently in the statement announcing the third cut, on March 20.
The latest cut, its fourth, came on the heels of continued news indicating that the economy was weakening. Cisco Systems had compared the plunge in demand for its products to a "100-year flood" when it announced layoffs and a $2.5 billion inventory write-off earlier this week, and new claims for unemployment insurance are rising at their fastest rate since the 1990-91 recession.
Still, Wall Street had most recently been acting as if it could see the bottom and knew that recovery was inevitable and would begin later this year. Since the Nasdaq composite hit bottom on April 4, at 1,638.80, that index was up 24 percent, to 2,025, by 10:54 a.m. yesterday, just before the news of the Fed move hit the wires. Over the same period, the S.& P. 500 had climbed 10 percent.
Rising stock prices would not have alarmed the Fed, which is clearly concerned about the effect of the fall of prices on consumer confidence. But the action of the bond market may have been a cause for concern. Rates had recently been rising, and the yield on 10-year government bonds had climbed to 4.84 percent by yesterday from a low of 4.45 percent on March 23, shortly after the previous cut. Yesterday the rate fell to 4.77 percent. 
"I don't think the Fed liked the fact the bond market was taking its cues from the stock market," said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig & Company. "It is trying to provide genuine interest rate relief to a weak economy."
The Fed's ability to affect the economy is based on its ability to control short-term interest rates. Lower rates reduce the cost of borrowing and thereby are supposed to stimulate economic activity. But the only rates it directly controls are the federal funds rate, the rate at which banks lend money to each other, and the discount rate, the rate at which it lends directly to banks. The discount rate is less important now because most banks do not borrow directly from the Fed. Both rates have now been cut by two full percentage points this year -- the federal funds rate to 4 percent and the discount rate to 4.5 percent.
But the bond market, which had cut rates sharply in late 2000 even before the Fed acted, has remained largely aloof, and yields on Treasury bonds with maturities of more than five years were higher than they had been on Jan. 2, before the Fed's first rate cut.
That Jan. 3 rate cut aborted a stock market plunge, and some analysts suggested that Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, had decided to move because of the market weakness. The Nasdaq composite jumped a record 14.2 percent that day, to 2,616.69, but later gave back all of those gains as it became clear that the economic news was worsening. Among the hardest hit companies were many major technology concerns whose businesses were suffering the most with the glut.
Now those stocks are rallying, a move that began before the Fed acted. Cisco, up $1.35 yesterday, to $18, had bottomed at $13.19 on April 4. Oracle, up $1.70, to $17.92, had fallen to $13 on April 9, and EMC, the leading company in memory storage systems, jumped $4.90 yesterday, to $36.66, after falling as low as $25.05 on April 3.
Each of those stocks, however, is still down by more than 40 percent since Jan. 3, the day of the first rate cut. Those stock declines show how the investment outlook for those companies has fallen even while the Fed was cutting rates.
Before the Fed's first cut, the Nasdaq composite had fallen 24 percent in three weeks, and some thought the Fed had reacted more to the market than to the economy.
Since then, the Fed has sometimes seemed determined to confound market forecasters. At the last regular meeting of the Fed's open market committee, on March 20, the Fed cut rates by half a point, less than the three-quarters of a point that many on Wall Street were expecting, and stocks sold off in response. 
The Fed's statement then indicated that another cut was possible, and Wall Street came to expect one in early April. But then, as the stock market strengthened, the conventional wisdom came to be that the Fed would do nothing until its next scheduled meeting, on May 15. Thus yesterday's cut took markets by complete surprise.
As analysts struggled to explain the timing, the most creative idea came from Rory Robertson of Macquarie Research. "Perhaps Chairman Greenspan wanted to get back in the news," he said, noting that contestants on "The Weakest Link," a television quiz show broadcast Tuesday night, were unable to name the chairman of the Fed.
Others had more conventional explanations. "I don't know if the timing was deliberate to surprise the markets," Mr. Dudley of Goldman, Sachs said. "They have to be scared stiff what the next unemployment report will bring. They are concerned that the investment bust and the wealth effect will drive up unemployment, and the increase in unemployment will scare consumers."
That fear of scaring consumers may have been one reason the Fed has tried to avoid sounding alarmed even as it has cut rates sharply this year. Earlier this month, Jack Guynn, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said the economy appeared to be "close to bottom" and William Poole, the president of the St. Louis Fed, said the odds against a recession were 3 to 1.
Yesterday, even after the Fed acted and said, as it had in March, that "the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future," Fed officials were trying to sound optimistic.
Anthony M. Santomero, the president of the Philadelphia Fed, after speaking to a group of New Jersey bankers yesterday, was quoted by Dow Jones as saying that he thinks an economic recovery is "just around the corner."
Investors, for now at least, think that is likely to be true.

HEADLINE: THE RATE CUT: THE IMPACT; 
Just in Time, Or Too Late?

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve made another assault yesterday in a war it has already lost, suggested a pessimistic group of economists who feel a recession is inevitable this year -- if one is not already under way.
 By lowering interest rates for the fourth time in less than four months, Alan Greenspan and his colleagues have made it less expensive for businesses to invest in new equipment and for consumers to buy cars and houses. 
 But it may not be enough to end the thousands of job cuts that companies are making, and it will not persuade businesses, many of which spent too much money during the bull market of the 1990's, to buy more equipment when they already own too much.
That is what worries those economists who shrug off yesterday's 399-point gain in the Dow Jones industrial average and remain at odds with the widespread belief that lower rates will spur consumer spending and quickly revive corporate profits.
Stocks may rise spectacularly after interest rate cuts, but lower borrowing costs have always needed months, or even a year, to affect people's decisions about most big purchases. Because of this delay, these economists say, the economy will continue to become weaker before it can recover. 
In the process, the longest economic expansion in American history would end.
"It is too late to prevent a recession," said Anirvan Banerji, the director of research at the Economic Cycle Research Institute in New York. "The process that leads to job losses is already in motion."
Thirty-eight percent of the economists surveyed recently by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a newsletter based in Alexandria, Va., said they expected a recession in the coming year. Mr. Banerji and other analysts who follow leading economic indicators, like new factory orders and the number of people applying for unemployment benefits, say that such numbers, taken together, have never reached their current levels without a recession following.
Optimists counter that unusually low inflation has given the Fed great flexibility to reduce interest rates without worrying that consumers and businesses would then embark on a spending binge that would cause prices to spiral upward.
With interest rates falling, most economists say, consumers will buy houses, cars and other goods at a healthy pace, as they have continued to do for most of the last year. Businesses, for their part, will become more willing to invest in new equipment and to hire new workers as they try to sell the products now lingering on warehouse shelves.
"This is a classic inventory cycle," said Neal M. Soss, an economist at Credit Suisse First Boston, who believes the economy will grow by about 1 percent in the first half of the year and about 3 percent in the second half. The main difference in this slowdown from previous ones, Dr. Soss added, is that businesses and the Fed have both reacted more quickly, ensuring a sharper but shorter adjustment period.
Many economists define a recession as two consecutive quarters of shrinking economic output by the nation as a whole. The National Bureau of Economic Research, a group of academics considered to be the official arbiter of business cycles, is less specific, but it says most recessions last six months to a year.
The debate is more than a semantic one because an actual recession would almost surely cause significantly more job losses and stock market declines than a slowdown would. The last slowdown occurred in the mid-1990's; the last recession lasted less than a year and ended in March 1991.
A similar version of the economists' debate is also playing out across the country -- albeit less explicitly -- as people decide whether to sell some of their stocks, buy a new house or commit to a summer vacation. They will ultimately affect the debate's outcome, too.
So far, Americans have reflected the divide among economists by saying one thing and doing another. People have become far less confident about the economy since late last year, according to polls, but they have continued to buy goods at a fairly brisk pace in the first three months of 2001. Even as the stock market has fallen, consumers have taken on more debt.
This must change soon, economists agree. Either confidence will begin to recover or spending will start falling.
The pessimists think the adjustment has already begun. In March, as the unemployment rate rose to 4.3 percent and the economy lost the highest number of jobs in a single month since 1991, retail sales fell slightly. During the early weeks of this month, initial unemployment claims increased to their highest level in five years.
Few analysts expect the unemployment rate to fall soon. This year, Cisco Systems, Eastman Kodak and dozens of other companies have announced layoffs, most of which are taking effect over weeks or months. Altogether, employment statistics that suggest future trends -- like the number of hours worked and other measures -- have dropped to their lowest level in 19 years, according to the Economic Cycle Research Institute.
Despite the increased popularity of investing in stocks, relatively few Americans rely on them for a significant portion of their income. Widespread job cuts, on the other hand, are almost guaranteed to crimp consumer spending, one of the few strengths of the American economy so far this year.
With layoffs already under way, the economy is doomed to weaken further, say those who believe a recession to be unavoidable.
"Ultimately, the Fed will win" and turn the economy around, said Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of Hoening & Company, a brokerage firm in Rye Brook, N.Y., who thinks a recession started late last year. But, he added, the Fed is more likely to start winning in July than to start winning now.
Behind some of the concern is the technology boom of the late 1990's. Eager investors encouraged companies to spend billions of dollars on new computer and telecommunications equipment. Largely as a result, productivity -- what one worker can produce in one hour -- surged.
But many companies now find themselves with more equipment than they can profitably use. Unlike extra cars sitting in a dealer's lots, the excess capacity cannot easily be sold off at a discount because the executives never intended to sell it in the first place, said John H. Makin, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute.
"It has all the classic elements of an overinvestment bubble," Mr. Makin said, adding that companies are unlikely to reverse course the next few months.
The optimists, on the other hand, believe the excess of technology equipment is simply a normal, if somewhat severe, build-up.
Inventories in the auto industry and other old-line businesses have started to fall recently, according to Economy.com, a consulting firm in West Chester, Pa. Technology inventories will soon follow, said Dr. Soss of Credit Suisse First Boston.
Companies like Cisco, Intel and Oracle have badly missed their sales estimates not because technology investment is entering a weak era but because managers now have better information about their businesses and can delay orders more quickly than in the past, say the economists who see the expansion continuing.
With inventories shrinking, the Fed cutting rates quickly and Congress moving to cut taxes, economic statistics will soon improve, the optimists add.
Wall Street seems to have come down strongly on this side. Stocks typically start rising a few months before the end of a slowdown, and many investors believe the economy is recovering.
Consider Cisco, the large maker of Internet equipment. After the market closed on Monday, the company said its sales for the three months ending April 30 would fall 30 percent compared with the previous quarter, a notable change from its recent growth rates. "This may be the fastest any industry our size has ever decelerated," said John Chambers, Cisco's chief executive.
On Tuesday, however, its stock fell only 54 cents, or 3 percent, to $16.66, from $17.20. By the end of yesterday's Fed-induced rally, Cisco shares were back to $18.
Worried economists may think one thing. But the message from investors could not have been clearer: they seem to think the worst is over.
In fact, by cutting rates yesterday, the Fed acted just as many investors were beginning to become optimistic. It also removed any doubt that Fed officials count themselves among those who believe that a recession is neither necessary to rid the economy of its imbalances nor unavoidable. 
"They're going to be very aggressive," said Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Economy.com.
A recession, he added, "is not inevitable, but they've got a tough battle."

CORRECTION-DATE: April 23, 2001

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Thursday about the effect of the Federal Reserve's cut in interest rates misstated a finding by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a newsletter based in Alexandria, Va. On average, economists surveyed by the newsletter believe there is a 38 percent chance the country will enter a recession in the next year. (The 38 percent figure did not refer to the number of surveyed economists who believed that there would be a recession.)

HEADLINE: Colorful Mayor of Providence Finds Comedy in Indictment 

BYLINE:  By DAN BARRY 

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I., April 18 

 BODY:
The recent indictment charging Mayor Vincent A. Cianci Jr. with running this city's government as a criminal enterprise has prompted the predictable responses: somber calls for Mayor Cianci's resignation, general fretting about the image of Providence, talk-show reflections on scandals past.
 But there has also been another reaction, one that seems odd given the seriousness of the charges. 
 Laughter.
Since his indictment two weeks ago, Mayor Cianci, 59, has gone out of his way to ridicule Operation Plunder Dome, the code name for the federal investigation into municipal corruption here. Last week he did a comedic riff on the case for the national audience of the "Imus in the Morning" radio show, portraying federal law enforcement officials here as bunglers of ill intent.
Of course, those investigators have given him killer material. Last week, Richard Rose, a federal prosecutor, admitted that he had invited friends into his home last summer to watch part of a surveillance tape on his television, in apparent violation of confidentiality rules. 
Mr. Cianci's response? "I guess Blockbuster's was closed that night," he told Imus. "I wonder if he sold popcorn?"
In the indictment, Mr. Cianci and several others, including some city officials, were charged with racketeering, conspiracy, extortion and mail fraud, with the mayor also charged with witness tampering. Mr. Cianci quickly proclaimed his innocence of all charges. 
For the last 26 years -- except for a six-year break stemming from an assault conviction in 1984 that forced him from office -- Mr. Cianci (pronounced see-AN-see) has been mayor, and Providence personified. He goes by the nickname Buddy and moves about this tightly knit city of 173,000 people with the confidence of a stand-up comic stalking a stage of his own design.
Since he returned to office in 1991, the city has undergone a renaissance, shedding its image as a grimy haunt of wiseguys and grifters. Although the reasons are many -- an economic upturn first among them -- Mr. Cianci, a political independent, has charged the air with his breathless boosterism.
Still, Providence is a municipal anomaly. There is no Republican Party to speak of, and many city Democrats hold their tongues to hold their City Hall jobs. That leaves only the "Buddy party," as it is known here, operating with total control and more than a little fear. 
"Cianci has created a cult of personality that has neutralized the opposition and prevented competing power centers from emerging," said Darrell West, a political scientist at Brown University. "And there is the populist side of him that creates a perfect defense: that there is a conspiracy trying to bring him down."
In his postindictment efforts to turn public opinion in his favor, Mr. Cianci has not had to go far to find convenient foils. 
In addition to the videotape-playing prosecutor, there has been Antonio Freitas, the businessman who first alerted federal agents to corruption in City Hall, and then worked undercover to expose it. Mr. Freitas was briefly cheered as a hero, but that ended when he was sent to prison for repeated domestic violence.
And there has been Dennis Aiken, the lead F.B.I. agent in the case, who recently stopped Christopher Nocera, a mayoral aide, on the street to shake his hand. But Mr. Nocera said that Mr. Aiken did not release his grip until he had demanded in colorful language that the mayor apologize for comments he had made about the agent on the Imus show.
Mr. Cianci's lawyer, Richard Egbert, sent a letter to Margaret Curran, the United States attorney for Rhode Island, that instantly became public. Mr. Egbert described the aide as "nervous and intimidated" and the agent as being "literally inches from his face."
The agent's remarks, Mr. Egbert wrote, "cause me a great deal of concern for the fairness of the process concerning Mayor Cianci."
Gail Marcinkiewicz, a spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said, "We disagree with Mr. Egbert's characterization of the incident."
As for the private showing of surveillance tapes, Tom Connell, the spokesman for the United States attorney's office, said Mr. Rose would continue to handle the prosecution. 
But the incidents demonstrate how in this city the not-uncommon prosecution of politicians is often messy. 
"Strategically, Buddy's doing the right thing, though I'm not condoning it," said Maureen Moakley, a political scientist at the University of Rhode Island. "It's a subtle war for the hearts and minds of the people of Providence. All he needs is one or two jurors to support him and he's home free -- literally."
Still, at the root of Providence's opera bouffe are broad and serious accusations of public corruption. They reach into the corners of City Hall, including the tax office, the planning office and the memento-adorned office of the mayor.
Among the accusations are that Mr. Cianci benefited from a deal in which the money-strapped school department paid $1.3 million to rent space in a former auto body shop owned by a convicted felon; that Mr. Cianci and his aides collected $250,000 in campaign contributions from tow-truck companies looking to secure their places on the Police Department's list of authorized towers; and that the mayor helped extort $5,000 from a man seeking a city job that he ultimately received.
One accusation taps into the city's longtime class divisions. A quarter-century ago, Mr. Cianci, the city's first Italian-American mayor, applied for membership in the exclusive University Club; he never received a response. But when the club was planning major renovations in 1998, it suddenly made the mayor an honorary member. In exchange for that honor, the government charges, the mayor arranged for routine construction variances that up to then had been maddeningly elusive.
After the indictment, the mayor repeatedly said "there are still no stains on this jacket," a reference to Bill Clinton's sex scandal. Two days later, he was warmly received at a conference of mayors in Washington. A week later he was on Imus, ridiculing the federal government as well as himself; he admitted, for example, that he was required to remove his toupee for his mug shot.
Gov. Lincoln C. Almond, for one, is not laughing. As the United States attorney in the 1980's, Mr. Almond, a Republican, oversaw an investigation of Mr. Cianci's first administration that led to two dozen convictions. As a result, Mr. Almond has become something of a Cianci expert. 
"He takes care of everyone," Mr. Almond said. "He takes people from the Republican Party and makes them subservient to him; the same thing with the Democratic Party."
Now, Mr. Almond said, he is calling on Mr. Cianci to resign. By remaining in office, the governor said, the mayor sends the wrong message of public acceptance of wrongdoing. In addition, he said, "you don't make light of a federal racketeering indictment."
Some other politicians have joined the call for the mayor's resignation; others have reserved judgment. 
"The people who are offended would be offended no matter what he did," said Ms. Moakley, of the University of Rhode Island. "For others there is this warped admiration for his puckishness."
John DePetro, the host of a morning radio talk show on WHJJ-AM, agreed, saying that the enduring statewide fascination with Mr. Cianci reached a feverish pitch in the wake of the indictment.
Last week, Mr. DePetro said, the number of callers vying to comment on the mayor's travails was so high that on three days he extended his three-hour program to five hours.
"This is great drama," Mr. DePetro said. "One of my callers said that it's the story of the greatest politician in Rhode Island running in the greatest political race in the state -- and it's against himself."
This week, at least, the mayor was taking a break from talking about himself and his indictment. Through his spokeswoman, Beryl Kenyon, he declined to comment for this article. But the example Mr. Cianci sets reverberates through City Hall.
On Monday, a reporter asked Mr. Nocera -- the Cianci aide who shared the handshake with an F.B.I. agent last week -- whether he could speak to him. Mr. Nocera's response reflects what passes for humor in Providence these days.
"You just did," he said.

HEADLINE: The Villain of the Village?; 
As N.Y.U. Edges Out and Up, Neighbors Put Up a Fight

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
To New York University, the issue could not be clearer: it does not have enough room for its 50,000 students, 1,500 professors and 300 laboratories.
 "If anything stops N.Y.U. it will be space," said Thomas Bender, a New York University professor who specializes in New York's intellectual history. "Office, classrooms, residential apartments: we are out of them all, and have been for a while. It is unbelievable what kind of crisis space is." 
 But the university's solution -- to buy, lease and build more space -- is enraging some of its neighbors in Greenwich Village. At bottom is a widespread feeling that N.Y.U. is inexorably changing the neighborhood's distinctive mixture of quaint and bohemian old town houses and tenements that once drew artists and writers, beatniks and folk singers, gays and lesbians, who felt they were not welcome elsewhere. 
"Today, N.Y.U. is looked at as the enemy by anyone who lives in the Village," said Barry Lewis, an architectural historian who lectures at the New York School of Interior Design.
Actually, many residents say that they like living in a university community -- with energetic students, and events and spaces open to the public. What they say they cannot stomach, however, is N.Y.U.'s big new buildings, including the dormitories and the new student center.
Not counting its medical and dental schools, N.Y.U. today owns about 60 buildings with 9.3 million square feet, about 50 percent more than the 6.3 million square feet it owned in 1970. That was before it sold its University Heights campus in the Bronx and concentrated itself around Washington Square Park, where it began life in 1831. 
In that year, a small group of wealthy New Yorkers founded the University of the City of New-York (the original name) to train merchants and engineers. They erected a single, majestic neo-Gothic building of white marble to call attention to their enterprise on newly fashionable Washington Square. 
That building no longer stands. But in N.Y.U.'s climb from a tiny commuter school with fewer than 100 students to a sprawling, internationally recognized university, it has become the dominating institutional presence in Greenwich Village. It owns or leases most of the buildings surrounding Washington Square. Washington Square South has become the university's backbone, with buildings like its 12-story red sandstone library, its law school and now a new student center. It has put up giant dormitories on 14th Street, at the northern edge of the Village, but even those replace two historic structures -- Luchow's, the fabled German restaurant, and the Palladium dance palace.
The latest episode that sent community residents to the ramparts was the announcement that N.Y.U.'s law school planned a new 13-story building for classrooms and faculty offices on West Third Street, replacing a town house where Edgar Allan Poe once lived and another set of row houses that had been renovated by McKim, Mead & White.
"It is not our job to recognize their educational objectives, which I am sure are worthy," said Jim Smith, chairman of Community Board 2. "Our concern is to keep the look of the Village."
Such fiercely negative sentiment is heard from the neighbors of large research universities everywhere as their dormitories and laboratories eat up local properties and contribute to soaring real estate prices. Sometimes the emotions explode, as they did famously in 1968, when angry protesters closed Columbia University over plans for a gymnasium in Morningside Park.
In New York, the city's newfound popularity, the booming economy of the late 1990's and billion-dollar capital campaigns have resulted in an explosion of university expansion. N.Y.U. and Columbia are both in the midst of building booms, as are the City University of New York, Polytechnic University in Brooklyn, St. John's in Queens and the Manhattan School of Music, among others. 
New York University, for its part, argues both that it has helped the community by bolstering the local economy and that while it must expand, it tries to do so in the most sensitive way that it can. It has rehabilitated old buildings rather than put up new ones, put classrooms and libraries below ground, hired prominent architects, and moved more and more functions to the "frontiers" of its neighborhood -- areas like 14th Street and Union Square, which are still undergoing redevelopment and which welcome the university more.
"I would like to think we have played a role in making this area more habitable, not less," said N.Y.U.'s president, L. Jay Oliva. 
In the last two decades, N.Y.U. has transformed itself from a second-tier school largely for commuting students into a residential research university. Where commuter students could live at home -- or rent apartments in a less expensive market -- the new students need housing. 
"That put us into the housing business in a tenfold way," said Robert Berne, N.Y.U.'s vice president for academic affairs.
The pressures are all the more intense considering that N.Y.U. has no real campus of its own -- officials like to say the city is their campus -- and that the university is centered in Greenwich Village, an area heavily protected by its designation as a historic district, which largely prohibits new construction. 
To guarantee housing for all undergraduates, the university has built dormitories, and bought or leased other space on Third Avenue, on Union Square and near Wall Street. But the new dormitories have grated on the community, even though the university built them away from Washington Square. 
The two most contentious are a 637-bed, 20-story residence hall that opened in 1998 on East 14th Street where Luchow's once stood, and a nearby 1,000-bed, 16-story, $80 million residence hall (with a spacious gymnasium) on the site of the old Palladium dance hall. That dormitory will open in the fall.
Critics say that the residence halls are too big, that they are not architecturally distinguished and that they replace historic buildings. But N.Y.U. officials say that the dormitories are no larger than neighboring buildings and that they helped bring back a run-down block. One supporter is David Gmach, executive director of the 14th Street-Union Square Business Improvement District, who said he welcomed N.Y.U.'s growing presence in the area.
Despite this extensive growth, not all neighbors regard N.Y.U. as a total villain. Even those who chastise the university for its new buildings commend it for buying and refurbishing older buildings.
But many of the critics have never forgiven N.Y.U. for the 150-foot-high Bobst Library, which was built on Washington Square South in the late 1960's. At the time, N.Y.U. needed more shelf space for books and study space for its commuter students. 
That library, said Regina M. Kellerman, an architectural historian who once served as executive director of the Greenwich Village Society, "destroyed the south side of the square." And when N.Y.U. decided to build a larger student center next door to the library a few years ago, those wounds were reopened. 
To minimize opposition, N.Y.U. decided to put the new 12-level, $70 million student center -- the Helen and Martin Kimmel Center, designed by Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo & Associates -- where the old building stood.
"I thought it was a real victory for the community that we decided to put the student center on the site of our old student center and to tear down a building that many saw as a monstrosity," Dr. Oliva, N.Y.U.'s president, said recently. 
He laughed ruefully. "Boy, was I wrong."
Although the new center will be only 12 feet higher than the old, it will be twice as large, and critics quickly attacked its bulk, saying it would cast a larger shadow over the park and further ruin the vista on the south end of Washington Square. 
An ad hoc opposition group, the Committee to Save Washington Square, filed suit to try to halt construction, but lost, and an appeals court recently ruled in the university's favor. Workers have already poured the foundation, and the building is beginning to rise.
The latest lightning rod has been the law school's decision to replace the town house where Poe lived briefly with a multipurpose building that critics say would block the southward view from Washington Square Park and the open vista behind the Judson Church campanile. 
Once again, opponents went to court. They also unleashed a publicity campaign. Martin Lipton, N.Y.U.'s chairman, said he received more than 5,000 e-mail messages demanding that N.Y.U. preserve the Poe house.
As the debate intensified, John Sexton, the law school dean and the heir apparent to N.Y.U.'s president, Dr. Oliva, jumped in and began to negotiate with community leaders. Ultimately, he agreed to lop three floors off the proposed 13-story multipurpose building.
Community leaders expressed satisfaction that N.Y.U. was willing to negotiate, and expressed hope that the process marked a new era in the university's relationship with its neighbors.
"The thing with the Poe house was a major turnaround," said Luther S. Harris, who has spent 20 years writing a book on Washington Square's history and architecture. "As far as I know -- and I've called N.Y.U. to ask -- I think that was the first time N.Y.U. has ever compromised." 

CORRECTION-DATE: April 21, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about the expansion of New York University in Greenwich Village referred imprecisely to a dormitory on 14th Street. Although it stands on the former site of Luchow's, the German restaurant, N.Y.U. did not replace that building. It was demolished after a fire, before the university bought the property.
A map and its key represented the histories of three buildings incorrectly. The buildings -- two on the west side of Broadway between West Fourth Street and Waverly Place and one on the southwest corner of Greene Street and East Eighth Street -- should have been colored blue, not red, to show that they were owned by N.Y.U. before 1970; they were not acquired or leased after 1970.

HEADLINE: Assembly Republicans Fail In Budget Amendment Effort 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 18 

 BODY:
Republicans in the Assembly tried unsuccessfully today to force a vote on a raft of measures intended to speed up the budget process by tacking them as amendments to a $6.7 billion stopgap spending bill.
 In an unusual tactic, the Republican minority offered as one of its amendments a bill sponsored by Sandra R. Galef, a maverick Democrat from Westchester County. The bill would require the Senate and Assembly to appoint a standing conference committee that, among other things, would automatically work out a budget compromise once each house had passed a budget resolution. Last year, Ms. Galef had more than 100 co-sponsors on the bill from both sides of the aisle. 
 The amendment put some Assembly Democrats who had supported the bill in an awkward position, forcing them to choose between loyalty to Speaker Sheldon Silver and a change that many see as positive.
It was a measure of Mr. Silver's strength, a year after he survived a coup attempt, that the Assembly voted 91 to 48 along party lines to keep the amendment from going to the floor for a vote.
Even Ms. Galef, who had been among those advocating Mr. Silver's ouster last year, voted with the speaker. She said she wanted to give him more time to make good on his promise to members in December that he would negotiate a bill similar to hers with Senate leaders.
"It was a hard decision," she said after the vote. "I wanted to give him a little more chance with the process."
The Democrats also shot down the Republicans' other budget reform proposals. One would have let the comptroller dictate revenue estimates if the Legislature and governor could not agree by a March deadline. Another called for a constitutional amendment that would require the state to use the previous year's budget if a budget was more than 60 days late. Democrats kept both from coming to a vote.
The Republican maneuvers came as both houses passed a $6.7 billion spending bill to keep the government operating at last year's levels. This bill is the second to be passed in a month and covers the state payroll as well as payments to school districts and local governments.
For the 17th straight year, the governor and legislative leaders failed to reach an agreement on a spending plan before the April 1 budget deadline. Negotiations remained deadlocked today. Gov. George E. Pataki and Mr. Silver remain far apart not only on their estimates of how much revenue the state will receive, but also on how much should be spent on aid to schools and how much should be kept in reserves.
"I am disappointed that a final budget is still not in place and that the Assembly majority continues to insist on spending levels that would turn back the clock to the day of multibillion-dollar deficits," Governor Pataki said in a statement.
School aid has become the largest stumbling block in the budget talks. Assembly Democrats are demanding an increase of at least $1.7 billion in each of the next two years while the governor has insisted on an increase of about $382 million this fiscal year. The Republicans who control the Senate have proposed an increase of around $925 million.
The governor has also argued that the state should place as much money as possible in reserve funds to hedge against the national economic downturn, a fiscal goal that dovetails neatly with his political desire to avoid making budget cuts before his re-election campaign next year.
In the Senate the roles were reversed. The Democrats bemoaned the late budget in long-winded speeches, while the Republican majority quietly passed the monthlong spending extension. "I think it stinks that we don't pass the state budget on time," said Senator Byron W. Brown, a Buffalo Democrat. "This is an admission that we are not doing our job."

MINEOLA: PESTICIDE NOTIFICATION RULING -- A state law requiring pesticide companies to notify neighbors at least 48 hours before pesticides can be used at a customer's residence has encountered a legal setback. Justice Stephen Bucaria of State Supreme Court determined in a ruling dated April 11 and released Tuesday that the Nassau County Legislature had failed to conduct a required environmental impact study before implementing the law. Pesticide companies argue that the notification provision is burdensome. Hope Reeves (NYT)

ITHACA: EX-TAIWAN CHIEF TO VISIT CORNELL -- Lee Teng-hui, whose 1995 visit to the United States aggravated relations between Washington and Beijing when he delivered a speech with political overtones at Cornell University, plans to visit Cornell again. Mr. Lee, president of Taiwan during his earlier visit and now a private citizen, plans a May 2-4 visit to Cornell, where a new research institute will be named for him. Mr. Lee, who has a doctorate in agricultural economics from Cornell, also plans to see his granddaughter, a Cornell student. China interpreted Mr. Lee's earlier visit as support for Taiwanese independence, which Beijing opposes. The State Department has not yet said whether it will grant Mr. Lee a visa.

MANHATTAN: REVISED RENT RULES CHALLENGED -- Legal aid and tenant groups plan to file lawsuits today challenging the state's recent revision of rent regulations in New York City and Nassau, Westchester and Rockland Counties as pro-landlord. The groups contend that the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal revised numerous rules to hurt tenants. The groups contend that the agency exceeded its legal authority and violated requirements to publicize and explain its proposals. The agency has defended its actions as proper. Bruce Lambert (NYT)

MANHATTAN: LIBRARIANS APPROVE CONTRACT -- Librarians working in public libraries in Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island voted overwhelmingly Monday night to approve a contract that gives them a pay raise of 16 percent this year, officials with the New York Public Library Guild announced Tuesday. With about two-fifths of the union's 500 librarians voting, the vote was 167 to ratify and 30 against. In return, the union agreed to give up two days off and the daily 20-minute break periods.

NEW JERSEY

TRENTON: SCHOOL BUDGET ELECTION RESULTS -- Voters approved only 81.1 percent of school budgets in Tuesday's elections, down from a record 88.1 percent last year, the State Department of Education announced yesterday. Voter turnout was 13.5 percent, up from 12.5 percent in 1999. A spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association, said that historically, voter approval of budgets drops in sour economic times and rises in good times. Steve Strunsky (NYT)

EWING: BOMB SUSPECT ARRESTED -- One month after a homemade bomb was found on the campus of the College of New Jersey, the Mercer County prosecutor's office has arrested a suspect, Jonathan Roberts, 19, of Milford. Mr. Roberts, a freshman at the college, was arraigned yesterday and entered pleas of not guilty to charges of bomb making and intent to use an explosive device. He faces up to $15,000 in fines and five years in prison, as well as expulsion from the college. The police did not speculate on a motive. (NYT)

CONNECTICUT

NORWICH: CLUB ADMITS 2 BLACKS -- A private club that rejected a black man's application last year and prompted accusations of racism has agreed to admit two other black men. The club, the Norwich Elks, on Monday night admitted Detective Dennis Jenkins and Sgt. Sidney Luther of the state police, who both live in Norwich. Last fall the club twice rejected Mannie J. Cooper, left, whose application was again turned down on Monday. Some club members said Mr. Cooper was rejected because he was from another town, Groton, and had also sought to intimidate the club into admitting him. (NYT)

HARTFORD: NURSING-HOME LABOR DISPUTE -- A federal judge in Bridgeport has refused to order the state to immediately stop giving financial aid to 40 nursing homes hurt by a one-day strike last month.

KEEPING OUT FOOT-AND-MOUTH

BYLINE:  AP 

 BODY:
 To reduce the risk of an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, dairy farmers and others in New York State's agriculture industry are taking stringent measures. The Northeast Dairy Producers Association is advising its members to take extra precautions to reduce the chance of an infection of foot-and-mouth, a highly contagious and economically devastating disease. 
The warnings come a day after the United States Department of Agriculture said the chance of a foot-and-mouth outbreak on American soil was "quite great." Peter Gregg, spokesman for the association, said members were closing their farms to anyone who had visited Europe in the last several months, stepping up monitoring of farm visitors, discontinuing tours and keeping out nonessential visitors. At Cornell University, officials responded to the disease with a ban on guest visits to two of its animal research facilities.

HEADLINE: G.M. Earnings Drop, but Forecasts Remain Positive 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 18 

 BODY:
General Motors announced this morning that it had earned 87 percent less in the first quarter than it did a year earlier, as its shipments to North American dealerships dropped sharply and the prices of new vehicles eroded.
 But G.M.'s profits were still nearly twice what Wall Street expected, and its stock jumped even before the Federal Reserve cut interest rates. G.M. shares closed at $56.80, up $3.17. 
 In a favorable sign for the strength of the American economy in the months ahead, G.M. said it would produce 30,000 more cars than previously planned in the second quarter, because sales have been somewhat stronger than expected. That represents an increase of 2.3 percent in G.M.'s overall vehicle production plans in North America. 
With the increase, G.M. will be idling fewer of its factories in the second quarter than it did in the first quarter. But output will still be 15 percent lower than in the second quarter of last year, when G.M. was running many of its factories with maximum overtime. Auto factory cutbacks played a big role in slowing economic growth during the first quarter, trimming the annual pace of growth by nearly a full percentage point. 
John M. Devine, the chief financial officer at G.M., said today that auto industry sales so far in April were slightly weaker than during the first quarter. But that would still make sales unusually strong by historical standards. In a telephone interview this afternoon, Mr. Devine welcomed the Fed's reduction in overnight interest rates but said G.M. had already been expecting rates to decline by a full percentage point by the end of May.
"We're glad to see it, but it's not unexpected, and we'd like to see more later in the year, and we'd like to see a tax cut as well," Mr. Devine said.
He also cautioned that given recent evidence of a slower economy, "We're going to see some further erosion in the U.S. car and truck industry unless some things change."
In a conference call with analysts and reporters this morning, before the Fed acted, Mr. Devine said that G.M. was comfortable with an estimate earlier this year by financial analysts that the company would earn 95 cents a share in the second quarter. He discouraged any increase in earnings estimates, despite the company's plans for extra production and despite a recent increase in the average estimate to $1.02 a share, saying that there were still some risks in the second-quarter outlook.
Mr. Devine said G.M. was also still comfortable with analysts' expectations earlier this year that earnings would be $4.25 a share this year, but noted that the company would have to do well in the third and fourth quarters to meet this target. The consensus of analysts recently fell to $3.23, however.
Automakers book profits when they sell cars to dealers, rather than when the dealers actually sell cars to customers. So the profit of automakers tends to track their factory production quite closely. G.M.'s profits took a nose dive in the first quarter, despite strong sales by dealers to consumers, because G.M. cut production drastically, idling factories for weeks at a time. This was done to reduce the enormous inventory of unsold cars that had accumulated at G.M. dealerships late last year. 
Mr. Devine expressed satisfaction this morning with the current level of inventories. "It puts us in good position going into the spring selling season," he said.
G.M. earned $237 million in the first quarter, or 53 cents a share, down from $1.78 billion a year earlier, or $2.80 a share. Revenue fell 9 percent, to $42.62 billion.
The first-quarter profits this year included a one-time gain of $12 million, or 3 cents a share, because of the adoption of new accounting rules relating to the treatment of derivatives, financial instruments usually used to manage risks. Excluding the one-time gain, G.M. earned 50 cents a share. That was nearly double the 26 cents a share that financial analysts, who also excluded the one-time gain, had been expecting, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.
But Mr. Devine and the analysts were quick to point out that the consensus had been for a very weak quarter. "It was a positive surprise against very low expectations -- it's the year-over-year decline that better reflects the difficult industry conditions the company faces," John Casesa, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said.
G.M.'s car-loan financing arm is bracing for trouble, despite earning $431 million in the first quarter. Mr. Devine said the unit had cut in half, to $15 billion, its outstanding commercial paper. This kind of short-term debt could be difficult to roll over if the economy sours or if G.M.'s credit rating is reduced. The unit switched to longer-term borrowing instead.
G.M.'s sales to dealers plunged by 248,000 vehicles in the first quarter, with most of the drop occurring in North America. The average price per vehicle after rebates and other discounts also dropped by 1 percent in the first quarter. 
Discounting has spread to full-size pickup trucks and sport utilities, a segment where automakers seldom needed to resort to such measures until recently, Mr. Devine said this afternoon, adding, "It became a battleground in the first quarter."

HEADLINE: 5 of 6 Big U.S. Airlines Post First-Quarter Losses 

BYLINE:  By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Can airline managers pass the test? In the late 1990's, when the industry was reaping record profits, many airline executives argued that their stocks were no longer cyclical and therefore deserved a higher valuation from Wall Street.
 But investors and analysts responded that such a change would come only if the executives could prove that they could earn profits in the face of an economic slowdown. 
 Now, the downturn has arrived and the initial results are not encouraging. Five of the country's six largest airlines reported quarterly losses yesterday, citing a steep decline in the lucrative corporate travel market stemming from the weakening economy and higher labor and fuel costs. 
Most disappointing was the UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines, which had an operating loss of $305 million, or $5.82 a share, in the first quarter, in contrast to a profit of $136 million, or 84 cents a share in the period last year. Analysts had been expecting a loss of $4.24 a share.
United said it was likely to post a loss in the current quarter, as well, and warned that if revenue from business travel did not pick up in the coming months, it could show a loss for the full year.
The airline also said that it did not expect its proposed $4.3 billion purchase of US Airways to receive regulatory approval before July, raising doubts that the deal might in fact be completed. 
US Airways posted worse-than-expected losses as well yesterday. It reported a loss of $171 million, or $2.55 a share, compared with a loss of $218 million, or $3.27 a share, in the first quarter of 2000. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call had predicted a loss of $1.74 a share.
US Airways' losses have mounted since UAL announced its bid last May, a situation the airline is increasingly using to press regulators into approving the deal. "The competitive environment underscores the necessity of US Airways becoming a part of a larger network," its chairman, Stephen M. Wolf, said in a statement. 
But the deal faces doubters in Washington and around the country. Leo F. Mullin, chairman and chief executive of Delta Air Lines and an opponent of the deal, said his estimate of its chances of success had diminished to less than 50-50. 
Delta also disappointed securities analysts, posting its first loss in 24 quarters. The airline lost $133 million, or $1.11 a share, including one-time charges, in contrast to net income of $216 million, or $1.61 a share, in the period last year. The average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call was for a loss of 85 cents a share. 
In addition to the slowdown in business travel, Delta cut back its schedule during the quarter as many pilots refused to fly overtime. They sought to exert pressure on the company, which has been in difficult contract negotiations with their union, the Air Line Pilots Association. 
The two sides returned to the bargaining table yesterday, but Mr. Mullin told analysts that they remained more than $1.7 billion apart and he reiterated that he did not think an agreement would be reached before a strike deadline on April 29.
He said, though, that he was certain the White House would intervene to prevent a walkout for 60 days after the deadline by appointing a so-called presidential emergency board.
About 1,300 pilots at Comair, a commuter airline owned by Delta, walked off the job on March 26, grounding the carrier. Delta said that strike was costing it $3 million to $4 million a day in lost revenue. 
Yesterday, the National Mediation Board, which supervises labor relations in the airline industry, asked the two sides in the Comair dispute to meet in Washington next Wednesday, which would be the first talks since the walkout.
Mr. Mullin said Comair's most recent offer would have raised its pilot costs by 30 percent while the demands of the pilots, who are also represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, amounted to an 80 percent increase. Giving in to the pilots, he said, would hinder Comair's ability to expand into smaller markets and raise costs at Delta's other commuter subsidiary and its partner airlines. 
The AMR Corporation, the parent of American Airlines and Trans World Airlines, and Northwest Airlines, also reported quarterly losses. Both losses were slightly less than analysts had predicted. 
AMR reported a loss of $43 million, or 28 cents a share, in contrast to a profit of $89 million, or 57 cents a share, last year. Analyst had predicted a loss of 30 cents a share. 
Northwest lost $123 million, or $1.47 a share, excluding one-time charges. Last year it lost $42 million, or 51 cents a share, on the same basis. Analysts were expecting a $1.64-a-share loss. 
Most of the airlines predicted that the slowdown in business travel would continue in the current quarter but said that leisure travel remained strong. Several analysts say that if the economy recovers in the second half of the year, as most economists expect, the industry could still eke out a profit for the year. 
That would be the silver lining to the current downturn, said Michael F. Linenberg, an airline analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York. Since the industry was deregulated in 1978, he said, it has never been profitable when the gross domestic product has expanded at a rate less than 2 percent. 
Output is now expected to grow 1 percent this year. If the industry can make money in 2001, it just might get the higher valuations from investors it has been seeking, Mr. Linenberg said.
"We stand by the notion that analysts do need to rethink the way they look at the industry," Rono Dutta, United's president, said yesterday. He said that the airlines were much more disciplined now than in the early 1990's when they aggressively expanded their fleets. This time, they were prepared for a slowdown, he said, but high fuel and labor costs wrecked even those plans. 
"We expected a decline on the revenue side," Mr. Dutta added. "What surprised us was the cost side."
Nearly all the carriers, including United, have announced cost-cutting campaigns to make up the difference. "I think the companies realize there is an opportunity," Mr. Linenberg said. "Several executives have said to me: this is the year that we have to make money."

Legions of protesters have gathered in this old fortified port city to rally against globalization and the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas, warning that eliminating tariffs and encouraging trade from the high Arctic to the Argentine pampas will lead to exploitation of workers and damage to the environment. 
 The plans for a hemispheric trade deal will be the center of attention at the third Summit of the Americas, which is to begin here Friday. But turning those plans into reality is still a long way off. The negotiations alone are expected to last until January 2005, and then the 34 countries -- every American nation except Cuba -- must individually agree to enter what would become the world's largest trade area. 
 Largely obscured by all the grand-scale talk is a faster-moving current. Countries are plunging ahead with smaller deals, often involving just two partners, that remove trade obstacles much sooner than the glacial hemispheric negotiations will. 
Mexico is the champion here, putting deals in place with Chile, Guatemala, El Salvador and others in recent years. Canada, too, has signed bilateral deals with Costa Rica and Chile. 
Even the United States, which first raised the idea of a hemispherewide trade pact at the first Summit of the Americas in 1994, is now active on the parallel path of bilateral trade agreements.
After meeting with Chile's president, Ricardo Lagos, in Washington earlier this week, President Bush said he was confident that a final deal with Chile could be reached by the end of this year. "It's in the nation's best interest to do so," he said. 
Simultaneously working on a two-way deal with Chile and on a larger trade pact that would subsume it appears to put Washington's trade policy a bit at odds with itself. But trade experts and administration officials say the two-pronged strategy makes sense in the long run because of the momentum it can create.
"Simply put, Chile can be a catalyst, an announcement to the region that trade in the Americas is on the agenda in a way it just wasn't before," said a United States diplomat close to the negotiations with Chile. "Washington can move the agenda forward with Chile and let loose some of the issues that have been holding everything back since 1994."
In early 1994, just months after the bruising battle over ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the broad authority that Congress gave President Bill Clinton to negotiate trade deals expired. Without this fast-track authority, as it is known, presidents cannot submit complete trade deals to Congress for an all-or-nothing vote, as Mr. Clinton did with Nafta. 
When Mr. Clinton proposed the Free Trade Area of the Americas in late 1994, he promised the nations of Latin America that he would soon regain fast-track authority, which every president since Richard Nixon has had. Congress had different ideas, and was never willing to reauthorize fast track. The nations of Latin America and the Caribbean grew frustrated and began to doubt Washington's interest in pursuing a hemispheric trade deal. 
Among the most frustrated was Chile, which was promised a chance to join Nafta in 1994 but saw little progress over the next six years. As his term was drawing to a close, Mr. Clinton met with President Lagos last December, and ordered a resumption of talks even though he did not have fast-track authority. 
The move won support from some trade experts, who thought a simple deal with Chile, widely regarded as South America's most disciplined and successful economy, could get through Congress even without fast track, and that moving ahead with Chile could prime the pump for a much more ambitious project, like the hemispheric free trade deal, and for new approval for fast track, now renamed trade promotion authority. 
"Americans have for a long time had this 'contagion' sense of negotiations," said Peter A. Petri, dean of the graduate school of international economics and finance at Brandeis University.
Professor Petri said the theory appeared to have been at work in the early part of the 1990's, when progress on Nafta helped pave the way for conclusion of the long-delayed Uruguay round of trade negotiations, and eventually the creation of the World Trade Organization. 
Moreover, the deal with Chile treads lightly on the sensitive issues of labor and environmental standards, proposing that if either country does not enforce its own laws in these areas it could be subject to fines -- but not trade sanctions, which Chile and most other Latin American nations oppose. 
Professor Petri said that by including such a provision in a Chilean-American trade deal, the administration might prepare the ground for compromises on labor and environmental standards that could win over some Democrats in Congress. President Bush needs some Democratic backing if he is to obtain trade promotion authority this year. 
"Sometimes the only way to move from a lower level of negotiation to a higher one," Professor Petri said, "is to start simple."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
Variety is a good gauge of progress. But how well can economists measure it?

BYLINE:  By Virginia Postrel; This column appears here every Thursday. Virginia Postrel is the editor at large of Reason Magazine and the author of "The Future and Its Enemies." E-mail: vpostrel@reason.com

 BODY:
ARE you better off than you were four years ago? It's not just a rhetorical jab for presidential candidates; it's a vexing puzzle for economists. From a purely material point of view, what does it mean to be better off? In a dynamic economy where goods and services are constantly changing, how do you gauge progress?
 The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, raised the issue in a speech late last month, arguing that it's more important to improve economic measurement than to tweak forecasting models. Before economists can say that the price of a good has gone up or down, which is essential to measuring productivity or inflation, they must define what the good is. For a 12-ounce can of Diet Coke, the problem is trivial. For health care, it is not. Is the good a particular procedure or drug, the treatment of a given condition, or a particular outcome? Ubiquitous "new and improved" products further complicate the picture. 
 While never easy, the measurement problem is becoming increasingly difficult. A few decades ago, Mr. Greenspan noted, "an average price of hot-rolled steel sheet and a corresponding total tonnage was precise enough for most analytic needs."
"By the same token, tons of steel per work hour in a rolling mill yielded rough approximations of underlying productivity for most purposes," he added. 
But economic value increasingly comes from less generic, harder-to-measure and often intangible goods. To understand the economy and avoid misstating the rates of inflation or productivity growth, economists need to find better ways to measure what's actually going on.
That's a hard task, especially given the data available. Consider what most businesspeople believe to be one of the most important developments in recent years: an increase in product variety. "We boring economists are left to say, 'What hard evidence do we have of that?' " says Peter J. Klenow of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. "You may be right, but how do we quantify that? What data can we use to systematically measure that?"
Even if variety is increasing, that doesn't prove that consumers are better off. Perhaps they're bypassing the proliferating new brands in favor of old standbys. In that case, variety would just be noise. And there's also the issue of exactly how much variety has grown. Is it really such a big deal? "The question is whether something grew 3 percent in a decade or 30 percent in a decade," said Mark Bils, an economist at the University of Rochester.
He and Dr. Klenow tackled the variety question in a paper presented at this year's American Economic Association meetings and scheduled for publication in The American Economic Review. (The paper, "The Acceleration in Variety Growth," is available at www.klenow.com.) To do so, however, they had to be ingenious.
That's because the government doesn't collect statistics on product introductions. To the contrary, the Bureau of Labor Statistics emphasizes old products. The bureau's agents go out each month and look for a list of the same products -- a certain weight box of Tide, for example -- and record their prices.
That's how we get the Consumer Price Index. Most of the time, the bureau adds new products only as substitutes for old ones that have disappeared.
This quirk of the data gave the two economists an idea. Perhaps they could measure the arrival of new products, which the government doesn't measure, by looking at the disappearance of old ones. If variety is increasing in a certain category, like breakfast cereals, the new products may be displacing old ones; there would, in short, be more product turnover than in other categories. Alternatively, it's possible that products are disappearing because no one wants them. In that case, consumers would be spending less on those categories.
Dr. Klenow and Dr. Bils divided the government's product categories into two groups, depending on turnover. "Dynamic" goods and services showed frequent changes, while "static" products almost never changed. Not surprisingly, various sorts of clothing were dynamic, while staples like milk and gasoline were static.
The economists then looked at consumer spending from 1959 to 1999 and found a striking result. Even after correcting for income growth, relative spending on dynamic goods increased 1.3 percent a year, "a very sizable shift of 68 percent over the past 40 years," they write. When they divided the time period in half, they found an even stronger shift. Seventy percent of the movement toward dynamic goods took place from 1979 to 1999. That movement appears to have accelerated in the mid-1980's, Dr. Klenow says.
He argues that the shift from static to dynamic goods indicates that consumers really like the new goods. To get them, people are willing to spend less on other things. Television used to be a static category until cable increased variety, and telephone service was stable before cell phones. Now both are dynamic categories, and they're attracting a bigger portion of consumers' budgets.
The same is true for more controversial shifts, like increased spending on prescription and nonprescription drugs -- both dynamic categories.
Consumers are voting with their dollars in favor of more variety. "It's not like we'd be happier or better off if we just said, 'No, no new drugs. Only old drugs,' " Dr. Klenow says.
But these highly visible sectors have no monopoly on variety. Along with all sorts of consumer electronics, prescription and nonprescription drugs, and physician services, dynamic goods include such mundane categories as breakfast cereals, candy, sports equipment and toiletries and cosmetics.
There are not only more brands on the shelves (and more different services available), but people are spending more on the categories that offer them more choices. Increasing variety raises Americans' standard of living, by giving us more of what we actually want rather than forcing us to make one-size-fits-all choices.

HEADLINE: Earnings Fall 21% at Merrill Lynch, Close to Estimates 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
Merrill Lynch & Company, the nation's biggest brokerage firm, reported a 21 percent drop in net income for the last quarter yesterday and said it would have trouble meeting expectations this quarter if market conditions did not improve.
 Having eliminated 1,700 jobs and made other expense cuts, Merrill kept its profit within pennies per share -- one way or the other -- of what analysts had forecast. But analysts generally were impressed that Merrill managed to earn as much as it did in a period when individual investors had retreated from the stock market. 
 The firm earned $874 million, or 92 cents a diluted share, in the quarter ended March 30, down from $1.10 billion, or $1.24 a share, in the period a year earlier. Some analysts said Merrill had missed their consensus estimate of 90 cents a share because the results included a one-time gain of about 5 cents a share on Merrill's sale of an energy-trading unit. But the firm's chief financial officer, Thomas H. Patrick, said analysts expected a gain from that sale and some had factored it into their estimates. 
Either way, Merrill's stock showed a muted reaction from investors until the Federal Reserve Board reduced interest rates a few hours into the trading day. After the rate cut, Merrill's shares jumped along with other financial stocks. Merrill ended the day up 9.3 percent, rising $5.65, to $66.25, though some other brokerage stocks had bigger gains.
Analysts said the latest Fed action would probably not significantly change the outlook on Wall Street. "The concern is that retail America is just sitting on their hands," said Henry McVey, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "I don't view the rate cut by itself as enough to vault Jane and John Doe back into the equity markets."
Mr. Patrick said the firm's bond trading and underwriting businesses remained strong throughout the quarter as interest rates declined, but most other businesses, especially stocks, deteriorated. "If this continues, it's going to create some real earnings challenges," he said.
Merrill may fare better than its competitors because it has been quicker to cut costs, analysts said. Then again, they said, Merrill had become bloated, especially in its brokerage, or retail, unit.
Since E. Stanley O'Neal took charge of the brokerage business in the United States early last year, he has tried to slim it down and make it more profitable. Last year, he eliminated about 2,000 jobs and several hundred more job cuts are in the works, according to people at Merrill.
Mr. O'Neal, considered the leading candidate to succeed David H. Komansky as Merrill's chief executive, has promised a sharp increase in profit margins, and so far he has delivered. The domestic brokerage business earned a pretax profit equal to 16.4 percent of its revenue, up more than two percentage points from a year ago, though it still is a drag on the rest on the firm.
"They've made significant strides on the cost-management side," said Guy Moszkowski, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. "They took out layers of costs that, frankly, their competitors don't have."
On the investment banking side, he said, "they're being realistic about what they should pay people." He noted that the compensation expenses the firm reported amounted to only about half of its revenue for the quarter and that it earmarked less money to pay year-end bonuses than it had a year ago.
All told, Merrill had a pretax profit margin of 21 percent, down from 22.4 percent a year ago. The firm's return on equity was 18.4 percent, near the low end of its target range of 18 to 20 percent.

HEADLINE: THE RATE CUT: THE OVERVIEW; 
FED, IN A SURPRISE, CUTS RATES AGAIN, SPURRING MARKETS

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18 

 BODY:
Faced with evidence that businesses are retrenching rapidly in a weakening economy, the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point today, igniting a powerful rally on Wall Street.
 Acting between scheduled meetings, the Fed reduced its federal funds target rate on overnight loans between banks to 4.5 percent from 5 percent. It also cut its discount rate on loans to banks from the Federal Reserve system to 4 percent from 4.5 percent. 
 It was the fourth half-point cut in rates by the central bank since the beginning of the year, and in announcing its decision today the Fed signaled that it was likely to reduce rates further in coming months.
The decision reflected increasing concern within the Fed that the economy was at risk from a steep falloff in corporate profits and a related pullback by companies in the purchase of computers, communications technology and other types of equipment. 
The Fed also cited concern that the drop in many stock prices over the last year would lead consumers to rein in spending, and that a slowdown in economies around the world would hurt exporters. Page C1. 
The move surprised most investors, who had concluded in recent days that the economy was beginning to stabilize and that the Fed was unlikely to cut rates again before its next scheduled meeting on May 15. 
But Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has shown in the past that he will sometimes act when the market's guard is down to give his moves maximum impact. If that was his intention today, he succeeded.
Stock prices, which were rising even before the announcement by the Fed just after 11 a.m., shot up immediately after it and held their gains. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 399.10 points, to close at 10,615.83. The Nasdaq composite index finished at 2,079.44, up 156.22 points for the day.
"If ever there were a surprise, this is it," said Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm. 
Although its full effects on the economy will not be felt for months, the move immediately began bringing down borrowing costs for some businesses and consumers. Banks dropped their prime lending rate to 7.5 percent from 8 percent, a step that should help small-business borrowers and consumers with some types of auto, home equity and mortgage loans. 
The decision was made during a conference call among Fed officials that began at 8:30 this morning and lasted less than an hour. Although Mr. Greenspan has the authority to move interest rates on his own between meetings, the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee took a vote in this case. 
The Fed did not disclose the margin by which the committee, which currently has 10 voting members, approved the cut in the federal funds rate. But Fed officials said the cut in the discount rate, which is controlled by the five-member Federal Reserve board, was unanimous.
In acting today, the Fed appeared to have multiple objectives. 
While Mr. Greenspan has been eager to break the widely held belief in the markets that the Fed will always act to underpin stock prices, he has also recognized the importance of market psychology to the general economy. In giving a market that was already moving upward a big lift today, he seemed intent on reinforcing whatever optimism there is on Wall Street.
But the Fed also seemed determined to make clear that it understood the complex nature of the current slowdown, and the danger that it could turn into a recession.
In its statement, the Fed noted that in some ways the economy was behaving just as would be expected at a time of falling interest rates and that there were signs that a recession could be avoided. 
The housing industry, a backbone of the economy, is holding up reasonably well, and consumers continue to spend, the Fed said. Companies are whittling down excess inventories of goods and supplies. And the most important measure of business efficiency and economic potential, productivity growth, "appears to be largely intact," the statement said.
The statement did not mention it, but the Fed could also have cited its own report on Tuesday that industrial production picked up unexpectedly in March, suggesting that manufacturing is bouncing back as businesses work off their inventories.
Up until now, Mr. Greenspan and many other Fed officials have stressed such upbeat signals, and have indicated that the economy is likely to rebound quickly once inventories return to their proper levels. Even after today's meeting, one official, Anthony M. Santomero, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, told reporters after a speech in Trenton that economic recovery was "just around the corner." 
But in its statement today, the Fed also noted more explicitly than it has previously the risks to the economy from a sharp falloff in investment by businesses in new technology and equipment.
In doing so, the Fed was acknowledging an argument advanced by some economists for the last several months: that a steep drop in business investment could make this downturn painful and long-lasting because it could not easily be reversed by lower interest rates.
Lower rates can encourage consumers to spend by reducing their borrowing costs. But a company that decides it has too much capacity is unlikely to invest in new equipment no matter how low interest rates go.
The problem has shown up clearly in recent weeks among suppliers of technology equipment. Cisco Systems, the leading supplier of Internet networking systems, said Monday that its revenue in the current quarter would plunge 30 percent from the previous three months, reflecting an abrupt decline in orders.
There were some indications that the Fed's outlook about the dangers from softer capital spending had changed just in the last week or so. Last Tuesday, William Poole, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and a voting member of the open market committee, said that there "are compelling times when quick action is necessary, but this is not one of them."
In its statement today, the Fed said that investment in equipment by companies "has continued to soften and the persistent erosion in current and expected profitability, in combination with rising uncertainty about the business outlook, seems poised to dampen capital spending going forward."
The slowdown in investment, "together with possible effects of earlier reductions in equity wealth on consumption and the risk of slower growth abroad, threatens to keep the pace of economic activity unacceptably weak," the statement said.
Analysts said that if a tumble in capital spending rather than consumer spending proved to be the economy's primary malady, it could leave the United States facing a lengthy period in which growth, profits and the financial markets would be sluggish.
"The areas of the economy over which they do not have a great deal of control are the most problematic right now," said Martin A. Regalia, chief economist at the United States Chamber of Commerce. 
"They are limited in what they can do to improve capital spending, and that's the weakest sector," he said. "The only thing the Fed can do is try to increase demand, which will give rise to increased production, which supposedly will give rise to increased investment. It's the only bullet they've got, and they're going to use it."
Using its usual code words, the Fed suggested that further rate cuts were likely, perhaps as soon as the next scheduled meeting on May 15. The central bank said it continued to believe that the "risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."
Analysts said they expected at least another half-point cut in rates in the next few months, especially if inflation remained tame. Should unemployment surge, the cuts could be even bigger, they said.

Other economists say that the economy is not nearly as weak as it was during the 1990-91 recession, arguing that a robust housing market, tame inflation and fairly high consumer confidence levels mean the economy can quickly begin growing at a strong pace again.

Rumsfeld Would Withdraw U.S. Troops From Sinai
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld surprised Prime Minister Ariel Sharon during a meeting in Washington last month by saying the United States wanted to withdraw the American soldiers serving as peacekeepers in the Sinai, Bush administration officials said. State Department officials who specialize in Mideast policy were not told in advance. A1

Palestinian militants fired a fresh volley of homemade mortar shells at Israeli settlements and military posts, only hours after Israel withdrew from a corner of the Gaza Strip. President Bush spoke by telephone with Mr. Sharon, in an apparent effort to smooth over the tensions raised by Washington's criticism of the Israeli incursion into Gaza. A8

HEADLINE: The Work of a Hemisphere 

BYLINE:  By Colin L. Powell; Colin L. Powell is secretary of state.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Working with our friends in the Americas is one of the first and highest priorities of President Bush's administration. If our neighbors are democratic and law-abiding, open to trade, and willing to cooperate with us on improving the environment, fighting drugs and stopping disease, we can make a vital difference in the life of every American. With this in mind, President Bush has already started to bolster our relationships in this hemisphere. He has met with the leaders of Canada, Mexico, Colombia, El Salvador, Brazil and Chile and meets today with Fernando de la Rua, president of Argentina. Tomorrow, when he travels to Canada to attend the Third Summit of the Americas -- a gathering of 34 democratically elected heads of state -- he will promote this vision of a better life for all who live in the region.
 At the summit, the leaders will set a common agenda of how our democracies can safeguard human rights as they build tighter economic bonds through free trade. The nations that believe in this vision should be proactive in defending these principles -- and will be proactive in Quebec. 
 Much has been accomplished since the first Summit of the Americas in Miami in 1994. At the past two summits, leaders promoted and defended the growth of democracy in the hemisphere. They expanded the rule of law by supporting the Inter-American Convention Against Corruption. They helped protect labor rights, advance the status of women and promote sustainable development.
These regular meetings have also provided a framework for cooperation in many other areas, so that ministers of trade, justice, finance, labor, environment, transportation and energy now meet regularly to tackle the problems we all face and identify ways in which we can help each other. These advances, often out of the public limelight, have strengthened our relationships with our neighbors and improved the lives of all.
Perhaps the best known achievement of the Summit of the Americas is the launching of the negotiations for the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas. We will be able to sell American goods, technology and services without obstacles or restrictions within a single market of over 800 million people, with a combined income of more than $11 trillion, stretching from the Arctic to Cape Horn. President Bush looks forward to re-energizing the negotiations in Quebec.
Similarly, the president will give a further boost to democracy and rule of law, for we have seen in recent years that while democracy may be widespread, in many countries its institutions are fragile. We owe it to those committed to democracy to help protect their commitment. A highlight of the summit will be the affirmation that only democracies can participate in the Summit of the Americas and reap all its benefits. In addition, our leaders will decide on policies to make governments more open to their people, to fight the corruption that undermines societies and business, and more generally to promote good governance at all levels.
Free trade and freedom work together to make life better and our neighborhood safer. But to take advantage of this opportunity, people need skills and education. Thus, the leaders will reaffirm their commitment to improve education systems, increase access to quality education, improve teacher training and expand the use of modern information technology. From the northernmost reaches of Canada to the southern tip of Chile, our children and our neighbors' children will all need to be able to use the latest tools and the best technologies to work together and succeed in the globalized world of the new century.
At the Quebec summit, the president will also support initiatives to help nations prepare for natural disasters -- like the hurricanes, mudslides and earthquakes we have all watched with concern in countries next door -- and to improve health care, strengthen civic groups, promote responsible practices by corporations and protect the environment.
President Bush and I are optimistic about the future for Americans here at home and in our larger neighborhood. At the summit, we will work with other nations to obtain the benefits of free trade, freedom and cooperation. As the president said during his first visit to the State Department, just before his first foreign trip -- to Mexico -- we will "work with our neighbors to build a Western Hemisphere of freedom and prosperity -- a hemisphere bound together by shared ideals and free trade." In Quebec, he and the other leaders will continue to bring the benefits of this vision home to the people of the Americas.

HEADLINE: Alan Greenspan's Surprise Move 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve surprised and pleased investors by cutting its key federal funds interest rate unexpectedly yesterday by another half-point, signaling that it will act aggressively to stave off a recession. It was the fourth such rate cut in as many months, and should quiet critics who have accused Alan Greenspan, the board's chairman, of being too timid in responding to the economic slowdown. Indeed, the Fed's aggressive use of monetary policy, the best short-term stimulus at the government's disposal, also undercuts the White House's attempt to re-package its proposed tax cut as a necessary means to quickly reignite the economy. 
 The move also signaled the Fed's deep concern that an economy facing lower corporate profits, declining capital investment and reduced consumer spending could be headed for a steeper decline. This show of concern fueled a rally on Wall Street, as it did in early January, the last time it cut rates when no regular meeting was scheduled. The timing was important. The mood among many economists was that another cut was urgently needed. Wall Street had expected that the next cut would not come until the bank's next scheduled meeting, on May 15. 
 A cautious Fed could have read Tuesday's better-than-expected manufacturing report, showing that overall American industrial production rose 0.4 percent in March after five consecutive monthly declines, as an invitation to wait until its May meeting before deciding on further action. But at a time when inflationary pressures are negligible, the central bank is rightly more engaged in pumping the economy. After being slashed a full two points this year, the federal funds rate now stands at 4.5 percent, its lowest level since mid-1994. 
In a statement, the Fed openly expressed concern that corporate profits and the resulting slump in business spending "threatens to keep the pace of economic activity unacceptably weak." The Fed also remains worried that consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity and has held up better than corporate spending, may slow in reaction to layoffs and people's diminished stock portfolios. One gauge of consumer confidence has slid to its lowest monthly reading since 1993, and while the unemployment rate remains relatively low, this month the number of initial claims for unemployment insurance hit a five-year high. 
Though it is in the best position to do so, it is not yet clear just how quickly the Fed, even at its most aggressive, can re-start the economy. Unlike most recent slowdowns, this one was not preceded by the inflation that is caused when excessive demand chases too few goods. On the contrary, prodded by the stock market bubble, businesses overinvested in recent years and many are now stuck with excess inventories. Monday's manufacturing report suggested that this problem is abating in the auto industry, but it remains a serious concern for technology companies. Indeed, Mr. Greenspan must have been as alarmed by Monday's announcement by Cisco Systems, the maker of Internet equipment, that it would write off a huge $2.5 billion in excess inventory as he has been by any economic report. 
The concern is that the Fed's traditional anti-recessionary medicine, stimulating spending by lowering the cost of borrowing, may be slow to take effect when businesses have already overinvested and, along with consumers, face high debt burdens. Further cuts, in other words, may be in order.

Apple Returns to Profitability on Strength of New Portable PC

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 18 

 BODY:
Largely on the strength of its hot-selling one-inch-thick titanium-clad portable computer, Apple Computer surprised Wall Street today by reporting a net profit of $43 million, or 12 cents a share, for its second fiscal quarter.
 After a loss in Apple's first fiscal quarter, analysts had expected the company to achieve only a razor-thin profit of a penny a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. 
 The strong results, which included nonrecurring items, were doubly impressive because the rest of the industry is experiencing dismal declines in the wake of the end of the dot-com Internet boom.
In its second quarter, however, Apple continued its roller coaster ride by returning to profitability, proving that the company was still able to generate demand by persuading its best customers to upgrade to full-featured portable computers. 
"With the PowerBook, we hit it right on the money," Steven P. Jobs, Apple's co-founder and chief executive, said in a telephone interview. "We had a lot of innovation this quarter, and our customers responded favorably."
At the same time, Mr. Jobs acknowledged that the company was dealing with the same murky economic climate that is affecting all of Silicon Valley.
"We'll have to play with the economic hand we're dealt," he said. 
Shares of Apple surged 15 percent in after-hours trading, rising $3.38, to $26.18, after finishing the regular session up $2.39, to $22.79.
Apple, which is based in Cupertino, Calif., had earned $233 million, or 64 cents a share, in the second quarter of 2000. Revenue was $1.43 billion this quarter, down 26 percent from the $1.95 billion recorded a year earlier.
The current numbers were a sharp contrast to Apple's first fiscal quarter, when it reported a $247 million loss in a period that is normally its strongest.
"This was a terrific quarter," said Charles Wolf, a financial analyst at Needham & Company. "What it shows is that Apple dances to its own tune. If it has good products it doesn't matter what the PC market does." 
The same has been true in reverse, he added. Last year, when Apple's ambitious G4 Cube computer disappointed the high end of the PC market and the company failed to offer a convincing Christmas consumer product line, its revenue plunged.
This quarter, however, Mr. Jobs once again demonstrated that he had retained a deft touch in offering Apple loyalists products that are still differentiated from the general PC marketplace. 
The company said that it had shipped 751,000 computers during the quarter, a number far higher than many analysts had anticipated. Of that, 115,000 titanium PowerBook G4 computers were shipped, a number that has kept the machine on back-order. The company's chief financial officer, Fred Anderson, said normal inventory levels would be reached at the end of April.
In particular, he said, the new machine, which has a 15-inch flat panel screen and sells for $2,500 to $3,500, helped raise the company's gross margin for the quarter to 26.9 percent, up sharply from the first fiscal quarter.
In addition to strong new-product sales, Mr. Anderson pointed to weakening component costs during the quarter and to the introduction on March 24 of the company's new Macintosh OS X operating system, which generated $19 million in revenue in its first week of sales. 
"The bottom line exceeded our expectations," said David Bailey, an analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison & Company. "The great majority of the difference this quarter came in gross margins, fueled by strong sale of the professional products." 
Although the company said that it planned a series of new products later this year, Mr. Anderson said he was remaining cautious and actually lowering the total revenue forecast for the entire year to $5.6 billion to $5.8 billion from the $6 billion that was the target in January.
"We want to be very conservative for our guidance for the top line," he said.

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The New York Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.

Museums

* "ABCD: A COLLECTION OF ART BRUT," Museum of American Folk Art, 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue at 66th Street, Manhattan, (212) 977-7170 (through July). Memorably vivid and widely abused, the phrase Art Brut (meaning raw or rough art) was coined in the 1940's by the French artist Jean Dubuffet. This exhibition, drawn from the holdings of a Paris-based foundation, attempts to reinstate his original meaning, revisiting the amazing pantheon of artists who inspired it and proposing some additions. Its many highlights include works by acknowledged greats like Adolf Wolfli, Aloise Corbaz, Henry Darger and Augustin Lesage, but the show also introduces many equally riveting artists unfamiliar to American audiences. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Free (Roberta Smith).

* "AFRICAN FORMS," Museum for African Art, 593 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 966-1313 (through Aug. 8). This show forgoes the figurative sculptures and masks that made African art a foundation of Western modernism to concentrate on supposedly humbler stuff, objects of physical adornment and daily use. With some 400 objects created by 156 ethnic groups, it proceeds in clusters of related carved wood neck rests, stools and boxes; ivory hairpins and snuff bottles; all kinds of jewelry; baskets and ceramic vessels; and spoons, weapons and musical instruments. The show is pervaded by an elegance, an economy of form and a sensitivity to materials that is both intensely spiritual and protomodern. Figurative sculpture and masks may be the "high art" of Africa, but there is no low. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50, students and 65+ (Smith).

"ALUMINUM BY DESIGN: JEWELRY TO JETS," Smithsonian Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400 (through July 15). Once regarded as a precious metal, aluminum today is one of the cheapest and most useful of all materials, the stuff of lawn chairs and airplanes. Though lacking the kind of sumptuous objects you would find in an exhibition devoted to gold or silver, this exhibition tells a fascinating story. It begins with Victorian jewelry, pauses for a good look at elegant Modernist furniture and housewares, touches on sports equipment and soda cans and concludes with contemporary objects like a chaise longue by Marc Newson, a silvery blob with riveted skin that looks like a prop from David Lynch's film "Dune." Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Tuesdays to 9 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $8; $5, students and 62+ (Ken Johnson).

* "BEAUTY, HONOR AND TRADITION: THE LEGACY OF PLAINS INDIAN SHIRTS," Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of the American Indian, George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212) 514-3700 (through Nov. 4). To Plains Indians of the 18th and 19th centuries, magnificently decorated hide shirts were symbols of bravery earned only by the most courageous in battle. Obsessively fringed and embellished with porcupine quills, paint, ribbon, hair and, later, tight patterns of colored glass beads, the shirts took on the spirits of their owners and even today are made for wearing at powwows and in recognition of other accomplishments. Celebrating the power of this glory gear, almost 50 dazzlers in the museum's collection are on view, dating from about 1820 to the 1990's. Among the more fascinating examples are a brilliantly painted Crow shirt (1890) with beadwork in geometric patterns. Hours: 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily; Thursdays to 8 p.m. Free. (Grace Glueck).

* "BITSTREAMS" AND "DATA DYNAMICS," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through June 10). Companion digital shows with a well-mannered, slightly dull air of decorous efficiency and cheerful modernity that encapsulates what you may regard as an ethos at large. Both affairs survey the new technological age in art, and there is no denying the inevitability of the big message here, which we discount at the risk of sheer stupidity: technology is changing how artists, especially young ones, make all types of art and, in turn, how we experience it. Still, the work produced needs to answer the old question: Does it move us? And there's the rub. A few artists, like Paul Pfeiffer and Jeremy Blake, stand out in "BitStreams." In "Data Dynamics," works like "Apartment" and "Netomat," metaphors for the Web as global unconscious, suggest that Internet art is at least becoming more like traditional media, whereby most but no longer all of what you see is unremarkable. Don't skip the sound section in "BitStreams," 25 audio artists working squarely in the tradition of musique concrete, a half-century-old movement but with new digital means replacing tape recorders. Hours: Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $8, students and 62+ (Michael Kimmelman).

* "COMMITTED TO THE IMAGE: CONTEMPORARY BLACK PHOTOGRAPHERS," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through April 29). This sharply installed survey of 94 artists covers several decades of work, much of it by a generation of photographers who came of age in the 1960's and 70's. The pictures are sorted by broad themes (people, beauty, family, religion, etc.), and formal polish tends to predominate over conceptual grit. The terrain, over all, is unsensational ordinary life, with the heat turned up high now and then. Images of urban churchgoers, Louisiana sugar cane cutters, the magnetic Billie Holiday and children in African refugee camps sit side by side. The eclectic array has its share of bland entries, but there are dozens of wonderful artists here, and their collective spirit is persuasive. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 am. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m (until 11 p.m. the first Saturday of the month). Admission: $4; $2, students and 62+ (Holland Cotter).

* LEANDRO ERLICH, "Neighbors," El Museo del Barrio, Fifth Avenue at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272 (through May 20). The first solo museum show by this young artist is a single, stagelike self-enclosed environment. The scene is a drab apartment building hallway lined with closed doors fitted with peepholes. An elevator opens at the push of a button, but leaves you peering down into an empty shaft. The results feel like a blend of Magritte, Hopper and Hitchcock: reality turns surreal; the everyday world is a forlorn, walk-in still life charged with voyeuristic tension. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $4; $2, students and 65+(Cotter).

* "ANDREAS GURSKY," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400 (through May 15). The giant pictures in this midcareer retrospective of Mr. Gursky, the 46-year-old German photographer, are so eye-poppingly, drop-dead gorgeous that in this world, where no good turn goes unpunished, you may feel compelled to react with suspicion and reserve. But knee-jerk resistance at the sight of the nondescript global emblems of new capitalist sprawl that he photographs is short-circuited by sheer awe at the incredible, sublimely weird, almost erotic glamour he imparts to them. The work is instantly attractive to the point of alarm, which is the feeling of falling in love. You might as well give yourself over to it and worry about the consequences later. Hours: Thursdays through Tuesdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; until 8:15 p.m. on Fridays. Admission: $10; $6.50, students and 65+ (Kimmelman).

* "KENNETH JOSEPHSON: A RETROSPECTIVE," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through May 27). The first full-scale career assessment for one of the earliest and most inventive explorers of photography's character and the issues of perception and representation that it raises. In the 1960's, when Mr. Josephson began commenting on it, the truthfulness of photography was still a myth with a powerful hold on the imagination. Best of all, his philosophizing is often served up with a generous portion of wit. Much of his work has never been exhibited, and he is not nearly as well known as he deserves to be. Hours and admission: See above (Vicki Goldberg).

* PAUL McCARTHY, New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through May 13). From his far-out position where the psychic security of Hollywood's packaging of sex and violence doesn't exist, Mr. McCarthy taps veins deep in the collective subconscious, well beyond where most shock artists have the audacity or intelligence to operate. He has been a cultish presence in Los Angeles for years, and his moment has finally come in New York. We see an artist of wild highs and lows, of black comedy, cheap jokes, unspeakable actions, dry formalism and some real fiascos -- the mark of an artist risking failure, a good sign. There is something beyond mere Pop parody or social provocation in the work, something to do with deep private needs and desires, which we perceive second-hand as comic pathos. It is art as tough therapy, disturbingly honest. Hours: Wednesdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays, noon to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, artists, students and 65+ (Kimmelman).

* "19TH- AND 20TH-CENTURY CHINESE PAINTINGS FROM THE ROBERT H. ELLSWORTH COLLECTION," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 879-5500 (through Aug. 19). The 19th and 20th centuries were shattering times for China, bringing wars, civil violence and the fall of an empire. In art, old forms survived and flourished but also changed. This exhibition surveys how elite painting traditions developed for a new audience and under Western influences from 1850 to 1980. Among the highlights is a group of paintings by Qi Baishi (1864-1957), deservedly one of the most popular of all Chinese artists. The big news is that a major museum has quietly taken a firm stand on modern art in Asia, seeing it not as a postscript to a great tradition but as an integral, living part of the continuum. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and 65+ (Cotter).

"MORITZ DANIEL OPPENHEIM: JEWISH IDENTITY IN 19TH-CENTURY ART," Yeshiva University Museum, 15 West 16th Street, (212) 294-8330 (through Aug. 31). One of the few professionally successful Jewish artists in early 19th-century Europe, Oppenheim (1800-82) was known as "the painter of Rothschilds and the Rothschild of painters." Some of his numerous Rothschild portraits are here, but he was also a prolific limner of biblical scenes and 19th-century Jewish life. As ethnic laws weakened in Germany, he became a pillar of Frankfurt's artistic and intellectual community and pursued a thriving career. Although a talented painter, he was by no means an innovator. Look on this show as a fascinating period piece and you will not be disappointed. Hours: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $4, students and 60+ (Glueck).

* "SULTAN ALI OF MASHHAD, MASTER OF NASTALIQ," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through May 27). Sultan Ali (1442-1520), one of the titans of Islamic calligraphy, was born in the northeastern Iranian city of Mashhad and spent most of his long working life at the Timurid capital of Herat, where he perfected the elegant cursive style known as nastaliq and produced extravagant manuscripts for the court. Several examples of his work are included in this smoldering little show of books and album pages. And anyone wanting to get a sense of the exalted status that writing had in the Islamic world and of just how luminous illuminated manuscripts can be will be able to do so here. Hours and admission: See above (Cotter).

* "THE TREASURY OF BASEL CATHEDRAL," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through May 27). The jewel-embellished gold and silver liturgical objects and reliquaries in this show exist on some exotic outer fringe of beauty where the crass and the ineffable meet. Together they have a cliffhanger of a tale to tell, as frustrating as it is uplifting. (They were preserved as an ensemble until Basel city politics intervened in the 19th century.) There's the rarity factor: almost none of the 75 works have visited the United States before. And it's hard to remember the last time anything quite like their single-minded incandescence radiated from a local museum. Hours and admission: See above (Cotter).

* "VAN GOGH'S POSTMAN: THE PORTRAITS OF JOSEPH ROULIN," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400 (through May 15). This revelatory micro-exhibition reunites five portraits of the postal worker Joseph Roulin, whom van Gogh met in Arles. The show affords an excellent opportunity to study the painter's craft as he processes a single motif through a series of approaches from painterly naturalism to richly patterned symbolism. It is fascinating as well to see the portraits in light of the biographical background. Roulin cared for van Gogh after the famous ear-cutting incident, and he grew in the artist's imagination from an amusing local character to a figure of Christ-like benevolence. Hours and admission: See above (Johnson).

* "VERMEER AND THE DELFT SCHOOL," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 879-5500 (through May 27). Genius does not flourish in a vacuum. That's the simple lesson vividly conveyed by this alternately tousled and crystalline exhibition. With 15 Vermeers -- nearly half his known paintings -- serving as ballast, this exhibition almost giddily spotlights a succession of artists, tracking the emergence of an increasingly effortless illusionism in Delft in the 1650's and 60's. Flower still lifes, whitewashed church interiors, townscapes and genre scenes by Pieter de Hooch, Carel Fabritius and Gerard Houckgeest are part of the mix, along with drawings and a breathtaking selection of small landscapes by artists you've never heard of. All this contextualizing sharpens one's sense of Vermeer's achievement, but it also spells out the milieu without which he would not have been Vermeer. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).

"FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT AND THE ART OF JAPAN: THE ARCHITECT'S OTHER PASSION," Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155 (through July 15). Some shows are like a vigorous read; you have to concentrate and try to follow the plot. Wright, an architectural colossus and a wily diva of a man, is the main character. The story of his infatuation with Japanese art, and of how he turned that love to lucrative ends by moonlighting as a top-dollar dealer in woodblock prints -- at least until disaster struck -- is a rich one. It's told through dozens of architectural drawings, documentary photographs, woodblock prints and a superb accompanying book by the curator, Julia Meech, which wraps wide-ranging art historical research in a nimble, personable style. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $5; $3 students and 65+ (Cotter).

Galleries: Uptown

"ONCE, THEN SOMETHING," Sculpture Center, 167 East 69th Street, (212) 879-3500 (through April 28). This wry show focuses on sculptures that are (or were) essentially ephemeral. Spencer Finch's big aluminum foil funnel is for listening for extraterrestrial communications. Little oval speakers emit a rhythmic sound sculpture by Finnbogi Petursson. Holly Zausner's red tubular sculptures are caught in states of levitation in large color photographs. Black-and-white photographs document Monika Brandmeier's abject architectural interventions. And, on video, Roman Signer goes for an absurd kayak ride (Johnson).

JONATHAN SANTLOFER, James Graham & Sons, 1014 Madison Avenue, at 78th Street, (212) 535-5767 (through April 28). Mr. Santlofer makes jokey, sometimes naughty art about famous artists. In a series of postcard-size panel paintings mimicking well-known pictures by Picasso of his mistresses, the hypersexed master himself has been inserted to X-rated effect. In trompe-l'oeil paintings of dogeared snapshots tacked to walls, Andy Warhol enigmatically mingles with Elvis Presley, Jackie Onassis and Elizabeth Taylor (Johnson).

HOUGHTON CRANFORD SMITH, "The Purist Landscapes," Richard York, 21 East 65th Street, (212) 772-9155 (through May 12). In Paris in the early 1930's, this American painter learned Purism, a variation on Cubism, from Amedee Ozenfant. Returning to New York, Smith combined idealizing simplification and finely textured paint in pastoral landscapes, producing images of New England hills or harbors or South American mountains that call to mind Grant Wood, Rockwell Kent and Charles Sheeler. But they also have their own slightly comical, slightly melancholy serenity (Johnson).

"VON TEUFELN/DEVILS' PAGEANT," Shepherd & DeRom, 58 East 79th Street, (212) 861-4050 (through May 5). To accompany 10 playful poems by the pianist Alfred Brendel on devils and the havoc they wreak, the printmaker and sculptor George Nama has done a series of 10 small etchings (published in a limited edition of 50 copies) and 10 small sculptures. Rather than depicting devils in their traditional form, they evoke the subject by way of horns, some docile, some bristling with menace, suggesting the creatures' sly ability to change and deceive. Mr. Brendel's poems resonate, but Mr. Nama's work could stand on its own without them (Glueck).

Galleries: 57th Street

BILL BRANDT, "Known and Unknown," Edwynn Houk, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 750-7070 (through May 5). Parlormaids and coal miners, portraits, landscapes and nudes are some of the subjects tackled by Brandt (1904-1983), perhaps the greatest of English photographers. His high-contrast prints are often infused with the Surrealist spirit he absorbed in Paris as a young man. After World War II, Brandt gave up documentary photography to concentrate on the poetic side of his art, and there is a wonderful selection here of his famous nudes, some straight, some distorted versions of the female body or abstracted parts. They disturb the viewer's sense of rightness-with-the-world, but that was the aim of Brandt's adventurous lens (Glueck).

MARJORIE CONTENT, "The Southwest and Bermuda With O'Keeffe," Washburn, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 397-6780 (through April 28). A photographer who used her Graflex with lyrical eloquence, producing 3-by-4-inch pictures that captured even the majestic sweep of the Grand Canyon, Content (1895-1984) showed that a photograph can be large in scope no matter how small its size. These pictures, taken from 1931 to '34, include the Canyon, adobe Indian abodes and Christian churches, pueblo ruins and the abstract composition of a fissure dividing the surface of a flat desert rock. A surprise is a close-up of her good friend Georgia O'Keeffe, usually portrayed as remote and austere, wearing a big smile. It's better than Garbo talking (Glueck).

* "THE JINA COLLECTION," Frederick Schultz Ancient Art, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 758-6007 (through April 28). Few examples of sculpture associated with the Jain religion of India are on permanent view in New York, which makes this show a rare treat. The 25 pieces are all of male spiritual heroes known as jinas. A big image from Rajasthan is among the earliest known Jain metal images of its size, and another, carved from sugar-white marble, is surely among the most beautiful. The show was organized in collaboration with Peter Marks, one of the city's top dealers in South Asian art (Cotter).

Galleries: SoHo

CARMEN CICERO, June Kelly, 591 Broadway, near Prince Street, (212) 226-1660 (through May 1). A big glowing derby hovering mysteriously in the woods; an old brick factory stranded in a yellow wheat field; a midget airplane flying over a stream in the moonlight: these are some of the sweetly surrealistic scenes generously painted in an appealing cartoonish style by Mr. Cicero, a Montclair State College professor of art (Johnson).

BILL SAYLOR, Leo Koenig, 359 Broadway, near Spring Street, (212) 334-9255 (through April 28). The key to this jumpy, aggressive New York solo debut by Mr. Saylor, who lives and works in Brooklyn, is a wall full of all-over-the-place acid-dream drawings of words, women, demonic heads, sci-fi flowers and spumes of explosive color. The paintings, which make up the bulk of the show, have the same elements blown up large, in compositions that seem both episodically additive and single-mindedly coded (Cotter).

Galleries: Chelsea

CLAIRE COREY AND ROBIN MICHALS, Venetia Kapernekas, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 462-4150 (through April 28). Morphing from intricate plaids to wide swooshes of striated color to opalescent clouds, Ms. Corey's large watercolors have such a captivating painterly lushness that it is hard to believe they are made entirely by digital machinery. Ms. Michals, by comparison, works digital transformations on photographs of military pilots to more conventional effect (Johnson).

* STEVE DIBENEDETTO, Baumgartner, 418 West 15th Street, (212) 633-2276 (through May 2). Brushing, troweling, scraping, scumbling and gouging, Mr. DiBenedetto paints splendidly gnarly, infernally incandescent topographies of nonstop tactile and chromatic intrigue. Emerging to varying degrees of visibility are Ferris wheels and octopuses, the one a symbol of Appollonian order, the other of Dionysian instinctual urgency (Johnson).

"HOME AND THE WORLD: AN EXPLORATION OF IDENTITY AT CROSSROADS," India Center of Art and Culture, 530 West 25th Street, (212) 462-4221 (through May 31). The center is a recently opened nonprofit space devoted equally to art, literature, music and film, and most of those media play some role in this group exhibition of contemporary artists of Indian descent (Cotter).

* IFTIKHAR AND ELIZABETH DADI, "They Made History," Admit One Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 463-0164 (through April 28). This is a smart, concise New York debut show by a pair of artists who divide their time between the United States and Pakistan. The gallery walls are lined with digital portraits of non-Western cultural heroes -- Gandhi, Geronimo, Genghis Kahn -- printed on circular backlighted screens, made in collaboration with Pakistani craftsmen. The portraits float against glowing sunset skies, but in each case the face is lifted from a Hollywood bio-pic: Ben Kingsely as Gandhi; Chuck Connors as Geronimo; John Wayne as Genghis Khan. This is history as import-export pop fantasy, and the only version of history many people ever know (Cotter).

JURGEN SCHADEBERG, "Drum Beat, South Africa 1950-1994," Axis Gallery, 453 West 17th Street, (212) 741-2582 (through April 28). In 1950 Mr. Schadeberg, a Berlin-born photographer then 19, traveled to Johannesburg, looking for a job. He found one on a new magazine called Drum, which during the years of apartheid was the country's leading lifestyle monthly. This show focuses on work done by Mr. Schadeberg between 1951 and the early 1960's, and includes powerful images both of the country's vibrant cultural life and its growing political oppression (Cotter).

DAVID VESTAL, "A Quiet Light," Robert Mann, 210 11th Avenue, near 25th Street, (212) 989-7600 (through April 28). Mr. Vestal's lovely, understated black-and-white photographs from 1949-89 exude a bluesy, mood-altering poetry. City streets are always wet, lights at night drunkenly blurred, lonely people shadowed and walking away. A series of rural road pictures vividly evokes the trance of car travel (Johnson).

MARNIE WEBER, "Who's the Most Forgotten of Them All?" Fredericks Freiser, 504 West 22nd Street, (212) 633-6555 (through April 28). A blue Styrofoam castle houses a shadowy video fairy tale of bizarre animals -- a violin-playing bear, a rabbit with one foot in a concrete block -- gathered in a graveyard at night. Installed in the gallery as sculptures, the life-size animal costumes look crowded and overly literal, but an otherwise unrelated series of photo-collages extends the video's spell of magically disjointed ennui (Johnson).

Last Chance

* PATTERSON BECKWITH, American Fine Arts, 22 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 941-0401 (through tomorrow). Mr. Beckwith, a talented young New York photographer and performer, is wearing both hats for his first local one-person show. He has set up American Fine Arts -- itself a New York treasure -- as a photography studio. The gallery recommends a call in advance to check on the shooting schedule (Cotter).

WILLEM DE KOONING, "Vellums," Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 744-7400 (through tomorrow). De Kooning used a variety of crafty techniques to achieve the look of effortless spontaneity in his paintings. One was to make charcoal tracings of his paintings on large sheets of semitransparent paper, or "vellum," which he would transfer to other canvases as the basis of new pictures. The 10 vellums don't necessarily look like finished drawings but they may have shown the way to the painter's surprisingly simplified and airy late works (Johnson).

PHILIP PEARLSTEIN, Robert Miller, 524 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 366-4774 (through tomorrow). With dry, clinical precision, Mr. Pearlstein continues to paint naked, exhausted looking women posed with antiques and works of folk art. Though ostensibly invested in strictly formal issues, it is still the undercurrent of sexual tension that makes his work interesting. In one of the most arresting pictures, a spearlike Victorian weather vane juts with alarming Freudian ferocity into the space before two somnolent nudes (Johnson).

* "RAIN OF THE MOON: SILVER IN ANCIENT PERU," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Sunday). Symbols of power and prestige in ancient Peru, gold and silver were equally revered, and Peruvian metalsmiths acquired great skill in the techniques of working them. This show deals with silver, harder to capture and preserve than gold, dating from the late first millennium B.C. to the Spanish conquest in the 16th century. The objects range from nose ornaments and ear pieces, some of them amazingly large, to human and animal figures, like a famous Inca llama whose hanging fleece is evoked by the rippled, crumpled sheet of silver that covers its body. As most gold and silver objects in Peru were melted down by the Spanish conquistadors, this show, half from the Met's collection and half from loans, amounts to a bonanza. It is the first devoted to the subject of pre-Columbian Peruvian silver. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).

AL SOUZA, Charles Cowles, 537 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 925-3500 (through tomorrow). Mr. Souza makes pictures entirely from jigsaw puzzle parts. Using sections from many different puzzles, side by side or glued on top of one another, he produces surrealistically disjunctive compositions, including images of cats, New England barns, comic book superheroes and packaged candy. The kitschy, kaleidoscopic busyness is fun, but when you get close you wish they were made in some more interesting way (Johnson).

ALTOON SULTAN, Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue, near 57th Street, (212) 262-5050 (through tomorrow). Modern farming as it appears in Ms. Sultan's neatly made, almost photorealist paintings is not a pretty business. Seeking out agricultural subjects that violate conventional notions of bucolic beauty, she paints, for example, a portrait of an "Ag-bagger," an uncomely green machine that stuffs enormous white plastic tubes with silage (Johnson).

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW; 
Manifest Destiny: Moving West With Maps and Entertainment

BYLINE:  By ROBERTA SMITH 

 BODY:
Real estate and entertainment. It's hard to think of the United States without them. They are among the most prominent obsessions of the moment, and it doesn't require nicer-sounding synonyms -- like property and culture or homeland and civilization -- to realize that they are deeply embedded in the nation's psyche and history.
 Just how deep is measured by two deftly dovetailed exhibitions at the New York Public Library. "Heading West: Mapping the Territory" and "Touring West: 19th-Century Performing Artists on the Oregon Trail" take real estate and entertainment back to Square 1, providing sobering insights into our own corporate-driven, celebrity-crazed times and their racial and economic inequities. 
 These shows are classic library presentations, full of what is fashionably called visual or material culture, which is itself full of history. In both there is often more reading than looking. But with the help of labels much of the information is visually accessible and memorable. One is also propelled forward by simple awe for this institution's extraordinary holdings and the stories they can tell. 
"Heading West" presents maps from 1540 to 1898, supplemented by atlases, books, photographs and a few prints. "Touring West" has an assortment of playbills, musical scores, newspaper clippings, ephemera and many photographs. The narratives progress from some of the earliest, largely fanciful charts of the new continent to the founding of the national parks and the advent of tourism, in one case, and in the other from acting troupes' performing cannibalized versions of Shakespeare to the dawn of vaudeville and the film age, with opera, rope dancers and abolitionist songs in between.
These accounts are often more than a little hair-raising, being riddled with examples of talent and ingenuity, greed and deception, cruelty and the denial of cruelty, along with physical daring, endurance and intermittent flashes of altruism. 
"Heading West," organized by Alice C. Hudson, director of the library's map division, presents the history of the United States in the late 19th century as one long land grab, a continual westward expansion paralleled by expansions of geographical knowledge and mapping techniques. Early on there is a 1540 chart by the German mapmaker Sebastian Munster, which shows the continent as a feeble promontory flanked by islands, evidence of the deluded hope that it was simply a minor obstacle on the western route to Asia.
One can witness the effects of innovations in color lithography, topographical mapping and printing and the involvement of the United States Geological Survey, which increased as the extent and richness of the continent became known. Along the way important individuals appear: the explorers Lewis and Clark (represented, among other things, by a facsimile of the beautiful manuscript map that William Clark drew as they moved north and west); the cartographer Frederick Von Egloffstein, and John Sutter, whose discovery of gold on his farm near Sacramento in 1848 radically accelerated the settlement of the West.
The show opens with a visual knockout: A. J. and D. Griffing Johnson's large and festive 1859 "New Illustrated & Embellished County Map of the Republics of North America and the Adjacent Islands & Countries." In tones of pink, red, green and yellow, its eastern half is as neatly squared off as a quilt, while the western half is a kind of Color Field abstraction, dominated by the relatively large blocks and stripes of the territories. Oklahoma is labeled Indian Territory.
The exhibition's primary narrative concerns the shifting shapes and increasing detail of these Western blocks and stripes. Especially amazing is the rapidity with which they snap into place after the discovery of gold. By 1866, with apparently no time off for the Civil War, the states are almost exactly as they are today.
Progress is spelled out with what might be called graphic brutality. It begins in competition and conflict among the Americans, French, Spanish and English. The most violent episode was the Mexican-American War in 1848, after which the American Southwest was "ceded" to the United States.
The onset of railroads is depicted in maps of proposed routes; maps showing the enormous government land grants to railroad companies (most of Iowa, for example), which were sold to settlers to finance construction; and finally maps published by the Union Pacific and Rock Island Railroads touting the convenience of their routes.
Some of the show's smallest and prettiest maps locate gold, silver and tin deposits. Others record coal and oil fields, forests and watersheds, the ownership of farms or the street plans of new cities from Topeka to San Francisco.
From the beginning the exhibition's labels make clear that the lands being settled were already occupied by Indians who not only guided the first explorers but also shared their knowledge of the land. The most wrenching of the show's many subtexts is the repeated taking of land from Indians, evidenced by the shrinking size and changing locations of reservations.
One is reminded, for example, that the Battle of the Little Big Horn was triggered by the onslaught of speculators that began after General Custer's men discovered gold on the Sioux and Cherokee Indian reservations. In William J. Keeler's "National Map of the Territory of the United States From the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean" (1867), the future of Oklahoma is labeled with phrases like "gypsum region" and "ceded to the U.S. by the Seminoles, March 1, 1866."
Fittingly, one of the last maps in the exhibition is David H. Burr's 1850 Mercator projection of the world, one of the first, which shows the United States as we know it, looming large at the center of things, a distortion of geographical fact.
In a different way, "Touring West" covers much of the same ground and in almost as much detail. It shows how artists, performers and lecturers of every ilk and nationality fanned out across the continent as it was being settled, their progress aided by the railroads, the gold rush and the growth, however short-lived, of boom towns. There is, for example, material about Thomas Macguire, a San Francisco entrepreneur who built a string of theaters in the mining towns of California and Nevada. And there is a promotional newspaper from Jenny Lind's 1850 tour printed in gold ink.
"Touring West" reflects the birth of theatrical agencies, lecture bureaus, the slide lecture, the celebrity photograph and theater criticism. There are several images and mementos of the actor Edwin Booth, including the embroidered handkerchief that figured in his portrayal of Othello, and a stereopticon picture of the actress Lydia Thompson, whose female troupe, the British Blondes, was known for cross-dressing and parodying other companies.
Although the labels in "Touring West" aren't quite as sharp as those in "Heading West," the material often speaks for itself, especially with the map show as a backdrop. Those maps add an uneasy resonance to photographs of Edwin Forrest, known for playing the title role in "Metamora, or the Last of the Wampanoags," one of several popular plays about doomed but heroic Indians.
A few maps are mixed in here as well, including one that records the slave population of the eastern United States by county. It relates to several vitrines devoted to the campaign against slavery, which included lecture tours by Henry Ward Beecher, plays like Harriet Beecher Stowe's "Dred" and the abolitionist songs of Mrs. E. A. Parkhurst, the Hutchinson Family and William Wells Brown, an escaped slave whose slave narrative was published in 1847.
The underlying theme of "Heading West" and "Touring West" may be the pursuit of glory and profit, whether personal or national, and the basic rawness of the human appetite. They present this apetite with admirable clarity and density, conveying both its achievements and its tragedies and illuminating the present as much as the past.
"Heading West: Mapping the Territory" is at the New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089, through May 19 and "Touring West: 19th-Century Performing Artists on the Oregon Trail" is there through July 7.

HEADLINE: Asia Hails Fed Rate Cut, but Europe Snubs It 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, April 19 

 BODY:
In Asia, where investors shiver at every slip of the Dow Jones industrial average, gnawing fear has given way to wary hope.
 Stock markets soared across the region today as investors rejoiced at the Federal Reserve's unexpected cut in interest rates on Wednesday. Analysts say there is a growing belief here that Asia will weather the slowdown in the United States with less damage than it once feared. 
 "The cliched point of view is that when the United States catches a cold, Asia catches pneumonia," said William H. Overholt, the head of strategy and economics at Nomura International in Hong Kong. "The reality is that when the U.S. catches pneumonia, Asia catches a cold." 
Although several Asian countries rely on the United States to buy their exports, Mr. Overholt said, this dependence is being offset by stronger domestic demand and by the remarkably buoyant Chinese economy.
This week, China said that its economy had grown 8.1 percent in the first three months of the year, well beyond analysts' estimates. Economists attributed the growth to the government's heavy investment in public-works projects, which has finally ignited consumer spending.
For now, China is mainly putting distance between itself and its neighbors. But as it grows into an economic power, analysts say, it will become an engine for the rest of the region -- a role historically played by Japan.
In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng index jumped 4.4 percent today, an increase driven mostly by the rate cut. Since the Hong Kong dollar is linked to the United States dollar at a fixed rate, the federal funds rate is automatically matched here.
Shares in Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea -- countries that depend on the American market for the bulk of their electronics exports -- surged as well, on the hope that the rate cut would hasten a turnaround in the United States.
"If you believe there is going to be demand for chips, PC's and handsets, these markets should be able to return to strong growth by next year," said Simon L. Ogus, the chairman of DSG Asia, a research organization here.
In addition, the Asian Development Bank said in its annual economic forecast that Asia would probably suffer only a short downturn. The report, released today, predicts that annual growth in the region -- excluding Japan, Australia and New Zealand -- will slow to 5.3 percent this year, from 7.1 percent in 2000, but will rebound to 6.1 percent in 2002.
The bank also said that the two most populous Asian countries, China and India, would scarcely feel the troubles in the United States. The so-called Asian tigers -- Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea -- will feel it most deeply, the report says, because they are exporters and because they recorded such brisk growth in 2000.
"We see this as a relatively brief moderation in the pace of economic growth, not a collapse," said Cindy Houser, an economist at the Asian Development Bank, which is based in Manila. "The decisive action by the Fed reinforces our view that the U.S. economy will recover in the second half."
If the downturn persists into next year, Ms. Houser said, Asian countries will face more serious problems. But, she added, the region is not on the verge of a crisis like the one that tore through Asia in 1997.
Mr. Overholt of Nomura, however, said countries that had not purged the excesses from their economies since that crisis were still at risk. He singled out the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia as vulnerable.
Shares in Jakarta bucked the upward trend in Asia today, dropping 1.9 percent because of fears of mounting political unrest. "Indonesia does not have credible leadership to carry out economic reforms," Mr. Overholt said. "You have to strain to put together an optimistic scenario there."

Try a Little Helpfulness

BYLINE:  By GAIL COLLINS 

 BODY:
Now that the job market is softening, you're probably asking yourself: What does it take to become a U.S. ambassador in a country with a nice climate and no cultural tradition of hostage-taking?
 There are a number of excellent job opportunities available in the Bush administration. Just recently, Clay Johnson, the White House director of presidential personnel, told The Times's Marc Lacey and Raymond Bonner what questions the president asks himself when he screens ambassadorial candidates: "Is the person a longtime friend? How close does he feel to the person? Has the person really gone out of their way to help him become president?" 
 The definition of "help" is a little hazy. It is against the law to take campaign contributions into consideration when picking ambassadors. Mr. Johnson must have been referring to people who gave the president rides to the airport in inclement weather. 
The law also says ambassadors should speak the language of the countries to which they're posted. Mr. Bush has shown a strong commitment to this principle by nominating as ambassador to Britain William Farish, a family friend and horse breeder who is fluent in English. 
Howard Leach, an agricultural business investment banker who does not speak French, has been nominated to be ambassador to France, a nation famous for its patience and tolerance in dealing with Americans who don't know the language. But Mr. Leach, whose helpfulness involved a stint as chairman of the Republican National Committee, is said to be taking lessons.
The Bush administration planned to make Rockwell Schnabel, a California businessman, the ambassador to Italy. Mr. Schnabel, who has been helpful to the tune of a couple hundred thousand dollars, was all but on the plane when Italian-American groups rose up in outrage. "As the fifth-largest ethnic group in our country, we feel it's important to have one of our own in Italy," said Max DiFabio, spokesman for the Columbus Citizens Foundation.
Specifically, the Italian-American organizations are lobbying for Charles Gargano, the economic development commissioner of New York. "We have never swerved in our support of Charles Gargano from day one, because we felt he was the most quintessentially qualified," said Philip R. Piccigallo, national executive director of the Sons of Italy. 
Mr. Gargano has distinguished himself in the production of testimonials, from people ranging from Cardinal Edward Egan to the Manhattan district attorney, Robert Morgenthau, who helpfully issued a statement clarifying that Mr. Gargano is not under investigation.
Some people might be embarrassed to be demonstrating this level of neediness, but some people are not from New York, a state that the president is treating like a hoof-and-mouth disease carrier. He doesn't visit, doesn't appoint. Massachusetts has about six Republicans, but the governor, Paul Cellucci, still managed to get named ambassador to Canada. (Mr. Cellucci speaks one of the two languages used by our neighbor to the north.) It does seem a little embarrassing to have the chief executive of your state decide he'd rather be hosting receptions in Ottawa, but at least the White House noticed he was there. 
Mr. Gargano's hopes are riding on Italian-American lobbying. However, the Italians themselves don't seem all that thrilled at the idea that their American ambassador has to be ethnically screened. "They'd like a career diplomat," says Sylvia Poggioli, who covers Rome for National Public Radio. You can understand why a member of NATO might not like to think that the United States regards it as nothing more than a gene pool for a domestic voting bloc.
Perhaps Mr. Bush will solve the problem by pulling an Italian-American out of his reservoir of college classmates. The "longtime friend" qualification looms very large in this administration. The new ambassador to China is rumored to be Clark (Sandy) Randt Jr., a Hong Kong businessman and fellow Yalie. 
"Many countries love the idea they're getting an ambassador who can pick up the phone and call the president," said Richard Holbrooke, the former ambassador to the United Nations.
Unfortunately, it's hard to translate the nuances of "former Deke social chairman" into Chinese.

HEADLINE: Struggling Red Hook Bank Gets State Deposit 

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
When the Independence Community Bank opened a branch in Red Hook, Brooklyn, four years ago, residents were anticipating an economic revival in the impoverished neighborhood. The branch was supposed to spur new business and provide traditional banking services to a community that had not had a bank for more than 50 years.
 But the economic rebirth of Red Hook never completely happened. Residents have been slow to patronize the bank, preferring instead to use a local check-cashing company or go to banks in neighborhoods near their jobs. Two years ago, bank officials estimated that the branch was losing $250,000 a year and talked of permanently closing it. 
 But yesterday, a $10 million deposit from the state comptroller's office breathed new life into the branch and has helped to steady its economic course. 
"That has helped us become viable here and has helped us retain a vitality in this neighborhood that otherwise would have been difficult," said Charles J. Hamm, the bank's chairman. "Without that, we'd be constantly worried about losing money. We're now on solid footing."
A 1997 state law allows the state comptroller's office to deposit state funds into banks that serve low- and middle-income communities. Banks taking part in the program pay a low interest rate on the deposited money, said H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller, who is a Democratic candidate for governor. Five other banks have already been helped by the program.
Mr. McCall said that the state's $10 million deposit at the Red Hook bank would help to "provide the financial resources for the businesses in the community so that this community can grow and contribute to New York's economy." 
He also praised bank officials for helping Red Hook's residents through a series of workshops on topics like homeownership, insurance and financial planning. 
"They've done more than just open up the branch," said Mr. McCall, who plans to have his office deposit money at the Carver Federal Savings Bank in Harlem later this spring. "They work very actively with people in the community." 
Since the branch opened four years ago, its charitable foundation has contributed more than $700,000 to community programs.
The bank has steadily been building up its business and now has 3,200 accounts and $21 million on deposit, not including the state's $10 million. Two years ago, it had 2,237 accounts and $3.3 million in deposits. As a rule, branches need $30 million on deposit to break even, Mr. Hamm said. The bank has also increased the number of small-business and real estate loans in the community. 
"A lot of people have ingrained that they just don't like banks," Mr. Hamm said. "Well, now every day that goes by they like us a little bit more. It's just a matter of spending time -- and that's why this deposit is so important. It takes time for a community to get to like you." 
The birth of Daniel Clay's daughter Kayla, now 8 months old, prompted him to explore the bank's services. Yesterday morning, Mr. Clay, 32, a child-care worker, opened an account.
"I really wanted to save some money," Mr. Clay said. "I was trying to plan for our future so maybe when she grows up she'll go to college and have the advantages that I didn't have."

Increase in Tax Credits May Mean More Low-Income Housing

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Next month, when developers apply to New York City or the state for the latest round of federal housing tax credits, there will be more available, thanks to an increase in financing for the program by Washington. Since the developers who are awarded the tax credits then sell them to corporations and use the proceeds to help build rental housing for low-income families, both the city and the state expect an increase in such housing.
 The financing increase, 40 percent over two years for each state, is the first in the 15-year history of the program, which was part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. It was the result of legislation passed last December after a four-year campaign by housing advocates. 
 As a result of the increase, the amount of tax credits allocated to each state per person will rise to $1.50 this year and to $1.75 next year from the current $1.25. That means New York State's allotment, which was $22.7 million last year, will be $28.4 million this year and $33.2 million in 2002. After that, the increase is tied to inflation.
New Jersey's $10.1 million allotment last year will increase to $12.6 million this year and to $14.7 million next year, according to the National Council of State Housing Agencies, based in Washington. Connecticut's $4.1 million portion, the group said, will rise to $5.1 million this year and to $5.9 million in 2002. 
New York State's Division of Housing and Community Renewal, which administers the state's tax credits, estimates that the 3,100 low-income units produced on average each year in the state will increase by 600 this year and by 1,200 in 2002.
The state gives part of its credits, about 54 percent in the last few years, to state-sponsored projects in New York City as well as to the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development. The department uses the credits with its housing programs, which focus mostly on rehabilitation, to produce about 1,400 apartments a year.
Alicia Glen, assistant commissioner for housing finance at the housing department, said the city was asking that its allocation of credits from the state be increased to $12 million from $8.5 million. The increase would add 480 low-income apartments this year, she said. 
Under the federal program, each state allocates its credits to nonprofit or for-profit developers to help finance the construction or renovation of apartments for people who earn no more than 60 percent of an area's median income. In New York City, the median income is $59,100 for a family of four. Rents in such developments are capped at 30 percent of a tenant's income.
Developers are selected according to criteria set by each state, like location or whether the development is a renovation or new construction. Once allocated to the developers of low-income housing, the credits are then sold to investors, mainly corporations, which provide cash needed for construction. Buyers get a $1 tax credit for 75 to 80 cents, said Marc D. Schnitzer, a managing director at the Related Capital Company of Manhattan, among the largest private buyers of tax credits in the country.
Mr. Schnitzer said his company bought $515 million worth of credits for $420 million last year from developers across the nation. The developers used the $420 million to help finance the construction of 85 projects with 10,850 apartments, he said. 
Then his company passed the tax credits to its institutional investors, which used the credits to offset their federal income tax liabilities. The credits are appealing, Mr. Schnitzer said, "because there are not many good tax shelters for corporations." 
For developers, offsetting construction costs through the sale of tax credits lets them lease apartments at lower rents. 
A $19 million project near the Grand Concourse in the Bronx that is nearing completion was awarded $8 million in tax credits and $11 million in financing from the city. Its developer, RSE Management of the Bronx, is renovating seven buildings scattered over four blocks. Half of the 153 apartments had been vacant. The credits "help subsidize the shortfall in the rents," said Ramon A. Escobar, RSE's president. "Without them, I couldn't do a full rehabilitation." 
Over the years the competition for the credits increased, as did the price investors paid for them. "But that was not enough to offset the toll inflation took on the credits," said Barbara J. Thompson, director of policy and government affairs at the National Council of State Housing Agencies. She said that as construction costs rose nationally, the number of low-income units produced using tax credits had been falling since 1995 and that last year's total of 62,420 units was among the lowest in the program's history.

As Its Losses Grow, Nortel Plans to Cut More Jobs

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
Nortel Networks, the large Canadian communications equipment company, said yesterday that it would cut an additional 5,000 jobs after losses ballooned in the first quarter.
 Total job cuts are now expected to reach 20,000, or 20 percent of Nortel's work force, by the middle of this year, the company said. Nortel has already eliminated about 10,000 jobs this year after demand for some of its products declined sharply. 
 Nortel's problems are indicative of the woes reverberating through the telecommunications industry, much of which has gone from boom to bust in the last year. Financing for expansion has dried up, and companies large and small have been left with a glut of network capacity, translating into a weaker appetite for Nortel's products.
Nortel's loss in the first quarter grew to $2.58 billion, or 82 cents a share, compared with a loss of $730 million, or 26 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Much of the loss came from a 23 percent decline in sales in the United States during the quarter. Revenue edged lower, to $6.18 billion from $6.32 billion.
The company's operating loss, which excludes one-time charges, was $385 million, or 12 cents a share, in contrast to a profit of $347 million, or 12 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Those results matched analysts' estimates, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. Nortel had lowered its own estimates twice during the last three months.
"The telecommunications equipment industry is going to be tainted for a while, and Nortel is tainted with it," said Crit Thomas, manager of the Armada Large Cap Ultra Fund in Cleveland. "Many of Nortel's clients just overspent, and now they're not spending hardly anything."
Before Nortel announced its results, its shares closed at $17.80, up 35 cents. They fell as low as $16.75 after hours but then rebounded to $18.10.
To be sure, the malaise among communications equipment companies is not specific to Nortel. Rivals like Lucent Technologies and Cisco Systems have repeatedly surprised investors with large job reductions and warnings that sales are slowing.
But in Nortel's case, at least, it appears that the company's problems are rooted in larger economic trends rather than in difficulties with management practices or lags in product development. That makes Nortel's situation different from Lucent's, for example. Lucent recently failed to reach ambitious sales targets as it sought to catch up with Nortel's lead in selling products like optical components.
"Nortel's caught up in a general macroeconomic trap," said Gus Papageorgiou, an analyst at Scotia Capital. "It should pull out of this when the economy improves."
In the meantime, Nortel, which is based in Brampton, Ontario, is seeking to decrease the risky financing it provides to clients for the purchase of its products. In the first quarter, the company's committed vendor financing fell to $4.7 billion from $5.7 billion. More than 90 percent of its financing in the months ahead should go to large, established clients, the company said.
"We see a tremendous winnowing of companies in the industry," John Roth, Nortel's chief executive, said in an interview. "Unfortunately, a lot of our larger clients are telling us they could buy the assets of distressed competitors or they could buy our equipment."

Possible Plan to Keep Treasury Market Alive Is Floated

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said yesterday that it was possible that the government could seek to keep the Treasury market alive by issuing new debt even when it was no longer necessary and giving the proceeds back to the public as tax cuts.
 He made his comments as Treasury prices fell sharply but stocks rose the day after the Federal Reserve unexpectedly cut short-term interest rates by half a percentage point. It was the fourth half-point cut since January. The Nasdaq composite index had its second consecutive gain of more than 100 points and has soared 33.2 percent from its low this year of 1,638.80 on April 4. That is the best 10-day run in Nasdaq history. 
 Mr. O'Neill spoke about the future of the Treasury market in answer to questions after a speech to the Economic Club of New York.
The future of the Treasury market is being debated because large government surpluses are reducing the need for the government to borrow. And with the outstanding publicly held debt declining, the government would have no real need to borrow in a few years. At that time, if the government ceased to issue bonds and notes, the Treasury market would lose its role as a benchmark for interest rates, a haven for worried investors and a tool in many of Wall Street's financial transactions.
But if notes and bonds continue to be issued, the government would in effect be borrowing money it did not need. Mr. O'Neill said this problem could be dealt with by giving the money back in tax cuts. While he did not say so directly, such a proposal, if made, means he thinks it is important to keep the Treasury market functioning so that the government could begin to borrow again easily when budget deficits return. In addition, it would keep open a risk-free market that has been important to many investors for decades.
"It is not inconceivable to me that we can maintain a liquid maturity curve," he said, apparently referring to the continued sales of 2-year notes to 30-year bonds.
Mr. O'Neill, however, gave no details of such a proposal. And he said that "this is an unsettled question" and indicated the option of letting the Treasury market effectively disappear could also be considered.
Stephen Stanley, senior market economist at Greenwich Capital, said that the "question of whether we need a Treasury market will be a very important debate over the next year or two."
The Treasury sell-off left longer-term Treasury yields higher than they were before the Fed move. This was in part because of investors switching back to stocks. The selling was also a response to the expectation of lower short-term interest rates as the Fed pushed them lower in the future. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 5.30 percent, from 5.15 percent on Wednesday. The price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 13/32, to 97 24/32. The yield on the 30-year bond rose to 5.80 percent from 5.66 percent. Its price fell 12 8/32, to 94 2/32.
The yield on the Treasury's two-year note rose to 4.32 percent from 4.23 percent. But based on other market barometers, investors still expect the Fed to reduce its benchmark interest rate, now at 4.5 percent, another quarter-point when policy makers meet on May 15.
The Nasdaq composite index, which is heavily weighted with technology stocks, jumped 102.70 points, or 4.9 percent, to 2,182.14. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 77.88 points, or 0.7 percent, to 10,693.71. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 15.54 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,253.70.
In a speech in Washington, meanwhile, the Fed's vice chairman, Roger W. Ferguson Jr., said it was not yet clear how much more the central bank might have to cut interest rates to restore the economy to a healthy growth rate. But he left little doubt that the Fed would have to consider further rate cuts in coming weeks and months.
Explaining the Fed's decision on Wednesday to cut its benchmark federal funds target rate between regularly scheduled meetings, Mr. Ferguson said economic conditions were changing rapidly and that the period between meetings was unusually long.
"Although some fog always surrounds the outlook, there is more than the usual amount of uncertainty at this juncture about the economic future," Mr. Ferguson said, alluding in particular to an abrupt drop-off in capital investment by businesses and concern that consumers might limit their spending because of the decline in stocks over the last year.
Mr. Ferguson said there was "plenty of room" for more rate cuts, in part because the rate increases by the Fed in 1999 and 2000 helped eradicate any threat of inflation.
He said the Fed preferred to act at regular meetings. But in an obvious reference to Wednesday's surprise rate cut, Mr. Ferguson said that at times "getting policy right will involve taking action unexpected by the market -- for example, in its timing or magnitude."

DATELINE: FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., April 19 

 BODY:
SportsLine.com plans to cut up to 92 jobs, or 20 percent of its domestic work force, because of a weakening advertising market and slowing economy, company officials said today.
 The company, which runs the Web site for CBS Sports, said on Wednesday that it would take a $3 million charge this quarter because of the job cuts, but will save up to $10 million annually. 
SportsLine .com reported a net loss of $23.8 million during the first quarter of 2001 against a loss of $21.9 million a year earlier. 
 Another sports Web company, Quokka Sports Inc., suffered a setback today after Olympic organizers said they hoped to replace Quokka with another company that can provide content for an Olympic Web site.
"We realize they were having severe financial difficulty," Mitt Romney, president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, said today as CNET, an Internet news service, reported that Quokka was shutting operations. Nasdaq also halted trading in the company.

Turning Tykes Into Zealots For Recycling

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
IN honor of Earth Day, our text is "RRR You Ready?" the new waste-reduction manual, weighing five pounds and prepared at a cost of $2 million, that has been distributed to public schools by the New York City Department of Sanitation. For safety purposes, let's begin with Chapter 4, "How I can be a TrashMaster!"
 This chapter instructs students who have learned the modern three R's -- reduce, reuse, recycle -- to "share" their knowledge with their families. That means getting their families to follow dozens of rules, including this one: "Return wire hangers and plastic bags to the dry cleaners." 
 Before your family sets up a new bin for dry cleaners' bags, you might consider advice from another source, the American Academy of Pediatrics. "Never leave plastic bags lying around the house," the academy's child-care manual warns. "Bags from the dry cleaner are particularly dangerous. Knot them before you throw them away so that it's impossible for your child to crawl into them or pull them over her head."
Perhaps a truly dedicated RRRer could carefully knot each bag, store it out of the reach of children and then unknot it for the dry cleaner. But why take any risk to save a few pennies' worth of plastic? Why waste so much time and effort to save a bag that may well be useless by the time it gets back to the dry cleaner?
You could raise similar cost-benefit objections to just about every other "waste reducing" tip in the manual, and you could end up agreeing with the wayward student who appears in an accompanying video. "Recycling is just another evil plan by grown-ups to keep kids from having fun," he complains. "What's wrong with a little garbage?"
But you, like that unenlightened student, would be missing the point of the curriculum. It's not intended to teach children about economic tradeoffs. Its purpose is to inculcate a system of beliefs and values. 
To Catholics who grew up on questions in the Baltimore Catechism like "Who is God?" or "Did Adam and Eve obey the commandment of God?" the questions in the RRR manual have a familiar feel. "What is waste?" "Why do we need to think about our waste?" "Why do we waste so much?"
These are not questions meant to be debated. Our wastefulness is a given, just like Adam and Eve's original sin. "In previous generations, people lived by the adage of 'waste not, want not.' They were careful to buy only what they needed, and reused whatever they could," the manual explains. But now we have eaten from the apple, and it's wrapped in plastic. "Every time we throw something away," the manual laments, "we are throwing out a lot." 
The manual does mention in passing that recycling is expensive, but it doesn't bother noting that it's more expensive than burying trash. And it certainly doesn't point out how much money (more than $500 million) New Yorkers could have saved over the last decade if there had been no recycling program.
No, the manual instead preaches reverence for handling waste. Students who can't pass reading or mathematics tests are urged to spend classroom time building a museum of garbage, then go home and determine the weight of their family's trash, all the while hectoring their parents to avoid "overpackaged" takeout food in plastic containers. 
Saving plastic is a new spiritual quest, but past societies have just as passionately revered natural resources and reviled human pollution. The Druids worshiped trees and sacrificed people. Saving dry cleaners' bags seems tame by comparison. 
BUT not everyone today shares these values or wants to see $2 million in public money spent on a manual to promote those values in public schools. I don't want my child to be a TrashMaster who weighs garbage and feels guilty for polluting the planet when he writes on only one side of a piece of paper.
I respect the neo-Druids' beliefs, but why should these beliefs be taught in public schools? Robert Lange, the director of the Department of Sanitation's recycling program, answered by pointing to the widespread support for recycling. "It is a value judgment," he said, "but it's advocated by a large part of the population, including the City Council."
True enough, but a majority of the population also believes in Christian dogma, and that doesn't justify preaching it in public schools. New York intellectuals like to mock Kansans who insist on teaching creationism, but at least creationism is presented as an alternative to Darwinism. In our schools, recycling is the one true faith.

HEADLINE: Defensive Drug Industry: Fueling Clash Over Patents 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW POLLACK 

 BODY:
The big pharmaceutical companies march to the beat of a steady chant -- that patent protection for drugs is essential for innovation. At the urging of the drug companies, the United States government has pressed many nations to honor patents on medications. 
 But now, it seems, the industry may have overplayed its hand. Drug patents are under attack, blamed for high AIDS drug prices that deny life-saving therapy to millions of people in developing countries. And some analysts say the industry itself fueled the backlash by staunchly defending its intellectual property in the face of a pandemic that could claim more lives than the Black Death of the Middle Ages. 
 The latest clash over patents on AIDS drugs came to a boil in South Africa yesterday, when 39 drug companies dropped a suit trying to block a law the companies asserted would make it too easy for the government to abrogate their patents. 
The debate has erupted in other countries as well. Brazil has threatened to grant licenses to local manufacturers on patents for AIDS drugs held by Merck and Hoffman-La Roche. In Thailand, AIDS patients and activists are planning a legal challenge to the validity of a Bristol-Myers Squibb patent on an AIDS drug.
The uproar over AIDS drugs is threatening moves toward more globalization, eight years after most nations approved the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, or Trips, which commits them to enforce drug patents. Activists are campaigning against the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas, saying the United States wants more patent protections.
"The Trips agreement was probably the greatest political economic achievement that the pharmaceutical industry ever had," said Jim Keon, president of a trade group representing generic drug companies in Canada. "Now it's coming home to roost, though. Can the world afford it? Is it ethical?" 
Even some supporters of patents are pulling back somewhat. Washington says it will no longer pressure poor countries that allow production of cheaper versions of patented drugs for major health problems, provided they adhere to Trips guidelines. The European Parliament has expressed "solidarity and support" for South Africa and Kenya in their efforts to gain access to lower-priced AIDS drugs. 
Until recently, the industry worried that erosion of patent rights or prices in one country could lead to similar actions elsewhere, particularly in the United States, where the industry gets much of its profit. 
"There was a feeling that if a country deliberately went against Trips, there would be a castle-of-cards effect," said Jean-Pierre Garnier, chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline, a major supplier of AIDS drugs. "Without patents, the industry ceases to exist."
But now, judging from their actions, drug companies have decided to sacrifice prices in some poor countries in order to argue that generic manufacturers are not needed and to relieve the pressure on the patent system. In Brazil, for example, Merck recently agreed to big price cuts for two AIDS drugs to prevent the government from allowing a local generic manufacturer to make a copy of one of them.
Some AIDS activists, however, say it is better to rely on competition from generic manufacturers than on voluntary actions by big drug companies. They say drug companies' recent discounting was only in response to an offer of low-priced AIDS drugs by a generic manufacturer in India. But under Trips, India and other countries will have to enforce patents by 2005 or 2006. 
"If we don't deal with the problem now, 5 to 10 years from now we'll have no possibility of bringing prices lower and we'll be completely at the mercy of the big drug companies," said Ellen 't Hoen, an attorney with Doctors Without Borders.
Drug company executives argue that patents are not a barrier to treatment of AIDS. Even generic drugs are out of reach for countries that spend less than $10 a year per person on public health and lack doctors and clinics to deliver the medications. Moreover, in many countries of Africa besides South Africa, AIDS drugs are not patented.
"At least for AIDS drugs, patents have been a barrier only as an exception rather than the rule in Africa," said Amir Attaran, director of international health research at Harvard University's Center for International Development. Drug companies and some experts argue further that if developing countries honor patents, drug companies will have more incentive to develop treatments for tropical diseases. But others say what deters companies from developing those drugs is the small market size.
Patents award an inventor exclusive rights to make or sell a product for a set period. In countries that adhere to the Trips agreement, patents run for 20 years from the filing of the application. Patents provide an incentive for innovation, and in return, the invention is publicly disclosed so others can learn from it. 
Drug companies argue that they need patents because it can take more than a decade and hundreds of millions of dollars to develop and test a drug, which can be copied relatively easily once it is on the market. Many countries have viewed drugs as meriting exceptions to patent law because of their importance to public health. But with trade agreements like Trips, countries have tightened their patent protection.
Trips does not go as far as drug companies would like, and it includes some exceptions to patent protection. For example, countries can force patent holders to license their patents to others, like generic manufacturers. But so far, no country has. 
Some activists say the countries have not used licensing because of pressure from drug companies and Washington. But the United States has partly reversed its policy and is no longer raising objections to compulsory licensing in the case of health crises in developing countries. 
The country with the most experience with compulsory licensing, albeit before Trips took effect, is Canada. For decades Canada allowed any company to apply for a license to make a patented drug there.
In 1969, it allowed copies of patented drugs to be imported, and a generic industry began to thrive. The compulsory licensing system was weakened in 1987 and then abandoned in 1993.
Since then, spending on research and development by drug companies in Canada has zoomed, to about $900 million in 1999 from $166 million in 1988. The Canadian experience suggests that protecting intellectual property may prompt greater investments by drug companies and even the development of a homegrown industry. 
But it is not clear if African countries have the scientific expertise for a research-oriented drug industry. Moreover, some experts say the drug companies promised in advance to increase spending in Canada if the law was changed. 
The precedent that most worries drug companies now is that weakened patent protection in developing countries will lead to pressure to weaken patents -- and in the process, their latitude to set prices -- in the United States. 
The Consumer Project on Technology, a Washington group founded by Ralph Nader, has asked the government to let it make a low-priced version of d4T, the Bristol-Myers AIDS drug. The National Institutes of Health has in the past rejected such requests. 
Even without the AIDS crisis, there is pressure on patents as a result of high drug prices in the United States. While innovation should be rewarded, some drug industry critics say, the drug industry is the most profitable in the nation. Moreover, many drugs are initially developed with government money. 
Gail Wilensky, a senior fellow at the international health education organization Project Hope who ran Medicare under former President George Bush, has proposed shortening the life of drug patents to let competition lower drug prices, as an alternative to regulatory options that are sometimes discussed.
A report issued last year by the National Institute for Health Care Management Foundation, an organization supported by health insurers, said the effective patent life for some drugs has grown from 8 years in the early 1980's to 14 or 15 years now. 
"We have moved more toward increasing market power of pharmaceutical companies than we wished to," Dr. Wilensky said.

HEADLINE: In Mayor's Race, Campaigning Is Blended With Official Duties 

BYLINE:  By ERIC LIPTON 

 BODY:
Mark Green arrived at the sunlit art gallery in Bedford-Stuyvesant just after all of the pieces had fallen into place.
 His mayoral campaign aides had successfully summoned television and newspaper reporters. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., son of the New York senator who 35 years ago helped set up the complex in Brooklyn that houses the gallery, accompanied him. 
 Stepping in front of a microphone stand, Mr. Green, the city's public advocate, detailed plans to jump-start the city economy and reorganize the mayor's office, relying on a report researched by his office staff, on a topic decidedly unlike his typical subjects of air-polluting dry cleaners or unethical health insurance companies. 
"I would like a better balance in our economic development budget," Mr. Green declared on Monday, as his office staff taped his remarks and snapped photographs, while campaign advisers milled around with other city staff members in the background.
For decades, political candidates have blurred -- if not crossed -- the lines between their dual roles as public officials and candidates, using the clout and government resources at their disposal to remind voters to keep them in office.
But nowhere, perhaps, has the distinction between candidate and official become murkier than in this year's mayoral race. The intense competition among the four Democrats, all city officeholders, is unfolding within the extraordinary constraints of the city's campaign finance system. Limited to $5.23 million each for the September primary -- a lot of money by most cities' standards, but considered a tight budget in New York -- the candidates are under heightened pressure to use their offices as much as they legally can to promote their campaigns, in part to save money for the expensive television advertising they must do later on.
A result is that in recent weeks there have been staged events that clearly stretch the boundaries of office duties, as the candidates at times use city staff or staff-prepared reports, mailings and other city-financed products to help them get their names out there at little or no cost to their campaigns.
Alan G. Hevesi, the city comptroller, who announced his candidacy in late March, has not yet opened a campaign headquarters or hired a campaign press secretary. On Monday, he came with his government aides to the City Hall steps for a comptroller's office news conference that seemed to have little to do with city finances: he called on President Bush to release the convicted spy Jonathan Pollard from prison. Before the event was over, he responded to questions about his campaign.
"The majority of New Yorkers essentially feel we are moving in the right direction," Mr. Hevesi said, as several of his senior city government staff members looked on. "But a lot of New Yorkers have been left out, that they are isolated, that they are not part of the economic boom, that they do not have access to City Hall, and that has to be repaired."
On Tuesday, Fernando Ferrer left the Bronx for Harlem, with a collection of his borough president aides and official news releases. "We need to stem the tide of losing jobs in New York because of the enormous traffic congestion," he said. "New York needs a full-length Second Avenue subway. New York needs this stop at 116th Street and Second Avenue."
Peter F. Vallone, meanwhile, acted as host to about 125 Jewish city residents Wednesday night in the City Council chambers for a salute to Jewish culture, complete with effuse praise of Mr. Vallone's efforts on behalf of Jewish causes, a memo board for each guest "Compliments of Peter F. Vallone, Speaker, New York City Council" and seven long tables filled with city-purchased deli sandwiches, kosher pickles, coleslaw, beverages and sweets.
"Take one of these home with you and you will remember what you have to do the next day by putting it right on the refrigerator," Mr. Vallone told the mostly elderly crowd of his memo boards, ad-libbing from his prepared remarks, which had been written by one of the nine City Council press spokesmen who work one flight down from his office.
Little appears to be clearly outside the law. And the candidates, in most cases, have explanations for why their government staffs are involved or why the staff is preparing a particular report that appears to be perfectly on cue with their campaign message, as is happening now on at least a weekly basis.
Mr. Ferrer's office staff pointed out that a Second Avenue subway could someday extend to the Bronx. Mr. Vallone's staff noted that these celebrations help recognize important community leaders. Mr. Hevesi acknowledged that his position on the Pollard case could be construed as political. And Mr. Green's staff said his Brooklyn event on the economy was entirely within his purview.
"As public advocate," said Stephen H. Sigmund, his government office spokesman, "he looks at how city agencies and the city can do a better job in all sorts of areas, including how it can contribute to neighborhood development." 
But not all city officials defend the practices, especially receptions for ethnic groups or community leaders. 
"This has almost become like the Lincoln Bedroom," said an elected city official, who has had city-financed celebrations of his own. "You go out and you find 10 people in each ethnic community and give them an award: three of them are outstanding humanitarians, three of them have political influence and three are potential fund-raising targets."
Mr. Hevesi has 14 ethnic celebrations each year, costing about $800 apiece. Mr. Green, who traditionally had three a year, has already sponsored three this year. Mr. Vallone's office could not offer a tally of the number or cost of these events. Mr. Ferrer holds his celebrations at the Bronx Borough Hall, although his spokesman said the food is often donated.
The blurry lines extend even further. The City Council recently mailed about one million brochures to residents, costing about $700,000, extolling Mr. Vallone's and the Council's work to increase services for the elderly, among other initiatives. The mailing included three pictures of Mr. Vallone.
Mr. Ferrer, similarly, spent $63,000 of borough money to mail 240,000 letters to Bronx residents last month, and criticized the state school aid formula.
City rules allow these mailings to continue until 30 days before a primary or election, a City Council spokesman said. Using city staff can be equally murky. 
Karen M. Persichilli spent weeks supervising Council workers who prepared the million brochures. Soon afterward, she resigned to become Mr. Vallone's campaign manager.
And Cathie Levine, who was a spokeswoman for Hillary Rodham Clinton during her Senate campaign and for Charles E. Schumer during his Senate campaign in 1998, was hired by Mr. Hevesi in January to be his communications director, a post that had been vacant for three years. Asked yesterday if she intends to leave his office soon to join his campaign payroll, Ms. Levine, who is paid $98,000 a year, said, "It's a distinct possibility, but I have no plans now."
Mr. Hevesi and spokesmen for the other candidates adamantly defended the work of their aides, saying they were more than qualified for their city government assignments.
But questions like these have already inspired at least one inquiry this year. The City Campaign Finance Board this week, at the request of Mr. Vallone's campaign manager, began an investigation into how Mr. Hevesi could have raised $6.1 million toward his campaign as of mid-January, according to financial disclosure forms, while spending only $402,565.
The subtext of the request for the inquiry, in part, was whether Mr. Hevesi was using his office or staff to help conduct his campaign, or perhaps just not reporting all the expenses he has incurred, officials said.
"It is incredible on its face that you could raise millions of dollars and only spend a few hundred on it," Mr. Vallone said on Tuesday. "I assure you, there is no way of raising money, without spending money."
Mr. Hevesi said he was merely being frugal to save money for critical needs, like the estimated $1 million he is spending on a television commercial campaign that is already being broadcast.
"With the limited amount of expenditures, we would rather spend our money on getting the message out and as little money as possible on extraneous expenditures, including staff," Mr. Hevesi said yesterday, explaining why he had no headquarters or formal campaign staff except his consultant, Hank Morris.
The City Conflicts of Interest Board has previously examined these questions, including a 1996 review of $7,400 worth of radio advertising by Ruth W. Messinger, then the Manhattan borough president, who was preparing a campaign against Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. The board concluded that she could use city dollars to criticize the mayor for his support of megastores in certain neighborhoods. 
"Distinguishing campaigning from fulfilling one's public duties can be difficult," said Joan R. Salzman, the board's director of enforcement. "The most extreme case would be attending a city event in one's capacity as an elected official and saying, 'Vote for me.' But it is rarely that clear-cut."

ECONOMY FARING WELL

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton 

 BODY:
 New York's economy is cooling off a little, but growth in the state and the city remains far stronger than the national average, according to data released yesterday by the New York State Department of Labor. The number of private-sector jobs in the state hit a record 7,264,000 in March, an increase of 1.9 percent over the past 12 months. While that is slower than the 2.9 percent growth rate hit last September, it is far above the 1.1 percent national average for March. Unemployment for the entire state fell to 4 percent from 4.3 percent, and for the first time in a decade is well below the national rate of 4.3 percent. The rate in New York City was 5.1 percent, the same as in January. Private-sector jobs grew by 2.4 percent in the city but still slipped to the lowest level in more than three years. Leslie Eaton

 Fearful that a devaluing currency will threaten the country's inflation goals, the Brazilian central bank raised interest rates 0.5 percent, to 16.25 percent. The rate increase was the second in a month, as weakening markets in the United States and concern over economic instability in neighboring Argentina have caused the currency, the real, to fall almost 15 percent since last September.

HEADLINE: Continent Officials Are More Worried About Inflation 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, April 19 

 BODY:
A day after the United States Federal Reserve electrified investors by lowering interest rates, the European Central Bank appeared today to be as unwilling as ever to follow suit.
 Analysts said the gulf between American and European central bankers widened after new data provided fresh support today to European officials, who are convinced that inflation is a bigger worry than a serious economic slowdown. 
 "They made it clear they do not want to be pushed into doing something they don't want to do," said Thomas Mayer, an economist with Goldman, Sachs in Frankfurt. "They are being seen as the odd man out, but it is also part of a central bank's job to stick to its beliefs. This is how a central bank earns its money, and its credibility." 
Defying widespread expectations among investors and political leaders, the European Central Bank has refused to match any of the Federal Reserve's four reductions in interest rates this year. And last week, the central bank not only declined to cut rates but strongly suggested that it would not do so any time soon.
If anything, the Fed's move on Wednesday seems to have stiffened resistance in Europe. Edgar Meister, a board member of the Bundesbank, which is part of the European Central Bank, said today that Europe faced a fundamentally different outlook than the United States.
"We have a different economic development in Germany and Europe," Mr. Meister told the Reuters news service. "You cannot be guided by what appears to be appropriate for America."
For the first time since the introduction of the euro in January 1999, Europe's baseline interest rate of 4.75 percent is now higher than that of the Federal Reserve's federal funds rate target, which dropped to 4.5 percent on Wednesday.
Europe's monetary hawks got fresh support today when the statistical arm of the European Union reported that prices in the 12 nations that use the euro climbed at an annualized rate of 2.6 percent in March. That is the same rate as in February, but well above the European Central Bank's target of 2.0 percent.
At least three basic differences lie behind the increasingly stark contrast between attitudes at the European Central Bank and the Fed.
European central bankers remain convinced that economic growth will slow down much more modestly in Europe than in the United States. They appear to be betting on growth of about 2.5 percent or slightly less this year, compared with a rate of 3.4 percent last year. By contrast, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, clearly fears that the United States is in danger of falling into a recession.
The European Central Bank reiterated its comparatively relaxed view today in its latest monthly report, which was written before the Fed acted on Wednesday. "The moderation in growth shouldn't be a source of pessimism as regards the economic strength of the euro area," the bank said. But, it added, inflation risks "have not fully disappeared."
Compounding that difference in outlook, the two central banks have very different views about what is normal and proper. The European Central Bank's only real mandate is to protect price stability, which it defines as inflation below 2 percent a year. The mandate reflects the passionate fears about inflation at the German Bundesbank, the biggest member of the European central banking system.
But the Federal Reserve has been content to let inflation run at more than 3 percent, and it views maintaining economic growth as part of its job. Mr. Greenspan has also been an outspoken supporter of the view that technology has opened a new era of growth in productivity that allows faster growth without inflation. The European Central Bank has been much more skeptical about Europe's entry into the new economy.
"The E.C.B. has a very different mandate," said Tony Norfield, senior currency analyst in London at ABN Amro, the Dutch bank. "The way they look at it, growth may be weakening a bit, but 2.5 percent is O.K. And underlying that, inflation actually is picking up. Because they have a stronger inflation mandate in the policy setting, that is not something they can walk away from."
A third major difference between the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve is the assumption about how fast the economy can grow without igniting inflation. For the last several years, the Federal Reserve has supported the idea that the United States can grow as much as 4 percent a year. But the European Central Bank, along with most economists, thinks European growth cannot average much more than 2.5 percent a year over the longer term.
"The E.C.B. and the Fed have decidedly different views on what the speed limit for growth ought to be," said James McCormick, an analyst with J. P. Morgan. "In that context, one shouldn't be surprised by the actions taken so far."
Analysts say the European Central Bank is also acutely concerned about protecting its credibility, and officials know that an abrupt reversal in policy would inevitably lead to accusations that it was indecisive.
Yet the Fed's move undoubtedly puts the European bank under new pressure. The struggling euro has failed to recover value against the dollar, even though Europe is now growing faster than the United States. That seems to reflect disenchantment with Europe's unimpressive growth and a belief that perhaps, thanks to Mr. Greenspan, the American economy will bounce back before the end of the year.

HEADLINE: Despite a Decline in Profit, Ford Outearns G.M. 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 19 

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company's profit dropped 49 percent in the first quarter, but the company earned much more than its archrival, General Motors, and came within a whisker of outselling G.M., which has been the world's largest automaker since the 1930's.
 Ford's sales were $42.36 billion in the first quarter, nearly matching G.M.'s $42.62 billion. The photo-finish came about partly because G.M. had to cut production more than Ford in the first quarter. G.M. dealerships were overflowing with unsold cars and light trucks at the end of last year. 
 Ford has been slowly closing the sales gap with G.M. for years, partly by avoiding G.M.'s steep losses of market share in the United States and partly by buying luxury brands, including Volvo cars in 1999 and Land Rover last year. 
G.M.'s North American sales have begun to stabilize and it plans less steep production cuts in the second quarter. Henry D. G. Wallace, Ford's chief financial officer, predicted in a telephone interview this afternoon that G.M. would stay ahead in sales for the year.
Ford remains well behind G.M. in the number of vehicles sold worldwide, trailing by 9 percent, or 186,000 vehicles, in the first quarter. Ford nearly beat G.M. on revenue because of the high prices commanded by its luxury brands, which include Aston Martin, Jaguar and Lincoln.
But while G.M. and Ford had virtually identical sales in the first quarter, Ford earned four times the profit of G.M. Ford did better in North America and earned money in Europe while G.M. lost money there.
Wall Street expects more of Ford these days than it does of G.M., however, and Ford's shares dropped 41 cents today, to close at $30.30. Ford's stock had risen $1.83 Wednesday, however, when G.M. announced that its profits had dropped 87 percent.
Ford earned $1.06 billion in the first quarter, or 56 cents a share, down from $2.08 billion, or $1.70 a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time charges, discontinued operations and a complex recapitalization of the company last summer, Ford's after-tax earnings from continuing operations were 60 cents a share, down from 90 cents a share. Ford still exceeded the consensus forecast of financial analysts by 6 cents a share, according to First Call.
Ford incurred a one-time loss of $72 million in the first quarter of this year when it adopted new accounting standards for derivatives, which are financial instruments often used to manage risk. Ford had $147 million in profit in the first quarter of last year from discontinued operations, notably the Visteon Corporation, an auto parts company that Ford spun off last summer.
Scott Sprinzen, an automaker credit analyst with the Standard & Poor's Ratings Group, said, "Results have held up pretty well, and demand in the U.S. has held up better than expected."
But growing competition from foreign automakers in the sport utility vehicle and pickup truck market is hurting Ford's market share. "They'll make up for that with marketing spending," which is costly, Mr. Sprinzen said.
Mr. Wallace said that the slow decline of the yen's value against the dollar over the last year had made it cheaper for foreign automakers to ship autos and auto parts here from overseas, allowing them to offer more generous marketing incentives. Ford has been compelled to match this discounting, and its marketing expenses rose in the first quarter to 12.2 percent of sales, from 11 percent a year earlier.
The yen's decline, "is a competitive threat out there," he said.
Mr. Wallace expressed confidence that Ford would meet analysts' expectations that it would earn 81 cents a share in the second quarter. But he cautioned that sales had slowed slightly so far in April from strong levels in the first quarter, and predicted that sales could remain "a little softer" through the third quarter. The Federal Reserve's decision to cut short-term interest rates on Wednesday, "will start to have an effect toward the end of the year," he added.
Ford Credit, the automaker's lending and leasing subsidiary, said today that it earned $393 million in the first quarter. Bibiana Boerio, the unit's chief financial officer, said that despite a weakening economy, credit losses in the first quarter were in line with the third and fourth quarters of last year, although a little higher than a year ago.

HEADLINE: A Foreseeable End to the Fed's Magic 

BYLINE:  By James Grant; James Grant is the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer.

 BODY:
The essential American financial dilemma is implied in a throwaway line in the statement released by the Federal Reserve to explain this week's surprise interest-rate action. The current risks, said the Fed, "are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."
 The telltale word, "foreseeable," is one favored by sloppy writers, psychics, mentalists and economic planners. "A cliche and a fuzzy one," adjured Strunk and White in "The Elements of Style." "How much of the future is foreseeable? Ten minutes? Ten years? Any of it? By whom is it foreseeable? Seers? Experts? Everybody?" 
 Not by everybody, experience teaches, and certainly not by seers, experts and federal bureaucrats. Cisco Systems, the archetypal "new economy" company, was recently forced to admit that it could hardly see past the end of its computer-enhanced nose. Is the Fed so much better equipped to predict coming events?
Remarkably, Wall Street is prepared to believe that it is. While the smashing of the icons of the boom years proceeds apace, the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, still lives high up on the pedestal of the long prosperity.
How does he do what he does? Nobody knows. It is a mystery. He collects data and ponders them. He conceives a course of action. This action takes the form of a double manipulation, first of an interest rate and second of the mind of the market. What is the purpose of these actions? To impart value to the dollar (a slip of paper of no intrinsic value), to promote economic growth, to guard against price inflation and to protect and defend the financial system.
This is a mighty tall order. In fact, it is reminiscent of the task that the economic planning agencies of the former Soviet Union were famously unable to carry out. For them, the "foreseeable" portion of the future turned out to be surprisingly short.
Does capitalist America have a clearer view? The Fed's myriad fans don't like to admit that what Mr. Greenspan actually does is to fix a price. Not just any price, either, but the federal funds rate: the fulcrum interest rate for the American dollar and a good portion of the global economy. What is an interest rate? It is a price that balances saving with investment. Set the rate too low, and there is likely to be too much investment. Too high, and too little.
On the evidence of the late boom, the Fed for many years set the rate too low. Thus, a comprehensive measure of investment -- including residential construction -- has been soaring. Last year, it amounted to more than 18 percent of gross domestic product, the highest percentage since the late 1970's. 
Investment, as we all know, is a good thing, but like all good things it can be carried to excess. On the evidence of the collapse in the high-tech economy (an event not foreseen by the Fed), outlays on computer-related equipment now appear to be excessive. Low interest rates are a balm to a recession-bound economy. However, to the extent that they redirect new capital into old, redundant places, notably information-technology hardware, they do harm.
The value placed on invested capital is measured by the stock market. Even after a year of horrific losses, valuations are still historically high. As a rule, the higher the valuations, the greater the risks borne by investors. By intervening in the money market aggressively and cunningly -- thereby inducing new speculative flows into equities -- the Fed has given its seal of approval to a stock market that many investment professionals refuse to touch even with other people's money.
The private market in interest rates is a human institution, and therefore imperfect. However, as Chairman Greenspan knows, markets usually outshine governments in the work of setting, or discovering, prices. Yet, oddly enough, Mr. Greenspan has become a living symbol of the efficacy of price fixing. But it's likely that sometime before his career is over, he will become a symbol of the futility of that black art.

HEADLINE: Fed Medicine: Some Patients Are Too Sick to Be Helped 

BYLINE:  By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
THE Federal Reserve is doing all it can. But its rate-cut medicine will take time to work and cannot help some parts of the economy.
 Lower interest rates have helped the auto and housing markets, and the corporate lending market has opened up to some extent. But borrowing costs for creditworthy companies are not down very much. The Fed's four rate cuts this year have stirred hopes for a quick recovery, thereby putting upward pressure on long-term rates. 
 The benefits are real, but they do not offset the more important fact that many companies simply cannot borrow. "You can offer really great interest rates, but if no one qualifies, it does not make much difference," noted Martin Fridson, Merrill Lynch's junk bond guru.
The credit markets, having been burned, now shun many borrowers that need money the most. Young telecommunications companies could easily borrow a year ago, but now the banks and bond buyers are not interested. So the companies do not have money to stay in business.
That means the lower rates won't help that part of the economy. Another part that still can borrow money doesn't want to. The boom that has ended produced huge overinvestment in some industries, as companies like Cisco Systems learned too late. No interest rate is low enough to persuade a company to build a plant to produce products it cannot sell. 
The Fed is being unfairly criticized for having raised rates last year, thus causing the slowdown. The more reasonable criticism is that it should have acted sooner to slow the boom that led to the bubble in so many technology stocks. The economic rebound would come quicker if the excesses had been less.
As the bubble progressed, companies with no real hope were sustained by suppliers that provided financing to keep peddling products and convince investors they were doing well. Now those vendors are haunted by those decisions, as credit losses pile up.
In December, Winstar Communications, a wireless phone company, was able to borrow $200 million from Siemens. That cleared the way for Winstar to borrow $500 million more from Lucent Technologies. But that money wasn't enough. This week Winstar filed for bankruptcy. Shares that traded for $23 in January sold for 14 cents before trading was suspended. Its bonds have fallen from 83 percent of par value to under 2 percent.
Another company whose financial reports show it to have little additional credit available is Microstrategy. Michael J. Saylor, the chief executive, sent a letter to shareholders yesterday explaining why the stock had fallen. He did not dwell on the company's losses and layoffs. Nor did he point to his own sales of 15,000 shares a day. Instead, he blamed short-sellers and urged holders to make it impossible for the shorts to borrow shares. Microstrategy stock, which peaked at $333 last spring, rose $2.27, to $5.24.
Winstar won't be helped by the Fed's actions. As for Microstrategy, Mr. Saylor must know that the shorts are not the real problem. "It is more difficult to raise capital," he told analysts a couple of weeks ago, without discussing interest rates. His "new business view," he said, is that positive cash flow is essential. If Microstrategy can accomplish that, the stock price will take care of itself.
It is unclear whether a recession will be avoided. But a big slowdown is already here. For many companies, life will never be anything like what it was, and there is nothing that the Fed, or anyone else, can do about that.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
At the Four A's meeting, an agency chairman delivers a stern assessment of the dot-com era.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

DATELINE: NAPLES, Fla. 

 BODY:
THE dot-com debacle cast its shadow yesterday over the opening general session of the annual management conference of the American Association of Advertising Agencies.
 But speakers at the general session also told the members of the association, which is known as the Four A's, that the stunning rise and abrupt collapse of Internet marketers and stocks offered them opportunities they could capitalize on as they grapple with the aftermath of dot-com mania. 
 The general session opened the association's 83rd management conference, which continues through tomorrow at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel here. 
The mood of the attendees seemed surprisingly upbeat, whether because they sense a coming improvement in the faltering economy, they cheer the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates again or they welcome the sunshine that shone brightly despite temperatures that were somewhat cooler than usual. 
The effects of the dot-com collapse were addressed in a provocative speech by Maurice Levy, chairman and chief executive of the Publicis Groupe in Paris, now the world's fifth-largest agency company. "To what extent did advertising agencies fuel the decline of dot-coms by draining their finances with disproportional ad campaigns," Mr. Levy wondered, adding: "Did we behave as pigs at the feeding trough? Or did we give sound business counsel?" 
"To the extent we contributed to the dot-com crash, let us accept some responsibility and learn some lessons," Mr. Levy said. "We must line up for lashes alongside the investment bankers who pocketed fees of more than $600 million for new companies that now trade under $1." 
One shortcoming, Mr. Levy declared, was a lack of what he called "fearless accountability," which hindered the ability of agencies to "deliver the desired business results that bring clients to our doors." 
"In fact, I'll make the radical assertion that without measurable objectives as our starting point, we are engaging in something akin to malpractice," he added. "I believe that every client's obligation is to be very specific about the terms of success, and every agency's duty to challenge that objective or plan to it."
Looking for the lessons, Mr. Levy suggested that "the obvious unpredictability and rapid pace" of events of the last year required agencies and advertisers "to plan for where consumers are headed, not where they stand today." 
"We must shorten our planning and development cycles to keep our brands, products and communications in tune with the times," Mr. Levy said. "In a world of instant messaging, it is time for marketers and agencies to move much, much more quickly." 
"By bringing ideas more rapidly to market, we can keep the blood coursing through the veins of our brands," he added. "And we can have a more timely and meaningful dialogue with our customers." 
Another speaker who focused on the lessons that could be found "after the rush and the bust," as he put it, was Lanny Baker, managing director in the United States equity research division at Salomon Smith Barney in San Francisco, owned by Citigroup.
The "unprecedented opportunity" for agencies and advertisers is that they "will dictate" the future of the online media, Mr. Baker said, "not Wall Street or the companies." 
"You all will pick the good ones and spur the growth of this medium," Mr. Baker told the audience. "The online companies are all ears, they're humbled, on their knees. They will listen to you." 
One reason "there's a real backlash against this medium today," Mr. Baker said, is that so far no one has found "a way to communicate with audiences on the Internet." 
"Please, no more banner ads," he added, laughing. "You have the creative capacity to do a lot better." 
The arrival of broadband capability in large numbers of households will help in that regard, Mr. Baker said, predicting that "AOL Time Warner and its partners will decide what advertising will look like in a broadband world," assisted with "content from the Warner side and the infrastructure of Warner Cable." 
A panel devoted to "the post-dot-com era" also offered some reasons agencies are, as one panelist put it, "in a better position to master the world the dot-coms left behind." 
Just as "the end of tulip mania" in the 1630's "didn't mean the end of tulips," said the panelist, Brad Brinegar, chief executive of Leo Burnett U.S.A. in Chicago, part of the Leo Burnett Worldwide unit of the Bcom3 Group, the dot-com collapse does not mean the end of the Internet as an effective advertising medium.
And, he added, "we are still the only industry that is consistently capable" of helping marketers sell branded products.
The conference continues today with a second general session devoted to creativity, which will include panels with top agency creative executives and top editors at Conde Nast Publications, part of Advance Publications; a speech about how creativity can be achieved without tastelessness or indecency, to be given by Keith Reinhard, chairman at DDB Worldwide in New York, owned by the Omnicom Group; and the presentation of the agency association's 2000 O'Toole Awards for creativity and consistency in work for clients.
For general excellence, the Minneapolis office of Fallon Worldwide, owned by Publicis, won for agencies with billings above $300 million. Carmichael Lynch in Minneapolis, owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies won for agencies with billings of $30 million to $300 million. And Mad Dogs and Englishmen in New York won for agencies with billings less than $30 million.
The O'Toole Award for multicultural advertising went to Ornelas & Associates in Dallas.
And the O'Toole Award for public service went to Saatchi & Saatchi in New York, part of Publicis, for broadcast work, and to DeVito/Verdi in New York, for print work.
For the first time the O'Toole Awards were accompanied by cash prizes. The general excellence and multicultural winners each received $25,000, and the public service winners each won $10,000.

EBay Bucks Online Trend With a Strong First Quarter

BYLINE:  By JOHN SCHWARTZ 

 BODY:
EBay, the giant online auction company, announced earnings yesterday for its first fiscal quarter that heartily surpassed analysts' expectations. 
 "EBay's momentum continues to accelerate," said Meg Whitman, president and chief executive of eBay, during a conference call for analysts and reporters. "Across all important metrics, we had a great quarter." 
 In the first three months of 2001, the company had net revenue of $154.1 million, a 79 percent increase over the nearly $86 million it earned in the same quarter of 2000. The company's net income was $21.1 million, or 8 cents a diluted share, compared with $1.8 million, or 1 cent a share, a year earlier. Once the effects of certain noncash and stock-related charges were excluded, earnings per diluted share rose to 11 cents, well beyond analysts' estimates of 8 cents, as gathered by Thomson Financial/First Call. 
At a time when many other leaders of the online revolution are announcing disastrous drops in sales and cutting staff, eBay, based in San Jose, Calif., actually raised its estimates of revenue for the next two quarters, saying they could be as much as $10 million to $15 million higher than previously anticipated. 
EBay delivered its earnings report after the close of financial markets, but its stock closed for the day at $49.99, up $4.24. After hours, the shares rose $3 more.
The company's executives said that eBay was moving forward on many fronts. It has created sites geared specifically to users in more than 10 countries.
It has also expanded the ways that its users can do business online: a free option, "Buy It Now," which allows buyers to purchase an auction item instantly at a price set by the seller, is now found on nearly a third of eBay's listings. 
With growth have come some growing pains: auction fraud has become the most common complaint to federal regulators who police online crime. The company has upgraded its own internal mechanisms to detect "shill" bidding, in which sellers or their associates artificially increase the prices in their auctions through fake bids.
The company's community of users continued to expand during the first quarter, with 7.2 million newcomers; at the end of March, eBay had 29.7 million registered users. More than three million of the newly counted users came with the acquisition of the Internet Auction Company in South Korea. And the number of auctions continued to grow, as well, with 89 million listings in the first three months of the year, 66 percent more than in the period a year earlier and 12 percent more than in the last three months of 2000. 
The company also announced yesterday that it was expanding Half.com, its trading area for those who wish to buy and sell items at fixed prices.
Derek Brown, an analyst with W. R. Hambrecht & Company, said the Half.com expansion would make eBay attractive to an even larger audience, because more people were comfortable buying and selling at fixed prices and were still wary of auctions. "It moves eBay more into the mainstream," he said. 
Mr. Brown said that the company's continued success in difficult times reflected the versatility of its marketplace. "It's very possible that eBay becomes even more valuable to buyers and sellers in a slow economy," he said, because sellers want to move merchandise quickly and buyers are looking for bargains. 
EBay's chief financial officer, Rajiv Dutta, said in a telephone interview that the transition over time from collectible items like Beanie Babies to more practical merchandise like computers and cars did make the site more attractive during an economic downturn. Car sales now make up 13 percent of the company's revenue, he said. 
"Most of the practical items on eBay are either used or distressed or obsolete or last year's model," he said, "and they really do represent value" to buyers. 
Because it draws profit from each transaction, eBay can prosper in both fat and lean times no matter what is being sold, Mr. Dutta said. The shift to practical, value-oriented items and away from things like hard-to-get Sony Playstations occurred automatically, he said, through the "collective wisdom" of millions of users. "It's something that a single company could never do," he said. 
Anthony Noto, an Internet analyst with Goldman, Sachs, said, "Clearly, this is no longer just about Beanie Babies." He said that the economic problems in the high-tech world were starting to separate the dot-com wheat from the chaff: "We're starting to see the viable, long-term Internet companies show through the clutter."

HEADLINE: Bush's Job at Quebec Talks: Push Case for Free Trade 

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: QUEBEC, April 19 

 BODY:
Even before he enters the gates of this historic walled city to attend the Summit of the Americas, President Bush faces major challenges to fulfilling his promise of using the forum to elevate the importance of relations with Latin America and breathe new life into American plans for a hemisphere-wide free trade deal. 
 The critical trade negotiating legislation that Mr. Bush pledged last summer to have well under way by now has not even been introduced in Congress. 
 And the administration's attempt to speed up the schedule for negotiating and setting up a vast Free Trade Area of the Americas was soundly defeated earlier this month, in part because of the objections of countries like Brazil that feel the United States is trying to dominate the region economically. 
The conference, which begins Friday, is Mr. Bush's first big international meeting, and he has long portrayed it as a prominent stage on which he intends to open a new era of hemispheric harmony. Besides the impact it will have in the region, the summit meeting is also expected to have lasting repercussions on the administration's ability to pursue other goals.
The president's arrival in Quebec without the trade measures he had promised is sure to frustrate some of the 33 other leaders who have already waited six years for a sign of Washington's commitment to the hemispheric trade deal, said Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, an academic forum. He added that Mr. Bush needed to send a clear signal that he was moving forward with his agenda despite the recent setbacks or risk deepening the "unhappiness, disappointment and sense of lost opportunity," already present in Latin America.
The region is eager to hear Mr. Bush's message. Carlos Echeverria, head of the Costa Rican delegation, said that while the conference was about far more than trade, gaining open access to the American market was of utmost importance to developing nations.
"We hope that the U.S. Congress is going to get a message from all this and give Mr. Bush what he needs to get the trade deal going," he said. 
Thousands of people concerned about issues from human rights to the high cost of AIDS medicines in undeveloped countries have already gathered here. They are separated from the delegates by several miles of concrete barricades and chain link fencing. 
Quebec itself became noticeably edgier this week after Jose Bove, the French sheep farmer who vandalized a McDonald's restaurant in France in an antiglobalization protest a few years ago, arrived here saying, "Even if some windows are going down on Saturday, that is not violence." And after authorities arrested six Canadian men headed for Quebec with smoke bombs, military stun grenades and other items that the police said were to be used to disrupt the meeting, shopkeepers began to board up their windows. 
The leaders are expected to discuss a wide range of issues, including health, education and Plan Colombia, under which the United States is providing $1.3 billion in mostly military aid to Colombia to help resolve a guerrilla uprising and drug problem. The leaders of several Latin American countries are expected to try to buttonhole President Bush to express their concerns about the plan, which they fear could heighten the fighting and cause it to spill over to other nations. 
A number of countries, led by Canada and Peru, are pushing hard for the adoption of a clear commitment to democracy in the region that will give a stronger policing role to the Organization of American States. A point of contention is expected to be how narrowly delegates are willing to define the concept of a functioning democracy. Nations that veer from democratic principles would be prohibited from taking part in future summit meetings and regional trade associations. 
The most controversial part of the summit is discussion of plans to create the world's largest trading block, with 800 million people from the Arctic to Argentina. All 34 nations support the proposal. In Buenos Aires earlier this month, Chile, backed by the United States, proposed accelerating the date for completing the pact to 2003 from 2005.

HEADLINE: Upbeat Xerox Reports Lower-Than-Expected Loss in First Quarter 

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
The Xerox Corporation, citing lower-than-expected costs and strong sales in its most lucrative product lines, said yesterday that it had appreciably stanched its losses and reiterated its promise to end the year in black ink.
 The company, based in Stamford, Conn., said it had an operating loss of $86 million, or 12 cents a share, in the first quarter. Analysts had been predicting a loss of 28 cents, and Xerox had been even more pessimistic than that. In late January, it predicted a first-quarter loss of 31 cents. 
 Including gains from asset sales and restructuring charges, the company posted net income of $158 million, or 19 cents a share, in contrast to a net loss of $243 million, or 38 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. 
"They've pretty much confirmed that it will be a positive year," said Charles L. Hill, director of research at Thomson Financial/First Call. 
The sales picture was less rosy. Thanks to price increases on service contracts and strong sales of color and superfast machines, Xerox's sales in North America rose for the first time in six quarters. But they dropped 20 percent in Latin America and other emerging markets as Xerox backed away from deep price discounts. Overall revenue was $4.2 billion, an 8 percent drop from $4.5 billion in the quarter a year earlier. 
Still, investors sent Xerox's shares up $2.50, to $8.90 -- the highest price since last fall. 
"We've turned the corner on our core businesses," an ebullient Anne M. Mulcahy, Xerox's president, said in an interview. "We haven't changed our strategy, but we've finally shown that we can execute it." Indeed, Xerox promised investors in October that it would sell $2 billion to $4 billion in assets and cut costs by $1 billion. It has already topped the $2 billion asset sale goal, with its sale of its China operations, part of its stake in Fuji Xerox and its financing business in Scandinavia. 
And Ms. Mulcahy said that Xerox, which ended the quarter with about $2.8 billion in cash, was ahead of schedule on cost cuts. The company reduced inventories by more than $100 million. It removed whole layers of management jobs overseas and, because digital machines rarely break down as often as the older copiers, cut many technician jobs. All told, Xerox has cut 4,300 jobs so far this year, 300 more than it had budgeted.
Xerox has also fine-tuned its forecasting and order-processing operations. "We put discipline back into our business," Ms. Mulcahy said.
Not all analysts were impressed, though. "Overall sales were not meaningfully above what we expected, and the gross margin picture was mixed," said Rebecca Runkle of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. 
Indeed, although Jonathan Rosenzweig of Salomon Smith Barney upgraded his rating on Xerox's stock to "outperform," most analysts remained "neutral" on Xerox shares. 
"The key question remains: Can they execute on margins and stabilize market share in the second half?" said Benjamin A. Reitzes of UBS Warburg. 
That may be hard to do. Canon, Ricoh and other competitors have been churning out new products, noted Jack L. Kelly of Goldman, Sachs. 
"They will not give up share lightly, and that could signal intense price competition," he warned.
Xerox was not expected to release its earnings until the end of the month. But the company had already shown its numbers to its banks, and "the risk of the numbers leaking was too severe," Ms. Mulcahy said. That fear was heightened, she said, when an e-mail message from an overseas manager, including confidential sales numbers, showed up on a Yahoo message board last week.
Still, the ability to give good news probably counted in the decision as well. The softening economy has put intense pressure on all office equipment companies. The pressure was particularly severe for Xerox, which has been grappling with a botched sales-force reorganization even as competitors chipped away at its most lucrative markets. The company's liquidity squeeze was so severe toward the end of last year that it had to battle rumors of bankruptcy.
Xerox's accounting practices are under a cloud, too. After Xerox disclosed accounting irregularities in its Mexican operations last June, the Securities and Exchange Commission began an investigation into Xerox's accounting practices. That inquiry is continuing. And Xerox's auditors, KPMG, have refused to sign off on Xerox's 10-K statement until they take a closer look at all the numbers.
"We're working cooperatively and diligently toward a prompt resolution," Xerox's chairman, Paul A. Allaire, said yesterday.

HEADLINE: Schools Are Now Marketers Where Choice Is Taking Hold 

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: FORT MYERS, Fla. 

 BODY:
Erica Pacetti picked a public high school according to family tradition: her parents and grandparents went to Fort Myers High.
 Derek and Kim McDaniel chose their daughter Kaelin's kindergarten for its location: it is near her grandma, who will watch her after school. 
 Linda Knopf's decision was based on a mix of start times, uniform policies, educational programs, even cafeteria menus. "It's something you have to study," she said as she listed choices 1 through 10 on her son's application.
These are the new school consumers, no longer assigned a school based on where they live but instead facing an education marketplace. Here in Lee County, a sprawling, racially mixed area with 58,000 students on Florida's Gulf Coast, as in an increasing number of school districts around the country, the neighborhood school has been replaced by a dizzying menu of curriculums fiercely marketed to a largely uninformed public. 
With President Bush championing the use of public money for private school tuition, and with charter schools multiplying, school choice and the competition it creates are often hailed as the surest path to educational improvement.
The number of students enrolled in public schools of choice jumped by 2.5 million from 1993 to 1999, a 50 percent increase, and today at least one in four American children attends a school other than the one nearest home (including the 10 percent in private schools).
But if parents are clamoring for choice, those who already have it say they sometimes feel more confused than empowered. Many lack the time to research options, or the expertise to evaluate them, and are instead swayed by a principal's greeting or a building's facade. As they filled out forms at Lee County's parent information center here on a recent Saturday morning, many families, longing for the days of simple sign-up registration, marked the old neighborhood school as their No. 1 choice.
"I think all schools should be equal," lamented Dick Hanley, whose youngest child is in eighth grade. "Then you wouldn't have to pick."
Market theory suggests that schools competing for customers will be forced to improve performance. While studies of limited choice programs show that parents who choose schools are generally more satisfied than they were before choice, and while their children's test scores often rise, there is little evidence of improvement in districts or systems as a whole. What does tend to improve immediately, though, is salesmanship, placing public school educators in an unfamiliar and sometimes uncomfortable role.
In Milwaukee, home of the nation's largest voucher program, the public school district loses money for every child who chooses a private school; so this year it produced a 30-minute infomercial on itself for cable television, and Englewood Elementary lured parents with a chili dinner and door prizes. In Arizona, which has far more charter schools than any other state, the Mesa district, east of Phoenix, advertises in movie theaters. Here in Lee County, one middle school distributed 5,000 promotional CD-ROM's, while another spruced up its brochure, turning a plain white photocopy into a multicolored glossy, though changing none of what it says inside.
Such marketing "asks schools to cater to the lowest common denominator," said Alex Molnar, a professor of education at the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, noting that it drains time and money from the traditional work of teachers and principals. "Schools need to show themselves to be with it, irrespective of whether that with-it-ness represents anything that is educationally important."
But Richard D. Kahlenberg, author of a new book advocating public school choice, said that "the pressure to market a school is not a bad thing," because "it requires school leaders to think hard about their missions and what they're trying to accomplish, what makes them distinctive."
In Lee County, almost all the schools, like many others around the country, have adopted themes like technology, global studies or performing arts. The first bell ranges from 7:15 a.m. to 9:45, and the district has created some K-12 schools and others serving Grades 6 through 12. In response to parent surveys, a rural high school added an agriculture program. After the first year of choice, 26 of the 57 schools improved their grades in a statewide evaluation system, while the grades of 4 declined. (The 27 others held steady, including 4 with A's.)
Suncoast Elementary, which failed to fill its seats after getting an F from the state in 1999, got a new name, a new principal, a tear-down renovation and an arts curriculum mimicking the county's most popular school. Dunbar High is enclosing its open-air walkways to allay families' safety concerns. Fort Myers Middle, the school that gave its brochure a makeover, now plans a program for gifted students.
"If I don't fill the seats, I lose P.S.U.'s, which is money," said Louise Hollins, principal of Fort Myers Middle, using district jargon for personnel staffing units. "It's almost like we have to go out and beat the bushes to bring kids in."
So Ms. Hollins took her jazz band to elementary schools, handing out plastic megaphones and pencils with the school logo. Dunbar High's principal spends many spring Saturdays at middle school science fairs and, in another effort to sell the school, recently went on a television talk show he had shunned for years. Edgewood Elementary sent two of its teachers skydiving at a February aviation show to get publicity. And the school district is considering buying lists of families with 5-year-olds so kindergartens can recruit via direct mail. 
"We have become a sales force," said Laurie Rucks, a middle school math teacher.
School choice began in America not as a result of a conservative call for capitalistic competition but, back in the 1970's, as a path to desegregation that avoided forced busing by attracting white students to urban schools with special programs.
Going further, Cambridge, Mass., in 1981 adopted a "controlled choice" plan that required all families to apply for particular schools, and doled out seats with an eye toward racial balancing. Some 20 cities followed suit, including Montclair, N.J.; Rockford, Ill.; San Jose, Calif.; and Seattle. In New York City, students choose from an array of high schools.
Three years ago, responding to a decades-old discrimination lawsuit and the choice movement, Lee County ended its headache of constantly redrawing school boundaries to accommodate a fast-growing population by adopting a plan like Cambridge's. Now the 900-square-mile district, which is 66 percent white, is divided into three zones, and families select among the schools in their zone -- or among several districtwide magnet programs -- as they apply for kindergarten, sixth grade or ninth grade. Last year about 80 percent got into their first-choice school. For schools that are oversubscribed, a computerized lottery determines enrollment. 
Some 535 buses travel 64,000 miles a day -- 12 million a year -- to deliver students to their chosen schools at an annual cost of $22 million, or $385 a student (up from $335 before choice). Although this transportation is free to families, some parents choose to drive their children to school, freeing them from long bus rides. 
"I bypass quite a few schools on the way here, but it's worth it," Karen Barnes said of her daily 20-mile trek to take her children to Edison Park Elementary, a 500-student arts school that had a 300-child waiting list for kindergarten last year. "If it wasn't for school choice, I'd move."
But it can be difficult to differentiate, even among schools with the same themes. At Edgewood, "global studies" means each building is named for a continent -- the office, where problems are solved, is the United Nations -- and the principal stamps children's "passports" after each unit in a curriculum conceived as a 180-day world tour. At Fort Myers Middle, the only sign of the same theme is that 30 percent of the students take Spanish, German or a class emphasizing international culture.
Joanne Payne visited 11 schools before filling out the application for her twins, who are now first graders at Edison Park. "When they got in," she said, "I cried."
Few do such exhaustive research. At the parent information center, a bustling hive that costs about $1 million a year to run, families waiting for their number to appear on the "now serving" display said they had skimmed school Web sites or relied on reputations.
Mr. and Mrs. McDaniel, who based choices on child-care needs, said they had been able to manage only a drive-by tour of schools at 9 p.m. Teresa LeMaster, a single mother of four, picked any school without uniforms, because she cannot stand washing them every night. Jose Moreno, an operations manager for a trucking company, put Hancock Elementary first because that is where his boss's daughter goes.
"If you've got an ugly-looking school, I don't think she's going to learn anything," Mr. Moreno said of Oceana, 5. "You got a brand-new school, she's going to get an education."
Such decision making is not exactly the utopia envisioned by the choice evangelists, but some experts say it does not much matter.
Caroline M. Hoxby, a Harvard economist, said efficient markets depended on just a few well-informed shoppers who spread the word about the best products. The key, she said, is to have financial consequences -- like Lee County's P.S.U.'s -- so weaker ones improve or disappear.
"I don't think school choice is going to get us perfect schools -- parents aren't perfect choosers," Ms. Hoxby said. "It's not that our cars are all perfect, or that everybody is a perfect car consumer. But we do eliminate really bad cars, cars that nobody would want to buy."

HEADLINE: THE FINE PRINT -- Alternative Minimum Tax; 
Democrats and Republicans Switch Roles on a Tax

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 19 

 BODY:
Many affluent people might not benefit from President Bush's tax cut plan. 
 When the plan goes before the Senate next month, Democrats will try to change one part of it so more of the wealthy can get a tax reduction. But the president and his Republican allies in Congress can be expected to try to preserve the feature that prevents some upper-income people from benefiting. 
 This seems counterintuitive, Democrats trying to protect the wealthy and Republicans working to prevent them from getting a tax reduction. 
But here is the rub. The well-off taxpayers most likely to lose out on the tax cut live in states with high income and property taxes. Those states, many of them in the Northeast, tend to vote Democratic.
In fact, 16 of the 20 senators from the 10 states where taxpayers are most likely to be hurt by this quirk in the president's plan are Democrats. And all 10 of these states went for Al Gore in last year's presidential election.
At issue is the alternative minimum tax, an arcane part of the tax code enacted 30 years ago and rewritten several times since. It is a separate tax calculation meant to keep rich people and prosperous companies from claiming so many deductions, exclusions and credits that they wind up with little or no tax liability. Mr. Bush would leave the minimum tax as is. The Democrats would change or repeal it.
People are most likely to be affected if they have many children and thus many personal exemptions, unusually large miscellaneous deductions for items like investment advice or large deductions for state and local taxes. The 10 high-tax states where taxpayers are most likely to owe the alternative minimum tax are, in order, New York, Wisconsin, Oregon, Maryland, Massachusetts, Maine, Rhode Island, Minnesota, Connecticut and New Jersey.
From the Republicans' perspective, changing the minimum tax would drain money available for tax breaks with more political appeal proposed by the president: lower income-tax rates, repeal of the estate tax and tax reductions for married couples and families with children. Many of these elements would also largely benefit the wealthy.
Michele A. Davis, a Treasury Department spokeswoman, said the administration was willing to consider changes in the minimum tax. But she said the president and his advisers felt that the elements he proposed were more important and that everything had to fit within the limit of $1.6 trillion in tax cuts over 10 years.
Nationwide, only 1.3 percent of taxpayers had to pay the minimum tax on their returns due this week, the Treasury estimated, and almost all of them had incomes of $100,000 to $500,000. (People with incomes above that are not generally affected because their deductions and personal exemptions are stripped away by other provisions in the tax code.) 
But unless the law is changed, many more people will become subject to the tax over the next decade. The reason is that, unlike tax brackets, the standard deduction and most other parts of the tax law, the alternative minimum tax is not adjusted for inflation, and it is now based on 1986 income and deduction levels.
The Treasury estimated that by 2010, 16 percent of taxpayers would be affected by the minimum tax, including 29 percent of those with incomes of $75,000 to $100,000 in 2000 dollars.
The Bush tax plan does not mention the minimum tax, but it would magnify the problem. The analytical staff of the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that more than twice as many taxpayers will become subject to the minimum tax in 2010 as will be if no tax laws are changed. 
Most politicians would like to get rid of the minimum tax, especially when it begins to hit taxpayers who are not wealthy. But the tax raises a considerable amount of money for the government. 
The Congressional staff calculated that it would cost the Treasury $162 billion over the next decade to repeal the minimum tax if other tax laws were not changed. If the Bush plan is enacted, the repeal will cost $292 billion, the officials said. 
One of the Democrats' main arguments against the Bush tax plan is that it already cuts too deeply into revenues and that the president has underestimated how much. 
Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, plans to try to change the minimum tax when work on the tax legislation begins next month. 
Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is the committee's chairman, said that the minimum tax needed to be changed and that he would like to do something on the matter this year. Perhaps, Mr. Grassley suggested, Congress could make certain that no one with an income below, say, $100,000 would be made worse off by the new tax legislation because of the minimum tax.
But Mr. Grassley said other tax issues were more important to him. The alternative minimum tax, he said, "is certainly not one of the first four or five things on my agenda."

HEADLINE: The Summit of the Americas 

 BODY:
President Bush will make his first important appearance at an international gathering this weekend, at the Summit of the Americas in Quebec, an assemblage of 34 hemispheric heads of state. No other president entered office having emphasized the importance of ties with Latin America to the extent that Mr. Bush did on the campaign trail. His election has therefore raised expectations throughout a continent that often felt neglected by the Clinton administration. Mr. Bush's principal aim at this meeting is to reaffirm the worthy goal of achieving a Free Trade Area of the Americas by the year 2005. 
 During President Clinton's second term, the United States abdicated its global leadership role in expanding free trade. After securing the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the enunciation of the Free Trade Area concept at the first Summit of the Americas in Miami in 1994, Mr. Clinton lost his "fast track" authority from Congress to negotiate amendment-proof trade agreements, an essential precondition for any meaningful talks. Then he failed at the 1999 World Trade Organization gathering in Seattle to fashion a compromise between Democrats' desire to link trade agreements to labor and environmental standards and developing nations' resistance to such linkage. 
 It is vitally important, both for American interests and for the future of impoverished nations around the world, that President Bush now break that impasse. He needs to assign high priority to reassembling a bipartisan consensus on Capitol Hill to grant the president fast-track or "trade promotion" power. The administration has wisely signaled a willingness to incorporate basic labor and environmental standards into any trade treaty.
The Bush administration needs to proceed with a sense of urgency, lest Central and South American leaders conclude that Washington is not serious about affording their economies the same direct access to American markets and investment capital that has proven so beneficial to Mexico as a result of Nafta. Such an impression could undermine the cause of free markets and liberalization in the hemisphere and sour America's relations with Latin America, which on balance have been highly positive in recent years.
Once he obtains fast-track negotiating power, President Bush ought to conclude a deal with Chile, South America's most open economy and a country that was promised entry into Nafta back in 1993. Chile is a heartening example of how a policy of economic liberalization can lift a people's standard of living. Brazil has misgivings about opening its markets and would like to see South America negotiate as a united front, but a bilateral U.S. deal with Chile would build momentum for the Free Trade Area multilateral talks. 
On a wider front, the administration should make clear that it does not intend to pursue only a hemispheric trade agreement. A summit in Qatar later in the year will pursue the possibility of launching a new round of World Trade Organization talks. As a proponent of free trade and free markets, the United States should be willing to negotiate a reduction of trade barriers with any and all interested parties so long as fundamental labor and environmental standards are observed.
Contrary to the claims made by the anti-globalization protesters who are out in force in Quebec, trade liberalization and economic globalization offer poor nations the best opportunity for improving their standards of living. There are no models for the notion that less interdependence with the global economy is a recipe for success.

HEADLINE: Colgate-Palmolive Defies Industry Trend and Posts Solid Gain 

BYLINE:  By JULIAN E. BARNES 

 BODY:
While several consumer products companies have struggled recently with rising materials costs and slowing sales growth, the Colgate-Palmolive Company reported yesterday that its first-quarter sales and profits grew despite the sluggish economy.
 Colgate's profit increased 11.7 percent, to $267.9 million, or 44 cents a share, from $239.9 million, or 38 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales grew 2.3 percent worldwide, to $2.3 billion, and 6 percent in North America. 
 The results beat analysts' expectations by a penny, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.
So far, Colgate has avoided the problems that have plagued other household products companies. Gillette announced on Wednesday that its first-quarter earnings fell 29 percent. And Procter & Gamble said last month that it would reduce its work force through buyouts and layoffs as it struggles to cut its overhead costs, fight eroding market share and lower its prices.
Colgate's share price advanced 82 cents yesterday, to $52.57, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
During a conference call with analysts yesterday, Reuben Mark, Colgate's chief executive, suggested that the problems experienced by competitors posed an opportunity for Colgate to continue to increase its market share.
"We do pretty well in tough times," he said. "When companies are in disarray, we build share."
Colgate has recently introduced new toothpaste formulas, including Total Plus Whitening and 2 in 1 Toothpaste Plus Mouthwash, that have stolen market share from P.& G.'s Crest.
Colgate said its share of the United States toothpaste market grew to 34.8 percent for the first three months of the year, from 31.1 percent a year earlier. P.& G.'s share declined to 24.3 percent from 27 percent.
Colgate has been quick to add innovations to its toothpaste. Some competitors have scoffed at the innovations, contending they do little to help oral care, only to have to scramble to come up with their own versions when consumers embraced the new products.
Although the price of Colgate's basic toothpaste has remained steady, Mr. Mark said the company had succeeded in enticing consumers to trade up to more expensive toothpaste formulas. The company also said yesterday that it was having similar success by adding vitamin E to its hand soaps.
Such moves have enabled Colgate to avoid the missteps of other companies. P.& G. raised prices on some of its products last year, but consumers then moved to its rivals. And sales growth at both P.& G. and Gillette has slumped because of the weakness of the euro and other currencies.
Although Colgate derives only 25 percent of its sales from North America, it has a smaller presence in Europe than Gillette or P.& G.
Amy Low Chasen, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs, said Colgate's focus had served the company well, helping it to increase its market share, expand its sales and consistently reduce its costs.
"I think they have stuck to their knitting," Ms. Chasen said. "Over the two or three years when other companies have lost their way Colgate has been able to sustain excellent earnings momentum." 

CORRECTION-DATE: April 23, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about Colgate-Palmolive's first-quarter earnings misstated the decline in market share for Procter & Gamble's Crest toothpaste in the period. The share dropped to 26.3 percent from 27 percent a year earlier, not to 24.3 percent.

HEADLINE: Pressure in Congo 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "Pressure Rises on Outsiders in Congo War" (news article, April 17) describes the growing impatience of the United States with Rwanda and Uganda because they are dragging their heels about withdrawing their military occupation forces from Congo. Moreover, Congolese rebels under Rwanda's control are also delaying the peace process by blocking the deployment of United Nations peacekeeping forces to the diamond-rich city of Kisangani. 
 One way to apply pressure to Rwanda and Uganda would be to suspend the tens of millions in World Bank and European Union budgetary support dollars being disbursed to these two countries. This money from American and European taxpayers has effectively financed Rwanda's and Uganda's wars in Congo since August 1998.

HEADLINE: Anthropology's Alternative Radical 

BYLINE:  By EMILY EAKIN

 BODY:
Among students at Columbia University, Michael Taussig has a glamorous reputation. An anthropologist who specializes in South America, he has hung out with shamans and tripped on yage, a potent hallucinogen, dozens of times. He keeps an enormous rainbow-colored hammock in his campus office. And his lectures are famous for their dramatic flourishes; he once gave a talk with his head in a paper bag (a homage to a Dadaist artist). Not surprisingly, his classes are always filled to capacity. "He's like a rock star," said one graduate student in anthropology. "He's the professor that all the students think is cool." 
 Among his colleagues in anthropology, however, there is no such consensus. Mr. Taussig owes his academic reputation to a body of highly unconventional work on topics like devil worship, shamanism and state terror. Ominous and otherworldly, his subject matter is inherently provocative. Yet it is his experimental approach to ethnography, or case studies of other cultures, as well as his occasional diatribes against the work of more traditional colleagues that have made him a polarizing figure in the field. 
 Over the last several decades, as the exemplars of traditional fieldwork have been toppled from their pedestals -- the current debate over the ethics and accuracy of Napoleon A. Chagnon's work with the Yanomami Indians being only the latest example -- Mr. Taussig has been developing a radical alternative. He is the innovator and most extreme practitioner of what he calls fictocriticism and what might fairly be described as gonzo anthropology. Blending fact and fiction, ethnographic observation, archival history, literary theory and memoir, his books read more like beatnik novels than sober analyses of other cultures. 
Typical is this passage from "The Magic of the State" (Routledge, 1997), a more or less fictional ethnography of a place Mr. Taussig calls "European Elsewhere," but which bears some similarity to contemporary Venezuela: "The decay. The gloom descending. The rain dripping from the haze on the mountain where life and death ferment in the dankness of plastic everywhere, holy and unclean, garbage everywhere, rocks painted with the national colors, caves with their interiors painted with the national colors, people lying still in front of their shrines under giant trees in the stillness of the night." 
During a recent interview in his office, Mr. Taussig said the goal of fictocriticism was to "duplicate in the writing something about the culture itself." (The scholar, 60, declined to be photographed, saying he thought author photos were vain.) He said that in "The Magic of the State," the atmospheric prose was meant to capture the aura of fantasy and superstition surrounding the state: the way, for example, abstract concepts like "the economy," "the market," and "the government" are imbued with human qualities and take on a magical life force of their own. 
Reviewing the book in the journal American Anthropologist, Stephanie Kane, a professor at Indiana University, pronounced it a "remarkable achievement," teeming with "uncanny observations." But Micaela di Leonardo, a Northwestern University anthropologist, writing in The Nation, dismissed it as "a terrible book" whose style she likened to "Allen Ginsburg on a very bad day." Mr. Taussig's "contempt for scholarship leads him into lengthy absurdities," she wrote.
As Gaston Gordillo, an anthropologist and visiting scholar at the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies at Harvard University, put it: "There are people who love him to death and people who have big problems with his work. Even if I don't always agree with him, I think he's one of the most original and brightest thinkers in anthropology."
To his admirers Mr. Taussig is something of a visionary, a scholar who found a way out of the paralysis that first gripped his discipline in the mid-1980's. Under the influence of French literary theory that held sway at the time, American anthropology took what scholars refer to as a "linguistic turn." Ethnographic writing, once considered merely the means for transmitting data, came to be seen as a politically loaded act. Cultural biases, under this new thinking, were built right into the language; ethnographies did not so much represent cultures as invent them. 
Meanwhile the work of the discipline's stalwarts was scrutinized and found lacking. Margaret Mead, Colin Turnbull and Marshall Sahlins were charged with error and exaggeration. Anthropology had caught what seemed like a terminal case of self-doubt. Was there anything an ethnographer could say with certainty about another culture?
"After the crisis of representation in the 1980's, people got nervous," said Kathleen Stewart, a professor of anthropology at the University of Texas at Austin and a former student of Mr. Taussig. "Much of anthropology backed off asking basic questions about what culture is. Michael Taussig is one of the few people who was able to continue to ask those questions."
One reason was that he paid little attention to academic debates in the first place. For one thing, he never intended to become an anthropologist. Born in Australia, he studied medicine at the University of Sydney and sociology at the London School of Economics. When he went to Colombia in 1969, it was to serve as a doctor for rural Marxist guerrillas. Culture shock led him to change his mind. "Nothing was black and white," he recalled. "It wasn't a place a first-world person could just drop into." 
He began writing about what he saw instead. His first two books were more or less conventional ethnographies, albeit heavily influenced by Marxist theory. 
It wasn't until he wrote "Shamanism, Colonialism and the Wild Man" (University of Chicago Press, 1987) that Mr. Taussig found his signature message and style. While reading archival reports about the atrocities committed by early-20th-century rubber traders in the Putamayo Valley, including the maiming and murder of dozens of Indians, he had a revelation. 
"The facts were so bad, so stark, and yet I wanted to see more," he said. "I started becoming a kind of violence junkie. I wanted the material to get wilder and more violent, and I started wondering about that: What is it in me? Am I a bad person?" Alternately fascinated and repulsed, Mr. Taussig realized that his reactions were a clue to understanding the violence, which otherwise made no sense.
Under the rubber companies' rationale, torture and murder were required to keep their recalcitrant Indian workers under control, he found. Ultimately, however, as Mr. Taussig pointed out, the station managers were simply killing off their labor supply. 
Irrational, then, as well as horrifying, the terror in the Putamayo was part of what Mr. Taussig called culture's "epistemic murk." It may have been motivated by fears and fantasies about savage Indians, he concluded, but in its extremeness, it was a phenomenon that defied explanation. Instead of analyzing the violence, Mr. Taussig wrote at the beginning of his book, he wanted to present it "as something you have to try out for yourself, feeling your way deeper and deeper into the heart of darkness until you do feel what is at stake, the madness of the passion."
The result was a book both lurid and mesmerizing. Drawing on the detailed reports of witnesses and investigators as well as gruesome archival photographs, Mr. Taussig spent the first half recreating the atmosphere in which the violence took place. The second half he devoted to the healing rituals performed by the Indian shamans with whom he had studied. Perversely, he observed, the white population that once tortured and killed Indians also depended on them for magical cures. 
In short, he concluded, the relationship between the colonizers and the colonized was riddled with the kind of contradictions that only something like fictocriticism was adequate to convey. "I had this notion that the best we could be was storytellers," Mr. Taussig said. 
For the most part anthropologists were impressed. "He was trying to infect you with the ideology of terror, to give you a case of it," said Renato Rosaldo, a professor of anthropology at Stanford University. "He was talking about the world as we know it, the culture terror in Argentina and Chile and in the background the Nazi period. He was saying that people get off on terror. They get addicted to it. And most efforts to comment on it fail to account for the grip it has on us."
Implicit in Mr. Taussig's visceral take on terror, however, was an attack on his field's obsession with meaning. For anthropologists who had not gotten that message, he published a long, harshly negative review of books by two of the discipline's most respected scholars, Sidney W. Mintz and Eric R. Wolf. But that did little to diminish Mr. Taussig's reputation as a rising star. In 1988 New York University wooed him away from the University of Michigan, and in 1993 Columbia lured him uptown, hoping he would help revitalize its foundering anthropology program.
His presence proved divisive, which some say Columbia should have predicted. "There's a danger in hiring a person who is a critic of the discipline as a key scholar in your department," observed Katherine E. Hoffman, who received her Ph.D. from Columbia last year and is now a professor of anthropology at the University of Illinois in Chicago. Though many say tension in the department has lately abated -- the hiring of five new senior faculty members has helped -- Mr. Taussig's scholarly provocations have not. 
Not long ago, for instance, he recruited local artists and poets to take part in a yearlong series of performances inspired by a report on corruption in the New York City police force. 
Mr. Taussig said his latest book project, tentatively titled "My Cocaine Museum," would focus on the Pacific coast of Colombia, the world's rainiest region. Each chapter will be devoted to a different aspect of the landscape: mud, rain, heat, humidity, gold and the cocaine that has largely replaced it. "I want to give a nature a voice which is not the cliched voice of environmental science," he said. "I don't know if it will work."

HEADLINE: On Native Land, a Fear of Free Trade 

BYLINE:  By Rick Hornung; Rick Hornung, author of the forthcoming "The Word and the Wire: A Journey Through the Many Nations of Quebec," teaches at Eastern Connecticut State University.

DATELINE: HADDAM, Conn. 

 BODY:
All this week, the Mohawks of Akwesasne used provisions of the United States' oldest major international trade agreement -- the Jay Treaty of 1794 -- in reacting to America's newest trade effort, the Free Trade Area of the Americas agreement currently being negotiated, and fiercely protested, in Quebec City. As Canadian officials detained protesters flying in from North and South America, busloads trekked along New York State Route 37 to the St. Regis Mohawk Indian Reservation, or what Mohawks call The Land Where the Partridge Drums.
 This 28,000-acre stretch of islands, coves and inlets that spans the borders of Canada and the United States has its own government. Many Mohawks on both sides of the St. Lawrence River consider themselves not citizens of the United States or Canada but residents of an aboriginal nation. And the 34 nations meeting in Quebec City are not the only ones with something to say about sovereign power in the Americas. If anything, indigenous peoples may already understand the pressures of globalization better than the negotiators in Quebec. 
 From the Strait of Magellan to Hudson Strait, Inuit and Kayapo, Mundurucu and Navajo live on reserved territories that contain many billions of dollars' worth of gold, silver, metal ores, uranium, coal, timber, oil, natural gas, water, fish and wildlife. These American nations enjoy various types of constitutional and statutory sovereignty that give them -- not trade officials from Washington, Brasilia, Buenos Aires or Ottawa -- the authority to negotiate development agreements. Aboriginal nations on both continents have blocked the sort of multibillion-dollar development deals that are characteristic of the globalized economy.
The new, new microchip world without borders is colliding with the old aboriginal world of turf and tools. The Yanomami control the gold in their plush Amazonian jungles, as the Inuit and Innu control the nickel in their jagged subarctic rocks. Regardless of the agreements negotiated at the Summit of the Americas, these resources will not move without their consent -- or so native peoples hope.
The creation of a free-trade market of 800 million people exchanging $11.5 trillion worth of goods and services is, to many aboriginal nations, a step backward. The great nations around them are trading away their tariff powers and other sovereign rights in Quebec City. If Brazil and Venezuela cannot resist the demands of globalization, what chance will the Yanomami have?
At the same time, the Free Trade Area of the Americas agreement could give aboriginal nations access to more customers and higher prices for their prized resources. An aboriginal nation in Canada, for example, could sell its water rights for hydroelectric generation to California rather than British Columbia, and the Navajo could sell their uranium to Colombia.
One nonindigenous entity in Canada is already looking forward to the benefits of free trade. The province of Quebec -- at least, the separatists in the Parti Quebecois -- has come to believe that globalization would be a boon. The separatists want economic integration because they think it will strengthen political and ethnic segregation. By making Canada's sovereignty less significant, the separatists assume, globalization would make francophone Quebec more independent. To the separatists, this Free Quebec, liberated to pursue its cultural and economic destiny, would inevitably win in global competition.
Indigenous nations, by force of experience, have a dimmer view of the promise of the coming free-trade agreement. To them it looks more like exposure to a harsh northerly wind. An indigenous nation alone, facing large corporations roaming across a continental marketplace, would not count for much.
But there are many indigenous nations, and they might consider making common cause. Perhaps the indigenous people of the Americas will use their sovereign powers to create their own free-trade agreement. Such a federation would not, at least, be ignored the next time the other Americans get together to talk about trade.

LITHUANIA: FEWER HEADS COUNTED
Lithuania's population has shrunk by 5 percent since 1989, to 3,496,000, according to preliminary results of a census. Demographers attribute the decline to the difficult economic conditions and health problems experienced by people in former Soviet republics. The populations of Lithuania's Baltic neighbors, Estonia and Latvia, have dropped by 13 percent and 11 percent since 1989.(Agence France-Presse)

FRANCE: WORLD WAR I THREAT EASES
Thousands of people evacuated last week from villages near a store of World War I munitions, including mustard gas, have been allowed to begin returning home. About 50 tons of the most dangerous shells were removed from the depot in Vimy by bomb disposal teams. Another 100 tons remain, but engineers have reinforced the storage area with a gravel wall.

Miguel Rincon, a top leader of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, suggested that the main prosecution witness had lied about Ms. Berenson's activities to hide his own involvement in terrorism.

MEXICO: NEW VIOLENCE IN CHIAPAS
Masked gunmen using assault rifles killed eight Indian farmers and wounded three, officials in Chiapas said. The victims of the attack on Thursday were members of a peasant group allied with the former ruling party and were killed outside Venustiano Carranza by a group of leftist farmers with whom they had political and land disputes, officials said.

CONGO: PEACEKEEPERS MOVE IN
United Nations peacekeepers who had been prevented from entering Kisangani last weekend reached it after an agreement between Rwanda-backed rebels and the United Nations. The arrival of 123 Moroccan soldiers is the first time peacekeepers have been on territory held by rebels and their Rwandan and Ugandan backers, who have been obstructing a recent cease-fire.

PERSON: Merton Edward Davies 

HEADLINE: Merton Davies, 83, Mapper Of Orbs and a Satellite Pioneer 

BYLINE:  By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Merton Edward Davies, a celestial mapmaker and a pioneer in spy satellite technology, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. A resident of nearby Pacific Palisades, he was 83.
 Mr. Davies went to work for the Rand Corporation in 1947 and remained there until his death. He became one of the world's foremost experts in using deep-space photographs to map the planets, a process known as planetary photogrammetry. His career spanned from the earliest orbiter missions to the Moon to marathon voyages to Mars, Venus, Mercury and the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn. 
 He performed top-secret work for the Air Force intelligence division in the early 1960's. But he turned increasingly from cold war reconnaissance to the scientific projects of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. For nearly 40 years he was on NASA's imaging teams for unmanned space missions like Mariner, Voyager and Galileo.
The maps that he and his colleagues compiled from early missions became guides for future generations of space explorers. In the case of Mars, for instance, the Rand team got its close-up with the Mariner 9 space probe in late 1971.
To draw maps, they worked with multiple photographs of all areas of the planet, using craters as reference points whose longitude and latitude were then plotted.
Peering through magnifying glasses, Mr. Davies and his associates counted pixels of the pictures until they agreed on where the center of a crater lay and what its precise coordinates were. The results of the tedious undertaking were then fed to a mosaic team and eventually rendered a true map of the entire planet.
Merton Davies was born in St. Paul. He graduated from Stanford University in 1937 and briefly taught mathematics at the University of Nevada. In World War II, he joined Douglas Aircraft in California, doing the mathematics required for lofting fighter planes.
At Rand, he began in the missiles division studying designs for rockets like the German V-2 and for satellites. His satellite work included vehicle models, space cameras and image interpretation.
Among his projects were reconnaissance satellites and satellite photographic systems for the Corona program, the first successful spy satellite. By 1958 he reported how to take pictures of the Moon from a spin-stabilized spacecraft. In 1964 he received a patent for a spin-pan camera that took panoramic pictures from such spacecraft.
Mr. Davies is survived by his wife of 55 years, Louise Darling Davies; a daughter, Deidra L. Stauff of Pacific Palisades; two sons, Albert K., of Santa Rosa, Calif., and M. Randel, of Calabasas, Calif.; a sister, Joyce Dresia of Novato, Calif.; nine grandchildren; and one great-grandson.
Mr. Davis wrote three books, "The View From Space" (1971), urging the use of space imagery to monitor arms agreements; "Atlas of Mercury" (1978); and "Rand's Role in the Evolution of Balloon and Satellite Observations Systems and Related U.S. Space Technology" (1988).
"Mert has single-handedly observed more of the solar system than any other human," said Torrence Johnson, project scientist of Project Galileo.

HEADLINE: Incentives Offer On Ford Explorer 

 BODY:
The completely redesigned 2002 Ford Explorer has been on sale only a month, and Ford Motor is already offering discounted lease rates and rebates for customers who own an earlier Explorer model.
 Industry analysts say that offering discounts to current owners of the same make of vehicle is part of Ford's standard approach to introducing new models. 
 It was done on the most recent redesigns of the Taurus sedan and the Windstar minivan -- two models not burdened by the Explorer's tie to the Firestone tire recall last autumn, said James Hall, an analyst at AutoPacific, a market research firm based in Santa Ana, Calif. "They like to launch hard," he noted.
Ford is offering $750 discounts for current Explorer owners, together with discounted interest rates of 3 percent on 24-month leases and 7 percent on 36-month leases. It offers even lower rates in some regional markets.
The deals were reported yesterday by BlueOvalNews.com, an Internet site specializing in Ford news.

HEADLINE: Caracas Journal; 
A Veteran Cop on a Tough New Beat

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, April 20 

 BODY:
When William J. Bratton walked into police headquarters here this week, Henry Rivas, the director of the Caracas Metropolitan Police, was waiting at the door for him. In a nearby conference room, division heads and precinct chiefs of the 8,000-member force had assembled for a strategy session with the former New York City police commissioner.
 "Welcome to your police," Mr. Rivas said to Mr. Bratton. "We have even got a uniform for you." 
 Going along with the joke, Mr. Bratton smiled and raised his right hand. "I'm ready to take my oath," he replied.
As New York's top cop from 1994 to 1996, Mr. Bratton presided over a sharp drop in homicides and other serious crimes that earned him a national reputation. He has come here to take on what may be an even more daunting challenge: helping the local government apply his crime-busting techniques to this sprawling and violent capital.
"Not only do we have poverty and unemployment, but we must also contend with corruption, weakness of the rule of law, a lack of resources and a culture of impunity," said Ivan Simonovis, the recently appointed municipal secretary of public security here. "That creates an ideal climate for the growth of crime."
Indeed, crime here has been on a steady rise for the past 15 years, with the number of reported incidents leaping 30 percent just in the past two years.
Public opinion polls consistently list "lack of security" as the top concern throughout this nation of 24 million people. 
"I thought I'd seen it all" during 30 years of police work, Mr. Bratton said as he, accompanied by Spanish-language interpreters, visited police stations, talked with civic, business and political leaders and met with the chiefs of the city's six separate police forces to prepare an anti-crime offensive. "But the public safety issues here are incredible."
What local authorities are calling the Bratton Plan has been heralded as the solution to that crisis, and so Mr. Bratton is regarded here as both a savior and a celebrity. 
At a police graduation ceremony that he attended on Wednesday, the police band struck up "New York, New York" when he arrived, residents greeted him by waving banners bearing his name and one especially grateful man, Antonio Belandria, even rushed up to kiss his hand.
"He is the Supercop, so we are confident that he will be able to help us," said Felipe Eduardo Manriquez, 63, a government employee, as he watched the proceedings. "Crime is out of control: I've been robbed five times, there is no police presence in the neighborhood where I live, and the criminals no longer have fear of anyone."
Even before Mr. Bratton was brought on board last month, local authorities were making efforts to restore flagging public confidence and strengthen the force. More than 4,000 new police officers are to be hired and trained this year and next, for instance; 361 officers have been dismissed for corruption; and starting salaries have been more than doubled, to $700 a month, in an effort to recruit better-educated officers and make corruption less tempting.
But the mayor of Caracas, Alfredo Pena, said that visits to New York had made him eager to have Mr. Bratton introduce innovations like community policing, computerized tabulation of crime statistics, standardized complaint forms and business improvement districts here. "These are systems to fight crime that are not unique but can be applied in many places," he said.
Mr. Bratton, though, has been careful to damp expectations of any sort of a miraculous turnaround. 
In an interview before he returned to New York on Thursday, he noted that Caracas's six police forces have a combined strength of only 11,000 to keep order in a city of five million people, compared with about 40,000 police officers for New York City, which has about eight million residents. The police here are also burdened with weak antinarcotics, internal affairs and investigative divisions, all of which he said need to be reinforced and coordinated. 
"The growth of this city has far outstripped that of its police," Mr. Bratton said. "They admit they have a problem, and they want to take steps, so at least the journey back has begun. There is potential here, but the reality is that they are facing a real crisis."
In addition, Venezuela's political climate is highly charged these days, making Mr. Bratton's presence controversial in some quarters. President Hugo Chavez is a left-wing nationalist who has been strengthening ties with Cuba, China, Iraq and Libya. At the same time, he has been distancing himself from the United States by limiting cooperation in joint counternarcotics efforts and withdrawing from regional military exercises.
In its annual human rights report this year the State Department said that "excessive use of deadly force by police and security forces was a serious problem" here, estimating that at least 2,000 suspected criminals were killed by the Venezuelan police last year. 
Mr. Chavez and his government quickly responded by telling Washington to mind its own business. "How many people died in the United States in the year 2000 as a result of human rights abuses and executions?" Mr. Chavez said in a speech.
Foreign Minister Luis Davila, who was minister of internal affairs and justice during the period covered by the report, described Mr. Bratton's hiring as unnecessary. "Venezuela rejects any kind of outside interference in its internal affairs," he said.
Mayor Pena is also a member of Mr. Chavez's governing Patriotic Pole coalition, but he minimized official resentment of his decision to hire a foreign adviser. 
"Since drug traffickers and organized-crime groups recognize no boundaries in a globalized world, the nations of the world must unite to fight them," he said. "So we must look for help wherever we can, and bring in the people who have shown that they know how to deliver results."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: That Secure Feeling Of a Printed Document; 
The Paperless Office? Not by a Long Shot

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: WINDSOR, Quebec 

 BODY:
Something happened on the way to the paperless office. Instead of shrinking, paper sales ballooned. And the biggest beneficiary was Canada, the world's largest exporter of office printing paper, which more than doubled its exports in the last 15 years -- the height of the computer revolution.
 In yet another case of the old economy's bouncing back with a vengeance, paper companies around here are riding what may be the biggest printing boom in history. The computer age has produced a golden age of paper, putting aside 1980's predictions that new paper mills would one day be as unnecessary as new power plants. 
 "People said paper would shrink with the computer -- just the opposite is happening," said Pierre Trudel, vice president of the Domtar Inc. mill here, one of the world's most modern. "Office paper is the fastest-growing segment. People print out everything they see -- Web sites, e-mail." 
A few steps from his office, acres of white paper race onto rolls at 75 miles an hour, then fly through a gantlet of sheeters and slitters, emerging at the rate of 53,000 sheets, or 106 packaged reams, a minute. To supply a mill that works 365 days a year, 11 robots work nearby, sorting and shuttling four-ton paper rolls in a ghostly eight-story warehouse.
Hewlett-Packard, the printer manufacturer, forecasts that North American laser printers will spew out 1.2 trillion sheets this year -- a jump of more than 50 percent in five years. Fax machines, photocopiers and other devices add to that.
With Americans unable to stop clicking their print icons, Canada's paper mills ran at 94 percent of capacity last year, exporting a record 31.5 million tons of white paper, largely to the United States. Printing and writing papers, the fastest-growing segment of paper exports to the United States, grew 14 percent in 2000.
"Just about every innovation in the digital revolution was supposed to cut out more paper," reads the year 2000 annual review of the Forest Products Association of Canada, an industry group based in Montreal. "Precisely the opposite continues to happen. The 200-million-plus personal printers sold since 1998 need paper. Sales of inkjet specialty printers designed to print digital photographs will jump from 2.1 million in 1999 to 6.3 million in 2003."
During the 1990's, the number of laser printers in the United States increased twelvefold and the number of fax machines increased 22-fold, according to Dataquest, a research company in San Jose, Calif., owned by the Gartner Group.
And new paper-hungry appliances are coming. Hewlett-Packard, for instance, has a new interactive television printer that it has styled to complement living room decors.
To feed all of those devices, analysts forecast that office-paper consumption would increase by at least another 50 percent over the next 10 to 15 years, the Forest Products Association's chairman, David L. Emerson, recently wrote to his members.
Paper industry experts gathered for PaperWeek, the industry's recent conference in Montreal, said that futurists, like Alvin Toffler, had underestimated the resilience of paper and people's attachment to the 2,000-year-old product.
E-mail, for example, often ends up on paper. Research indicates that people tend to print out e-mail messages that are over half a page in length. Offices that extend e-mail to workers see paper consumption increase about 40 percent, according to the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.
"The paperless office never did develop out of the silicon revolution of the 1960's, 1970's, 1980's or 1990's," said a Morgan Stanley report that circulated in the halls of PaperWeek. "The proliferation of high-speed photocopiers, personal computer printers and plain-paper copiers has helped keep offices flooded with paper."
Manufacturers of filing cabinets also report no slump as 21st-century office workers routinely print out paper backups, apparently fearing the loss of electronic files to computer viruses or power failures.
"There are a lot of paper hoarders, people who want the security net of the paper copy," said Richard Descarries, spokesman for the Forest Products Association.
In addition to reliability, paper offers portability, ease of reading and better retention. Some surveys indicate that people retain 30 percent more of what they read on paper than on computer screens. People generally find that paper documents are easier to annotate and to compare. Ink on paper is hard to beat for resolution -- the clarity of printed words. Laser-jet-printed pages commonly have resolutions around 600 dots an inch, or about six times the clarity of computer screens.
"When in doubt, print it out," chortled Frank A. Dottori, president of Tembec, a Montreal-based paper and forest products company. "There always will be new uses for paper."
But, he warned: "The paper industry should not be complacent. In the business area, the use of paper will decline. When I started in business there were 13 copies of invoices; now there is none of that."
But while businesses phase out paper invoices, e-commerce has led to new needs for paper, notably cardboard boxes that Amazon.com and other retailers use to ship goods ordered over the Internet.
"Before we would produce one box for 144 books, now we produce 144 boxes for 144 books," said Lise Lachapelle, president of the Canadian paper association. "The billings, the magazines, the catalogs, the packaging that you receive with e-orders -- all that is paper."
Despite the boom in sales, Canada's highly capital-intensive pulp and paper industry recorded only $1.7 billion in profit last year. While that was more than triple the industry's 1999 profits of $500 million, Canadian pulp and paper companies still posted only a thin 9 percent annual return on invested capital last year.
The paper makers' party is also damped a bit by the development of electronic books and papers. In laboratories, research scientists deride books as "dead trees bound with cow hide," and remain determined to make future offices "pulp-free zones." They say it is a matter of time before screens catch up with printed pages.
Next year, the Microsoft Corporation's eBook Group plans to market its Tablet PC for about $3,500. Thin, lightweight, with a long-life battery and a wireless Internet connection, this reading machine is to be loaded with the Microsoft ClearType software, offering resolution four times that of today's computer screens.
In 2003, electronic newspapers -- or portable, Internet-connected, high-resolution reading devices -- are expected to be marketed by two companies, Gyricon Media, a Xerox subsidiary, and the E Ink Corporation, a spinoff of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
"You are safe for a decade," Jean Lanoix, a Montreal computer expert, lectured the paper industry experts at PaperWeek. "We are moving to a less-paper office."
He predicted that future generations of North Americans would print out fewer documents, and would read more electronic books and newspapers.
But, so far, in just the way that motion pictures never killed live theater and television did not extirpate radio, Web sites are not replacing newspapers.
At the peak of the Internet boom in the late 1990's several consultants predicted that the newsprint market would soon shrink as millions of Americans turned to the Web for news.
In fact, during the Internet go-go years, American consumption of newsprint grew about 10 percent, to 12 million tons last year from 10.9 million tons in 1996. Instead of shrinking, Canadian newsprint exports to the United States expanded last year by almost 6 percent. Worldwide, newsprint demand grew last year by 3 percent.
The adoption of electronic replacements of paper "will be more demographically driven than technologically driven; young people will adopt faster," said Francois Perron, a paper and forest products analyst here for Merrill Lynch Canada. "It is a very real concern for the paper industry. But at the same time, in other parts of the world, literacy rates are rising. Will they skip paper? I doubt that."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Stocks Droop But End Week Up Sharply

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
The stock market pulled back yesterday from the huge rally that followed the Federal Reserve's unexpected interest rate cut on Wednesday, but the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index still had its best two-week gain ever.
 Signs that first-quarter corporate earnings would not substantially disappoint Wall Street and that an economic recovery was foreseeable, though not imminent, left investors and market analysts confident. 
 "The economy has not bottomed, but the stock market has bottomed," said Jeffrey S. Van Harte, vice president of Transamerica Investment Management.
"How long do I have to wait for business to come back?" Mr. Van Harte said. "That could be an industry-by-industry or company-by-company call." 
The Nasdaq fell 18.73 points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 2,163.41; it was up 10.3 percent for the week but is down 12.4 percent so far this year.
For the Nasdaq, however, the last two weeks were spectacular. In that period, which included a trading holiday on Good Friday, April 13, the Nasdaq was up 25.7 percent, surpassing the previous best two-week gain of 20.9 percent, recorded on June 9 of last year, when the index closed at 3,874.84.
The Dow Jones industrial average, meanwhile, fell 113.86 points, or 1.1 percent yesterday, to 10,579.85. The Dow, which has fallen 1.92 percent so far this year, closed the week up 4.5 percent.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 10.72 points, or 0.9 percent yesterday, to close at 1,242.98. That index was down 5.85 percent for the year and up 5 percent for the week.
Analysts said yesterday's retreat was not surprising. Earlier in the week, "the market finally got some steam," said Richard McCabe, chief market analyst for Merrill Lynch. "There's a little pause going on today. It's only natural."
Bond prices were mixed yesterday as the market tried to recover from a sell-off on Thursday.
The 10-year Treasury note rose 2/32, to a price of 97 26/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.29 percent from 5.30 percent on Thursday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond dipped 1/32, to 94 1/32. The bond's yield was unchanged at 5.80 percent.
"Investors moved into higher-yielding corporate debt, which they had shunned at the end of last year," said Gemma Wright, director of market strategy at Barclays Capital in New York. Combined with rising stock prices, the trend seemed to indicate that investors "thought that the Fed was reinflating the economy."
The stock market's first sign of strength this week appeared on Tuesday, after a dismal financial forecast from Cisco Systems failed to shake investors. Then, Intel and Texas Instruments reported financial results that exceeded Wall Street's estimates.
As the markets began to rise on Wednesday in reaction to those reports, the Federal Reserve cut its target for the federal funds rate, which banks charge one another for overnight loans, to 4.5 percent from 5 percent.
Investors charged into the market, giving the Nasdaq its fourth-largest percentage gain and its busiest day ever.
Yesterday, however, stock prices moved lower, despite a surprisingly positive report by Microsoft that its profits and revenue exceeded analysts' expectations. That stock held on to some of the gains that it had made in after-hours trading on Thursday, and it was the Dow's best buoy at times. But optimism surrounding Microsoft did not spread much. The stock closed up 98 cents, at $69.
Other companies reporting financial results received a mixed reception yesterday.
Boeing, which exceeded Wall Street's expectations with a report that profits had nearly tripled from a year earlier when its workers were striking, gained $1.07, to $61.70.
Merck announced profits that met expectations but also warned that its earnings-per-share growth rates in the remaining three quarters would not match the 13 percent rise in the first period. Shares of the drug company fell $4.66, to $73.61.
And Sun Microsystems, which reported late Thursday that net income slid 73 percent as the company missed sales targets, fell $1, to $19.71.
Market analysts said investors were now waiting for the Fed's interest rate cuts to show some results in reviving the economy and corporate profits.
The Fed's action, in the view of several analysts, was merely a catalyst for a strong rise in stock prices that were badly battered in late March and early April.
As investors look forward, "the thing now is anticipation of more cutting by the Fed," Mr. McCabe of Merrill Lynch said, adding, "the worries may start in May about the second-quarter earnings results."

HEADLINE: Confusion Ensued After Census Report on Two-Parent Families 

BYLINE:  By TAMAR LEWIN 

 BODY:
Last week, the Census Bureau heralded the return of two-parent "traditional" families -- glad tidings that were trumpeted on front pages and newscasts nationwide. 
 The only problem with the rebound of two-parent families, experts say, is that it is just not so. 
"I wish it were true," said David Blankenhorn, president of the Institute for American Values. "But it's a colossal blunder. You had 280 million Americans being told by hundreds of news outlets that the tide has turned, that there's been a major turnaround in family fragmentation. But there's no evidence of that. The issue that's on people's minds, the important issue, is how many children live with both their parents. And the Census Bureau concedes that that number hasn't changed." 
The census report, released on April 13, found that the proportion of children younger than 18 living "in a traditional nuclear family" with their biological parents had risen to 56 percent in 1996 from 51 percent five years earlier. 
But what the Census Bureau calls a traditional nuclear family is a household made up of a married mother and father living with their biological children -- and no one else. 
The increase in those households probably reflects a decrease in another kind of household that many experts see as just as traditional: married couples and their children, who live with someone else, like a grandmother, niece or boarder. That kind of household declined as the economy improved and there was less need to live with extended-family members.
Bottom line, the overall proportion of children living with their married biological parents has remained essentially unchanged, about 62 percent, throughout the early and mid-1990's, said Jason Fields, the Census Bureau family demographer who wrote the report, "Living Arrangements of Children: 1996." 
"I was a little distressed when I saw the stories," Mr. Fields said. "I tried to be as clear as I could talking to reporters and to describe the complexities, but for the most part, they wrote the story they wanted to." 
The first sentence of the press release did seem to support the idea of an increase in two-parent families, describing an increase in the share of children "living in a traditional nuclear family with their biological mother and father." 
Small wonder, then, that many news reports said that a larger share of children were living with both biological parents. (As it happened, The New York Times did not publish an article on the study.)
Mr. Fields, who did not write the press release, agreed that it would have been a good thing to elaborate further in that first sentence. 
The census report described other changes in the family that Mr. Fields said were perhaps more interesting. 
"We found that about half the children living with cohabiting parents are living with both their biological parents," he said. "What we saw, and what we tried to communicate, was the enormous diversity in family structure."
But what was communicated to the public, family experts said, was a flawed view of family structure. 
"When every reporter gets it wrong, I think you can conclude that the Census Bureau didn't make itself very clear," Mr. Blankenhorn said. "I think misinformation from such a trusted agency, on such an important issue, causes real harm. We've been hearing for years about the weakening of the family, and that's a big issue, not a technical question like whether the family's letting grandpa or a boarder live with them."

HEADLINE: Federal Judge Halts Opening Of Slag Plant 

 BODY:
A federal judge has blocked the opening of a cement additive plant in a poor black neighborhood in Camden, N.J., a ruling that legal experts said was the first time an environmental agency that issues permits had been found in violation of civil rights law.
 The decision, a preliminary injunction issued Thursday by Judge Stephen M. Orlofsky of United States District Court in Camden, found that the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection violated permitting rules established under Title VI of the federal Civil Rights Act. 
 The department issued the permit, dated Oct. 31, after finding that the plant would not exceed air pollution limits established by the federal Environmental Protection Agency, but the judge ordered it to conduct a broader review based on E.P.A. guidelines that call for incorporating the heavily industrialized neighborhood's racial and ethnic makeup, existing pollution sources and potential cumulative health effects from the plant.
He ordered that the department complete the review within 30 days, and that the plant, which was built by the St. Lawrence Cement Group of Montreal at a cost of $50 million, not open at least until the more thorough review is complete. 
Judge Orlofsky wrote that the plaintiffs had "established a prima facie case of disparate impact discrimination based on race and national origin in violation of the E.P.A.'s regulations."
The suit was filed by Olga Pomar of Camden Regional Legal Services, with help from the Public Interest Law Center of Philadelphia and the Center on Race, Poverty and the Environment in San Francisco, on behalf of 10 residents of the South Waterfront neighborhood of Camden who call themselves South Camden Citizens in Action.
Spokesmen for the Department of Environmental Protection and the state attorney general's office said that officials had not decided whether to appeal, but St. Lawrence Cement issued a statement indicating that it would.
"We are confident in our investment and proud of the integrity with which our company submitted to extensive environmental review, engaged in substantial outreach and responded to community concerns," Patrick Doberge, the president of St. Lawrence, said in the statement.
Legal experts said the decision was a milestone that would force all states to do more than just gauge whether technical emissions standards were met when issuing permits. 
"I think if this decision is upheld on appeal it will be the most important environmental justice case ever decided, by a wide margin," said Michael B. Gerrard, an adjunct professor at Columbia University School of Law and author of "The Law of Environmental Justice," published in 1999 by the American Bar Association. Officials at the state and federal environmental agencies said they were unaware of any similar rulings.
The decision was a potential blow to the environmental record of Christie Whitman, now the administrator of the federal Environmental Protection Agency. She was governor when the permit was issued. 
Barbara Pfeiffer, one of the plaintiffs, said the group wanted the plant to remain unopened indefinitely. "We want it to be a monument to the folly of Governor Whitman," she said.
Mrs. Whitman has not commented on the decision and could not be reached yesterday, said Mary Helen Cervantes, an E.P.A. spokeswoman.
Some in the neighborhood welcomed the plant, which would employ 15 people. The Rev. Al Stewart, a director of the Waterfront South Neighborhood Partnership, said that the community needed economic activity. "We're going to need private dollars; the city can't do it, the state can't do it, and the feds can't do it," he said.
The 14-acre plant site, where slag would be ground down and shipped out as an additive to cement, is leased from the South Jersey Port Corporation, a state agency, under a 45-year deal estimated to be worth $1.8 million a year.
But part of the suit's argument was that the area was already overburdened by industry. Waterfront South has, among other businesses, an incinerator, a power plant, a sewage treatment plant, a scrap metal yard and two Environmental Superfund sites. One of the plaintiffs, Phyllis Holmes, said she was worried that her asthma would be aggravated by emissions from the plant.
Ms. Holmes, 57, said hers was the first black family to move into the neighborhood in 1968, before much of the industry moved in. "I started realizing that when black and Hispanic families started moving in here that things were being put here that ordinarily wouldn't be put here."

HEADLINE: Desperate for Prison Guards, Some States Even Rob Cradles 

BYLINE:  By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: LANSING, Kan. 

 BODY:
Donald Culbertson's face betrays the untamed skin of a teenager, and his uniform practically swims on his gangly frame. His buzz haircut does nothing to disguise the fact that he is not long out of high school, and his way of blowing off steam after work is to play video games.
 There can be lot of steam to blow off because Mr. Culbertson is a corrections officer at the state prison here in Lansing, hired three months ago at the age of 19 to oversee murderers, rapists and other medium- and maximum-security prisoners. 
 Kansas hired Mr. Culbertson and others his age this year as part of a desperate effort to fill vacancies at the prison by lowering the minimum age of corrections officers to 19 from 21. 
The situation in Kansas is hardly unique. Low salaries in a competitive economy, an explosion of prison building and a tougher, more violent class of inmate have all contributed to a severe shortage of guards in prisons around the country. Unable to find enough people willing to work as corrections officers and having even more trouble convincing those who do to stay, prison officials across the United States are unleashing a barrage of recruiting techniques.
"Every state is really being affected in one way or another," said George Camp, co-president of the Criminal Justice Institute, an independent group that studies prisons. "In some jurisdictions it is a matter of wages; in other jurisdictions it's simply the matter of the lack of potential workers in close proximity to the institutions."
Another deterrent is that inmates are likelier to be serving long mandatory sentences that offer no incentive for good behavior and are more likely to be mentally ill and have drug problems, corrections officials say. 
"If prisons were to honestly advertise the job," Mr. Camp said, "they might say: 'Come to work with us. Have feces thrown at you. Be verbally abused every day.' People don't advertise the job that way, but that often is what they have to deal with."
Staff turnover rates have risen steadily in recent years, with several states losing more people a year than they are able to hire. An average of 16 percent of officers left in 1999, up from 9.6 percent in 1991, according to the Corrections Yearbook, published by the Criminal Justice Institute. In some states the number is much higher: Arkansas lost 42 percent. 
Turnover is especially high among new staff. In Oklahoma, which is considering lowering its minimum age to 18 from 21, 57 percent of last year's recruits have already quit, officials say. And in Alabama, which is short 412 corrections officers, even after lowering its minimum age to 20 from 21, John Hamm, a corrections department spokesman, estimated that last year 180 officers were hired, but 240 quit.
In some states, the problem is so serious that it has contributed to prison breaks or attacks on staff. Mr. Hamm said the escape in January of six inmates from a prison near Birmingham was the result of having 41 officers instead of 58, and leaving three of four towers unmanned.
In Arizona, corrections officials claimed that short staffing contributed to a November assault of a nurse by six inmates in a Phoenix prison. 
In Texas, which is down nearly 2,600 officers from the 26,000 it needs, twice as many down as it was three years ago, Glen Castlebury, a corrections department spokesman, said a shortage of guards has meant that "shakedown searches" of cellblocks are not done as often or as thoroughly as necessary. 
And it was staffing problems at Lansing that contributed to the 1998 rape by an inmate of an officer who was alone in a three-person post, said the warden, David McKune. A state audit followed the rape, underscoring staffing problems and getting officers a salary increase. 
In some states, new prisons are being mothballed for lack of guards. Arizona has delayed opening 1,150 beds at its complex in Lewis, and Wyoming may not be able to open a high-security prison in Rawlins.
To attract guards, states are turning to a multitude of strategies, some never tried before. Some are trying to lower the minimum age to as low as 18. While some states already have policies permitting teenage prison guards, they say they hire few. Some corrections officers and experts question whether teenagers have the maturity to be guards. 
"You'd be hard pressed to find much support in the community for hiring 19-year-olds," said Kenny Wilk, a Kansas state representative from Lansing. "It's just a maturity question." 
Mr. McKune, Lansing's warden, counters that 18-year-olds can serve in the military and that "some of the 19- and 20-year-olds I know are more mature than 40- and 45-year-olds I know."
So far, he said, one 19-year-old has been fired, before he even got out of training, because he was "mouthing off and not wearing the uniform right."
Mr. Culbertson, the first 19-year-old hired, has had mixed reviews for his performance but has been improving, senior officers said. He got a talking to for being free with his language over a prison radio. 
Lt. Leslie Wagers, assigned to be Mr. Culbertson's mentor, said: "He has a lot of eyes on him and every little mistake he makes, I'm going to learn about it. They say, 'Well, if he would do this, it would be easier.' Or, 'He doesn't seem to be listening,' or, 'He just stares at me.' But if he doesn't make mistakes, how's he going to learn?" There are also less controversial recruiting techniques. Some prisons are offering signing bonuses to recruits or giving bonuses or savings bonds to staff members who manage to recruit guards. Some are advertising on television, taking to the Internet or using direct-mail blitzes. And many are swooping down on factory or mine closings and peppering military bases with help-wanted posters.
"My God," said Mr. Castlebury of Texas's advertising campaign. "I don't think you can move anywhere in Texas without seeing our signs." 
Still others offer free room and board, or free transportation, to officers who live far away.
About two years ago, Kentucky feared it might have to call in the National Guard to fill vacancies in the Kentucky State Reformatory near Louisville. Instead, the state instituted a three-day workweek, complete with room and board, to attract people from distant rural communities. Now, said the warden, Bill Seabold, two-thirds of the employees work three 13-hour shifts, with many traveling back to faraway hometowns on their four days off.
States like Texas are cobbling together a work force of retired corrections officers, college students or police officers to work part time. The state also started paying overtime two years ago, giving officers the opportunity to augment salaries that top out at $28,380 after four years.
As they have for years, corrections departments and officers unions are pushing for pay raises for a job whose starting salary averages $23,000 a year nationally. But at a time when many state budgets are being cut, salary increases, never particularly popular for a profession that many voters rarely come in contact with, are a tougher sell.
In Oklahoma, where nearly one-fifth of the positions are empty and overtime pay is skyrocketing, the starting salary is $16,742 a year, below poverty level for a family of four and, said Jerry Massie, a corrections department spokesman, less than "you can make as a convenience store clerk in Oklahoma City." 
The problem is not as acute in Northeastern states because unions are strong and salaries tend to be more competitive. But experts say they have related problems. 
New Jersey, wrestling with vacancies and high overtime in recent years, replaced some guards in prison towers with a system of truck patrols and electronic fencing. In New York, the number of nonviolent inmates is decreasing so the state is actually cutting jobs in some medium-security prisons upstate.
Often, staff shortages are not spread evenly in a state. Some states have shortages only in new prisons built in rural areas where the labor pool is thin, while others have shortages in metropolitan areas, where other jobs pay better and are safer. 
Aside from the cost in dollars, there is the cost to overburdened officers, exhausted from long hours and the stress of having to deal with a revolving door of inexperienced cadets. Officers say they become less attentive and more forgetful in these situations, and more afraid that inmates will take advantage of the fact that they are stretched too thin. 
"Put together the shortage of officers, the size of the system, the attrition rate and new officers coming on line almost all of the time, and you have a dynamite keg," said Gerald McEntee, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. "You have a real threat in terms of the security of state prisons."
Shortages also plague some federal and county prisons, Mr. McEntee said, but they tend to pay better. That is the case in the Lansing area, where, in nearby Leavenworth, the federal penitentiary, a private detention center and even the county jail pay starting salaries as much as $8,000 higher than the $21,944 that Lansing corrections officers get. 
Staffing shortages at the Lansing prison, a turreted limestone edifice, became so serious that 61 out of 530 positions were vacant as of Dec. 31, and officers were working 80-hour weeks. The state began offering $500 recruiting and signing bonuses, and legislators are considering an increase in starting pay of about $750. 
These measures, along with a television commercial and the softening economy, have all helped, Mr. McKune said. And, since January, Lansing has hired nine 19- and 20-year-olds. Mr. Culbertson, whose parents work at the federal prison in Leavenworth and whose uncle works at Lansing, is one of them. He is quite happy with his new job. 
"Good benefits," Mr. Culbertson said. "Free boots. And it's a job not anybody could do. You need the mentality to put up with all the stuff you go through every day."
Stuff like the inmate who hooted at him the other day as he walked by. And inmates who harp on the low pay officers get and try to bribe them to smuggle in drugs and other forbidden items.
"I tell them it's about the best job I've ever had," said Mr. Culbertson, who worked as a welder when he finished high school. "This is the best pay I've gotten. Being 19, you don't really get cut a whole lot of breaks. A lot of places won't hire you until you're 21."

HEADLINE: Boeing Quarterly Earnings Nearly Triple 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, April 20 

 BODY:
Buoyed by strong airplane deliveries and a substantial tax break, Boeing said today that first-quarter earnings nearly tripled from the period a year earlier when it was hurt by a strike.
 The results easily beat Wall Street expectations. 
 Boeing earned $1.24 billion, or $1.45 a share, in the first quarter compared with $418 million, or 48 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. The latest results included a one-time tax benefit of $475 million. 
Without the tax benefit, Boeing earned $762 million, or 89 cents a share.
Analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call were expecting earnings of 80 cents a share excluding the tax benefit.
Shares in Boeing rose $1.07, to $61.70.
First-quarter revenue was $13.3 billion, up from $9.9 billion a year earlier when engineers and technicians went on strike.
In a conference call, Mike Sears, Boeing's chief financial officer, said the strike made last year's performance especially weak.
He said the tax benefit, which came from a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service based on earnings from the late 1980's and early 1990's, also gave earnings an unusual one-time lift.
In core operations, Boeing benefited from strong sales, especially in commercial airplanes. Total commercial airplane revenue was $8.4 billion, up 63 percent from the corresponding period last year. The company delivered 122 jets during the period, compared with 75 in the first quarter of 2000.
Excluding the tax benefit, net earnings for commercial airplanes were $195 million, up from $103 million in the period a year earlier.
Paul Nisbet, an analyst with JSA Research Inc. in Providence, R.I., said the company was able to benefit even in an economic slowdown because of its backlog of airplane orders, which number around 1,600. Phil Condit, Boeing chairman and chief executive, would not comment on whether tensions between the United States and China would affect Boeing's business in China this fiscal year.
But he did acknowledge that "we're a pretty high-visibility player, and that always puts us on the front line."
China's airlines are major buyers of Boeing jets.
Boeing's space and communications division recorded net earnings before the tax benefit of $123 million, compared with $124 million a year earlier. Revenue was $2.2 billion, up from $1.7 billion, as Boeing completed the acquisition of Hughes's space and communications business.
The company had a bigger drop in military aircraft and missile systems earnings, which fell to $53 million from $61 million a year earlier, excluding one-time costs. The company said it was hurt by fewer deliveries of its F-15 and F/A-18 fighter jets and C-17 military transports.
The company stunned its hometown of Seattle last month when it announced that it would be moving its corporate headquarters to Dallas-Fort Worth, Chicago or Denver.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Aides Considering Capital-Gains Tax Rate Cut 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 20 

 BODY:
With the Senate in recess the last two weeks, the staffs of Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi and other Republican leaders have been working on a plan for a big cut in the capital-gains tax this year to stimulate the economy, leadership aides said today.
 One possibility, a staff assistant said, is to begin immediately to tax capital gains on assets held less than a year at the same rate as gains on property held longer. Short-term capital gains now face a tax as high as 39.6 percent. The maximum capital-gains rate on assets held a year or longer is 20 percent. 
 Capital gains are the profits from the sale of investments like stocks and bonds. The staff members are working on the theory that cutting the rate on short-term gains would induce many investors to sell stock immediately. The expectation is that proceeds from the sales would be spent, giving the economy a jolt.
The capital-gains proposal is one of several alternatives under consideration in Congress for spurring the economy.
The disclosure today was a trial balloon meant to advertise Republican allegiance to the principle of reducing capital-gains taxes and to see if the idea would fly politically. The aides emphasized that their bosses had not signed off on the plan.
"This might not be a fight we can win," a legislative assistant said. The assistant added: "We're not at the point where we're applying the political filter to our options. We're looking at the range of options."
The great bulk of stocks and bonds are held by wealthy investors. A capital-gains tax cut would mostly benefit the well-to-do and would offer relatively little directly to typical taxpayers. 
Democrats generally oppose reducing the capital-gains rate. Over the years, proposals to do this have led to fierce political battles.
Lowering or even eliminating the capital-gains tax has long been a central theme of Republican dogma, but President Bush's 10-year tax-cut plan does not include any change in that part of the tax code. The main elements in the Bush plan are lower income tax rates, repeal of the estate tax and tax reductions for married couples and families with children.
The first item on the agenda when Congress reconvenes next week is for conferees from the House and Senate to work out the differences in the budget blueprints they have adopted. The House approved the Bush plan of a $1.6 trillion tax cut in the fiscal years 2002 through 2011. The Senate figure was $1.2 trillion.
But the Senate also voted for $85 billion in tax relief in the fiscal year 2001, which ends Sept. 30, to give the economy a quick lift. The House did not approve a stimulus package, but conferees from the House are expected to agree to an amount close to what the Senate adopted. 
The question of how this money would be distributed will first be addressed when the Senate Finance Committee begins writing the specific tax legislation next month.
Democrats generally would like to give the stimulus money back to taxpayers in the form of rebate checks. Under this scheme, all taxpayers would receive the same amount of money, perhaps $400 or $500. 
Republicans want to put lower tax rates into effect and to have this reflected in the amount withheld from taxpayers' paychecks. This would have the effect of giving a bigger tax cut to those who pay more taxes.
But the Republican staff assistants who have been working on the matter during the recess concluded that a third option might be to use the stimulus money for a cut in capital-gains taxes. They have been encouraged in this direction by a variety of business lobbyists.
The staff members said that the idea had not been evaluated by the specialists who calculate how much revenue tax proposals would raise or lose. Generally, such calculations show that cutting the capital-gains tax brings in more revenue in the first year because investors sell short-term assets they would otherwise hold. The revenue loss from the lower rates is thus delayed.
The analysts have also not yet projected how much of the money investors might receive from selling stocks and bonds would actually be spent and how much would be reinvested.

HEADLINE: For Protesters at Yale, A Who's Who Audience 

BYLINE:  By PAUL ZIELBAUER

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Conn., April 20 

 BODY:
In recognition of Yale University's 300th anniversary, many of its most famous alumni have returned to campus this weekend to participate in a series of private seminars and lectures on the school's impact on world culture and politics.
 But if today was any indication, the select group of returning Yalies -- former President George Bush, former Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, Tom Wolfe and William F. Buckley Jr. among them -- may end up sharing the glare of television camera lights with hundreds of graduate students protesting Yale's opposition to their efforts to unionize. 
 The weekend of events began Thursday, but today was the first full day of meetings, luncheons, dinners -- and pro-union demonstrations. The largest demonstration was heldlate this afternoon, as Mr. Rubin and Janet L. Yellin, the former chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisors, discussed their Clinton-era economic policies in a large campus auditorium here. 
When the talk ended, as hundreds of mostly graying Yalies and their spouses streamed into the street, a clutch of local clergy members and several dozen graduate students in baggy pants and T-shirts began chanting and shouting pro-union slogans. Two dozen armed campus and city police officers stood by and coralled the students onto sidewalks. There were no arrests. 
In all, about 1,400 Yale alumni are scheduled to participate in more than 50 lectures, galas and musical performances on campus this weekend, a 72-hour affair the university is calling the Alumni Leadership Conference. The lecture topics seem as diverse as some of the college's returning graduates.
Saturday morning, Anita Hill, the 1980 Yale Law graduate who became famous for her role in Clarence Thomas's confirmation hearing to the Supreme Court, will be part of a discussion on "Yale law school and the law of sexual harrassment." 
At 2 p.m., Christopher Durang and Wendy Wasserstein, award-winning playwrights, are scheduled to view and discuss scenes from their plays -- Mr. Durang's "For Whom the Southern Belle Tolls," and Ms. Wasserstein's "Heidi Chronicles" -- to be performed by Yale undergraduates. 
Mr. Wolfe is to talk about how Yale's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences helped him develop his writing and storytelling styles. 
Many of the lectures even have suggested homework: readings and Web sites for those attending to review before they arrive.
Although many of the lectures are planned to occur simultaneously, former President Bush, a member of Yale's Class of '48, is the only lecturer scheduled for 3:45 p.m. on Saturday. He plans to discuss his presidency and his opinions of the nation's political future.
It was not clear whether the weekend's events would be accompanied by the vociferous pro-labor demonstrations that graduate students and members of Yale's clerical, maintenance and hospital workers union held on and around campus today. 
The most passionate of the demonstrators were graduate students who have called on Yale's administration to recognize their union's effort to organize though a "card count," in which an employer agrees to recognize a union when a majority of an employer's workers sign union membership cards. 
Yale opposes the graduate students' efforts to organize, and it dismisses the card-count method as unacceptable. 
Asked to explain Yale's opposition to the graduate-student unions, Tom Conroy, Yale's spokesman, read a statement from the university's president, Richard C. Levin. 
"Yale is committed to free expression and open debate," Mr. Levin's statement said, "and the secret ballot is the time-honored method used in American democratic elections of all kinds. It is the procedure used in elections by the National Labor Relations Board to protect the rights of employees."
In October, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that graduate teaching and research assistants at New York University had the right to organize as any employees would under federal labor laws. That ruling inspired the beginning of a similar unionization drive at Columbia University in March.
Today's student protests at Yale were intended to catch the attention of some of the college's most distinguished and influential alumni, and they appeared to surprise quite a few. 
Mehmet Kahya, a Yale alumnus from the class of 1973 who flew in this weekend from Turkey, observed the protests with unmistakable amusement. 
"This reminds me of 1968 and '69, when we had demonstrations all the time," said Mr. Kahya, now the president of the only Yale Club in Istanbul. "If the students want something, I think one has to listen to them."
Across the street, seven undergraduates from the Committee for Freedom, a conservative campus group, taunted the graduate students and held up anti-union slogans scribbled on squares of paper. 
"Teaching is part of the educational process -- it's not labor," said Bill Rogel, 20, a political science major from Pittsburgh, who held a sign that read, "Unions: Enslaving America one workplace at a time."

Americas Summit Opens; Protesters Take to Streets
President Bush arrived at the Summit of the Americas in Quebec, his first summit meeting, declaring that he would make the expansion of economic and political ties with Latin America his first foreign policy priority. But before he and other leaders could get to work, the opening ceremony was delayed by thousands of protesters clogging the streets, seeking to block talks on a Free Trade Area of the Americas. A1

A crowd that the police estimated at about 2,000 tore down about 150 feet of a chain-link fence atop concrete barricades erected near the convention center where President Bush and other Western Hemisphere leaders were gathering. A6

Hesitation on AIDS Drugs
The governing African National Congress, in its online newspaper, ticked off reasons why South Africa should think twice about providing lifesaving drug cocktails to people with AIDS. The article, coming a day after the drug industry dropped a legal challenge to South Africa's right to import cheaper brand-name AIDS therapies, dismayed patient advocates. A4

Taiwanese's Visas Irk China
The United States granted Lee Teng-hui, the former president of Taiwan, a visa to visit in May, a step certain to irritate in Chinese-American relations further. And Tokyo said it would let Mr. Lee visit this month. China's Foreign Ministry quickly warned Japan's ambassador that it felt compelled to make a "necessary reaction." A3

Italy Presses Nazi Cases
Italy is pressing Germany and Canada to bring to justice two former Nazis convicted of war crimes in absentia by Italian courts while living in quiet retirement, one in Hamburg and the other in Vancouver. A6

Missionary Plane Shot Down

States Facing Shortages Of Guards for Prisons
Prison officials across the country are having to cope with a severe shortage of guards brought on in large part by low salaries in a competitive economy, an explosion of prison building and a tougher, more violent class of inmate. The shortage has figured in some escapes and disturbances and has led at least one state, Kansas, to reduce the minimum age for guards to 19 from 21. A1

Therapists Found Guilty
A jury in Colorado convicted Connell Watkins, 54, and her assistant Julie Ponder, 40, of child abuse in the death of a 10-year-old girl who suffocated after being wrapped in a sheet during a psychotherapy session employing a technique called "rebirthing." A8

Nuclear Family Status Quo
The overall proportion of minor children living with their married biological parents remained essentially unchanged, about 62 percent, throughout the early and mid-1990's, according to Jason Fields, the Census Bureau demographer who wrote a recent report widely portrayed as reflecting a rebound in two-parent families. A16

SCIENCE/HEALTH

Soot and Early Death Linked
The E.P.A. has concluded that there is a stronger link than ever between the tiniest soot particles and thousands of premature deaths each year. Officials said changes in the draft report were inevitable before any new rules would be put forth but that the evidence at hand eliminated almost any doubt that this pollution posed a serious health threat. A1

EDUCATION

Sex-Ed Report Languishes
In the waning months of the Clinton administration, Surgeon General David Satcher laid the groundwork for a sweeping report on sexual attitudes and education that would urge comprehensive sex education in every grade and measures to "promote responsible sexual behavior," like improved access to contraception. But the report was not published and his office says any statement now will likely avoid controversial areas. A9

HEADLINE: BUSH WILL PRESS FREE-TRADE ISSUE AT QUEBEC TALKS 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: QUEBEC, April 20 

 BODY:
President Bush arrived at his first summit meeting today declaring that he would make the expansion of economic and political ties with Latin America his first foreign policy priority. 
 But before Mr. Bush and other leaders could get down to work, tonight's opening ceremony of the Summit of the Americas was delayed for an hour, to about 7:30, as thousands of mostly young protesters clogged the narrow streets of this walled city seeking to block talks over a Free Trade Area of the Americas. 
 For Mr. Bush, the tear gas battles that broke out between the police and several thousand protesters marked his first close-up view of the raw emotions that free trade pacts now routinely encounter. 
Mr. Bush made no direct reference to the periodic skirmishes taking place just outside his hotel, but several of the leaders he was supposed to meet this afternoon could not make it through the streets, and his aides watched as the Canadian police, dressed in riot gear, tried to restore order tonight so the summit sessions could begin. Page A6. 
"We already know from the North American Free Trade Agreement that free trade works," Mr. Bush insisted just before leaving the White House this morning, invoking the trade accord negotiated by his father and supported by President Bill Clinton that would form the model for a broader accord. "It has created good jobs for our workers. Now is the time to extend these benefits of free trade throughout the entire hemisphere."
But on television, Mr. Bush's message was drowned out by scenes that were reminiscent of Seattle in December 1999, but that in reality were far more tame. 
All afternoon, protesters milled around Quebec's antique fortifications, modern concrete barricades and tall steel fences that the police had set up to keep demonstrators far from the 34 presidents and prime ministers here for the summit meeting. Periodically, the crowds surged forward, knocking over one section of the fence, and periodically the police drove them back with tear gas. Few injuries were reported, and arrests seemed sporadic. But the center of the old city was boarded up, and overnight the local McDonalds literally disappeared: workers took down all its signs and covered all its windows, so that it looked like a long-abandoned storefront.
"We expected this," one senior Bush administration official said. "You can't have a trade summit these days without tear gas; it would be like having a cheeseburger without cheese." 
In fact, a senior administration official said this evening that Mr. Bush had not been able to meet with Caribbean leaders because they could not get near his hotel -- a situation reminiscent of Seattle, where many trade negotiators were blocked from entering the city's world trade center. But the president did manage to meet with Andean leaders and the leaders of Brazil and Panama.
"The chemistry was really quite good," one Bush administration official told reporters, saying there was "solid agreement" that "trade is the engine that is needed for development" But such generalities ignore the question of the terms on which that trade should occur.
The official said that "the president did note that there were some outside who were trying to isolate this process," and added that Mr. Bush had watched some of the television footage of the protesters' clashes with the police.
Mr. Bush faces three separate challenges to his trade agenda: one on the street, one in Congress and one with the countries on the other side of this negotiation.
The challenge on the street is the most familiar, and the least cohesive. Just as Seattle attracted everyone from anarchists to human rights advocates to environmental groups and labor unions, here in Quebec every kind of protester was on the street today. 
Some complained that trade accords do not guarantee rights for gays and lesbians, others said they put corporate profits ahead of creating democracy. Still others argued, bullhorns in hand, that the poorest workers in Mexico were no better off now than they were in 1995, when Nafta went into effect. 
So far, Mr. Bush has rarely addressed those complaints directly. But Canada's prime minister, Jean Chretien, who had to delay the opening of tonight's ceremonies, said the protesters were ignoring new provisions of the proposed free trade agreement without mentioning that the draft agreement has yet to be published. (Mr. Bush has promised to make it available soon.)
"If they looked at the texts on all these subjects that are on the table," Mr. Chretien said, "in fact we are making sure that there will be a better preoccupation in many of these countries about human rights and democratic rights." 
He appeared to be referring to the "democracy clause" expected in the final communique of this meeting, which will stipulate that any country that retreats from democracy will be banished from the summit meeting process and thus from the next four years of negotiations over a free trade area in the hemisphere.
"There is, in fact, a very strong democracy clause in the summit's political declaration," Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Bush's national security adviser, said on Thursday in Washington. "It's quite remarkable." But it is unclear how, or if, that clause would be enforced. 
While all 34 nations here are celebrating hemispheric democracy -- only Fidel Castro of Cuba has been excluded -- several of those democracies are shaky. Ecuador had a military coup last year, though the military quickly stepped aside; Colombia is on shaky ground; and Peru's future is still uncertain.
Mr. Bush is also facing economic uncertainties in Latin America that are bound to make a free trade agreement harder to negotiate. Argentina has been in crisis for a year, and Brazil has argued against Mr. Bush's efforts to speed up negotiations, for fear that lowering its trade barriers would threaten a number of politically influential industries. 
Such problems derailed Mr. Clinton's promise, at the first Summit of the Americas in 1995, to negotiate such a pact before he left office. 
"There's a huge gap between promises made at these summits and what actually gets done," said Richard E. Feinberg, a professor at the University of California at San Diego and a former Clinton administration official. "People get disappointed, and leaders haven't responded. And that makes it harder and harder." 
And Mr. Bush must now decide how much political capital he will put into winning a free trade accord, in a year he clearly wants to devote to tax cuts and education.
It will be politically costly. Congress remains sharply divided on the wisdom of new free trade accords, and the issue is so sensitive that Mr. Bush himself has not yet submitted the legislation needed to give him the authority to negotiate the Free Trade Area of the Americas. That legislation, once called "fast track," is now called "trade promotion authority." It would give Mr. Bush the ability to negotiate an accord and submit it to Congress for an up or down vote, without amendments -- the only way, advocates of free trade say, to keep the American agricultural or textile industries, or other groups, from altering negotiated agreements to their advantage.
One main sticking point is how to deal with sanctions against countries that violate basic labor or environmental standards -- the same issue that bedeviled Mr. Clinton throughout his presidency.
Democrats say any accord must include stiff sanctions, and Republicans have traditionally insisted that those issues have no place in free trade agreements. Mr. Bush is trying to weave a middle ground, one that would permit the United States to impose financial sanctions against countries that violate labor or environmental standards, but that would forbid trade sanctions. It is unclear whether this watered-down approach will be viewed as tough enough by Democrats, or whether countries like Brazil or Venezuela would sign any accord that allowed other countries to dictate minimum wages, working conditions or the internal workings of their economies. 
No agreements are expected here. Mr. Bush is simply starting a dialogue, as President George Bush did in 1990 and Mr. Clinton did in 1995. The fact that both men ran aground is, one of Mr. Bush's aides said, "a warning signal." But the declaration signed by the leaders should have considerable symbolic importance, both for Mr. Bush and the nations of Latin America. During last year's presidential campaign, Mr. Bush often accused the Clinton administration of having neglected Latin America, skewing American foreign policy too far toward Asia.
This weekend Mr. Bush is expected to describe how he would change that. But even while he is making the case, he is also considering arms sales to Taiwan -- scheduled for announcement on Tuesday -- and deciding when to renew surveillance flights along the Chinese coast. 
"It's fair to say our minds are in two places," one of his advisers said.
