HEADLINE: CHRYSLER FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY; U.A.W. AND FIAT TO TAKE CONTROL

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and BILL VLASIC; Nick Bunkley and Micheline Maynard contributed reporting from Detroit.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama forced Chrysler into federal bankruptcy protection on Thursday so it could pursue a lifesaving alliance with the Italian automaker Fiat, in yet another extraordinary intervention into private industry by the federal government.
Flanked by his automobile task force of cabinet secretaries and business advisers in the White House's grand entranceway, Mr. Obama announced a plan that would allow the United Automobile Workers, through their retirement plan, to take control of Chrysler, with Fiat and the United States as junior partners. The government would lend about $8 billion more to the company, on top of the $4 billion it had already provided.
The arrangement came after an intensive round of White House-sponsored negotiations among the Treasury Department, the union and Chrysler's executives and creditors. After working through the night, a small group of debtholders balked at Mr. Obama's final terms, leading the president to decide that bankruptcy could not be averted. 
It was a stark moment, and one unseen in modern times, as the fledgling president deepened his involvement in a struggling but iconic American company. Chrysler, which Mr. Obama called ''a pillar'' of the industrial economy, invented the minivan and owns the Jeep brand.
With Thursday's filing, Chrysler became the first major American automaker to seek bankruptcy protection since Studebaker did so in 1933.
It was a humbling moment for the nation's third-largest automaker, which recovered strongly after a near bankruptcy in 1979 with help from the Carter administration before entering its latest, dangerously fallow period under the ownership of the German auto company Daimler-Benz and, as of 2007, Cerberus Capital Management.
Bringing to bear his White House megaphone on Thursday, Mr. Obama laid out the terms of a deal that he said would save well over 35,000 jobs. And with a hint of anger, he railed against the holdout lenders, now effectively a hostile group of business partners, whom he called ''speculators.''
''They were hoping that everybody else would make sacrifices, and they would have to make none,'' Mr. Obama said of the creditors, among them several hedge funds and boutique investment funds. ''I don't stand with them.''
As the most visible investor in the newly formed Chrysler, Mr. Obama also donned his presidential sales cap, emphasizing that Chrysler's warranties would now be backed by the United States government -- addressing a potential concern for those in the market for a new car.
''If you are considering buying a car, I hope it will be an American car,'' he said. ''I want to remind you that if you decide to buy a Chrysler, your warranty will be safe.''
The crisis in the auto industry has presented an early test for Mr. Obama, who has had to wrestle with the limits of federal involvement in private industry as few presidents have since the Great Depression. Save for crucial moments of decision, officials said he left the automotive task force he formed in February to work through sticking points with the participants, with its main leaders, the financiers Ron Bloom and Steven Rattner, handling the late-night phone calls.
Mr. Rattner and Mr. Bloom both have experience with corporate turnarounds and were able to wring critical concessions from the U.A.W. The union, for example, agreed to accept company stock for 50 percent of what Chrysler owes its retiree health care fund. Most of the major debtholders, led by JPMorgan Chase, agreed to write down the debt owed to them by more than two-thirds.
That put the onus on the remaining holdouts -- including units of OppenheimerFunds, Xerion Capital Fund of Perella Weinberg Partners and Stairway Capital Management -- which argued they were falling victim to the willingness of their big banking partners in Chrysler to play nice with a government that had helped bail them out as well. Perella Weinberg decided late Thursday that it would accept the government's terms.
Administration officials said the holdouts' position left them no option but to force Chrysler into bankruptcy.
The hope now is that Chrysler will come out of bankruptcy quickly, perhaps as soon as late June, and serve as a model for General Motors, which has to produce its own lifesaving plan in the next 30 days.
But court documents filed by Chrysler in New York on Thursday showed that Chrysler's re-emergence from bankruptcy could take until Aug. 28, or four months from now. Bankruptcy always contains some element of unpredictability, and the minority of debtholders who oppose the new arrangement could argue in court that the company is worth more to them in liquidation.
But administration officials said they believed that it was highly unlikely that a bankruptcy court judge would side with the minority when those holding 70 percent of the debt had signed off on the arrangement.
Chrysler said its factories would go mostly idle starting Monday, and remain so for the bulk of the process. Auto workers will receive about 80 percent of their base pay during the shutdown. The Treasury is providing $3.3 billion in so-called debtor-in-possession financing, and administration officials said during a conference call with reporters that no jobs would be lost during the bankruptcy.
Any future cuts, they said, would be decided by the new company's board -- which is to include representatives appointed by the union, the administration and the government of Canada, which also lent money -- and the successor to the Chrysler chief executive, Robert L. Nardelli, who said he would leave the company at the bankruptcy's end.
In Auburn Hills, Mich., groups of Chrysler workers watched the president's speech on television Thursday at the Red Ox Tavern on their lunch break. While they welcomed Mr. Obama's endorsement of Chrysler's future, they worried about the stigma associated with bankruptcy.
''It seems like an ugly word -- bankruptcy,'' said Christopher Whiteman, an engineering supervisor at the company. ''It puts a lot of doubt in people's minds.''
That sort of trepidation is common in politically important Michigan, which is bracing itself for General Motors to submit its restructuring plans some 30 days from now.

HEADLINE: Justifying His Fiscal Policies, Obama Borrows From the G.O.P.

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
CORRECTION APPENDED
WASHINGTON -- For 30 years, Republicans have held as an article of faith that tax cuts spur the economy and generate more revenue. ''Deficits don't matter,'' as former Vice President Dick Cheney said. Now President Obama is adapting Republican arguments to his own agenda -- only substituting spending for tax cuts.
Call it the Democratic version of Reaganomics, the supply-side theory that replaced Republicans' longtime belief in balanced budgets. As popularized by President Ronald Reagan, the theory holds that cutting income taxes encourages people to work harder and to produce more goods, sparking economic growth and increased tax revenues.
With Congress's approval on Wednesday of a $3.5 trillion budget blueprint embracing Mr. Obama's spending initiatives for education, health care and energy, the president extolled the potential benefits of these ''new investments.'' In his nationally televised news conference that night, he said the budget would start laying ''a new foundation for growth, a foundation that will strengthen our economy and help us compete in the 21st century.'' 
Democrats have derided Republicans as going beyond ideology to theology with their antitax orthodoxy. But it was Mr. Obama who borrowed from the Bible for his ''new foundation'' economic metaphor. In an address at Georgetown University, where he used some variation of ''invest'' for ''spend'' 14 times, the president recalled Jesus' parable in the Sermon on the Mount about two men, a foolish one who builds a house on sand and a wise one whose foundation is rock.
''We cannot rebuild this economy on the same pile of sand,'' he said. ''We must build our house upon a rock, a foundation that will move us from an era of borrow and spend to one where we save and invest.''
Promoting aid for high-speed rail corridors -- Mr. Obama seeks $5 billion on top of $8 billion included in his $787 billion recovery plan -- the president said, ''Investing in our transportation system pays enormous dividends over the long term.''
At a wind energy plant in Newton, Iowa, to showcase the job-creating potential of his 10-year, $150 billion plan to encourage alternative energies, Mr. Obama called the initiative ''a win-win: it's good for the environment; it's great for the economy.''
Obama advisers acknowledge a similarity between the president's economic justification for spending and supply-siders' rationale for tax cuts. But they say Mr. Obama would never go so far as Republicans who claim that tax cuts pay for themselves. (Reagan told advisers who recommended a tax increase in 1984 to shrink a ballooning deficit: ''There has not been one tax increase in history that actually raised revenue. And every tax cut, from the 1920s to Kennedy's to ours, has produced more.'')
''I would be worried,'' Mr. Obama's budget director, Peter R. Orszag, said in an interview, ''if the gestalt out there was that we were saying that these investments will by themselves bring down the deficit, as opposed to they will help spur economic performance, partially offsetting the costs of the investments in the first place, which is a much different thing. And in fact, if that's all Reagan said, then that would have been analytically right, too.''
From Reagan to President George W. Bush, big tax cuts were followed by big deficits. Might Mr. Obama's investments yield another outcome? Even sympathetic economists say they will not without action to cut projected spending for popular health and retirement benefits, chiefly Medicare and Medicaid, that are driving the forecasts of unsustainable deficits.
To some economists, such economic theories are just gloss to cover the fact that both parties want it all: Mr. Obama proposes to have tax cuts as well as new spending, just as Republicans when they were in power consistently increased spending as well as reduced taxes.
''In both cases, long term the money is not there,'' said C. Eugene Steuerle, a Treasury official in the Reagan administration who is vice president of the Peterson Foundation, a grant-making and advocacy group in New York.
Mr. Steuerle and other economists say the result for Mr. Obama, if he prevails, may be much the same as for Reagan: rising deficits that force partial retreats from the original policies, tax increases and unanticipated fiscal reforms, like Reagan's 1986 tax code overhaul.
''There is an analogy here: 2009 may represent for the Obama administration what 1981 represented for the Reagan administration,'' Mr. Steuerle said. ''After 1981, after the tax cuts and the defense-spending increases, in the following years you had very substantial movements toward long-term reform on the deficit and Social Security and the tax system.''
W. Elliot Brownlee, a historian of taxation at the University of California, Santa Barbara, similarly predicted that when the economy recovered, Mr. Obama could end up presiding over budgetary reforms that amounted to ''one of the great shifts'' in the nation's fiscal history -- the sixth by his count, after economic developments that followed the American Revolution, the Civil War, World War I, the Great Depression and World War II.
''You only get these in periods of great national crisis,'' Mr. Brownlee said.
The global economic crisis, war, mounting costs for health and retirement benefits, energy woes and climate change, Mr. Brownlee said, presented ''a very powerful array'' of problems that could well force action.
Obama aides insist that the president will be true to his word also to cut spending to reduce deficits, projected at $1.2 trillion for the 2010 fiscal year alone. ''If we want to spend,'' Mr. Obama said in a recent radio address, ''we'll need to find somewhere else to cut.''
But Presidents Reagan and Bush also promised to shave expenditures to offset tax cuts. They instead added spending.
The problem with Mr. Obama's case for spending, just as with the promotion of tax cuts by Republicans, is that the long-run benefits of the policy cannot be separated from the issue of how those actions fit within the country's overall fiscal picture.
Mr. Brownlee said it was reasonable for the Obama administration to argue that the kind of investments it wanted would result in productivity gains that produced tax revenues.
''But the question is, When will we see those gains, and will they be enough to pay for the investment?'' he said. ''That seems highly unlikely. And will it be enough to help significantly in dealing with the other fiscal challenges that we're facing?''
Correction: May 12, 2009, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A Political Memo article on May 1, about President Obama's fiscal policies and how they compare to policies during the Reagan years, misidentified the organization for which C. Eugene Steuerle works. He is vice president of the Peterson Foundation, a grant-making and advocacy group in New York. He is not a scholar at the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics, a separate research group in Washington.

HEADLINE: Uncertainty And Doubts As Flu Cases Keep Rising

BYLINE: By DENISE GRADY; Reporting was contributed by Gardiner Harris and Jeff Zeleny from Washington, Elisabeth Malkin from Mexico City, and Ian Austen from Ottawa.

 BODY:
The swine flu continues to spread slowly but surely, with 114 confirmed cases in 12 states on Thursday, up from 91 in 10 states on Wednesday. Many more states have suspected cases, and 11 countries have been affected so far.
 But little else seems sure about the disease, including how bad it will turn out to be and even its name, now officially influenza A(H1N1), according to the World Health Organization. 
 ''This is a rapidly evolving situation,'' said Dr. Richard Besser, acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ''It is a situation filled with uncertainty.''
 Dr. Besser praised a decision by the W.H.O. on Wednesday to raise the global alert level to Phase 5, one step below a pandemic. He said the move would not affect the United States, which is already taking measures against the outbreak, but would alert other countries to get pandemic plans in order. On Thursday, officials of the health organization said Phase 5, which means a pandemic is highly likely, was still the appropriate level.
 In this country, hundreds of schools have closed, including Fort Worth's entire school district of about 80,000 students. Texas has 26 confirmed cases. 
 On Thursday, the White House disclosed that a member of the Obama administration delegation that traveled to Mexico in mid-April probably contracted the disease. The man had flu symptoms when he returned to Washington, and spread the illness to his wife and son, but he and his family have recovered and he is back at work. Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, said the man did not work closely with the president and never posed any risk to him. 
 In Canada, the confirmation of 15 additional cases on Thursday brought the total number of cases there to 34. 
 Mexico now has 312 confirmed cases and 12 confirmed fatalities. More than 2,500 cases are suspected, and at least 150 people are believed to have died of the disease. 
 Mexican officials fear that by shutting down businesses and scaring tourists away, the disease will deal a crushing blow to the country's already battered economy. Finance Minister Agustin Carstens said Thursday that he expected the new flu to cost Mexico from 0.3 percent to 0.5 percent of its gross domestic product, a loss that comes on top of an expected decline for the year of 3 percent to 5 percent. 
 In the United States, the government continued to roll out the plans it had made to deal with a nationwide outbreak. Until now, states have had to send samples to the C.D.C. in Atlanta to be tested for the new flu strain. But this week, the C.D.C. began sending materials to the states so that they could do their own tests and get results more quickly. 
 California was among the first to receive the materials, and a spokesman for the state health department said that by the end of the week, the state should be able to do its own testing.
 But as health officials kept working in emergency mode, a few infectious disease experts quietly suggested that fears related to the outbreak were overblown.
 Dr. Paul Offit, chief of infectious diseases at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said the death of a 23-month-old Mexican child in Texas did not mean that the outbreak was extraordinarily dangerous. 
 ''Every year we see between 75 and 150 children die of flu, most of whom were previously healthy,'' Dr. Offit said. 
 Recent improvements to the nation's flu surveillance system led officials to notice the swine flu outbreak, he said, when just a few years ago it would have been lost among the sea of routine sicknesses. 
 ''We're very quick now to identify new strains of the flu,'' Dr. Offit said. ''The question is what we should do with that.''
 Dr. John Treanor, a professor of medicine at the University of Rochester Medical Center and an infectious-disease expert, said swine flu would probably be only slightly more dangerous than the usual seasonal flus.
 ''It won't be severe, although there will be some deaths,'' Dr. Treanor said. Because seasonal flu causes about 36,000 deaths a year in the United States, some deaths should not be surprising, he said.
 At a House hearing on Thursday, several members of Congress said fear had begun to grip not only their constituents but also their own families. 
 ''You'll forgive some of my constituents for wanting to get into the fetal poison and bathe in Purell,'' said Representative Anthony D. Weiner of New York City, where half of the nation's cases of swine flu have been reported.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 6, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about the uncertainties surrounding swine flu quoted Representative Anthony D. Weiner of New York City incorrectly. In describing the fear gripping people in his district, he said at a House hearing, ''You'll forgive some of my constituents for wanting to get into the fetal position and bathe in Purell.'' He did not say ''fetal poison.''

HEADLINE: Overhaul In Bond Sales Is to Be Urged In Tennessee

BYLINE: By DON VAN NATTA Jr.

 BODY:
The Tennessee comptroller plans on Friday to propose a sweeping overhaul of the way the municipal bond market is regulated in the state. 
 The comptroller, Justin P. Wilson, said Thursday that his recommended changes would prohibit small cities and counties from using sophisticated derivatives, which have crashed, causing interest payments to increase by as much as 500 percent and putting a strain on local governments. 
 ''I think what we are proposing is a fundamental change in the way we will regulate local government financing,'' Mr. Wilson said in an interview. ''These changes would be revolutionary.''
 In early April, The New York Times reported that the municipal bond market in Tennessee was dominated by Morgan Keegan & Company, a investment bank based in Memphis that served for years as financial adviser, bond broker and tutor for local officials through a state-sponsored education program. 
 Critics of the practice said it was a conflict of interest for a single firm to play so many roles. Officials from several smaller cities and counties have complained they had not understood the risks of such transactions.
 Across the country, cities and counties that used bond derivatives to manage debt are reeling from escalating interest rates and high fees associated with canceling the transactions. The federal government does not regulate municipal bond derivatives, leaving any oversight to the states.
 In Tennessee, Mr. Wilson is also proposing to discontinue the state-sponsored, one-day seminar about bond derivatives intended to explain the risk and benefits of the transactions to local officials. Instead, an independent review would determine if a municipality's chief finance officer had the expertise to assess bond derivative transactions, like interest-rate swaps.
 ''We want to require a level of sophistication with the governments that would go far beyond what could be taught in an eight-hour course,'' Mr. Wilson said.
 He said other changes would involve greater disclosure of fees associated with bond transactions as well as a requirement that a single firm ''only play one role'' in each transaction. 
 ''No firm will be allowed to act on multiple sides of a transaction,'' Mr. Wilson said.
 The proposed changes will be presented to the State Funding Board, a five-member body that includes Gov. Phil Bredesen, a Democrat. 
 After the article in The Times, Mr. Bredesen said state officials had failed to do enough to protect cities and counties that had used municipal bond derivatives.
 It is up to the funding board whether to accept the proposals. 
 Morgan Keegan executives have defended their work in Tennessee, saying city officials were apprised of the risks and benefits of the transactions. The bank's officials said that the seminar curriculum had been approved by the state, and that they did not use the sessions to market products. 
 Some local officials have said Morgan Keegan failed to warn them about the consequences if the rating of the bonds' insurer, the Ambac Financial Group, was downgraded. When that occurred, the bonds' interest payments quadrupled and the pay-off time increased. The cost of terminating the interest-rate swaps was exorbitant.

HEADLINE: Student's Goal Is College. The Hurdle Is Finding Financial Aid.

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Each afternoon this spring, Brennan Jackson, an A-student who ranks near the top of his high school class, has arrived at his guidance counselor's office to intercept the latest scholarship applications, as if they were a newspaper landing on his front stoop.
 Because his father is out of work and his mother works only part time, Brennan has set an ambitious goal for himself: to raise the $25,000 he still needs for his freshman year at the University of California, Berkeley, by stitching together a quilt of merit scholarships. 
 ''We need to spread our resources as far as possible,'' he said the other night, over a family dinner of reheated eggplant parmigiana. ''I guess I feel a little responsible.'' 
 The stress has taken its toll: Brennan's guidance counselor blames it for the boy's thinning hair, and Brennan points to his scholarship search as the cause of a recent outbreak of acne.
 While Brennan's situation, and the remedy he is pursuing, may sound extremely ambitious, guidance counselors across the country say they can recall no prior year in which so many applicants' families have been squeezed by so many financial pressures.
 Not only have families' incomes been falling as their savings have dwindled, but also tuition has been rising -- including proposed increases of nearly 10 percent next year throughout the University of California system. (Brennan would face bills nearly as high as Berkeley's at the University of California campuses in Los Angeles and Davis, the only other colleges to accept him; Stanford, a private university that typically offers full scholarships to families with incomes under $60,000, rejected him. Berkeley offered him only $212 in scholarship money.)
 While private colleges have vowed to protect financial aid in hard times, some of the most reliable independent scholarship programs have been reduced or discontinued this year -- including some that lost parts of their endowments to Bernard L. Madoff's vast Ponzi scheme -- further raising the competition for those that remain.
 Interest rates on student loans, including on popular federal programs like the unsubsidized Stafford (now nearly 7 percent) and Parent Plus (8.5 percent), are running several percentage points higher than the rates on secured loans, like home equity lines of credit.
 ''The difference of rates between secured and unsecured loans is higher than I have ever seen,'' said Scott White, director of counseling services at Westfield High School in New Jersey. ''This is one further impediment to access to post-secondary education for all but the well-to-do.''
 Judy Campbell, Brennan's guidance counselor at Hollywood High School, where three of every four students qualify for a free or reduced-price lunch, suggested that his family was ''not poor enough for need-based aid and not rich enough to write a check.'' 
 When asked over dinner whether she felt guilty that Brennan had taken so much upon himself, his mother, Caryn, began to cry. ''We didn't expect to end up in this situation,'' she said.
 Tuition, board and other expenses at Berkeley are estimated at $27,000 a year. Last year, the family's income was $58,000, when Ms. Jackson's wages from teaching were combined with revenue from a part of a rental property. The family cannot sell the property because it does not own it outright, and Ms. Campbell believes that the investment reduced the direct aid Brennan might have received. 
 Brennan's father, Aaron, who was laid off as an accountant more than a year ago, acknowledged that his son had few options. He said his lack of steady income prevented the family from refinancing the $500,000 mortgage on its cramped, nearly 90-year-old, two-bedroom home or taking on additional debt. 
 Mr. Jackson said his job search had been frustrating: he said he had been deemed overqualified for some jobs in recent months, and underqualified for others. His previous job with a real estate company paid about $75,000 annually.
 Which is not to say that the family has not been doing its part to offset its expenses.
 They have reduced visits to the dentist from twice a year to once; saved $45 a month in groomers' fees by trimming their two dogs themselves; returned one of their cars, a Honda CRV on a lease, to the dealer; stopped eating in restaurants; and deferred home repairs.
 As May 1, the day his $100 deposit was due at Berkeley, was drawing near, Brennan said he had netted about $1,500 in outside scholarships, mostly from the California Scholarship Federation, a statewide organization. He is also a finalist for a scholarship from the Rotary Club of Los Angeles that could be worth $2,000. And he was preparing to submit his application for a $5,000 grant from an organization called D.R.E.A.M.S. (Developing a Responsible, Educated and Moral Society). ''Five thousand dollars isn't a small contribution,'' Brennan said. But even with that infusion, he said, his situation ''would still be problematic.''
 He said he had been filling out two applications a night, most of them requiring original essays, for more than month. 
 The only part-time jobs he has found are as a baby sitter and as a student poll worker in a statewide special election in mid-May. (His pay for that day's work -- which, a form letter from the county clerk assured, ''looks great on college/scholarship applications'' -- will be $105.)
 While many of the scholarship organizations will not send out their decisions until later this spring, or even in the summer, Brennan said he knew he could tap one additional source should he come up short: the $15,000 remaining in a college savings account his father had established for him, which had been worth upward of $30,000 less than a year ago. The problem, he said, was that the account had been intended to last four years.
 Then there is the matter of his sister, Elise, 16, a junior who will be applying to college next year, meaning his parents will have two children in college at the same time for three years.
 Asked whether she had a preliminary plan of attack, Elise said she did: to gain admission to a wealthy, highly selective private college that, unlike the California system, might pay her tuition in full.

HEADLINE: Lower Oil Prices Reduce Exxon's Quarterly Profit

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
Exxon Mobil, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, reported its lowest quarterly profits in nearly six years on Thursday as lower oil prices slashed earnings across the industry. 
 Despite the recent collapse in prices, Exxon earned $4.55 billion in the first quarter, down 58 percent from $10.89 billion in the period last year. Profit fell to 92 cents a share in the quarter, from $2.02 in the year-earlier period. 
 Exxon, whose operations stretch from Nigeria to Siberia, managed to wring out bigger profits than any of its rivals because of its size and its obsessive attention to controlling costs. These industry costs, which had doubled in the last few years, have been falling lately as companies cancel projects or delay investments. 
 Oil prices have fallen sharply in recent months as a global recession drastically slowed economic activity around the world. Crude oil futures contracts traded in New York have averaged about $43 in the first quarter of this year, compared with nearly $100 a barrel in the first quarter of 2008. On Thursday, oil settled at $51.12 a barrel, up 15 cents.
 ''This volatility over such a short period of time is a supreme test of a company's business model,'' said Kenneth P. Cohen, the company's vice president for public affairs.
 Exxon said that the drop in prices would not change its spending plans for the year. The company said it still expected to spend a record $29 billion this year to expand production and develop new projects. But in a bid to preserve some of its cash, it also signaled that it would reduce its share buyback program by $2 billion in the second quarter. 
 ''In spite of the dramatic changes to the global economic environment, Exxon Mobil is maintaining its long-term focus and disciplined approach to capital investment,'' the company said in a statement.
 While other oil companies are trimming or ending their share-buyback programs, Exxon spent $7 billion in the first quarter to purchase shares. In the second quarter, it plans to spend $5 billion buying back shares. Exxon had $25 billion in cash at the end of the first quarter, down from $31 billion at the end of last year.
 Despite the market's decline and the drop in gasoline consumption, Exxon recently regained its position as the largest American corporation in the Fortune 500 list of companies, overtaking Wal-Mart. The company's shares have lost 25 percent of their value in the last year, compared with a 37 percent drop on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
 Exxon's report caps a week of weaker earnings for major oil companies. Royal Dutch Shell and BP both reported lower profits in recent days.
 Shell's net income for the first quarter fell 62 percent, to $3.49 billion. At BP, profits fell by 64 percent, to $2.56 billion, prompting the company's chief executive, Tony Hayward, to scale back spending this year by 9 percent, to $20 billion.
 ''This is a very difficult condition for the oil industry, and we need to be clear about it,'' Shell's chief financial officer, Peter Voser, said on a conference call on Wednesday. 
 ConocoPhillipssaid last week that its profit plunged by 80 percent, to $840 million. Chevron is scheduled to report its results for the quarter on Friday.
 Even as it outperforms its peers, Exxon faces stark strategic questions about its future. The Obama administration's goals of cutting carbon emissions and reducing oil consumption threaten Exxon's profits and its business model. The cap-and-trade policy, which is being considering by the administration, would raise production costs and increase energy prices. 
 Exxon, which has long fought policies to reduce carbon emissions, has recently championed the idea of setting a carbon tax to reduce emissions, a measure favored by some economists. Many analysts do not consider a carbon tax to be politically realistic, while environmental advocates prefer the certainty offered by a declining cap on carbon emissions.

HEADLINE: The Old-Fashioned Pleasures of a Quiet Place

BYLINE: By AUSTIN CONSIDINE

 BODY:
WHEN I was about 12 years old, my grandfather bought a fishing cabin on a tiny lake in northeastern Indiana, in the middle of the state's Amish country. The horse-drawn buggies, the clapboard farmhouses with linens hanging out to dry and the ubiquitous red barns held a simple allure that contrasted with my suburban Indianapolis upbringing. And as my adult life grows increasingly complicated, each return visit brings a new and deeper appreciation.
 Long before my grandfather was drawn to these glacial lakes and rolling plains, the Amish came for the abundance of inexpensive timberland and rich, fertile soil. The first to arrive, in 1841, were four men from Somerset County in western Pennsylvania. 
 Today, the area is home to the third-largest Amish community in the country, after Holmes County, Ohio, and Lancaster County, Pa., with a population exceeding 20,000 -- attracting tourists each year to the bakeries, family-style restaurants and cultural attractions of Elkhart and LaGrange Counties. 
 But the community there is undergoing rapid changes, at least by Amish standards. For centuries, they maintained an insular, agrarian society. But population growth and a land inheritance system that divided once-broad farmlands into ever-diminishing parcels have forced most Amish to find new ways to make a living. 
 In recent years, many worked for the region's RV manufacturers and related businesses. But the economic downturn has torpedoed that industry, bringing widespread layoffs: unemployment in LaGrange and Elkhart Counties, about 19 percent in March, is among the highest in the country. Some Amish, who always rejected government welfare on religious principles, are collecting unemployment checks for the first time. 
 Others have returned to more traditional pursuits, like baking, and furniture- and quilt-making, hoping to make ends meet by revealing more of their lives to tourists.
 Merlin and Mary Lou Mullet began serving home-cooked communal meals in a banquet room at their modest country farmhouse in Nappanee in 2004. ''I was working at a trailer factory, and I was working anywhere from 60 to 70 hours a week at that time,'' Mr. Mullet said. ''It just seemed like we were struggling all the time.''
 He still works a day job but with more regular hours. Mrs. Mullet does most of the cooking, while their seven children help cook, serve and clean up. 
 Dinners at the Mullets' home are by reservation, and require a minimum of 10 guests. Visitors can call ahead to see if they can tag along with another group. (You'll have to call ahead regardless: the Amish don't allow phones in their homes, but many have phone booths on their properties for business purposes. Leaving messages and waiting for a return call is standard.) 
 Though the lifestyle has changed for Amish families like the Mullets, their food is still based on the starch-heavy, butter-rich meals of a hard laboring, agricultural past. 
 Perhaps the best way to describe Amish cooking is ultimate comfort food. The Mullets served rolls fresh from the oven slathered with apple butter; country-fried chicken that had been steam roasted until the meat practically fell off the bone; and a sort of deconstructed pot pie I concocted of chicken and noodles with chicken pepper gravy atop mashed potatoes. 
 After a round of seconds came the nail in my coffin: blueberry pie, ice cream and a warm, moist hunk of turtle cake, made with chocolate, pecans and caramel. It was lucky Merlin and I had become fast friends, because I couldn't move. We sat and swapped stories well after everyone else had left, sipping cup after cup of coffee, digesting as best we could. The whole thing cost $16.
 There are at least a dozen other home-dining options, but if you don't want to make arrangements yourself, an alternative is Miller Buggy Line Tours, which will take you to one of these Amish homes at the end of a long and pleasant horse-and-buggy ride. The tour includes a noodle shop, a dairy farm and cheese-making at the Deutsch Kase Haus, which produces from 45,000 to 60,000 pounds of cheese each day. 
 Even if the area's big Amish-themed restaurants, bakeries and food shops are rarely Amish-owned, most of the bakers and cooks are Amish.
 I thought the Dutch apple pie I had last fall at the Blue Gate in Shipshewana, with its brown sugar crumble coating, was the best piece of pie I had ever had. But my new favorite is the Country Lane Bakery -- a true Amish bakery on a family farm near Middlebury. Like all Amish-owned businesses, it is lit mostly by gas lamps, with on-site generators providing electricity where needed (self-generated electricity is allowed at most Amish businesses; it's being off the grid that counts). The apricot turnovers are moist and syrupy-sweet.
 Aside from cooking, quilt-making has long been an Amish pastime. The Little Helpers Quilt Shop, on the family farm of Freeman and Carol Wingard in Shipshewana, sells quilts from around the area, including many made by Ms. Wingard's mother. 
 Amish country is also bed-and-breakfast country, with accommodations in old Victorian homes, farmhouses or even restored barns. The Amish-owned Farmstead Bed and Breakfast near Shipshewana lacks electricity-based amenities like television, air-conditioning and Internet access, so a stay on the 80-acre working farm is a true getaway. 
 Nappanee and Shipshewana are filled with dozens of arts-and-crafts shops and furniture stores. This is particularly true of Shipshewana, where a 40-acre flea market houses some 1,100 vendors from May through October. 
 The Amish have increasingly turned to making furniture. I visited two furniture places, both with the name of Lambright -- Lambright Woodworking and Lambright Comfort Chairs -- but under different ownership. At the former, I was shown around the factory behind the showroom, where tours are given daily. Tools are powered pneumatically or hydraulically, and the factory floor is lighted mostly with gas lamps.
 At Lambright Comfort Chairs, I spoke with Vernon Lambright. His shop is similarly powered and employs Amish furniture makers who had all ridden their bikes home for lunch. 
 We stepped outside and gazed at the green fields surrounding us. I mentioned how much I had loved spending summers nearby when I was younger. He looked around, breathed deeply, then exhaled with satisfaction. ''I like it here,'' he said. ''This is where I grew up, and this is where I want to stay.'' 
 I told him I didn't blame him. He smiled. 
 ''Just about any time at night, you can come out here and hear the clip-clopping of horses' hooves,'' he said. ''It's peaceful.''

HEADLINE: An Affordable Salvation

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
The 2008 election ended the reign of junk science in our nation's capital, and the chances of meaningful action on climate change, probably through a cap-and-trade system on emissions, have risen sharply. 
 But the opponents of action claim that limiting emissions would have devastating effects on the U.S. economy. So it's important to understand that just as denials that climate change is happening are junk science, predictions of economic disaster if we try to do anything about climate change are junk economics.
 Yes, limiting emissions would have its costs. As a card-carrying economist, I cringe when ''green economy'' enthusiasts insist that protecting the environment would be all gain, no pain. 
 But the best available estimates suggest that the costs of an emissions-limitation program would be modest, as long as it's implemented gradually. And committing ourselves now might actually help the economy recover from its current slump.
 Let's talk first about those costs.
 A cap-and-trade system would raise the price of anything that, directly or indirectly, leads to the burning of fossil fuels. Electricity, in particular, would become more expensive, since so much generation takes place in coal-fired plants. 
 Electric utilities could reduce their need to purchase permits by limiting their emissions of carbon dioxide -- and the whole point of cap-and-trade is, of course, to give them an incentive to do just that. But the steps they would take to limit emissions, such as shifting to other energy sources or capturing and sequestering much of the carbon dioxide they emit, would without question raise their costs.
 If emission permits were auctioned off -- as they should be -- the revenue thus raised could be used to give consumers rebates or reduce other taxes, partially offsetting the higher prices. But the offset wouldn't be complete. Consumers would end up poorer than they would have been without a climate-change policy.
 But how much poorer? Not much, say careful researchers, like those at the Environmental Protection Agency or the Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Even with stringent limits, says the M.I.T. group, Americans would consume only 2 percent less in 2050 than they would have in the absence of emission limits. That would still leave room for a large rise in the standard of living, shaving only one-twentieth of a percentage point off the average annual growth rate. 
 To be sure, there are many who insist that the costs would be much higher. Strange to say, however, such assertions nearly always come from people who claim to believe that free-market economies are wonderfully flexible and innovative, that they can easily transcend any constraints imposed by the world's limited resources of crude oil, arable land or fresh water. 
 So why don't they think the economy can cope with limits on greenhouse gas emissions? Under cap-and-trade, emission rights would just be another scarce resource, no different in economic terms from the supply of arable land. 
 Needless to say, people like Newt Gingrich, who says that cap-and-trade would ''punish the American people,'' aren't thinking that way. They're just thinking ''capitalism good, government bad.'' But if you really believe in the magic of the marketplace, you should also believe that the economy can handle emission limits just fine.
 So we can afford a strong climate change policy. And committing ourselves to such a policy might actually help us in our current economic predicament.
 Right now, the biggest problem facing our economy is plunging business investment. Businesses see no reason to invest, since they're awash in excess capacity, thanks to the housing bust and weak consumer demand.
 But suppose that Congress were to mandate gradually tightening emission limits, starting two or three years from now. This would have no immediate effect on prices. It would, however, create major incentives for new investment -- investment in low-emission power plants, in energy-efficient factories and more.
 To put it another way, a commitment to greenhouse gas reduction would, in the short-to-medium run, have the same economic effects as a major technological innovation: It would give businesses a reason to invest in new equipment and facilities even in the face of excess capacity. And given the current state of the economy, that's just what the doctor ordered.
 This short-run economic boost isn't the main reason to move on climate-change policy. The important thing is that the planet is in danger, and the longer we wait the worse it gets. But it is an extra reason to move quickly.
 So can we afford to save the planet? Yes, we can. And now would be a very good time to get started.

HEADLINE: Henri Bendel Plans to Stop Selling Clothes This Summer

BYLINE: By ERIC WILSON

 BODY:
A venerable name in New York retailing, Henri Bendel, is planning to stop selling clothes this summer and focus on accessories and beauty products as it struggles to lure shoppers during a prolonged recession. 
 Bendel's flagship store at 712 Fifth Avenue will also give up one of its three floors, according to the company's plans. 
 Several employees briefed on the plans said on Thursday that they were told that Bendel had decided to eliminate the fashion departments because there was no sign of a turnaround in the sale of high-ticket items, but that beauty and gift products were selling well and typically with much higher margins. About 8 percent of the employees will be laid off, including sales clerks and executives in its buying office, these people said. About 250 people work at Bendel.
 Luxury stores like Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue and Barneys New York have all eliminated hundreds of jobs and scaled back their orders from designers in reaction to the economy. Sales of $1,000 dresses and cashmere sweaters began to plummet last October. 
 But Bendel, a division of Limited Brands, is changing its business model, from the department store that was founded in 1895 to a more mall-like chain selling Bendel-branded beauty and gift items, like an $18 box of tea in the company's signature brown-and-white stripes.
 In a news release, the company positioned the changes as a measure for expanding the Henri Bendel brand. Six accessories-only stores are to open this year in shopping centers nationwide. 
 But for most of its history, Bendel had operated as a single store, famous for its ''store of shops'' concept and the image of high fashion, seen recently in its cameos on ''Gossip Girl'' and, under a pseudonym, in ''Confessions of a Shopaholic.'' 
 A spokeswoman for Limited Brands would not make its executives available for comment.

ICE PEOPLE
 Opens on Friday in Manhattan.
Directed by Anne Aghion
 1 hour 17 minutes; not rated 
 The ice in ''Ice People'' is instantly compelling: endless white-on-white vistas, ethereal panoramas of cold. Culled from a four-month trip to Antarctica by the filmmaker Anne Aghion, this modest little documentary sets its lens on one of the most majestic and forbidding landscapes on the planet. 
 The people of ''Ice People'' take a while longer to come into focus. The movie, which runs a scant 77 minutes but feels four times as long, is so maddeningly slow to develop any sort of narrative shape that you begin to suspect Ms. Aghion of doodling. She is, as it turns out, a canny portraitist, and her patience in divulging the context of her project pays off as the movie sinks something of the feel (brr!) and routine of an Antarctic expedition into your bones. 
 Her companions are a group of academic geologists sifting through rock in search of fossils, though to what end isn't entirely clear. What's obvious is their tenacious, obsessive joy in work -- which, to the outside observer, simply looks like a bunch of grubby people unusually committed to sitting in dirt. 
 The film's hesitation, lack of rhetorical inflation and commitment to humble observation generate a tough poetry. ''Ice People'' sticks in the mind. NATHAN LEE

HEADLINE: Motorola Scrambles to Restore Its Lost Cellphone Glory

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

 BODY:
Motorola has had its ups and downs. Fifteen years ago, a gray brick Motorola handset was synonymous with mobile phone. Sales slipped, but the company came back five years ago with the sleek Razr, the must-have cellphone. 
 Motorola's cellphone sales are now falling almost 50 percent a year. Bereft of a smash hit, the company finds itself in its darkest hour. Once responsible for half of the cellphone sales in the world, its share of the market has plummeted to 6 percent. 
 Industry analysts are questioning not whether Motorola will again become dominant but whether the handset division will survive. 
 ''They're stuck heavily in the handset death spiral,'' said Edward Snyder, an analyst with Charter Equity Research. ''If they have tens of billions of dollars they want to pour into this black hole, they might be able to save it. Even then, there are no guarantees.''
 Sanjay K. Jha, Motorola's co-chief executive who was brought in from Qualcomm last year, still contends he can fix the handset business. He said that for now, he was not interested in market share or hit products -- not with losses mounting. ''I'm interested in break-even performance,'' he said in an interview. ''I'm trying to build a stable machine.''
 ''We need to have profits under all circumstances, and then have hits on top of that,'' he said Thursday after Motorola announced that the operating loss in the handset division grew to $509 million in the first quarter from a loss of $418 million a year ago.
 These are seemingly modest goals for a company that has strong brand recognition. But new tough competitors like LG, Samsung and Apple have transformed the market with phones that can do anything a computer can do and more. 
 Motorola's first-quarter results demonstrated how challenging Mr. Jha's task is. The company said mobile device sales dropped 45 percent to $1.8 billion. It sold 14.7 million handsets, down from 27.4 million a year ago.
 The company, including a more successful unit that makes set-top boxes and other electronic equipment, said the quarter's net loss grew to $231 million, or 10 cents a share, on revenue of $5.37 billion. A year ago, Motorola, based in Schaumberg, Ill., had a net loss of $194 million, or 9 cents a share on revenue of $7.4 billion.
 A consensus of Wall Street analysts compiled by Thomson Reuters had projected Motorola would lose 11 cents a share, excluding one-time charges. On that basis, the company reported a loss of 8 cents a share. The analysts projected sales of $5.6 billion for the quarter. 
 Shares of Motorola fell 7.2 percent on Thursday to close at $5.53. 
 Todd Koffman, an industry analyst with Raymond James, who said he has a strong buy rating on Motorola stock, said that skeptics were judging the company too quickly. Mr. Koffman said that Mr. Jha should be given more time to prove himself.
 ''This quarter's results are not relevant,'' Mr. Koffman said. ''The June quarter's results are not relevant.'' The real test for Motorola's handset division will come in the second half of this year, he said, when the company releases handsets that have Mr. Jha's prints all over them. ''To draw some sort of conclusion based on today's products is shortsighted,'' Mr. Koffman said.
 Mr. Jha said that he needed to cut the losses and simultaneously build a series of new phones. In the current and next quarter, he said in the interview, Motorola will begin shipping touch-screen phones, the kind Apple, Samsung and LG already have. In the fourth quarter, Motorola will release ''a few'' phones based on Google's Android operating system, he said.
 He declined to specify how many new phone models the company would release this year.
 Introducing a host of phones is critical to Motorola's survival. Phone makers that do not come up with big hits or a constant flow of midtier successes begin to lose the pricing power and influence with the mobile phone carriers like AT&T or Verizon that determine which phones get into consumers' hands.
 Roger Entner, an industry analyst with Nielsen, said a vivid example of Motorola's struggles was the release early this year of its phone called the Evoke. The device, meant to compete in the growing smartphone category, was not picked up by the big carriers, like AT&T, Verizon, Sprint or T-Mobile, but by smaller carriers, like Alltel.
 ''The niche that Evoke is filling is already filled by several other phones,'' Mr. Entner said. Motorola ''continues to develop late on products.'' Motorola is pushing its first touch-screen device as other companies are working on second- and third-generation devices, he said.
 ''Motorola is not one of those companies that can blame its woes on the economy,'' he said. ''It's purely self-inflicted.''
 James Kelleher, an analyst with Argus Research, said Mr. Jha's more modest goals are appropriate. Success, Mr. Kelleher said, might be defined as being a strong regional player that settles for less than 10 percent of worldwide market share.
 ''The analogy is General Motors,'' he said. ''They once had 50 percent market share and they're not getting it back.''

HEADLINE: Risk Unclear, Some Fliers Grow Skittish Over Travel

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
As fears about swine flu spread, the airline industry is bracing for the worst, worried that travelers will cancel their plans to fly to or from not only Mexico, but also almost anywhere else in the world.
 The airlines that depend on traffic to Mexico are the hardest hit at the moment. ''Airlines tell me that southbound Mexico bookings are close to zero,'' said Henry H. Harteveldt, a travel analyst at Forrester Research. ''Mexican leisure destinations have almost no volume.'' 
 But, he added, some travelers appear to be switching their vacation plans to other places, with ''some bookings coming in now for destinations like Florida, Caribbean, et cetera,'' he said. 
 Still, industry analysts are worried that if the toll from the flu -- which health officials are calling H1N1 -- worsens, people will become wary of getting on any plane.
 Those concerns seemed to surface Thursday morning, when Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said in an interview on the ''Today'' show that he would advise his family to stay off airplanes. ''It's not that it's going to Mexico,'' he said in the interview. ''It's that you're in a confined aircraft. When one person sneezes, it goes all the way through the aircraft.''
 Mr. Biden's office later issued a clarification, saying that ''the advice he is giving family members is the same advice the administration is giving to all Americans: that they should avoid unnecessary air travel to and from Mexico.'' 
 In response, the travel industry issued a statement pointing out that all-out travel bans had not been issued. ''According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, swine influenza should not discourage people from traveling to or within the United States,'' Roger Dow, president and chief executive of the U.S. Travel Association, said in a statement. ''Elected officials must strike a delicate balance of accurately and adequately informing citizens of health concerns without unduly discouraging travel and other important economic activity.'' 
 The Air Transport Association of America, which represents airlines, took a similar tack. ''The airlines have been working daily with government agencies, none of whom suggest people avoid air travel, unless they are not feeling well,'' James C. May, the group's president and chief executive, said in a statement. ''The fact is that the air onboard a commercial aircraft is cleaner than that in most public buildings.'' 
 Because the concerns about the flu outbreak have been raised just in the last few days, it is too soon to have definitive numbers on the impact on air traffic. ''I wouldn't be surprised certainly if bookings had dropped significantly to Mexico,'' said Philip A. Baggaley, an airline credit analyst for Standard & Poor's. ''But whether it has moved beyond that to any material degree is an open question.''
 Travel agents said Wednesday that people continued to plan trips. ''People are still booking airline tickets,'' said Brian Hoyt, a spokesman for Orbitz, the online travel agency. 
 Yet some travelers are weighing the risks of flying, as recent reader posts on the New York Times Web site suggest. 
 ''My husband and I are 75 and 74 respectively, both of us recovering from cancer,'' wrote one reader, Lorraine Robertson. ''We are scheduled to fly from Tampa, Fla., to Newark, N.J., next week. Tampa airport is a hub for people flying from Mexico to other parts of the United States. We do have the option of driving, which we are in good shape to do. Which is the better choice at this time? I want to make a rational decision, not an emotional one. Can you help us decide? Thanks.''

 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'GUSTAVE CAILLEBOTTE: IMPRESSIONIST PAINTINGS FROM PARIS TO THE SEA,' through July 5. Thirty-some years ago, the museum had a big success with a Caillebotte retrospective that more or less introduced American audiences to an artist who was an Impressionist by association rather than by style. His three best-known pictures, ''The Floor Scrapers,'' ''The Pont de l'Europe'' and ''Paris Street, Rainy Day,'' all grand urban scenes from the late 1870s, are absent from this show, which is a more modest enterprise than a survey. But Caillebotte was a painter as interesting for his weaknesses as for his strengths, and any exposure is valuable. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. 
 JAPAN SOCIETY: 'KRAZY! THE DELIRIOUS WORLD OF ANIME + MANGA + VIDEO GAMES,' through June 14. This show addresses a vibrant chapter in the history of visual storytelling: a specifically Japanese set of approaches that has gained a worldwide following over the past two decades. It will not live up to its promise for devoted followers of Japanese pop culture, but as a multimedia sampler including comics, graphic novels, video games, action figures, animated cartoons and more, it might entice the uninitiated to explore the field more deeply. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Ken Johnson) 
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ROXY PAINE ON THE ROOF: MAELSTROM,'through Oct. 25. An awesome spectacle awaits visitors to the museum's roof garden: a gnarly thicket of trees and branches extending 130 feet from one end of the open-air deck to the other and rising 29 feet overhead. It looks as if a tornado had ripped through Central Park and de-posited its gleanings here -- except that it is all made of shiny metal pipe, as if all that wood had been transformed by someone with a stainless-steel Midas touch.(212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson) 
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'ON THE MONEY: CARTOONS FOR THE NEW YORKER,' through May 24. Go to this exhibition and you will see not only how money is like a cartoon, but also how cartoons shed light on money. In more than 80 drawings, the complexities of economic theory dissolve into the far more pungent currency of social relations, of status and snobbery, pretense and pride, distilling finance to its human essence. Money becomes a chit in the social game, a medium of exchange in a world careering between boom and bust. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Edward Rothstein) 
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PERFORMANCE 1: TEHCHING HSIEH,'through May 18. This small, gripping exhibition -- the first in a series dedicated to performance art -- centers on the documentation of ''Cage Piece'' (1978-79), the first of five ''One Year Performances'' by the deprivation-prone Taiwanese artist Tehching Hsieh. The piece entailed spending one year doing absolutely nothing in nearly solitary confinement in a cell-like cage, built in the artist's studio. The show includes the cell, as well as daily photographs of the artist that measure the year in the growth of his hair. Few performance pieces communicate the demands of this particular genre in such a basic, resonant way, or its ability to expand our understanding of time and space with such simple force.(212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Roberta Smith) 
 THE NEW MUSEUM: 'THE GENERATIONAL: YOUNGER THAN JESUS,' through July 5. The latest local survey to challenge the pre-eminence of the Whitney Biennial is big, international in scope and age-specific. As the title implies, only artists 33 or younger were considered for inclusion. The result is a serious, carefully considered show, but one that with a few magnetic entries aside -- a video by Cyprien Galliard; an animation by Wojciech Bakowski; a madcap Ryan Trecartin installation -- feels sedate for a youthfest. Despite the global reach, it's oddly familiar, like a more-substantial-than-average weekend gallery hop in Chelsea and the Lower East Side, right down to token African and Asian imports. Still, there are many intriguing artists to look (and listen) for, among them the filmmakers Keren Cytter and Luke Fowler; the painter Tala Madani; the collagist Haris Epaminonda; the digital whiz-kid Mark Essen; the photographer Elad Lassry; and the multitaskers Ruth Ewan, Ziad Antar, Dineo Seshee Bopape, Liu Chuang, Ahmet Ogut, Guthrie Lonergan, Ciprian Muresan and Icaro Zorbar. There is also, as it happens, a much livelier survey to be found in an accompanying book called ''Younger Than Jesus: Artist Directory,'' which features nearly 500 artists who didn't make the final exhibition cut. A panel discussion led by Brian Sholis with three now older-than-Jesus artists of earlier generations -- Carroll Dunham, Joan Jonas and Mira Schor -- on Saturday at 3 p.m. should be worth hearing. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Cotter) 
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'JONATHAN HOROWITZ: AND/ OR,' through Sept. 14. Andy Warhol's grandchildren, numerous beyond count, have cashed in on his rich and radical legacy to see what further possibilities it might yield. Such is the case with the New York artist Jonathan Horowitz in this smart, crisply edited retrospective. The works evoke the media-saturated art of the 1970s, the neo-Conceptualist consumer art of the 1980s, and the identity art of the 1990s, landing in a Never-Neverland era, in which analog is poised to turn to digital, and Doris Day and Paris Hilton have equal currency. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Cotter) 
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'JENNY HOLZER: PROTECT PROTECT,'through May 31. After decades of pelting us with unsettling, increasingly relevant portents, Jenny Holzer can say, ''I told you so.'' This 15-year survey proves that her signature LED-sign conflations of poetry, politics, reading and seeing are ever more dazzling; her warnings about the military-commercial-entertainment complex ever more pertinent. In addition, as time has overtaken her, Ms. Holzer has turned from soothsaying to simply reporting the facts. Her latest light works and paintings take their language and motifs entirely from declassified and redacted government documents concerning the war in Iraq. This is a beautiful show, but not a pretty sight.(212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith) 
 ANDRE ETHIER: 'HEADING SOUTH,' through May 16. Funny, faux-naive paintings by this Toronto artist resemble the works of a semitalented high school stoner steeped in heavy metal music, fantasy novels and French Symbolism. Mr. Ethier paints on easel-size panels in oleaginous glazes, creating an oozy, finger-painting-like luminosity. He makes cartoonish portraits of gnomes, cyclopes, old hippies and other characters who seem to belong to some ramshackle place like a derelict neighborhood in ''The Hobbit.'' Derek Eller Gallery, 615 West 27th Street, (212) 206-6411, derekeller.com. 
 PETER SAUL: 'NEW PAINTINGS,' through May 23. The irrepressible Mr. Saul continues his cheerfully acerbic ways. With their pneumatic forms neatly rendered with a spongy, semi-pointillist touch in glowing colors, his cartoon paintings are like enlarged stills from a twisted animated film. In ''Viva la Difference,'' a grinning bon vivant with a martini in one hand wraps his arm around an amorphous blob that sprouts multiple breasts and is perforated by numerous vaginal orifices. Talk about your male gaze! David Nolan Gallery, 527 West 29th Street, (212) 925-6190, davidnolangallery.com. (Johnson) 
 WARD SHELLEY: 'WHO INVENTED THE AVANT GARDE (AND OTHER HALF-TRUTHS),' through May 17. Drawing with ink and paint on sheets of Mylar in a cartoonish style, Mr. Shelley creates intriguingly eccentric flow charts that analyze particular historic developments, mostly having to do with modern art. In the gallery's back room he has installed hundreds of cardboard boxes, each with an amusing label describing its supposed contents: ''Pandora's Socks'' and ''Submerging Artists,'' for example. Pierogi, 177 North Ninth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-2144, pierogi2000.com. (Johnson) 
 DREXEL UNIVERSITY: 'INK NOT INK,' through May 9. Organized by the Shenzhen Art Museum in China, and making a one-stop appearance in the United States, this ambitious exhibition of 40 artists, most of them living in China, many of them working on a large scale, is intended to give a sense of the many uses to which the ink medium and its associated techniques, time-honored in China, are being put today. Landscape makes an expected appearance, but much of the work is figurative or abstract. Forms range from conventional brush-and-ink on paper, to sculpture and collage. An immense hanging piece by the well-known artist Wenda Gu is made of human hair. As Abbie Dean and Joseph Gregory, who coordinated the show, point out, after the suppressions of the Cultural Revolution and the innovations of globalism, the future of ink painting in China remains an open question, and a fascinating one. Sponsored by the Antoinette Westphal College of Media Art and Design, the show is in three Drexel locations: the Bossone Research Center and the Paul Peck Alumni Center, which are next door to each other, and the Leonard Pearlstein Gallery in Nesbitt Hall, a short walk away. Drexel University, Antoinette Westphal College of Media Arts & Design, 33rd and Market Streets, Philadelphia, (215) 895-2548, drexel.edu/inknotink. (Cotter) 
 LAURIE ANDERSON: 'FROM THE AIR: TWO INSTALLATIONS'; closes on Sunday. Ms. Anderson, the artist and cross-over pop star, here presents two modest works. An audio piece has a high-tech overhead speaker projecting quiet sounds and poetic fragments of speech in such a way that it seems as if they were inside your head. The other piece is in the form of a miniature video projection in which Ms. Anderson tells a story about vultures menacing her little dog in the mountains of Northern California. It's about post-9/11 New York. Location One, 26 Greene Street, at Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 334-3347, location1.org. (Johnson) 
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 2009 YEAR OF FASHION; closes on Sunday. Four synergistic shows inaugurate the museum's yearlong focus on fashion photography. Leading off is the crackling survey ''Weird Beauty: Fashion Photography Now'': a floor-to-ceiling, push-pull installation that clocks the genre as a fast-moving collective expression that is as esoteric as abstract art. Stylists, in particular, shine. ''This Is Not a Fashion Photograph'' reveals faces, bodies, garments, poses and style in a century's worth of nonfashion photographs by everyone from Jacob Riis to Malick Sidibe. ''Edward Steichen: In High Fashion, the Conde Nast Years, 1923-1937'' affirms fashion photography's short history by examining how this pioneer more or less invented both fashion photography and celebrity portraiture. ''Munkacsi's Lost Archive'' is less an exhibition than a prelude to one, but it elucidates post-Steichen developments by highlighting Martin Munkacsi, a photographer who set fashion models in motion, further blurring the line between fashion and nonfashion photography. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, www.icp.org. (Smith) 
 ALFREDO JAAR: 'THE SOUND OF SILENCE'; closes on Saturday. Using human tragedy as an artistic readymade has definite pros and cons, as this carefully orchestrated film installation proves. It centers on an incendiary Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph of a starving Sudanese child, and can leave you feeling moved yet irked, raw yet manipulated. Its immediate subject is the ungovernable life of the photograph, a nanosecond in an arc leading up to and then away from its own creation, a tipping point between its cause and effect. Its larger subject is the inexorable way human suffering causes further suffering. Galerie Lelong, 528 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 315-0470, galerielelong.com. (Smith) 
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'THE THAW COLLECTION OF MASTER DRAWINGS: ACQUISITIONS SINCE 2002'; closes on Sunday. The Thaw Collection of Master Drawings, promised to the Morgan Library & Museum, has been introduced to the public in a series of exhibitions since 1975, each reflecting the latest additions by the former art dealer Eugene V. Thaw and his wife, Clare. This installment of 80 recently acquired drawings from the past five centuries is a bit smaller than the last one in 2002-3, though it includes sure-to-please works by Ingres, Gauguin and others. Many selections reflect the Thaws' passion for 19th-century German Romantic art, which may not be for all tastes. The curators make the most of this historically unbalanced group, however, sketching out a pragmatically loose chronology. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. 
 'LUKE MURPHY: CERTAINTY SHELTER'; closes on Sunday. The ingredients in the cryptic, complicated but clean-lined third New York solo by this artist include flesh flowers, Geiger counters, uranium glass, gorgeous projections and decay. The result is a nice combination of the brainy and the beautiful, though you may want to do some reading to get the full effect. The artist has provided an essay, and there's another by the art historian Monroe Denton, which leaps effortlessly from Nietzsche and Warhol to Robert Frost and Oliver Wendell Holmes. Canada, 55 Chrystie Street, near Hester Street, Lower East Side, (212) 925-4631, canadanewyork.com. (Cotter) 
 GAVIN TURK: 'JAZZZ'; closes on Saturday. A nonexpert could mistake the paintings in this show for vintage Jackson Pollocks. Mr. Turk made them by repeatedly dripping his own signature on canvases up to 23 feet wide. They're clever meditations on identity and authorship, as is a film in which the artist imitates a famous 18th-century chess-playing automaton known as ''the Mechanical Turk.'' Sean Kelly Gallery, 528 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-1181, skny.com. (Johnson) 
 FRANZ WEST: 'WORKS FROM THE 1990S'; closes on Saturday. A selection of Mr. West's first plastered paper-pulp sculptures that used color asserts a wonderful formal beauty and inchoate rawness. The pulp is crude -- quasi-digested papier mache, you might say -- giving the rich colors an underlying sense of decay. Often mounted on ingeniously improvised pedestals, the shapes evoke recently excavated fragments of some sort. Mr. West emerges here as an heir to Giacometti (both early and late) and Claes Oldenburg's plaster pieces. He borrowed something from each and took it further. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677, zwirnerandwirth.com. (Smith)

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending Slipped in March

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Workers earned less in March and consumers spent less, the government reported on Thursday, as people worried about job losses socked away more money in savings accounts.
 A day earlier, the government released figures showing an unexpected increase in consumer spending in the first quarter, offering one of the few bright spots in an otherwise dreary accounting of the country's overall economic output. But the monthly report released Thursday showed that while consumer spending rose sharply in January, its gains tapered off in February and reversed themselves in March, declining by a larger-than-expected 0.2 percent. 
 Consumer spending, which accounts for some 70 percent of economic activity, tumbled as the financial crisis erupted late last year. The increased spending in the first quarter was partly a result of higher-than-normal tax returns and lower energy prices. Economists expect spending to remain essentially flat as the country tries to climb out of a 16-month recession.
 ''There should be great concern on this front as we enter the summer months,'' Dan Greenhaus, an analyst in the equity strategy group of Miller Tabak & Company, wrote in a research note. ''Unemployment continues to move higher, and it's very clear that as of now, businesses are simply not hiring and virtually every metric on the labor front has yet to get better.''
 The Commerce Department reported that personal incomes fell 0.3 percent in March. Incomes have fallen in four of the last five months as employers trying to weather the recession cut pay, furlough workers and cut jobs by the thousands.
 The personal savings rate, which dipped below zero as Americans maximized their use of credit cards and tapped big home equity lines of credit, grew to 4.2 percent in March, from 4 percent a month earlier. People saved $455.3 billion, an increase of $22.7 billion from February.
 The spending report came as the Labor Department reported that first-time claims for unemployment insurance fell by 13,000, to a seasonally adjusted 631,000. The number of continuing jobless claims kept rising, to 6.3 million for the week ending April 18 from 6.1 million a week earlier.
 The country has lost more than five million jobs since the recession began in December 2007, and unemployment has climbed to 8.5 percent. Many economists say it will crest at 10 percent by the time the economy begins to recover.

HEADLINE: Senate Refuses to Let Judges Fix Mortgages in Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Senate handed a victory to the banking industry on Thursday, defeating a Democratic proposal that would have given homeowners in financial trouble greater flexibility to renegotiate the terms of their mortgages. 
 The House of Representatives, meanwhile, overwhelmingly approved a bill backed by the Obama administration that would limit the ability of credit card companies to charge high fees and penalties. The bill, approved 357 to 70, still faces obstacles in the Senate, where -- as the action on Thursday illustrated -- the industry has more clout, particularly among Republicans and moderate Democrats. In recent days the White House, partly in response to polls showing the significant public outrage over high fees charged by credit card companies, has begun to work for its passage.
 The mortgage provision garnered only 45 votes in the Senate, falling well short of the 60 votes necessary to break a threatened filibuster to a measure sponsored by Senator Richard Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, that would give bankruptcy judges greater flexibility to modify mortgages. In recent weeks, major banks and bank trade associations worked closely with Senate Republicans to stop the measure. Twelve Democrats joined all the Republicans in voting against it. 
 The defeat clears the way for a final vote as early as Friday for the legislation, which has several features that the banking industry has sought. One provision would have the effect of reducing a proposed special premium the banks would owe the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation later that year by more than 50 percent -- a $7.7 billion saving. A second provision would make permanent the temporary increase in deposits guaranteed by the F.D.I.C., to $250,000, from $100,000. 
 Once the Senate completes its action on the legislation, it will have to be reconciled with a similar measure already adopted in the House before it can become law.
 The House bill contains the bankruptcy provision. But the Senate's defeat of the so-called bankruptcy cramdown measure all but makes certain it will disappear from the final bill. 
 It also demonstrates that, even though Democrats are close to gaining 60 votes in the Senate with the recent decision by Senator Arlen Specter to leave the Republican Party, the increasing number of Democrats does not prevent the Republicans -- with the support of a handful of moderate or conservative Democrats -- from blocking legislation. Mr. Specter voted against the provision.
 Bank lobbyists had maintained that the legislation, if adopted, would have resulted in higher rates for all mortgage holders. A letter signed by 12 industry organizations this week to senators warned that the legislation would ''have the unintended consequence of further destabilizing the markets.''
 ''Though interest rates today are at all-time lows, this legislation would result in higher costs for future borrowers,'' the letter said.
 But supporters of the legislation disputed that argument. President Obama sought the cramdown provision during the election, although the White House has done virtually nothing to move it through Congress.

HEADLINE: Leaving, but Feeling Like a Winner

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
He is the first chief executive in decades to lead a major car company into bankruptcy, but Robert L. Nardelli hardly considers himself a failure.
 Instead, Mr. Nardelli was holding his head high Thursday for helping keep Chrysler in business -- bankruptcy or not.
 ''It's not the fate I would have chosen, but it has allowed us to save the company,'' Mr. Nardelli said in an interview. ''I think the cup is half full, and not half empty.'' 
 His efforts were recognized Thursday by President Obama, who singled out Mr. Nardelli in his remarks for his ''positive and constructive role'' in getting deals with the Italian automaker Fiat, the United Automobile Workers and Chrysler's largest lenders that will be integral to a successful restructuring in bankruptcy court.
 Once Chrysler emerges from Chapter 11, Mr. Nardelli, 60, will leave the company as it transitions to new management selected by a reconstituted board.
 It was his decision to leave at that point, he said. ''I got us here,'' he said. ''And I feel good about getting us here.'' 
 Still, Chrysler's trip into bankruptcy was hardly the comeback that Mr. Nardelli envisioned when he was hired by Cerberus Capital Management to run the automaker in August 2007.
 Mr. Nardelli came to Detroit with a reputation as an autocratic executive who had clashed with shareholders and directors at his previous company, Home Depot.
 He methodically tried to change that perception at Chrysler, where his long days of work and disciplined approach to business decisions won over many skeptical employees and industry experts.
 A year ago, the privately held Chrysler was flush with cash and leaner than at any time in its history after rounds of job reductions, plant closings and production cuts.
 Mr. Nardelli said he believed that Chrysler was poised for a renaissance -- until the slumping United States economy dragged new-car sales into the ditch.
 By last fall, Chrysler was spending billions of dollars in cash reserves and running dangerously close to insolvency. Only a $4 billion federal loan kept the company from shutting its doors months ago.
 When he joined his fellow chief executives from General Motors and the Ford Motor Company last November to seek government aid for the industry, Mr. Nardelli was set against taking Chrysler into bankruptcy.
 Even during marathon negotiations in recent days with Chrysler's unions and banks, he held out hope that bankruptcy could be avoided.
 ''I'm disappointed that we couldn't get all of the lenders to agree,'' he said. ''Filing for Chapter 11 was obviously not my preference.''
 He says he sees a bright future for Chrysler in its alliance with Fiat, which can provide small cars and fuel-efficient engine technology that Chrysler sorely lacks.
 Once out of bankruptcy, Chrysler will have a new board of nine members -- the government will select six and Fiat will choose three. 
 That board will select a chief executive for Chrysler. While Mr. Nardelli said he was never told he could not compete for the job, he felt it was ''the right time to transition'' to a new chief executive, possibly Fiat's leader, Sergio Marchionne.
 ''I tend to be proactive,'' Mr. Nardelli said. ''I felt, let's get past this issue and get it off the table and behind us.''
 Thomas LaSorda, a vice chairman who was Mr. Nardelli's immediate predecessor as chief executive, will also be leaving Chrysler. Mr. LaSorda, 54, said Thursday that he planned to retire, but had not set a date. Another vice chairman, James Press, did not make his future plans known during a conference call with reporters.
 In his relatively short time at the top of Chrysler, Mr. Nardelli did fulfill much of the agenda laid out for him by Cerberus. He streamlined the company and significantly lowered its costs, although tens of thousands of jobs were eliminated in the process.
 He said he would go back to Cerberus as an adviser, and then evaluate other opportunities.
 Yet wherever he ends up, Mr. Nardelli's business career will be defined, in part, by Chrysler's trip into bankruptcy.
 It has been an emotionally charged experience, particularly Thursday morning when he flew back to Detroit from Washington to be at Chrysler headquarters in time to watch Mr. Obama's speech.

HEADLINE: U.N. Seeks End to Razing of Homes in East Jerusalem

BYLINE: By ISABEL KERSHNER

DATELINE: JERUSALEM 

 BODY:
The United Nations is calling on Israel to freeze all pending demolition orders against Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem in a new report that reflects growing international concern over developments in the contested city. The report also urges Israel to provide solutions to the housing crisis there. 
 Scores of Palestinian-owned structures are demolished every year by the Israeli authorities on the grounds that they were built without the required permits. But many Palestinians say Israel limits construction to push them out of East Jerusalem, which they claim as the capital of a future Palestinian state. 
 The report states that only 13 percent of East Jerusalem land is currently zoned by the Israeli authorities for Palestinian construction, and much of that is already built up, severely restricting the possibility of obtaining a permit. More than a third of East Jerusalem, meanwhile, has been expropriated for Israeli construction since 1967, according to the report, while 22 percent is zoned for green areas and public infrastructure and 30 percent remains ''unplanned.'' 
 Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 war and then annexed it, after expanding the boundaries of the city into the West Bank. Israel claims sovereignty over all of Jerusalem, but the annexation has never been recognized by the United Nations or its member states. 
 The report, by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in the occupied Palestinian territories, was to be published Friday. An advance copy was made available to The New York Times. 
 Although the report was critical of Israeli policies, its tone was explanatory and it avoided defining political motivations on either side. 
 During a recent tour of East Jerusalem, Robert H. Serry, the United Nations special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, called for an immediate end to the demolitions, which he described as ''not helpful,'' fueling tensions at a time when ''the international community is trying to relaunch a results-oriented peace process.''
 Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton also spoke out against threatened demolitions and evictions in East Jerusalem during her visit to the region in March. Such activities, she said, are ''not in keeping with the obligations entered into under the 'road map,' '' the United States-backed peace plan of 2003.
 A spokesman for Jerusalem's mayor, Nir Barkat, said Thursday that City Hall could not comment on the United Nations report without seeing it, but that Mr. Barkat was ''committed to addressing the issue of affordable housing throughout the entirety of Jerusalem.'' In the coming weeks, the spokesman, Stephan Miller, said, Mr. Barkat will present his master plan for the city of Jerusalem ''which will, of course, include plans to provide more affordable housing in eastern Jerusalem.'' Mr. Miller added that the mayor ''will continue to uphold the rule of law and, as such, there will continue to be building demolitions if there is illegal construction.''
 The United Nations report, in exploring the reasons for the demolitions, noted that the process of applying for a building permit in East Jerusalem was lengthy and costly and that there was no guarantee that one would be issued in the end. Even for building on land zoned for Palestinian construction, applicants must submit a detailed area plan.
 Coming up with a detailed area plan -- including allocating land for public use, like roads -- is particularly difficult because of the unresolved land ownership disputes among Palestinian neighbors. 
 The Palestinian population of East Jerusalem, which stood at about 66,000 in 1967, is now about 250,000. In addition, more than 195,000 Israelis live in Jewish developments -- referred to as ''neighborhoods'' by the Israelis and as ''settlements'' by the United Nations -- in East Jerusalem.
 The Palestinian population growth, coupled with the difficulty in obtaining building permits, has led to a situation in which at least 28 percent of all Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem have been built in violation of Israeli zoning requirements, according to the United Nations report. At least 60,000 Palestinians are at risk of having their homes demolished as a result.
 One case highlighted in the report was that of Mahmoud Alayyan and his family, who live between the Palestinian neighborhood of Sur Baher and the Israeli development of East Talpiot. The house was built in 1963. An extension was added, without a permit, in 1999. Mr. Alayyan said he was told by the Israeli municipal authorities in 2000 that he could not get retroactive approval for the extension because his home was in a designated green area. 
 This year, he was told that the entire house was slated for demolition to make way for the expansion of East Talpiot. His case is pending in court. 
 Another case that received attention during Mr. Serry's tour of East Jerusalem on April 22 was that of the Hdaidun family, whose home was demolished that day. By the United Nations' count, it was the 19th such demolition this year. (In 2008 there were some 93; demolitions reached an annual peak of 133 in 2004.)
 When Mr. Serry's party arrived at the site, Amar Salameh al-Hdaidun, 39; his wife, Samia; and their five young children, some in school uniforms, were gathered by the heap of rubble that was their home. 
 Mr. Hdaidun said he and several neighbors had been going through a planning process for five years to try to change the zoning of their land from a designated green area to a residential area. He said they had spent some $45,000 on the plans, which were to be submitted by this July. A court order postponing demolition of the house expired in January, however, and Mr. Hdaidun did not apply for an extension. 
 Mr. Serry, a Dutch diplomat, was visibly moved and expressed his sympathy to the family, whose furniture and other belongings were piled up nearby. 
 ''I know how much Jerusalem is dear to many Israelis,'' Mr. Serry said. ''But it is also dear to Palestinians.''

HEADLINE: Personal Experience Weighs on Obama in Health Policy Debate

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In the weeks before he was elected president, Barack Obama confronted a life crisis all too common in families across America. His grandmother, who already had a diagnosis of terminal cancer, fell and broke her hip, possibly because of a mild stroke. The question became whether to replace her hip even though she was dying.
 As Mr. Obama recounted the story, his grandmother, Madelyn Dunham, decided to have the surgery, but then, two weeks after the operation, everything went downhill. Ultimately, Ms. Dunham, who helped raise Mr. Obama, died in Hawaii two days before her grandson was elected president. 
 Mr. Obama discussed the episode in an interview with The New York Times Magazine, posted online Wednesday and scheduled for print publication on Sunday, to point out one of the thorniest issues involved in overhauling health care: Much of the spending on medical care in the United States goes to people in their final months of life. If society is to rein in health costs, at what point are expensive operations like Ms. Dunham's hip replacement surgery no longer affordable?
 ''I don't know how much that hip replacement cost,'' Mr. Obama said in the interview with David Leonhardt of The Times. ''I would have paid out of pocket for that hip replacement, just because she's my grandmother. Whether, sort of in the aggregate, society making those decisions to give my grandmother, or everybody else's aging grandparents or parents, a hip replacement when they're terminally ill is a sustainable model is a very difficult question.''
 He went on to say: ''If somebody told me that my grandmother couldn't have a hip replacement and she had to lie there in misery in the waning days of her life, that would be pretty upsetting.''
 At the heart of the health care debate that will soon occupy Washington is just that conundrum. As an intellectual matter, it's one thing to say that it makes no sense for a country to spend so much on procedures that ultimately will do little to extend or improve the lives of those nearing death. But as a personal matter, it's another to deny your own grandmother an operation that may at least make her last days more comfortable.
 Some conservatives have cited Mr. Obama's story to make the case that his plan to expand access to health care and reduce costs ultimately will result in rationing, of the kind that might have denied his grandmother the surgery unless she paid the bill on her own. 
 ''To me, Obama is laying out the intellectual case for health care rationing while acknowledging the potential human costs of such a policy,'' wrote Matthew Continetti on the Web site of the Weekly Standard magazine. ''He's saying that, in order to contain costs, under a universal health care program his grandmother might have been denied that hip replacement, or forced to pay for it herself. This is the natural consequence of a universal policy, which would bankrupt the country without some form of rationing care.''
 Advocates on the other side of the debate reject the label. ''I think Obama was trying to invoke the notion of tradeoffs more than rationing,'' said Len Nichols, who directs the health care program at the New America Foundation, a Washington research organization. ''Curative care for his grandmother was futile. Rationing is when efficacious care is denied to save money, perhaps to provide basic care to another, but nevertheless consciously denied.''
 Drew Altman, president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, said that nothing envisioned in the current health care legislation would take decisions about end-of-life care away from patients or doctors. 
 ''One of the great lessons of the Clinton debate was not to scare the public that health reform would change their current medical arrangements,'' he noted. ''Health care is front and center again because of the problems average Americans are having paying their health care and health insurance bills in the middle of a recession, and that's the core problem health reform legislation has to address.''
 In discussing the flaws of the current system, Mr. Obama has often invoked his mother's death from cancer at age 53 and her struggles to pay medical bills in her last months. But he has not talked about his grandmother's illness last year as frequently. In the Times Magazine interview, he recounted what happened after she broke her hip:
 ''She's in the hospital and the doctor says, 'Look, you've got about -- maybe you have three months, maybe you have six months, maybe you have nine months to live. Because of the weakness of your heart, if you have an operation on your hip, there are certain risks that -- you know, your heart can't take it. On the other hand, if you just sit there with your hip like this, you're just going to waste away and your qualify of life will be terrible.''
 As Mr. Obama tries to translate that experience into policy for the rest of the country, the real issue is who would decide which procedures will be covered for those near the end of life. Mr. Obama did not say in the interview who paid for his grandmother's hip replacement, but given that she was 86, it could have been Medicare.
 ''There is going to have to be a conversation that is guided by doctors, scientists, ethicists,'' Mr. Obama said. ''And then there is going to have to be a very difficult democratic conversation that takes place. It is very difficult to imagine the country making those decisions just through normal political channels. And that's part of why you have to have some independent group that can give you guidance. It's not determinative, but I think has to be able to give you some guidance.''
 Get ready for a difficult democratic conversation.

HEADLINE: Diverse Partners With Many Goals

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Before Chrysler can start building cars that more Americans want to buy, it will have to overcome considerable challenges. 
 The biggest may be persuading its three principal new owners -- the retiree benefit fund for the labor union that President Obama himself has identified as a contributor to the company's decline; a government that insists it will keep its hands off day-to-day decisions; and a foreign car company, Fiat -- to innovate in ways the carmaker has resisted for three decades.
 There is reason for skepticism. For all the optimism expressed by the administration about a downsized, leaner Chrysler, the structure of the new Chrysler sets the stage for a conflict between current workers and retirees. 
 Chrysler's workers, of course, are desperate to preserve their job security, their wages and their generous health care benefits, built up over years of negotiations. But it is Chrysler's retirees who will hold a seat on the new company's board, representing the interests of a dwindling -- and expensive -- retirement health plan. 
 ''There's a potential conflict there, absolutely,'' one of Mr. Obama's aides conceded Thursday. 
 The innovative element of the new company is supposed to come from Fiat, the Italian automaker that managed a remarkable turnaround in the last five years. Fiat turns out fuel-efficient engines and sporty, economical small cars -- exactly the image of the future American car industry that Mr. Obama talks about in glowing terms. 
 But when Chrysler was controlled by Daimler-Benz, one of Europe's most successful luxury carmakers, everyone hailed the potential of great crossborder synergies. They simply never materialized. 
 Members of the team that negotiated the deal insisted on Thursday that they had explored all those risks as they revamped Chrysler and faced down a group of recalcitrant lenders who, on Wednesday night, balked at taking a deal that would give them about 28 cents for every dollar they had lent the company over the years. 
 The United Automobile Workers will not be managing the company the way unions tried, and failed, to manage United Airlines, they said. Moreover, Fiat is not Daimler -- it is geared toward small, midmarket cars, not fine driving machines with wood-burl dashboards, they added. 
 Mr. Obama is trying to portray the government's role as more venture capitalist than manager.
 ''I'm not an auto engineer,'' the president declared Wednesday evening during the news conference marking his 100th day in office. ''But I know that if the Japanese can design an affordable, well-designed hybrid, then doggone it, the American people should be able to do the same.''
 In fact, in Chrysler's case, he is relying on Italian technology -- Fiat technology -- to do what Chrysler has been unable to do itself. And while the White House doesn't want to advertise that fact as Chrysler embarks on its latest last chance, the plan is for Chrysler to ultimately be a subsidiary of Fiat, in a turnabout of fortune like those in the early days of the auto industry, when giants were consumed by faster-moving competitors. 
 The plan announced Thursday creates incentives for Fiat to obtain a majority share of its troubled American partner, step by step. Fiat's stake is supposed to rise in 5 percent increments, if it satisfies each of three milestones: It must expand Chrysler's market beyond North America by putting Chrysler's popular Jeeps on car lots in places like Brazil and Italy; it must begin to produce high-performance engines in old Chrysler factories; and it must produce a car that can get 40 miles to the gallon. 
 The entire venture will be overseen by a new board, including four directors appointed by the president -- some of whom, it appears, have already been approached about the job. 
 Mr. Obama insists that beyond appointing those directors -- mostly ''experienced C.E.O.'s,'' one administration official said -- Washington will keep its hands off. But he cautioned that ''every dime of new taxpayer money will be repaid before Fiat can take a majority ownership stake.'' 
 That ''new money'' amounts to about $8 billion in loans, including the cash to pay off Chrysler's lenders. The federal government has already extended about $4 billion to keep the company afloat in recent months. 
 The plan faces another potential hitch: that 40-mile-a-gallon car, according to administration officials, probably will not be for sale in the United States until 2012. If the Secret Service can be persuaded, Mr. Obama could tool around in it as he campaigns for re-election. 
 That means the government, the unions and Fiat must find a way to keep Chrysler afloat for two and a half years, in the worst car market in memory and with offerings that Mr. Obama himself described Thursday at the White House as ''less popular, less reliable and less fuel-efficient than foreign competitors'.'' Presumably, they will keep that ringing endorsement out of the company's advertisements. 
 At General Motors, the events about to unfold are even more complex. While the United States government will hold only about 7 percent of Chrysler's shares, it will very likely end up with 55 percent of G.M., once the world's largest carmaker. 
 And while Mr. Obama says he neither wants to dictate car models nor run the companies, their success or failure will be viewed, rightly or wrongly, as his success or failure as the auto executive he says he never wanted to be.

HEADLINE: Schools Fill Up. Parents, Told to Wait, Heat Up.

BYLINE: By ELISSA GOOTMAN

 BODY:
As a growing collection of Manhattan's most celebrated public elementary schools notify neighborhood parents that their children have been placed on waiting lists for kindergarten slots, middle-class vitriol against the school system -- and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg -- is mounting. 
 Parents are venting their frustrations in e-mail messages and phone calls to the mayor, local politicians and the schools chancellor, Joel I. Klein (''You have unleashed the fury of parents throughout this city with your complete lack of preparedness,'' read one father's recent missive, which he shared with The New York Times). Some plan a rally on the steps of City Hall for next Wednesday afternoon (''Kindergartners Are Not Refugees!'' proclaims a flier), and some are taking it upon themselves to scour the city for potential classroom space.
 The outpouring of anger comes as state lawmakers consider whether to renew mayoral control of the city school system, which expires in two months, and Mr. Bloomberg is seeking a third term in part on his education record. 
 ''I got a call from Mayor Bloomberg's campaign about yadda yadda yadda was I going to vote for him,'' said Beth Levison, a documentary filmmaker whose son is No. 79 of 90 on a combined waiting list for Public School 41 and Public School 3, both in Greenwich Village. ''As a parent who has a child with no place to go next year, no indication of where he's going to go next year as a result of the mayor taking control of education, I said absolutely not. 
 ''You would think that Bloomberg, who is a businessman, knows how to manage inventory like this,'' Ms. Levison continued. ''My kid isn't just a bottle of vodka, but this is about inventory.'' 
 Assemblywoman Deborah J. Glick, whose district includes Greenwich Village, said it would not help the mayor's cause to have the debate take place amid this ''very tense circumstance.'' 
 ''If people believe that the core mission is to have a seat in a local school where there is a reasonable class size,'' she said, ''people are going to say, regardless of the P.R. campaign, there need to be changes.''
 The Department of Education would not say how many schools had waiting lists or how many children were on them, explaining that officials were still reviewing the information that principals in Manhattan were required to submit earlier this week (principals in other boroughs must do so by Friday). But parent advocates and public officials in pockets throughout the city said that they had heard more complaints this year from panicked parents told that there may not be seats for their 5-year-olds at their neighborhood schools.
 The notion of a waiting list for students living within a school's zone is not unprecedented; last fall, 34 schools outside Manhattan capped their enrollment, turning away neighborhood children. But this year, after a change in city policy to standardize kindergarten admissions and encourage registration earlier in the year, the waiting lists seem to have proliferated, making their way into Manhattan neighborhoods where parents often make expensive real estate decisions with a specific public school in mind. And parents fear that the lists reflect not just the new policy but also a surge in demand, fueled by an increase in young families and an economic downturn that makes private schools less appealing. 
 David Cantor, the chancellor's press secretary, said that schools previously had grappled with supply and demand in an ad-hoc way, and that the Bloomberg administration's approach was fairer. Children still on waiting lists at the end of June will be offered slots at other schools in their district (there are 32 across the city). Their names can stay on the lists through the summer in hopes that spots open up. City officials expect lists to shrink as some students choose gifted and talented programs or other options. 
 Before, Mr. Cantor said, ''students remained on wait lists without a school unless a parent knew how to navigate the system.'' 
 ''This administration's position is that equity of access and transparency for every parent is essential,'' he added. ''This year, for the first time, we stepped in to quantify wait lists, assist schools in managing their wait lists, and will ensure that children have a placement offer by the end of June.'' 
 In some lower-income areas, public officials are concerned about a city budget cut that is sending some 3,000 children from day care centers funded by the Administration for Children's Services to public kindergartens.
 But the epicenter of the outrage is Manhattan's District 2, particularly the Upper East Side and the Village, where new condominiums have lured young families. The district's Community Education Council estimates 400 children are on waiting lists at a dozen schools.
 ''We feel desperate,'' said Ben Allison, a bassist and composer whose daughter, Ruby, is on the P.S. 41 waiting list. ''We're calling up N.Y.U. to say, 'Can you provide a space for us? Maybe you can clear out some classrooms and create an annex.' ''
 Then there are the parents of children zoned for Public School 151. That school, on East 91st Street, has been closed for nearly a decade. The Education Department promised to reopen it this year because of the space crunch, but has yet to secure a space.
 Jacalyn Filler, whose son is supposed to be in P.S. 151's kindergarten this fall, wrote to Mr. Bloomberg, Mr. Klein and the federal education secretary, Arne Duncan, criticizing what she called ''bureaucratic foot-dragging, lack of focus and high-handed attitude displayed by D.O.E. officials.'' 
 ''Mr. Mayor, you are spending a good chunk of money on TV ads where you tout New York as 'a great place to raise a family,' '' she wrote in the letter, which she shared with The Times. ''How can you make this claim with a straight face, given the current crisis?''
 Rebecca Daniels, president of the District 2 council, said parents were frustrated because they had warned the Education Department that this could happen, and were skeptical as to whether slots were handed out fairly by lottery as the city required.
 ''These parents are questioning everything and everybody, and it's putting them in a position that they don't want to be in,'' she said. ''Parents shouldn't be sitting here pitted against one another when their biggest concern is telling their 4- or 5-year-old why they're not in kindergarten.'' 
 City Councilwoman Jessica S. Lappin, who represents the Upper East Side, said she had heard from distraught parents, including some whose children have spots in neighborhood schools but worry about overcrowding.
 ''The mayor has said repeatedly, the buck stops with me, and so has the chancellor,'' she said. ''These parents should hold them accountable.''

HEADLINE: Obama Brings a Hands-On Style to Details, Grand and Mundane

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
AS he thrust Chrysler into bankruptcy on Thursday, President Obama stopped to make a commercial message to his national audience.
 ''If you are considering buying a car,'' he said as cameras carried his words live, ''I hope it will be an American car.''
 No money down! Just drive it off the lot today! 
 But he was not done yet. ''I want to remind you that if you decide to buy a Chrysler,'' he went on, ''your warranty will be safe because it is backed by the United States government.''
 Free, no obligation quote for the extended warranty!
 He may not have set out to be a car salesman -- or a banker for that matter, or an insurer. But suddenly Mr. Obama is all of those. And more.
 In the midst of a health scare, he is Dr. Obama telling Americans to wash their hands. In an energy crisis, he is a utility engineer telling them to turn down their thermostats.
 By dint of circumstance, ideology or nature, or some blend of the three, this is a president, and by extension a government, that is increasingly involved in many corners of society.
 The president's announcement on Chrysler made abundantly clear that his team effectively controls a onetime American industrial giant, down to determining which executives are out, which brands die and how much aggrieved creditors will get.
 Standing behind Mr. Obama during Thursday's announcement was essentially the new management team for American industry, the collection of cabinet secretaries, economists and policy makers who make up the president's auto team. It will be up to these government jockeys to help build a new-generation Chrysler that can retool its products, scale back its work force and find its niche in the modern marketplace.
 All of which has many free-market libertarians worried about the expanding presence of the state and its leader. Even many conservatives grant the logic behind government intervention during times of economic crisis -- after all, it was President George W. Bush who started putting taxpayers into the banking business -- but they want to see an exit strategy. 
 The administration's resistance to taking back bailout money from some financial institutions only reinforced the fear that state involvement may not be temporary.
 ''You can make a reasonable case that the circumstances required them to'' dive deeply into the financial sector, said Irwin M. Stelzer, director of the Center for Economic Policy Studies at the Hudson Institute. ''What is scary is they don't want to give it up: 'Here's your money back.' 'Uh-uh, we don't want you to give the money back. We want control.' '' 
 Mr. Obama insists he has no interest in ''meddling in the private sector,'' as he put it at his news conference Wednesday. ''I don't want to run auto companies,'' he said. ''I don't want to run banks. I've got two wars I've got to run already. I've got more than enough to do. So the sooner we can get out of that business, the better off we're going to be.''
 And yet there does seem to be a part of Mr. Obama that has him in other people's business beyond business itself. He seems prone to giving advice for everyday lives. During the campaign last year, he told Americans to properly inflate their tires and get their cars tuned up to save on energy use. Republicans mocked him, with Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, the party's vice presidential nominee, complaining that his approach would lead to the ''government moving into the role of taking care of you.''
 More recently, Mr. Obama advised Americans not to ''stuff money in their mattresses'' out of fear of bank failures. Last month, he held a roundtable discussion to urge Americans to refinance their houses, complete with a Web address. And on Wednesday night, he counseled those worried about a flu outbreak to ''wash your hands'' and ''cover your mouth when you cough.''
 Such entreaties do not always work out so well for presidents. Mr. Bush was ridiculed for telling Americans after Sept. 11, 2001, that the most important thing they could do was to go shopping. 
 Jody Powell, a former press secretary for President Jimmy Carter, said that the president has a responsibility to speak out. ''I think Americans are kind of looking for some leadership here,'' he said. ''Maybe we're getting past the point of, 'Hey, if it feels good do it; don't worry, it'll all work out.' ''
 Even some critics said Mr. Obama's popularity might make it easier for him to play the outsize role in American society he is assuming, at least for now.
 ''He is, I hate to say this, the father of the country,'' Mr. Stelzer said. ''There's a kind of egomania behind that. But it works.''

HEADLINE: Chrysler: A Short History

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
Chrysler, founded in 1925, has had a tumultuous history as the third-largest of Detroit's auto companies. Known in the years after World War II for its well-engineered cars, it has spent the last three decades bouncing between highs and lows. 
 The company encountered financial turbulence in the late 1970s that prompted it to seek a Congressional bailout, a process that vaulted its chief executive, Lee A. Iacocca, to national prominence. Chrysler paid off the loans early in the 1980s, when it enjoyed success thanks to its minivans and a family of fuel-efficient autos called the K-cars.
 In 1987, Chrysler bought the No. 4 automaker, American Motors, but the subsequent consolidation prompted another financial crisis that led to a restructuring of the company. In the 1990s, Chrysler came back again, with vehicles like the powerful Dodge Viper sports car and its Jeep lineup. In 1998, Chrysler was acquired by Daimler-Benz of Germany and spent the next eight years as part of DaimlerChrysler.
 But its inconsistent financial results and pressure from German shareholders prompted Daimler to seek a buyer in 2007. It sold the company to Cerberus Capital Management, an investment fund, which installed Robert L. Nardelli, the former chief executive of Home Depot, as its chief executive. Mr. Nardelli vowed that Chrysler would make a comeback as an American-owned company, yet the automaker, like others in Detroit, was battered by a deep sales slump last year as a recession took hold.
 In November, Chrysler joined General Motors in seeking assistance from Congress, which rejected the company's bid, forcing the Bush administration to step in with a financial lifeline. In January, Chrysler announced it had reached a tentative deal with Fiat, and in March, President Obama gave the companies 30 days to conclude the transaction.
 That effort culminated in a restructuring plan in which Fiat would take a major role in the company's management and the United Automobile Workers and major lenders agreed to concessions. But with the Obama administration unable to get support from all of the bondholders for the plan, it is now up to a federal bankruptcy court to determine the details of Chrysler's immediate future.

HEADLINE: The Chrysler Bankruptcy

 BODY:
When President Obama outlined his plan to restructure Chrysler under bankruptcy-court protection, we shared his view that keeping a company ''afloat on an endless supply of tax dollars'' was no solution to the cratering of even iconic American companies. 
 We also admired his supreme confidence that the Chrysler bankruptcy will be a quick, official and controlled process. We just wished we were as confident as the president.
 If the process is prolonged, the costs and complexity would likely ensure that the company would never emerge from bankruptcy proceedings, with dire implications for employment and economic recovery.
 For the administration, the Chrysler bankruptcy filing became inevitable when a holdout group of the carmaker's lenders rejected the government's final offer to settle their debts, for about 33 cents on the dollar. The United Auto Workers union had already agreed to concessions to help keep the company afloat, as had large banks that hold most all of the company's debt. Chrysler and the Italian carmaker, Fiat, had also agreed to a partnership that would enable Chrysler to tap into Fiat's technology, designs and management.
 By pushing the matter into bankruptcy court, the administration is assuming that the judge will also reject the holdouts' demands. That would allow for a quick restructuring while keeping intact the previous agreements with the union, the big bank lenders and Fiat. In short order -- 30 to 60 days by the administration's estimate -- Chrysler would emerge from bankruptcy with all the pieces in place to become in Mr. Obama's words, ''stronger'' and ''more competitive.'' 
 There are reasons to hope it will work out that way. In particular, a judge may be unwilling to favor the dissident bondholders when other significant stakeholders have been able to come to agreement outside of court. 
 But short ''prepackaged'' bankruptcies generally succeed when all of the difficult issues are resolved ahead of time, requiring only a judge's official approval. The judge in the Chrysler case may not see the remaining issues in the same cut-and-dried way that the administration does. Quickie bankruptcies like the one the administration envisions for Chrysler have also never been attempted for a company as big and multifaceted as a carmaker. If the Chrysler bankruptcy case does not proceed apace, the administration will need a new plan -- and fast -- to avoid pouring taxpayer money into a restructuring that may never yield the desired result.
 If the bankruptcy succeeds, there is no guarantee that the Chrysler and Fiat partnership will succeed. A recent report by Fortune magazine detailed the likelihood of culture clash in a Chrysler-Fiat combination, given the companies' complexity and different national identities. Remember the disastrous Daimler-Chrysler marriage? 
 It will also take some time, probably at least a couple of years, before the Chrysler and Fiat partnership yields any new cars. In the meantime, Chrysler's own brands like Dodge and Jeep have been badly damaged by the company's failing fortunes. 
 The Chrysler bankruptcy filing is a bold move for the administration, a refusal to blink when confronted with what it perceived as unreasonable demands. The object of the game -- a strong and competitive Chrysler -- is far from achieved.

HEADLINE: Hasbro and Discovery Plan Channel Based on Toy Brands

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
Heightening the competition among cable television channels for children, Hasbro and Discovery Communications plan to jointly reformat a channel with programs based on G.I. Joe, My Little Pony and other classic toy brands. 
 The venture, announced Thursday, reflects Hasbro's efforts to turn its toys into multimedia brands and Discovery's attempts to wring more money from its cable channels. 
 The 13-year-old Discovery Kids Channel, an afterthought among children's channels, will be replaced in late 2010 by the new venture, which has yet to be named. 
 Brian Goldner, the chief executive of Hasbro, said the company would produce ''new stories and new programs around a number of Hasbro brands that have been enjoyed by generations of consumers.'' The company will pay $300 million for a 50 percent stake in the new network, and will form a team to produce programs. 
 Hasbro has already moved aggressively to feature its products in movies, including ''Transformers'' in 2007. Another ''Transformers'' film will be released in June, and films based on the Candy Land, Monopoly and Stretch Armstrong franchises are being developed. The company has also released dozens of video games in a partnership with Electronic Arts.
 Executives said a television channel is another natural extension. On cable television, children's programming is dominated by Cartoon Network, the Disney Channel and Nickelodeon. ''We saw a big opportunity in the kids' space,'' said the Discovery chief executive, David M. Zaslav.
 Susan Linn, the director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, was critical.
 ''This partnership represents a new low in children's television, a network devoted to showing infomercials for Hasbro's toys and games,'' she said in a statement. ''It will make a mockery of existing ad limits and the current prohibition of product placement in children's television.''
 While the television advertising market has been battered by the recession, the children's marketplace has held up unusually well. ''There's a very limited amount of supply and still a strong demand for that demographic,'' said David Levy, the president of sales for Turner Broadcasting, the owner of Cartoon Network, in an interview in March.
 Discovery Kids is the latest channel to be reformatted by Mr. Zaslav. While the company's portfolio includes 13 channels in the United States, three of them, Animal Planet, Discovery and TLC, generate about 80 percent of revenue. Mr. Zaslav has moved to reinvigorate the other channels to increase ratings and advertising revenue. In a deal similar to the one with Hasbro, Discovery started a venture last year with Oprah Winfrey to turn the Discovery Health Channel into OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network.

HEADLINE: Berkshire Is Still A Brand Name

 BODY:
Berkshire Hathaway shareholders are on their way to Woodstock. Or rather, they are heading for Omaha and the company's annual gathering, known as Woodstock for capitalists. Warren Buffett, the Berkshire boss who holds deceptively folksy court at these occasions, has changed the format to encourage more questions about the company's business. Investors should take him up on that and listen. Through Mr. Buffett's choices and market forces, Berkshire is changing.
 Shareholders don't yet know the result of one of Mr. Buffett's most important decisions: his successors. The influential investor is 78, and his longtime business partner, Charlie Munger, is 85. With his track record and public profile, Mr. Buffett is the epitome of the corporate ''key man,'' as Fitch Ratings pointed out in knocking Berkshire's triple-A rating down a notch in March. 
 Although Mr. Buffett's chosen successors' identities remain undisclosed, it's a safe bet they know what they are doing. But they aren't Mr. Buffett. Moreover, the leadership of Berkshire and the management of its investments will be separated, requiring some adaptation. The culture that brings 30,000-odd shareholders to Omaha every year will unavoidably change, too.
 Another important Buffett decision of late has been to expose Berkshire to big derivatives bets -- $67 billion worth in terms of the worst-case exposure at the end of 2008. Despite having once called such instruments ''financial weapons of mass destruction,'' he appears to think they are safe enough in his hands.
 He recognizes the apparent double standard and brings to derivatives much of the common sense he applies to other investments. The types of contracts he has written -- long-dated stock-index put options and credit-default swaps -- are relatively straightforward, and he collects premiums up front to avoid the danger of trading partners running short of cash. So far, he has also limited expected losses, a fraction of the worst-case figure, to an amount Berkshire could easily handle. 
 Even so, Berkshire's recent performance will take some explaining. In recent years, the company has released quarterly earnings on the eve of the annual shareholder meeting. That would be this Friday, but the report is instead expected in a week.
 That's the company's prerogative and doesn't necessarily signal any trouble. But with further losses anticipated, Mr. Buffett might be glad for the chance to explain his derivatives holdings to shareholders at Saturday's meeting before the bald numbers are published.
 Another change is Berkshire's growing vulnerability. The company looked good in the wake of the dot-com bust because Mr. Buffett avoided technology investments. But in the wake of global market turmoil centered on financial businesses, Berkshire's shares have lost a third of their value in the past year, and its vaunted triple-A rating is gone. Berkshire suddenly looks like what it is: a largely unhedged equity investment vehicle with a focus on the financial sector.
 Its giant insurance businesses, which generate gobs of free investing capital in good times, don't look so special at the moment, and its large stakes in American Express, Wells Fargo and the ratings agency Moody's underline the finance focus. Then there are those out-of-the-money derivatives trades that, in hindsight, seem to have been badly timed.
 Along with the succession question, that may all help explain why Berkshire's shares appear to be trading at a discount to the market value of the company's holdings, even after allowing for stock market declines during the first quarter.
 That stocks have turned upward recently is one positive thought for those traveling to Omaha this weekend. But another development should also generate optimism among the Berkshire faithful: opportunities to invest on the cheap ought to be plentiful now.
 In his annual letter to shareholders, which showed 2008 to be his worst investing year on record, Mr. Buffett gleefully noted the disappearance of debt-financed private equity firms after the credit crisis (''they're keeping their remaining funds very private,'' he observed). Far less money is sloshing around markets.
 Partly as a result, Mr. Buffett picked up some good deals last year, including what now looks like a bargain $5 billion stake in Goldman Sachs. Berkshire still has strong credit and plenty of cash. And the sage is still around. After years in which few bargains were available and Berkshire's size made meaningful deals hard to come by, Mr. Buffett has the chance to redeem himself.

HEADLINE: Union Takes Rare Front Seat in Chrysler Deal

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Labor unions usually dread bankruptcy, and for good reason. Their pay, benefits and pensions typically suffer significant cuts, as airline and steel workers can attest.
But for the United Automobile Workers union, Chrysler's Chapter 11 case, which began in New York on Friday, could turn out to be -- if the company survives and thrives -- the Cadillac of bankruptcies.
The U.A.W., for example, has received upfront protection from the Treasury Department for its pension plan and the fund that will take over responsibility for retiree medical benefits. 
Moreover, that fund, called the voluntary employee beneficiary association, or VEBA, will control 55 percent of the equity in the new Chrysler once it emerges from bankruptcy, and hold a seat on the Chrysler board.
Of course, those hard-fought gains, and the big ownership stake, could be worthless if Chrysler does not make it. And the company's fortunes continued to sag in April, when sales fell 48 percent compared with the same month in 2008. Chrysler will also have to wait roughly two years or more for new cars designed by its partner, the Italian automaker Fiat, to show up in Chrysler dealerships.
But for now, even though Chrysler workers had to agree to lower pay and less generous benefits as part of the deal, the U.A.W. appears to be enjoying relative safety in helping steer the course of the Chrysler bankruptcy.
''I'm very comfortable,'' Ron Gettelfinger, the U.A.W.'s president, said Friday on National Public Radio. ''It's not like we're going into this bankruptcy fighting with Chrysler and Fiat and the U.S. Treasury. We're going in there in lockstep to put our agreements in place.''
Labor and restructuring lawyers said such a comprehensive deal going into bankruptcy was rare.
''This is extraordinary, truly extraordinary,'' said Mary Jo Dowd, a partner in the financial and bankruptcy restructuring practice at Arent Fox in Washington. ''I never would have thought a year ago that this would occur. These are truly unusual times.''
Asked if he could recall any other union that fared as well, David L. Gregory, a labor law professor at St. John's University, replied: ''Nobody's even close.''
But the U.A.W. is also no ordinary union. Even though its membership at the Detroit automakers has shrunk to a quarter of its size in 1990, it still maintains tremendous influence in Washington, partly because of its heavy political contributions.
The government, in assessing what was needed to make Chrysler viable, decided it needed to support workers, as well as suppliers, and guarantee the warranties on Chrysler vehicles.
Because the union agreed to negotiate, it was made a partner, with the government and Fiat, in developing the plan to restructure the company.
In contrast, other companies often use bankruptcy as a way to gain leverage over labor, so that they can lower their costs. Workers at Bethlehem Steel, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and US Airways lost all or most of their traditional pension benefits when those employers sought bankruptcy protection in this decade, though some of the shortfall was covered by the federal government. Retiree health care coverage was also cut.
None of those cases, filed during the Bush administration, had the kind of federal support offered to the U.A.W.
In the case of Chrysler, the Treasury said Chrysler is giving a VEBA a $4.6 billion note, payable over 13 years at a 9 percent interest rate, helping to fund roughly $10 billion in liabilities. The rest will be paid in Chrysler stock. Chrysler's pension plans will be preserved, with the help of $600 million from Daimler, Chrysler's former owner, the Treasury said.
If Chrysler goes under, pensions will be covered in part by the federal pension agency, but workers will receive much less than they are owed. The VEBA would be in dire straits, since it would owe the Treasury and have nothing to pay it back with.
The U.A.W. was ready for the probability of a Chrysler filing as far back as two months ago, people involved in the negotiations said. Its stand was clear: for it to support a bankruptcy case, workers' health care and pensions had to be protected.
But the administration, advised by Ron Bloom, the veteran restructuring expert, also insisted that the union make sacrifices. On Wednesday, Chrysler workers approved concessions, including work rule changes, that would result in lower pay and less generous benefits than in the 2007 contract.
Significantly, the VEBA can begin adjusting workers' health care benefits in 2010, two years sooner than the previous contract allowed.
Chrysler workers' concessions, similar to those granted earlier this year at Ford Motor, form the basis of a prenegotiated labor agreement with the new Chrysler, people involved in the negotiations said.
Chrysler's pension liability will shift from the defunct company to the new one, these people said, and workers will continue to have a lucrative contract.
Despite the concessions, Chrysler's most senior workers, like those at Ford, still have healthy wages and benefits; bountiful health care coverage, at least until it is adjusted; and subsidies to help bolster unemployment benefits they receive while plants are closed, as they will be at Chrysler for weeks until the sale is final.
That carryover is unusual, Ms. Dowd said, since the buyers of assets in bankruptcy cases normally try to purchase them free and clear of their existing liabilities.
It also means the union will not have to come to terms with Fiat once it takes over the company, or risk having its contracts abrogated.
None of this sat well with some Chrysler's debtholders, who questioned the fairness of the 55 percent stake granted to the VEBA. They did not raise objections in bankruptcy court on Friday, however.
Professor Gregory said the U.A.W.'s position still carried risk.
''Chrysler may be worth nothing, and 55 percent of nothing may be worth nothing,'' he said. But a comeback by Chrysler after it emerges from bankruptcy could ensure the security of the retiree health care fund, which will begin selling its Chrysler shares as soon as possible, Mr. Gettelfinger said Friday.
His legacy, and that of the union, could also could benefit, Professor Gregory said -- if Chrysler and G.M. are able to successfully restructure.
''It's walking a very tight rope without a safety net, and a very high wire,'' he said. ''But if this can get some traction, they could be the envy of not just organized labor, but a lot of folks.''

PERSON: Albert Gordon 

HEADLINE: Albert Gordon Dies at 107; Rebuilt Kidder Peabody

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Albert H. Gordon, who helped pick up the pieces of a shattered Kidder Peabody after the 1929 Wall Street crash and built the firm into what Forbes magazine called ''a minor powerhouse on Wall Street,'' died Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 107.
 His son John announced the death. 
 Mr. Gordon lived to become an eminence grise of the investment community, began running marathons in his 80s and at his death was the oldest graduate of both Harvard College and Harvard Business School, according to Harvard Magazine. In 1960, Fortune magazine listed Mr. Gordon as one of the 10 most powerful men on Wall Street and as the financial community's most successful underwriter and salesman. It noted that he ordered his men to read ''The Elements of Style,'' written by William Strunk Jr. in 1918 and revised by E. B. White in 1959, to improve their reports.
 Mr. Gordon used his charm, powerful friends like Armand Hammer of Occidental Petroleum and legendary energy to chase deals. John C. Whitehead, former chairman of Goldman Sachs, called Mr. Gordon ''a famous business-getter.'' In ruling that the investment industry did not violate federal antitrust laws in 1953, Judge Harold R. Medina noted the industriousness of Kidder. He said Mr. Gordon's firm had ''forged its way strictly on the merits from a minor position in 1931 to that of one of the country's leading underwriters.''
 Mr. Gordon arrived on Wall Street in 1925 as a new Harvard Business School graduate, to take a job as a statistician with Goldman. He traveled an immense territory selling commercial paper; he was on a train 12 nights out of 14. (He was later one of the first investment bankers to fly.)
 In those days, investment bankers strove for decorum.
 ''We wore silk collars,'' he said in an interview with National Public Radio in 2004. ''We wore hats. We took ourselves seriously.'' Kidder itself was a respected Wall Street institution when Mr. Gordon arrived in 1931. The firm had been prominent in the early financing of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company.
 But two years after the crash, it was broke. J. P. Morgan & Company arranged financing that included a cash infusion from the Webster family of Stone & Webster, the engineering company. Frank Webster had led Kidder for most of the first third of the 20th century.
 The reconstituted Kidder had three principals: Edward S. Webster Jr., Frank's grandson and Mr. Gordon's Harvard classmate; Chandler S. Hovey, who led a Boston investment bank, and Mr. Gordon, who, at 29, was the youngest. 
 Kidder came back. From 1960 to 1964, it ranked second among all investment banking concerns in a category of securities offering, The New York Times reported in 1965.
 Mr. Gordon was chairman and a large shareholder of Kidder in 1986 when General Electric bought the business. Under G.E., Kidder floundered and ended up selling most of its assets to the competing PaineWebber Group in 1994. Mr. Hovey retired in 1952, and Mr. Webster died in 1957.
 Albert Hamilton Gordon was born in the community of North Scituate, Mass., on July 21, 1901. His father, after working as a sheepherder in Wyoming, had moved east to become a successful leather merchant, supplying the British Army in World War I.
 The younger Mr. Gordon graduated from Roxbury Latin School, where he broke his nose playing football. He graduated cum laude from Harvard College in 1923 with distinction in economics. He ranked third in his class at Harvard Business School. Arriving in New York, he shared an apartment with four or five friends, who embraced the local popular culture, including speakeasies, flappers and Babe Ruth. ''We were having a very, very good time,'' Mr. Gordon told NPR. 
 At his first job with Goldman Sachs, he got a $2 million deal from National Dairy Products, a predecessor of Kraft Foods. He was entitled to a substantial commission, but his boss took all the credit. Mr. Gordon learned an important lesson, he told Forbes in 2000, ''You can't retain employees if you don't spread credit around.''
 The Times reported in 1989 that Mr. Gordon had imbued Kidder with ''an air of positive gentility, giving employees a free hand to pursue deals.'' He also gradually sold back ownership of the firm to its workers, to signal that he would not challenge the new management he had recruited. He did not want anyone to think of him as ''that greedy old bastard,'' he told Business Month in 1989.
 As one of the oldest surviving Wall Street veterans of the crash of 1929, Mr. Gordon was often asked to reflect on how he thought it had happened. In 1987, he told The Nation magazine, ''Young men thought they could do anything.''
 Mr. Gordon became something of a legend for his dedication to physical fitness, which he believed explained his longevity. He took one puff of a cigarette in his life, he said, didn't salt his food and limited his alcohol intake to a glass of Champagne a year.
 He was twice the oldest participant in the London marathon and sometimes walked from airports to his hotel. He made cold calls to prospective clients well into his 90s. At 105, he was still working four days a week at Deltec Asset Management.
 Mr. Gordon was a past president of the Harvard Club of New York, and his generosity to Harvard is evident in the Albert H. Gordon Track and Tennis Center there, as well as a professorship at the business school. The New York Road Runners named its library and an annual race after him.
 Mr. Gordon's wife, the former Mary Rousmaniere, died in 1980. He is survived by his sons, Albert F. and John R., both of Manhattan, and Daniel F., of Philadelphia; his daughters, Mary Gordon Roberts and Sarah F. Gordon, both of Manhattan; 12 grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.
 In the 1960s and 70s, Mr. Gordon offered cash rewards to employees who quit smoking. He always flew economy, and when he noticed a young Kidder vice president sitting in first class, Financial News reported in 2001, he penciled a note for a flight attendant to pass on.
 ''What is the food like up there?'' it read.

HEADLINE: Where Money Was Flaunted, Now It's Budgeted

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
New York City's neighborhoods are a patchwork of tribes, each with its own standards about manners and the flaunting of wealth. Chatting openly about an inheritance in a Williamsburg cafe or bantering loudly with buddies in a Park Slope pizzeria about ''making seven figures'' would be immediate grounds for social exile. But the Upper East Side is a different story.
 This is a neighborhood where, until recently, it was commonplace for bankers to boast into their cellphones about their bonuses. Spike-heeled ladies clacked along avenues and noisily swung designer shopping bags. Developers could sell speculative shells of unfinished five-bedroom condos. Its residents boldly prided themselves that they were surrounded by the trappings of wealth: AmEx black cards, dexterous plastic surgeons and preened pooches. 
 But the Upper East Side has been served a dose of humility in recent months as its residents have watched their wealth slip away. Their chatter about bonuses has been replaced with gripes about severance agreements. Their investments have been wiped out by collapsed hedge funds and Ponzi schemes, often run by their neighbors. 
 Even the neighborhood's coveted co-ops and town homes have lost their luster. The number of homes sold there dropped by 45 percent in the first three months of this year compared with the same period in 2008, according to the brokerage firm Halstead Property. And the shopping spree has ended; residents cannot stroll down Madison Avenue without discovering another boutique that has been shuttered.
 ''People have been sadder on the Upper East Side. Life in general is much quieter. Everything is more subdued,'' said Michele Kleier, a resident who owns a real estate brokerage firm. Since her beloved cafe Petak's closed, she has been trying to help keep other restaurants open by eating in the neighborhood rather than venturing downtown. 
 ''I walk past my favorite restaurants and look into them and make sure they don't close,'' Ms. Kleier said. ''We want things to survive.''
 Local businesses are noticing in small ways that their customers are trimming budgets. Louis Balducci, a partner in the specialty food market Agata & Valentina, says customers are buying fewer high-end items like pate, caviar, foie gras and smoked salmon. They now fill their shopping baskets with chicken rather than steak. And while they still buy candy, they have cut their pastry budgets and pick up ''one cupcake instead of two,'' Mr. Balducci said. At the same time, he is hearing more customers snap at his workers, and fielding more complaints from customers about matters he calls ''insignificant.''
 ''Patience is running thin,'' he said.
 Residents have eliminated much of the splurging that many local shop owners depended on for business. Leslie Edelman, owner of the Tiny Doll House shop, has noticed that when parents come in to buy brownstone and Victorian-style dollhouses, they now want to spend $500 to $600, not the $1,800 to $2,400 they spent before the recession. Instead of hearing parents openly disregard costs when decorating the dollhouses, he hears more customers share their fears of losing their jobs. Many regular customers who stopped in weekly to brighten up their daughters' dollhouses with wicker lawn furniture and $6 miniature Hermes shopping bags have disappeared entirely.
 ''Sometimes you ask, 'Where did everybody go?' '' Mr. Edelman said. ''The impulse buying has disappeared.''
 Some residents are becoming more confrontational about money itself. Tanya Zuckerbrot, a registered dietitian and founder of skinnyandthecity.com, used to be flooded with patients paying about $2,500 for five sessions of her advice. But demand for her services suddenly dried up this year; she joked that her office was quiet enough to hear crickets. Her patients trickled back in March. But then they brought their friends and tried to bargain down her prices by asking for two-for-one deals.
 ''I'm not used to talking about money to patients,'' she said. ''People are just worried.''
 Yoga, however, seems to be on the rise. Michelle Demus, program director for Pure Yoga, says the studio's membership has doubled in the past 10 months -- there are more ''Type A athletic types'' and people who have cut private yoga instructors from their budgets. They are ''leading very stressful lives, and they need to find some peace,'' she said.
 But many of these new members are still in the early phases of adapting. Ms. Demus has been battling a growing number of people trying to check their BlackBerrys and take cellphone calls in the middle of yoga sessions. Her instructors ''gently'' tell them to switch them off and perhaps take a break from their worries.
 ''It's great for them to realize that the world will continue spinning,'' Ms. Demus said, ''if they let go for an hour.''

HEADLINE: Out Of Touch

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
The incredibly clueless stewards of the incredibly shrinking Republican Party would do well to recall that it was supposedly Abe Lincoln, a Republican, who said you can't fool all of the people all of the time.
 Not only has the G.O.P. spent years trying to fool everybody in sight with its phony-baloney, dime-store philosophies, it's now trapped in the patently pathetic phase of fooling itself.
 The economy has imploded, the auto industry is in danger of being vaporized and more than half of all working Americans are worried that they may lose their jobs in the next year. So what's the Republican response? To build a wall of obstruction in front of efforts to get the economy moving again, and then to stand in front of that wall chanting gibberish about smaller government, lower taxes, spending cuts and Ronald Reagan. 
 It's not a party; it's a cult. I'm no fan of Arlen Specter, but if I were a Republican, I wouldn't be shoving him out the door and waving good riddance. This is the party of Rush Limbaugh, Sarah Palin, Newt (''I'm trying to rise from the ashes'') Gingrich, and the dark force who can't seem to exit the public stage or modify his medieval ways, Dick Cheney.
 It is losing all credibility with the public because it is not offering anything -- anything at all -- that could be viewed as helpful or constructive in a time of national crisis. And it has been unwilling to take responsibility for its role in bringing that crisis about. 
 Americans are aghast at what happened to the country while the G.O.P. was in charge. Iraq and Katrina come to mind, not to mention the transmutation of the Clinton surpluses into the Bush budget deficits and the collapse of the entire economy.
 Trickle down. Weapons of mass destruction. Torture. Deregulation. You name it. The Republican-conservative know-it-alls of the past several years (all-too-frequently with feckless Democrats following closely behind) brought destruction and heartbreak to just about everything they touched. 
 And yet the G.O.P. behaves as though nothing has changed. Even in the face of a national economic nightmare, the party is offering nothing in the way of policies or new ideas that might give a bit of hope or comfort to families wrestling with joblessness, housing foreclosures and bankruptcies.
 It's a party that doesn't seem to care about anything other than devotion to a set of so-called principles that never amounted to more than cult-like rhetoric. Waging unwarranted warfare while radically cutting taxes for the wealthy and turning the national economy into the equivalent of a Ponzi scheme may be evidence of many things, but none of them have to do with the so-called conservative principles the G.O.P. is always braying about.
 When it came to looking out for the interests of ordinary working Americans, the party of just-say-no could hardly have cared less. Referring to the catastrophic ordeal of Detroit's automakers, Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the banking committee, told us last November, ''The financial situation facing the Big Three is not a national problem but their problem.''
 And Phil Gramm, John McCain's top financial adviser during the presidential campaign, was enshrined in the foot-in-mouth hall of fame last summer when he said the country was experiencing ''a mental recession.'' 
 After awhile, it became all but impossible to overlook the madness of these true believers and the incalculable damage they had done to the country. Voters who hadn't sipped from the Kool-Aid themselves couldn't help but recognize that the G.O.P. was bizarrely detached from the real world.
 It still is. In the place of constructive alternatives to Obama administration policies, it has offered increasingly hysterical rhetoric. Mr. Gingrich warned on television that the Democrats' moves to stem the banking crisis ''gives them the potential to basically create the equivalent of a dictatorship.''
 Senator Jim DeMint, a Republican from South Carolina, described President Obama as ''the world's best salesman of socialism.'' And Mike Huckabee, a former Republican governor of Arkansas and presidential candidate, said of the administration's economic policies: ''Lenin and Stalin would love this stuff.''
 This is not a party that can be trusted with the leadership of the country. John McCain was ready to have Sarah Palin a heartbeat away from the Oval Office and reportedly wanted Phil Gramm to be his Treasury secretary. Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, has the strategic sense and attention span that you'd expect to find in a frat house on Saturday night.
 ''I love the Oscars,'' he told GQ. ''I'm looking for who's got what dress on, you know?''
 All the talk about the permanent marginalization of the Republican Party is silly. It will be back. Someday. But first it will have to stop fooling itself and re-engage with the real world.

HEADLINE: Lower Profit For Chevron

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The Chevron Corporation posted its lowest profit in five years Friday after the global recession cut fuel demand, dragging down energy prices. 
 First-quarter net income fell 64 percent to $1.84 billion, or 92 cents a share, from $5.17 billion, or $2.48 a share, a year earlier, Chevron said. Excluding divestiture gains, profit was 72 cents a share, 9 cents below the average of 13 analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
 The company's earnings from oil and natural-gas wells in the United States fell 99 percent, to $21 million, as crude futures in New York traded 56 percent lower than a year earlier, the biggest decline in more than a quarter century. 
 ''Prices have come down so far that nobody's showing a higher profit,'' said William J. Andrews, a money manager at C. S. McKee & Company in Pittsburgh.

HEADLINE: Flu Outbreak in Mexico May Be Smaller Than Feared

BYLINE: By DENISE GRADY and LIZ ROBBINS; Denise Grady and Liz Robbins reported from New York. Reporting was contributed by Larry Rohter and Elisabeth Malkin from Mexico City, Keith Bradsher from Hong Kong, and Anemona Hartocollis and Catherine Rampell from New York.

 BODY:
The swine flu outbreak in Mexico may be considerably smaller than originally feared, test results released there on Friday indicate.
 Of 908 suspected cases that were tested, only 397 people turned out to have the virus, officially known as influenza A(H1N1), Mexican health officials reported at a news conference. Of those, 16 people have died.
 Mexico had reported about 2,500 suspected cases as of Friday, but the number of real cases could turn out to be less than half the suspected number if further testing follows the same pattern as the original round. Officials said that the tests were being done quickly, and that 500 more would be completed Friday. 
 Jose Angel Cordova, Mexico's health minister, said, ''This is a new epidemic, and we can't predict exactly'' what it will do. ''We need more days to see how it behaves,'' he said. 
 ''Apparently the rate of infection is not as widespread as we might have thought,'' he added. The materials needed for the test were provided to Mexico by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
 Officials at the centers declined to say what the new numbers might mean.
 ''We are continuously assessing new information, but it is still too early to draw conclusions about the extent of the spread of this new virus in Mexico or the severity of disease caused by it,'' Dr. Nancy Cox, chief of the influenza section, said by e-mail, when asked to comment on the test results. 
 Dr. Javier Torres, the head of the infectious disease research unit at the Mexican Social Security Institute, Mexico's main public health care system, said that he had been analyzing the past week's influenza statistics.
 ''The number of those exposed and infected has gone up, and the number of fatal cases has gone down,'' he said. ''We can be comfortable with those facts.''
 Officials at the World Health Organization, which has declared that a pandemic is imminent, declined to comment beyond saying that the investigation into the outbreak was continuing.
 But a public health and infectious disease expert from Vanderbilt University, Dr. William Schaffner, said the test results were ''going to change, I think in a substantial way, the image of this outbreak in Mexico.'' 
 If the outbreak is much smaller than initially thought, Dr. Schaffner said, ''It would, I think, enable the world's public health community to take a deep breath and continue to track the outbreak and reduce the tendency, as the W.H.O. has been doing, to notch up on its pandemic scale.''
 If the testing also shows that the disease has caused fewer deaths than the 170 or so suspected, Dr. Schaffner said, it might resolve a question that has been puzzling health experts since the outbreak began: why did the disease appear to be so much more severe in Mexico than in the United States? In the United States, cases have been mild and there has been only one death, that of a 23-month-old child from Mexico. Meanwhile, the disease continued to spread to other countries and was confirmed in more American states on Friday. The disease is expected to drop off during the summer, because flu viruses do not thrive in heat and humidity, but it could rebound in the fall and winter. The World Health Organization said that the flu vaccine given to millions of people for the most recent flu season appeared ineffective against the A(H1N1) strain, but that health officials were talking to manufacturers about creating a new swine-flu vaccine, which would take four to six months to produce. 
 Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, director of the Initiative for Vaccine Research at the World Health Organization, said that unless the numbers of cases decreased significantly, ''it seems mostly likely that the manufacturers will proceed and we will certainly support them.''
 Officials at the Centers for Disease Control said a decision had not yet been made about whether to manufacture a vaccine, but President Obama said that the government would support it. 
 New cases were reported in Denmark, France, Russia, Hong Kong and South Korea on Friday, but they were not confirmed by the health organization. The United States reported 141 confirmed cases in 19 states, up from 109 cases in 11 states on Thursday. 
 Concerns about the disease are having an increasing impact. On Friday, a United Airlines flight with 245 passengers heading from Munich to Dulles Airport in Washington landed in Boston instead because a female passenger had flu symptoms and the airline thought she needed prompt attention, a United Airlines spokesman said. 
 In New York, the school with the nation's largest cluster of swine flu to date -- St. Francis Preparatory School in Fresh Meadows, Queens -- was set to reopen Monday after being closed for a week. 
 Researchers say that some genetic features of the virus may help explain why many cases tend to be mild.
 ''We do not see the markers for virulence that were seen in the 1918 virus,'' said Dr. Cox, of the Centers for Disease Control. ''However, we know there is a great deal we don't understand about the virulence of 1918 or other viruses that have a more severe clinical picture in humans.'' 
 It is too early to know what economic impact, if any, the flu outbreak might have on the United States economy. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the recession will push this year's national economic output 7.5 percent below its potential level. A true flu pandemic could shave off an additional 1 to 4.25 percent and could have a similar effect on the world's output, too, some economists say.

HEADLINE: MasterCard Falls Back, But Beats Forecasts

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The credit card and global payments processor MasterCard said Friday that first-quarter profit fell 18 percent from the year-earlier period, but topped analysts' expectations.
 Despite the better-than-expected results, shares of MasterCard fell sharply as the company said income growth during the year would fall below its long-term outlook of 20 to 30 percent because of the struggling global economy. 
 Stock in MasterCard, which is based in Purchase, N.Y., fell $10.55, or 5.8 percent, to $172.90 a share.
 ''Investors were hoping to hear that MasterCard is starting to see improvement in April, but that wasn't the case,'' said Andy Miedler, a senior technology analyst for Edward Jones. Mr. Miedler added that some of the sell-off could reflect profit taking. Shares had gained 6 percent during the week before Friday's decline.
 MasterCard's chief financial officer, Martina Hund-Mejean, said early data from April continued to show some volume weakness in the United states.
 ''When you look at what's happening in April, we're not yet seeing a stabilization,'' Ms. Hund-Mejean said. ''The data is mixed.''
 Net income for the quarter ended March 31 fell to $367.3 million, or $2.80 a share. MasterCard earned $446.9 million, or $3.37 per share, a year earlier, when it recorded a one-time gain from the sale of an investment. 
 Revenue fell 2 percent, to $1.16 billion from $1.18 billion a year ago. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters forecast earnings of $2.61 a share on revenue of $1.21 billion.
 Despite a weakening global economy, the number of processed transactions rose 6 percent, to 5.1 billion.
 The dollar value of those transactions fell 10 percent to $411 billion, however, primarily because of foreign currency exchange. On a local currency basis, purchase volume increased less than 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Future in Reach, Boxer Is Pulled Back by Past

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BRICK

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex. 

 BODY:
The boxer took his nickname, Mandingo, from the story of a slave turned bare-knuckle champion who bedded his master's wife. At 25, he stood 5 feet 8 inches with a 70-inch reach. He was left-handed. He brawled like a rousted drunkard, all momentum and fists. He never lost a paying fight. He knocked out 22 men, most in the opening rounds, one in 66 seconds.
 His labors on the undercard appeared to be done, with his match Saturday night billed as the co-main event at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, where he was set to fight before a television audience on HBO. He was guaranteed $150,000. The World Boxing Association was already setting up his title bid. 
 But the fighter, James Kirkland, was here in his hometown last Friday, dressed in shackles and an orange jumpsuit, shuffling down the hallway of a federal district courthouse to face charges of weapons possession in violation of probation. Escorted by marshals, he passed his lawyers, his trainers, his manager, his mother and the mother of his two sons. 
 ''Hey, baby,'' his mother said.
 Kirkland did not respond. Inside the courtroom, his request for a pretrial furlough to Nevada was rejected.
 ''Sometimes I have to make these kinds of decisions, and when I do it's never fun,'' the magistrate judge, Andrew W. Austin, said. ''I know it's affecting a lot of people.''
 To HBO, Kirkland was a hard puncher with a hustler's story. To his relatives, he was Big James, the second of three brothers raised without a father on the impoverished east side of town. And to the authorities he was James Derrick Kirkland, a convicted violent felon dealt one chance too many.
 At 17, Kirkland won his first professional fight. In a city park, he met a girl from the other side of the highway.
 ''When I met him, he didn't have nothing,'' said Venessa Wells, now 23, the mother of Kirkland's two young sons. ''He wore the same white T-shirt, same clothes every day.''
 Wells found Kirkland prideful. She turned him away. Later a blind date was arranged. Wells stood to leave, but Kirkland coaxed out her phone number. 
 ''I didn't grow up in the hood,'' she said. ''I guess he was different from where I lived. I was like, Ooh, different.''
 In the next two years, Kirkland won 10 fights. Late one night in September 2003, a city patrolman chased him through a housing complex on suspicion of acting as a vandal's lookout.
 ''Kirkland stated that he ran because he knew what his companion did was wrong and that he did not want to get caught,'' the officer wrote.
 The police found counterfeit $100 bills in Kirkland's pocket. In court documents, he described himself as unemployed, living with his mother. He pleaded guilty to forgery, agreeing to serve two years' probation.
 In November 2003, Kirkland extended his boxing record to 11-0. A year later, Wells gave birth to their first son.
 ''He was always trying to find a way to get out of the situation he was in, trying to get out of the hood or whatever,'' she said. ''I said, James, we're about to have a baby. You need to calm down and get back in the gym.''
 But Kirkland spoke of frustration with his boxing career. He took a job at the United Parcel Service. It lasted little more than a month.
 ''He said, 'It's not enough money,' '' Wells recalled. '' 'How am I supposed to support you and a baby making $9 an hour?' ''
 A few days before Christmas in 2004, the manager of a Dollar Tree store was attacked in a parking lot by the highway. 
 The robber escaped with $1,797. Later, the store manager picked Kirkland out of a lineup. He was charged with aggravated robbery. Wells called a lawyer who advertised on TV.
 ''I didn't know what to do,'' she said.
 As Kirkland awaited trial, his supporters remained steadfast.
 ''Sir, I just cannot believe my son committed the offense of which he is accused,'' his mother, Paula Kirkland, wrote to the judge.
 After six months in jail, Kirkland was released to serve eight years' probation.
 ''At that point right there, I was scared he was going to give up,'' Wells said. ''When you come out of jail, you don't have nothing. You don't have a car, you don't have clothes, you don't have shoes. He didn't know where to start.''
 Wells drove to Wal-Mart to buy jeans and T-shirts for Kirkland. She drove to the mall to buy nice tennis shoes. The couple moved in with her mother. Kirkland brought home stray dogs; Wells sent them away.
 In the ring, Kirkland's fights gained little notice. The couple separated. Wells told Kirkland: ''I know you think I talk too much, or don't want you to have fun, but I just want what's best for you.''
 In May 2008, Kirkland scored a first-round knockout. The video drew attention online. He signed to be promoted by Oscar De La Hoya.
 In March, Kirkland agreed to fight Michael Walker in Las Vegas. HBO sent a camera crew to document Kirkland's training methods.
 ''I'm looking for this contract to be a good thing for me and my family,'' Kirkland said in publicity materials.
 On April 19, officers staking out a gun show followed Kirkland and a 20-year-old woman in a black Cadillac, court records show. In the Cadillac they found a loaded .40-caliber handgun. They found a box of .40-caliber ammunition. And they found a letter from Kirkland's probation officer, granting permission to leave the state for his boxing match. An arrest warrant was issued.
 In federal court on April 24, Kirkland hunched forward and clasped his hands. His lawyers asked for a furlough so that he could reach Nevada, cut eight pounds and make the weigh-in. Federal prosecutors described him as a flight risk.
 When the judge gave his ruling, Kirkland stood, turned and accepted his shackles. Then his lawyers, his trainers, his manager, his mother and the mother of his sons left the courthouse.
 ''He's just got to wake up,'' his mother said. ''And this is a wake-up call right here.''
 On Monday, HBO and De La Hoya announced a change on the card. Instead of James ''Mandingo'' Kirkland, Walker would fight Daniel Jacobs, 22, of Brooklyn. At 6-1 with a 73-inch reach, Jacobs is undefeated in 15 fights. He is said to be a real prospect. The promoters are calling him The Golden Child.

HEADLINE: Fed to Begin Lending Program in June

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve announced Friday that it would start a much-awaited program in June to encourage commercial real estate lending. 
 And, to help make the program more attractive to investors, the Fed will provide longer, five-year loans.
 Investors would use the money to buy securities backed by commercial real estate loans.
 The goal is to expand the availability of these loans, help prevent defaults on commercial properties like office parks and malls and make the sale of distressed properties easier, the Fed said.
 The new commercial real estate component is part of a broader program introduced in March, called the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF, that aims to jump-start lending to consumers and small businesses.
 It figures prominently in efforts by the Fed and the Obama administration to ease credit stresses and stabilize the financial system. Those are critical elements needed to lift the country out of recession.
 The TALF has the potential to generate up to $1 trillion in lending for households and businesses.
 Earlier this year, the government said it planned to expand the TALF to include help for commercial real estate lending.
 The commercial real estate lending industry welcomed the longer loans.
 ''A five-year term is more consistent with the longer-term nature of commercial lending and will provide more flexibility to borrowers as they navigate the current real estate cycle,'' said Christopher Hoeffel, president of the Commercial Mortgage Securities Association.

HEADLINE: Another Weapon Emerges in the Combat Over Global Warming: A Thesaurus

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The problem with global warming, some environmentalists believe, is ''global warming.'' 
 The term turns people off, fostering images of shaggy-haired liberals, economic sacrifice and complex scientific disputes, according to extensive polling and focus group sessions conducted by ecoAmerica, a nonprofit environmental marketing and messaging firm in Washington.
 Instead of grim warnings about global warming, the firm advises, talk about ''our deteriorating atmosphere.'' Drop discussions of carbon dioxide and bring up ''moving away from the dirty fuels of the past.'' Don't confuse people with cap and trade; use terms like ''cap and cash back'' or ''pollution reduction refund.'' 
 EcoAmerica has been conducting research for the last several years to find new ways to frame environmental issues and so build public support for climate change legislation and other initiatives. A summary of the group's latest findings and recommendations was accidentally sent by e-mail to a number of news organizations by someone who sat in this week on a briefing intended for government officials and environmental leaders.
 Asked about the summary, ecoAmerica's president and founder, Robert M. Perkowitz, requested that it not be reported until the formal release of the firm's full paper later this month, but acknowledged that its wide distribution now made compliance with his request unlikely.
 The research directly parallels marketing studies conducted by oil companies, utilities and coal mining concerns that are trying to ''green'' their images with consumers and sway public policy.
 Environmental issues consistently rate near the bottom of public worry, according to many public opinion polls. A Pew Research Center poll released in January found global warming last among 20 voter concerns; it trailed issues like addressing moral decline and decreasing the influence of lobbyists. ''We know why it's lowest,'' said Mr. Perkowitz, a marketer of outdoor clothing and home furnishings before he started ecoAmerica, whose activities are financed by corporations, foundations and individuals. ''When someone thinks of global warming, they think of a politicized, polarized argument. When you say 'global warming,' a certain group of Americans think that's a code word for progressive liberals, gay marriage and other such issues.''
 The answer, Mr. Perkowitz said in his presentation at the briefing, is to reframe the issue using different language. ''Energy efficiency'' makes people think of shivering in the dark. Instead, it is more effective to speak of ''saving money for a more prosperous future.'' In fact, the group's surveys and focus groups found, it is time to drop the term ''the environment'' and talk about ''the air we breathe, the water our children drink.''
 ''Another key finding: remember to speak in TALKING POINTS aspirational language about shared American ideals, like freedom, prosperity, independence and self-sufficiency while avoiding jargon and details about policy, science, economics or technology,'' said the e-mail account of the group's study.
 Mr. Perkowitz and allies in the environmental movement have been briefing officials in Congress and the administration in the hope of using the findings to change the terms of the debate now under way in Washington. 
 Opponents of legislation to combat global warming are engaged in a similar effort. Trying to head off a cap-and-trade system, in which government would cap the amount of heat-trapping emissions allowed and let industry trade permits to emit those gases, they are coaching Republicans to refer to any such system as a giant tax that would kill jobs. Coal companies are taking out full-page advertisements promising ''clean, green coal.'' The natural gas industry refers to its product as ''clean fuel green fuel.'' Oil companies advertise their investments in alternative energy.
 Robert J. Brulle of Drexel University, an expert on environmental communications, said ecoAmerica's campaign was a mirror image of what industry and political conservatives were doing. ''The form is the same; the message is just flipped,'' he said. ''You want to sell toothpaste, we'll sell it. You want to sell global warming, we'll sell that. It's the use of advertising techniques to manipulate public opinion.''
 He said the approach was cynical and, worse, ineffective. ''The right uses it, the left uses it, but it doesn't engage people in a face-to-face manner,'' he said, ''and that's the only way to achieve real, lasting social change.''
 Frank Luntz, a Republican communications consultant, prepared a strikingly similar memorandum in 2002, telling his clients that they were losing the environmental debate and advising them to adjust their language. He suggested referring to themselves as ''conservationists'' rather than ''environmentalists,'' and emphasizing ''common sense'' over scientific argument.
 And, Mr. Luntz and Mr. Perkowitz agree, ''climate change'' is an easier sell than ''global warming.''

HEADLINE: To Avoid Conflict Later, It's Best to Keep Bequests Flexible

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
Like many people, I pay attention when I hear news about my alma mater. I enjoyed college -- I went to Trinity College in Connecticut -- and still like to know what is going on there. But last week, I spotted something about Trinity that made me think about a growing problem between donors and recipients: a clash over how to use a long-ago gift. 
 The story in Trinity's case is a common one for these rifts. An economics professor (whom I don't know) complained to the Connecticut attorney general's office that money meant to support his endowed position was being misused. What had been $750,000 some 30 years ago had grown to $9 million. That was far more than was needed to pay one professor, so the college proposed using some of the excess income to pay for scholarships. The professor cried foul.
 What was interesting about my alma mater's problems, first reported in The Wall Street Journal, was not the amount of money or how it was being redirected (for scholarships). It was that battles between dead donors and nonprofits are increasing as the economy worsens. 
 ''The colleges are getting the publicity, but it happens all the time,'' said Hank Goldstein, principal of the Oram Group, an adviser to charities.
 When the donor is alive, redirecting funds is simple: a charity asks and the donor agrees or disagrees. The battles ensue when the donor is dead and the meaning of the legacy is up for debate. 
 The university may decide that financing something additional is still following the intent of the original gift, but the heirs may disagree. Yet if the university presses on, the heirs have little recourse beyond the court of public opinion. State attorneys general are responsible for regulating nonprofits, but they often do not have the time or desire to get involved. 
 ''Generally, the donor's recourse is to not make future gifts,'' said William Woodson, managing director at Credit Suisse. ''And obviously that hurts the charity because you want to cultivate a donor base.''
 The good news is both donors and recipients have become much more pragmatic about gifts.
 ''Now, institutions have to have the uncomfortable conversation of saying, 'If you get arrested and convicted of a crime, we're taking your name off the building,' '' said Melissa Berman, president and chief executive of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisers. ''And the donor has to say, 'If you go under or don't use the funds the right way, you have to return the funds.' ''
 Still, most people who give with strings attached do so because they have a vision that they want carried out. For those of you considering donations, here are some of the pros and cons when imposing restrictions on your gift. 
 CHECKBOOK PHILANTHROPY The easiest way to have an immediate impact is to write a check and trust the charity to use it wisely. Another, particularly in a recession, is to be understanding. 
 ''With a multiyear gift to a nonprofit, people have been flexible with moving the payments up, if another fund-raising campaign came up short,'' said Lisa Philp, managing director at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.
 But even when the economic crisis passes, institutions appreciate unrestricted donations. Your bequest may go toward keeping the lights on or paying salaries in the development office, which are not as glamorous as a building or an endowed chair. But they are practical and necessary. 
 LIFETIME GUIDANCE There are several ways for a donor to give and still have a say. 
 A popular method is a donor-advised fund. Think of it as a charitable mutual fund: you put in money when you want, take a tax deduction as if you were donating to a public charity and have the firm running the fund manage the money. When it comes time to make a donation, you can direct it to the charity of your choice. 
 Since it is an ''advised'' fund, the firm does not have to follow your wishes, but, practically speaking, that rarely happens. The two best-known donor-advised funds are operated by Fidelity and Schwab, but there are dozens of community foundations that offer them as well. The New York Community Trust is one of the largest, with 1,100 donor-advised funds (out of some 2,000 bequests it oversees) directed at interests in New York City. 
 ''People don't set up a donor-advised fund with a narrow interest,'' said Lorie Slutsky, its president. ''Someone with $5 million may care about his alma mater, his church, the ballet but he also wants to do something about hunger and homelessness.'' 
 The New York Community Trust, founded in 1924, does its best to adhere to a donor's wishes, but Ms. Slutsky said the agreements for the funds they managed in perpetuity explicitly granted them discretion.
 A donor who wants to remove that discretion would be more apt to give his money as a restricted or endowed gift to one institution. These gifts are typically made for something specific -- scholarships, art collections, fields of study -- and the recipient must use the money for those purposes, even if it has more urgent needs. 
 Mr. Woodson said he understood both why a donor would be angry if his gift were used for something other than he intended and why a nonprofit would need to reallocate money. ''Charities need to act in the best interest of their charities,'' he said. ''It's a delicate balance.'' 
 The easiest way for a donor to prevent problems with heirs is for both parties to negotiate up front and to be clear about what they want to accomplish with the money.
 ''Is it important you offer courses in such and such for people who are going into nursing, or is it important that you offer them a path to further their career in nursing?'' Ms. Berman asked.
 The key is to realize how much the world will change and to know that the more restrictive your gift is the more difficult it will be for an institution to honor your intent.
 Iris J. Goodwin, associate professor at the University of Tennessee College of Law, said a fund set up to buy typewriters 100 years ago should still buy typewriters today, even if there was little need for them. Most colleges would probably use the funds to buy computers, but doing so would violate the bequest, she said.
 Few would challenge something like this, since typewriters are nearly obsolete. But when money is, say, for the study of Sumerian civilization, there is no legal reason not to finance it, even if the restricted endowment has grown to $30 million and there are only four students. 
 CONTROL FROM THE GRAVE Setting up your own charity is the best way to insure that grants match your beliefs. ''The only foolproof way is for people to create their own charitable entity,'' said William Sutton, head of philanthropy in the United States for UBS. ''You can set the parameters and the way you want to give.''
 But charities are expensive to operate and the government allows less of a tax deduction when you give money to your private foundation. In the case of a cash gift, the difference in the deduction is 20 percentage points. 
 Of course, no matter how much you plan, family members can squabble long after you're dead.

HEADLINE: Citi Will Sell Japan Units, Bolstering Its Capital

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
Citigroup said on Friday that it would sell its Japanese brokerage and investment banking units for $5.56 billion, securing much-needed capital before results expected next week from a government ''stress test'' of its financial health. 
 Citigroup, the recipient of about $45 billion in bailout money, will sell its Japanese securities arm and parts of its investment banking business to Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group.
 The overall transaction, including shareholdings and retained debt payments, is valued at 774.5 billion yen ($7.8 billion), Citigroup and Sumitomo Mitsui said. Citigroup said it would realize a loss of $200 million on the transaction, which would generate $2.5 billion in tangible common equity, a measure of financial health.
 Citigroup's sale of important businesses in Japan would reverse an ambitious, yet short-lived, push into the country. Just two years ago, the bank, based in New York, had spent about 1.6 trillion yen to acquire the Nikko Cordial franchise.
 But Citigroup has been scrambling to raise capital after a year of crippling losses that has led to three bailouts, the last of which gave the government a 36 percent stake in the bank.
 Vikram S. Pandit, Citigroup's chief executive, called the sale ''another step in the execution'' of a strategy announced in January that would separate Citigroup's main banking business from its other assets.
 Citigroup's sale in Japan includes Nikko Cordial Securities, a large brokerage firm, and parts of Nikko Citigroup, the investment banking unit of Citigroup in Japan.
 The transaction does not include Nikko Asset Management, which is expected to be sold separately. The sale also leaves out Citigroup's consumer banking and credit card assets in Japan, which Citigroup says it will keep.
 The deal comes as United States regulators prepare to disclose results of the stress tests, which are assessing the banks' ability to withstand a further deterioration in the economy.
 With its purchase, Sumitomo Mitsui hopes to close the gap with the top brokerage house in Japan, Nomura Holdings. Nomura bought some of the operations of the failed investment bank, Lehman Brothers, last year.
 Sumitomo Mitsui invested $745 million in the British bank Barclays last year and has had capital ties with Goldman Sachs since 1986. The Japanese bank said Friday that it would also work with Citigroup in the securities brokerage, sales and trading businesses.
 Japanese banks have been looking to expand globally and increase fee revenue amid sluggish corporate activity at home. But losses on recent investments, as well as mounting bad loans and write-downs in the value of shareholdings, have battered their balance sheets.
 On Friday, the biggest bank in Japan, Mitsubishi UFJ, said it expected to swing to a 260 billion yen loss for the year ending next March, compared with a previous forecast of a 50 billion yen profit. Mitsubishi UFJ, which invested $9 billion in Morgan Stanley last year, said its equities losses were likely to come to 520 billion yen.
 Sumitomo Mitsui booked a loss of 390 billion yen in the year ended March 31. The bank said it was assessing the effects of the Citigroup deal on its finances.

HEADLINE: A Blessed Approach to Debt

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
This week, yet another Washington debate over who deserves a break on their debts drew to a close. On Thursday, the Senate voted against allowing judges to adjust the terms of the mortgages of people filing for personal bankruptcy.
 Scratch the surface of the opposition in these sorts of debates, and it tends to ooze moral righteousness. ''People who get themselves in over their heads,'' the upstanding declare, ''need to bear some responsibility for their foolishness.'' 
 Maybe so. But if we can't pass legislation that gives us new tools to determine who should be eligible for debt forgiveness, we need to look elsewhere for written instruction. Given that large numbers of Americans take many of their moral cues from their spiritual beliefs, I decided to turn to the good books of some of the world's great religions for guidance on the subject. 
 Just about every doctrinal expert I spoke with, no matter the background, began by mentioning slavery. In ancient times, when interest accrued and compounded, it was common for the indebted to simply work it off. Often, this took the rest of their lives. Many of the teachings that grew up around debt forgiveness aimed to avoid that sort of outcome. 
 Still, the notion of enslavement, albeit of the psychological sort, survived to modern times. N. Eldon Tanner, a leader of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, wrote: ''Those who structure their standard of living to allow a little surplus control their circumstances. Those who spend a little more than they earn are controlled by their circumstances. They are in bondage.'' 
 This will be a familiar idea to people who have considered the idea of paying only the minimum amount on a large credit card debt, only to realize that if they do that, the debt may actually outlive them.
 ''Binding oneself financially is not something that trumps every other need,'' added the Rev. Brian Daley, a Jesuit priest and professor of theology at the University of Notre Dame. Scripture suggests that the redistribution of property is also a reasonable thing to do. ''You just can't mention it in public in the United States,'' he said. ''Our notion of capitalism is so absolutized that we give it a quasi-religious value.''
 However strongly we believe in free markets (not, perhaps, as fervently as we did a year or two ago), the theme of forgiveness does run strongly through religious writings of all sorts. In the Old Testament, for instance, Chapter 15 of the book of Deuteronomy calls for the forgiveness of debts once every seven years. 
 Religious leaders were aware, however, of the chilling effect that could have on lending (particularly in the sixth year). ''The Torah says don't think that way, don't be stingy'' in that sixth year, said Rabbi Mark Washofsky, a professor of Jewish law at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in Cincinnati. He added that later on, the Talmud introduced the idea of a Prosbul. This was a sort of workaround court that was not covered by the religious law. The Prosbul could administer debts during or right before the seventh year. 
 When the court confiscated property outright, sometimes this worked to the benefit of the debtor and sometimes to the benefit of the creditor. ''In other words, the ultimate power resides with the community,'' Rabbi Washofsky said. ''It can intervene in what was a private transaction, in a situation of great need. The power is there. The real question is, do you use it and when?''
 The answer depends on who you are ultimately reporting to, your immediate supervisor, your shareholders or the Entity that will ultimately render judgment on you. 
 Father Daley, of Notre Dame, said that the New Testament talked about debts to God resulting from sin. Another idea popular with rabbis and early Christians, he said, was the notion that doing good deeds turned God into a debtor. ''God is a kind of referee or bookkeeper, noticing things that people do,'' he said. ''And if they do good deeds without obligation, God will repay them in judgment. I think being able to dismiss debts or forgive them is something that is seen as a generous and gracious act.''
 Bankers that cater to Muslims, who are not allowed to charge interest because of some of the tenets of Islamic law, claim to foreclose on homeowners less frequently than regular creditors, according to Mahmoud Amin El-Gamal, an expert on Islamic finance and an economics professor at Rice University. He added, however, that any leniency was probably priced into the financing in the first place, making it a bit more expensive. 
 The Koran, meanwhile, offers one of the more useful ideas on debt. ''If the debtor is in a difficulty, grant him time till it is easy for him to repay,'' the passage in the second chapter, verse 280, reads. ''But if ye remit by way of charity, that is best for you if ye only knew.''
 Charity is not required here, according to Mr. El-Gamal. But during that granting of time, he added, the creditor is not allowed to charge interest. 
 This offers a possible compromise. If lenders and senators are unwilling to allow judges to permanently alter the terms of a mortgage loan, perhaps they would agree to allow qualified borrowers who have lost their jobs or fallen ill to take a two- to six-month break from making payments. 
 During this time, the lenders would stop the interest clock from ticking, not levy any fees and not tack on missed payments to the end of the loan. Then, once the borrowers were back on their feet, they could start regular payments again. If they weren't able to make them by then, then foreclosure proceedings could begin.
 Or, if this proves unpalatable or too expensive, how about selling an insurance policy that would pay for a six-month period of payments? That could satisfy both God and the gods of capitalism. 
 Perhaps if the Democrats want to enact bankruptcy reform, they ought to bring an imam to address their opponents.

HEADLINE: Putting Off the Final Buzzer for More 'OT'

BYLINE: By LYNN ZINSER

 BODY:
In honor of the Celtics and Bulls, who are playing one of the most epic, if not the best, N.B.A. playoff series ever, we are going into overtime. Seven of them. Buckle up. Every word carries the entire column in the balance and one mistake could end our season. We'll throw in a chest-bump or two and howl when it's over.
 There are several columnists out there who wish the two teams would play forever, including ESPN.com's Gene Wojciechowski, and others like CBSSports.com's Ken Berger who thinks while Boston and Chicago are fixing everything wrong with the N.B.A., they should try fixing the economy too. The Celtics' Paul Pierce said, ''Everybody is getting their money's worth,'' an idea the Boston Globe's Dan Shaughnessy cannot argue with and Yahoo's Dan Wetzel just says, wow. 
 The Orlando Magic finished off its series with Philadelphia just in time to watch all three of the Bulls-Celtics overtimes. Magic center Dwight Howardspent his one-game suspension Twittering, with most of his Tweets along the lines of this one: ''cmon boysssssss im sooo hype.'' Although he also announced that after eating French fries, pizza and wings he was still hungry. Get that man back on the court.
 One player the N.B.A. doesn't want to see is Ohio State benchwarmer Mark Titus, who earned the unusual honor of being asked to remove his name from eligibility for the draft. Titus, whose entertaining blog has captivated fans, thinks it is funny that the N.B.A. has so little sense of humor it wants him to go away.
 The Bulls and Celtics will play Game 7 on Saturday night, after the other biggest (if much shorter) sporting event of the weekend in which the competitors will be eating carrots instead of French fries. And they will definitely not be Twittering. Yes, it's Kentucky Derby time, which Tim Layden of Sports Illustrated tells us, used to get a lot more attention. Some, like Mike Celizic of NBCSports.com, bemoan the decline of racing and talk of the joys of the Derby, while Gregg Doyel of CBSSports.com cannot wait until it goes away for good. Tom Pedulla writes in USA Today that horse racing is trying to address its many issues, not the least of which is safety after last year's sad story of Eight Belles.
 If what you care about is picking a winner, USA Today says to look at the horses' racing history and WSJ.com offers Keith J. Winstein's analysis to consider the ''fastest average speed'' in the prep races. Or just pick the favorite.
 Everyone's favorite target in baseball took a few more shots to the ego, and CBSSports.com's Ray Ratto was caught off guard, thinking he wouldn't be kicking Alex Rodriguez again for another week or so. Baseball commissioner Bud Seligwill resist the urge to kick until after he reads Selena Roberts' book alleging Rodriguez lied when he said he only used steroids while he was a Texas Ranger.
 A-Rod got some support from his old high school teammate, Doug Mientkiewicz, now a Dodger, who said he did not believe the allegation that Rodriguez used steroids as early as high school.
 When Indians' reliever Tony Sipp thinks about his high school -- which is in Katrina-ravaged Moss Point, Miss. -- he wants to reach out and help.
 Tampa Bay pitcher Matt Garza did his best Thursday night to give baseball a non-A-Rod story line, flirting with a perfect game, in a 13-0 demolition of the Red Sox, which featured outfielder Jonathan Van Every pitching an inning.
 Perhaps someday Van Every will prove as versatile as Jose Canseco, who has moved on from baseball player to author, reality-show star, whistle-blower and car-into-tree-rammer to now trying his luck at mixed martial arts, with his first match against a 7-foot-2 guy from Japan.
 While you are in the mood for eye-rolling, consider the fixation with quarterback Brett Favre, whose second retirement has spawned several overtimes worth of conjecture whether this one will take, with the St. Paul Pioneer Press speculating that the Vikings could be his next stop.
 If you prefer a more heartwarming story to linger over, the Los Angeles Times' T.J. Simers catches up with legendary basketball coach John Wooden and determines he is too busy at age 96 to consider dying.
 Now that is what we call a successful overtime.

NEW YORK ON LESS:
 Recession Deals
 At the Table
 As more New Yorkers are brown-bagging lunches and making dinner at home, city restaurants have found a creative way to lure customers back. 
 Enter the recession specials: From the Soup Man's ''$3.99 Bailout Package'' to the Beacon's ''60-Day Stimulus Plan,'' restaurants are offering deep discounts.
 ''People just want simple food, a simple meal, and $5 macaroni and cheese, you can't go wrong,'' said Albert Fenza, head chef of SuperMac, during a packed dinner shift on Wednesday. He said that business was booming and that his $5 mac 'n' cheese special was drawing in customers who end up choosing higher-priced items. Many of his customers just want comfort foods to ease the recession's effect on their minds and wallets, he said.
 Though recession specials are a way to help business at less-expensive restaurants, for fine dining places, it is a way to survive. ''Our drop has been manageable, and we equate that to the special-value propositions,'' says Vadim Ponorovsky, owner of Paradou, a French restaurant in the meatpacking district. 
 Mr. Ponorovsky said specials like Paradou's $35 five-course prix fixe dinner were saving his business, since they give diners who are wary of spending money on luxurious meals a chance to try his cuisine. He added, ''There's no way we can make a profit now, and it's all about survival, and the recession deals really help.''
 Many New Yorkers are taking advantage of the specials. ''In this recession, I've had the chance to eat at some very high-end places for some very reasonable prices,'' said Lindsay Hausner. He said he frequented restaurants with specials, since he did not expect the offers to last long once the economy recovered. ''We'll be back on track, and the really expensive restaurants will start charging very expensive prices for their meals again.''
 Most economists say the recession isn't going away any time soon. Mr. Fenza insisted that even when it does, he will keep the $5 macaroni-and-cheese special. ''It's a good solid product that people are buying,'' he said, ''and that's the outcome that we want.''

HEADLINE: A Shrinking Trade Deficit, At Least for Now

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at norris.blogs.nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THE American trade deficit is collapsing at the fastest rate ever, a testament to the ability of a worldwide recession to sharply reduce global economic imbalances that had grown to unprecedented size. 
 The United States estimated this week that the trade deficit, as a percent of gross domestic product, fell to 2.4 percent in the first quarter of this year. 
 That is the smallest deficit in a decade, as can be seen in the accompanying chart. It is less than half of the deficit shown in the first quarter of 2008, when the American recession was new and not yet devastating other economies.
 Few countries have reported first-quarter data as yet, and the American number will be revised. But what appears to be happening is that much of the pain from the fall in American consumption is being felt in other countries, since exporters in those countries supplied the products that Americans are no longer buying.
 Declining trade deficits in the United States are likely to be matched by falling trade surpluses in countries that have historically been net exporters. That is one reason Germany's economy appears to be faltering badly and China has embarked on a huge economic stimulus program.
 The shrinking trade deficit is not being caused by a rebound in American exports. They are falling as well, but not nearly as much as imports are declining.
 As can be seen from the other chart, American exports peaked in the third quarter of 2008, at 13.7 percent of G.D.P., but were down to 10.9 percent in the first three months of this year.
 Over the same period, imports fell to 13.3 percent of G.D.P. from a peak of 18.6 percent. 
 Those figures are based on nominal dollar values, and, in part, reflect the fall in oil prices. But even after adjusting for inflation, imports are down sharply.
 For many years, critics of American economic policies, particularly in Europe, have said that the United States had to take action to reduce its trade deficit. Now that the reduction has happened, it is they who are among the most hurt by it.
 Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG, pointed out that the elimination of the trade deficit -- an idea that seemed beyond belief only a few months ago -- could be within reach. The United States, he said, does not have to develop some new export industry. It simply has to refrain from importing more when exports recover to last year's level.
 For anything like that to happen, however, the engine of recovery in the world would have to be a country or region other than the United States, whose own recovery would need to be gradual and based in large part on growth overseas.
 That seems unlikely to happen. Some countries that historically ran large trade surpluses are in no position to use fiscal stimulus to accelerate growth in their economies, because their own access to international credit markets has been damaged. Others, including most of Western Europe, have so far resisted large stimulus packages.
 In the United States, however, the stimulus efforts have been very large, and that seems likely to continue. That same G.D.P. report showed a mild and tentative rebound in consumer spending in the first quarter. If that continues, the trade deficit may soon start to widen again.

HEADLINE: Don't Ask. You Can Afford It.

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
Wal-Mart may have become the premier place to shop for Americans struggling through a severe recession, but the giant chain has competition nipping at its heels.
 The nation's dollar stores, those once-dowdy chains that lured shoppers by selling some or all of their merchandise for $1, are suddenly hot. They are busily opening new stores, outfitting existing stores with refrigerators and freezers, and sprucing up their aisles with better lighting, fresh paint and new signs. 
 And while most big retail chains are closing stores and radically cutting back on new outlets, the dollar chains are planning to open hundreds of stores this year in some of the best locations to which they have ever had access. 
 Dollar stores have long had a reputation for being down-at-the-heels places to buy cheap, generic goods. While keeping their low prices, they are revamping their image and climbing the respectability ladder -- in some cases into the Fortune 500. 
 Dollar General, long part of that select club of the 500 biggest American companies, appears on this year's list at No. 259, up 15 places from last year. And Dollar Tree landed on the list for the first time, at No. 499. Those rankings are a far cry from Wal-Mart Stores, which holds the No. 2 position behind Exxon Mobil, but some dollar chains these days are growing faster than Wal-Mart. 
 ''When you think about the dirty dark days of dollar stores,'' said Joshua Braverman, a spokesman for Family Dollar, ''I think we've come a really long way.''
 Richard Russell, a health care worker for an assisted-living community in East Northport, N.Y., said that even people who can afford to pay $5,000 a month for their parents to reside in the community are shopping at the local dollar store.
 ''You go to the supermarket and you buy eggs and milk, and your money's shot,'' Mr. Russell said recently as he pulled a box of Kraft macaroni and cheese, 85 cents, off the shelf.
 The selection of merchandise at dollar stores is nowhere near that of Wal-Mart, of course. But Mr. Russell is among the consumers who said they liked shopping in a smaller store where the staff was easily accessible and the aisles tended to be less crowded. 
 Of the nation's three major self-described dollar chains, Family Dollar and Dollar General sell many items for about $1 along with other merchandise that costs more. Over the last year, another chain, Dollar Tree, tried selling items in some stores for more than $1, but sales were not impressive enough to keep the experiment alive. Today, Dollar Tree is back to being a dollar purist. 
 What the three companies have in common is strong sales growth in their most recent reporting periods -- a feat in this economy, where most chains are posting declines.
 For the three months ending Feb. 28, sales at Family Dollar stores open at least a year -- a measure of retail health known as same-store sales -- increased 6.4 percent compared with last year. Customer traffic, as well as the average amount of money spent at the checkout counter at Family Dollar, which operates more than 6,600 stores, also increased. 
 Same-store sales for the three months ending Jan. 31 increased 2.2 percent at Dollar Tree, which has more than 3,600 stores. Timothy J. Reid, vice president of investor relations for Dollar Tree, said the company had a 3.7 percent increase in the number of transactions in 2008 compared with the previous year. 
 At Dollar General, which operates more than 8,400 stores, same-store sales for the three months ending Jan. 30 were up 9.4 percent. 
 Stacey Widlitz, a retailing analyst with Pali Research, summarized the dollar-store success story: ''They're killing it because consumers are trading down.'' 
 As a result, the chains are opening more stores and negotiating less expensive rents in better shopping centers. After all, landlords are hungry for healthy retailers to take over the empty spaces left behind by bankrupt and ailing chains.
 ''We have seen a softening of the market when it comes to real estate, and certainly when you're the big dog and doing well, people want to come to you,'' said Mr. Braverman of Family Dollar. ''We plan to open 200 stores this year.''
 Dollar Tree plans to open 235 new stores and relocate 90 existing stores. Dollar General will open 450 new stores and remodel or relocate about 400 existing stores. 
 To capitalize on the down economy, the chains are offering more groceries and household necessities -- and giving those items more prominence in their stores.
 ''All these guys are seeing more traffic and new customers than they've seen in the past,'' said Joseph Feldman, a retailing analyst with the Telsey Advisory Group. ''It's clear to me that it's an attempt to capture and retain the customers that they are getting.'' 
 Some chains began making their food business a priority well before the recession hit -- installing refrigerators and freezers so they could take market share from grocery stores; adding more name brands; and trying to make their stores more appealing by repainting them, improving the lighting and widening the aisles. 
 While most dollar store and closeout retailers said food did not make up the bulk of their sales, they said it has become an increasingly important part of their business. In its 2008 fiscal year, Dollar Tree added freezers and coolers to 135 stores. This year, at least 150 more stores will receive them. 
 Mr. Braverman of Family Dollar said the company had spent the last few years positioning itself ''for an economy such as this'' by adding more brands and a wider selection of salad dressings, pastas and sauces. Last month the chain began carrying Double Stuf Oreo cookies. Family Dollar also began rearranging merchandise to make its stores easier to shop. ''Are the plates near the food?'' Mr. Braverman said. ''No? Well, let's put them over there.''
 More dollar stores are also accepting food stamps, which is helping drive sales. Dollar Tree, for instance, accepts food stamps in 2,200 of its stores today, up from 1,154 stores last year. The company expects that number to increase yet again as more of its stores receive refrigerators and freezers. 
 Low prices are not the only reason consumers are flocking to dollar stores, though. 
 Some go because they can get a shopping fix without doing too much damage to their wallets. But they have to be careful. ''You can spend a lot of money that you don't mean to,'' said Susan Fallon, during a recent trip to Family Dollar in East Northport. A teacher and single mother of two children ages 6 and 9, she has been trying to save money by cutting back on driving, dining out, eating meat and drinking soda.
 Lisa DeFranco, a seventh-grade teaching assistant, agreed. But like many consumers she likes the convenience of shopping at a local store; the quieter, less crowded aisles; and the personal attention -- something that is often lacking at big-box discounters. 
 ''The man who works here is such a nice guy,'' Ms. DeFranco said. ''They always offer to help you.''
 Mr. Braverman of Family Dollar said the small-town feel of the stores appealed to many customers. And he noted another boon: ''You don't have to navigate the big-box parking lot.''

HEADLINE: Citi Will Sell Japan Units, Bolstering Its Capital

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
Citigroup said on Friday that it would sell its Japanese brokerage and investment banking units for $5.56 billion, securing much-needed capital before results expected next week from a government ''stress test'' of its financial health. 
 Citigroup, the recipient of about $45 billion in bailout money, will sell its Japanese securities arm and parts of its investment banking business to Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group.
 The overall transaction, including shareholdings and retained debt payments, is valued at 774.5 billion yen ($7.8 billion), Citigroup and Sumitomo Mitsui said. Citigroup said it would realize a loss of $200 million on the transaction, which would generate $2.5 billion in tangible common equity, a measure of financial health.
 Citigroup's sale of important businesses in Japan would reverse an ambitious, yet short-lived, push into the country. Just two years ago, the bank, based in New York, had spent about 1.6 trillion yen to acquire the Nikko Cordial franchise.
 But Citigroup has been scrambling to raise capital after a year of crippling losses that has led to three bailouts, the last of which gave the government a 36 percent stake in the bank.
 Vikram S. Pandit, Citigroup's chief executive, called the sale ''another step in the execution'' of a strategy announced in January that would separate Citigroup's main banking business from its other assets.
 Citigroup's sale in Japan includes Nikko Cordial Securities, a large brokerage firm, and parts of Nikko Citigroup, the investment banking unit of Citigroup in Japan.
 The transaction does not include Nikko Asset Management, which is expected to be sold separately. The sale also leaves out Citigroup's consumer banking and credit card assets in Japan, which Citigroup says it will keep.
 The deal comes as United States regulators prepare to disclose results of the stress tests, which are assessing the banks' ability to withstand a further deterioration in the economy.
 With its purchase, Sumitomo Mitsui hopes to close the gap with the top brokerage house in Japan, Nomura Holdings. Nomura bought some of the operations of the failed investment bank, Lehman Brothers, last year.
 Sumitomo Mitsui invested $745 million in the British bank Barclays last year and has had capital ties with Goldman Sachs since 1986. The Japanese bank said Friday that it would also work with Citigroup in the securities brokerage, sales and trading businesses.
 Japanese banks have been looking to expand globally and increase fee revenue amid sluggish corporate activity at home. But losses on recent investments, as well as mounting bad loans and write-downs in the value of shareholdings, have battered their balance sheets.
 On Friday, the biggest bank in Japan, Mitsubishi UFJ, said it expected to swing to a 260 billion yen loss for the year ending next March, compared with a previous forecast of a 50 billion yen profit. Mitsubishi UFJ, which invested $9 billion in Morgan Stanley last year, said its equities losses were likely to come to 520 billion yen.
 Sumitomo Mitsui booked a loss of 390 billion yen in the year ended March 31. The bank said it was assessing the effects of the Citigroup deal on its finances.

HEADLINE: A Spotty Response to the Flu Threat

 BODY:
The sudden emergence of a new swine flu virus has posed the first real test of new preparations to control novel influenza strains that might spread rapidly around the world and, if sufficiently virulent, kill millions of people. The global response has been mixed -- sluggish at the start but increasingly sure-footed as the new strain has spread from Mexico to the United States and other nations. We are fortunate that the initial illnesses in most countries have been mild, no worse than the standard seasonal flu that we endure every year without panic.
 A big advance in this emerging epidemic is that no nation seems to have covered up the problem as China did in 2002-2003 when its secrecy slowed the response to SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. International experts have praised Mexico for its openness once it understood the new threat. 
 Even so, there appears to have been serious glitches in detection and information sharing. The World Health Organization did not issue its first warning until three weeks or more after the first cases emerged in Southern California and Mexico. By that time the slim hope had vanished that a fast-moving virus like influenza could be contained in a small area of a single country. 
 The causes of the delays are not yet clear, but the United States itself may have fumbled at the start. The first two cases of the new illness in this country were detected in late March in Southern California. Special diagnostic tests being tested in the state showed them to be an unusual influenza strain. But it was not until April 17 that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified the cause as a novel swine flu virus. Officials will need to explain why it took so long and whether such gaps can be reduced in the future.
 Meanwhile, Mexican authorities were slow to grasp the significance of an increase in pneumonia and respiratory illness, largely because it was submerged in a statistical sea of normal flu cases. As the case load mounted in April, Mexico, which lacks the sophisticated tests that identify a new flu strain, sent samples to a Canadian laboratory that quickly identified the new swine flu virus. Mexico bypassed the C.D.C. for fear of getting slowed by paperwork, a complaint that needs investigation.
 Once the alarm had been sounded, the response in this country was vigorous, thanks to advanced planning and stockpiling of medicines and equipment during the Bush administration. The federal government, which had 50 million treatments of antiviral drugs, distributed a fourth of that to states and localities, many of which had created federally subsidized stockpiles. If anything, this enormous array of antiviral medications and other medical supplies was overkill given the relatively small number of cases and the mildness of the disease so far in this country. But it was reassuring evidence that a defense could be mounted against a nastier virus.
 Many experts believe serious gaps remain in our defenses. Budget cuts and layoffs at state and local health departments during the recession seem likely to crimp protection efforts. It is not clear that most state and local health departments could distribute the medications fast enough for them to be effective. And almost all hospitals lack the ''surge capacity'' for the horde of patients that might result from a pandemic, a problem that may be almost inescapable for financial reasons. 
 The scramble to keep up with the new flu strain has underscored how wrong some Republicans were to eliminate $870 million for pandemic flu preparedness from the stimulus package on the grounds that it was not relevant to creating jobs or stimulating the economy. President Obama was wise to come back with a request for $1.5 billion to supplement medication stockpiles, develop a vaccine, improve monitoring and diagnostic capabilities and assist global efforts to stem the outbreak. Such spending would not only help protect against the flu, it would help keep Americans at work rather than bedridden with swine flu should the virus spread widely.

HEADLINE: Shares Rise Slightly on Factory Reports

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY; Eric Dash contributed reporting.

 BODY:
In recent weeks, hints of slowing economic declines and less-terrible pieces of data have been enough to warm investors' spirits and push stock markets sharply higher. On Friday, the same messages got a more measured reaction from Wall Street.
 Stock markets finished moderately higher as investors received more signals of muted activity in the industrial sector. A private group said manufacturing activity continued to decline in April, although more slowly, and the government reported that manufacturing orders fell again in March. 
 After wobbling all day, the Dow Jones industrial average ended with a gain of 44.29 points, or 0.54 percent, at 8,212.41, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.71 points, or 0.54 percent, to 877.52. The Nasdaq composite index was up 1.9 points, or 0.11 percent, to 1,719.20.
 For the week, the Dow was up 1.7 percent, while the S.& P. 500 rose 1.3 percent.
 Ford and General Motors fell Friday, as did American-traded shares of the Italian automaker Fiat, which is forming an alliance with the bankrupt automaker Chrysler. The government pushed Chrysler into bankruptcy on Thursday after months of negotiations with creditors fell apart. On Friday, lawyers for Chrysler asked a judge to secure employee paychecks and basically allow the company to keep operating.
 Shares of big banks like Bank of America and Citigroup, and troubled regional banks like Ohio-based Fifth Third turned lower after reports that the government would delay by several days the release of its so-called stress tests of 19 big banks. Regulators have been examining banks to see whether they have enough of a capital cushion to withstand additional declines in the economy.
 Federal officials now plan to release the results on May 7, a government official briefed on the plans said. They will list the banks' estimated losses for certain types of loans and gauge their ability to absorb those losses if conditions worsen. The information will be tallied for all 19 banks and broken down for each institution. 
 Two new reports suggested further economic declines were in the pipeline.
 The Institute for Supply Management said economic activity among manufacturers fell in April, but the pace of contraction was slower than at any time since September. New orders improved, as did gauges of employment and inventories. And the Commerce Department said that orders for manufactured goods fell 0.9 percent, or $3.2 billion, in March. 
 After a brutal winter, stock markets have been on a roll this spring in response to some encouraging outlooks from corporations and rosier economic numbers. In April, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed more than 7 percent, and the S.& P. 500 soared 9.4 percent, its best performance since March 2000. 
 After Wall Street skidded to its lowest levels in more than a decade, stocks have surged since the second week of March, propelled higher by hopes that the banks and the broader economy were beginning to pull out of a long slide. Investors are still worried about rising unemployment and the prospect that some banks will need to raise more money, but they are still buying into the rally, analysts said.
 ''There are buyers out there, whether individuals or institutions,'' said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at Standard and Poor's. ''Somebody's obviously got guts or liquidity.''
 That optimism helped to lift credit markets on Friday. 
 Yields on better-quality corporate bonds and riskier junk bonds fell, indicating more appetite for corporate debt that investors once shunned. And an important measure of borrowing costs among banks, the London interbank offered rate, fell to 1.01 percent, its lowest point in a year.
 Treasury prices weakened again as investors looked warily at the new supplies of government debt coming onto the market. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 9/32, to 96 20/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.15 percent, up from 3.12 percent late Thursday.
 The Federal Reserve has tried to suppress interest rates by buying longer-term Treasuries, but rates have climbed back in the last few weeks, prompting some analysts to suggest that the Fed may have to expand its Treasury purchases.

HEADLINE: The World Economy, Still Waiting

 BODY:
Last month's meeting in London of the world's top 20 economies was a diplomatic success but an economic muddle. President Obama's understandable desire to restore diplomatic harmony won out over the urgent necessity for coordinated international stimulus. 
 Four weeks later and the cost of that fudge is clear: Global indicators are still sinking, and the huge pool of bad debts weighing down the world's banks has not been adequately addressed. Protectionism is spreading. 
 A report this week showed the United States economy declined at a more than 6 percent annual rate for the second straight quarter. Equally abrupt declines seem likely in Germany, Europe's largest economy. Sharper falls are anticipated in poorer developing countries. 
 Wealthy countries -- not just the United States -- must take aggressive steps to stimulate world markets and trade. Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, is resisting, making it easier for the rest of Europe to resist.
 We know that German voters are worried about inflation. But Mrs. Merkel is feeding their fantasy that Germany is somehow insulated from the world's woes. It isn't. With more than 40 percent of the German economy based on exports, it cannot afford an accelerating decline in international trade and markets.
 Stimulus isn't all that's needed. There must be stronger national and international regulation of financial markets, a politically delicate subject only gingerly dealt with in London last month. Governments need to be bolder about taking temporary public ownership of banks overwhelmed with bad debt, restoring their financial health by disposing of these crippling obligations then returning them to private ownership. 
 And while all 20 countries participating in the London summit pledged to avoid new protectionist measures, the World Bank's president, Robert Zoellick, says that at least 9 of them are considering or have already taken steps that would violate that pledge. 
 To keep developing world economies from imploding further, richer countries must fulfill their generous pledges to increase support through the International Monetary Fund. Mr. Obama has already asked Congress to approve a $100 billion United States loan to the I.M.F.
 Other destabilizing imbalances will have to be addressed. The United States must increase savings and investment. China must invest more at home in social safety nets and infrastructure. Currency exchange rates must be allowed to adjust more freely. If policy makers respond creatively to these challenges, the long-term resolution of today's economic crisis can bring more sustainable and equitable future global growth. 
 Addressing those long-festering imbalances will take time. More international stimulus cannot wait.

HEADLINE: Immigrants' Rallies Draw Small Crowds In Flu Scare

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON and KIRK SEMPLE; Julia Preston reported from San Diego, and Kirk Semple from New York. Mathew R. Warren and Karina Ioffee contributed reporting from New York, Rebecca Cathcart from Los Angeles, and Karen Ann Cullotta from Chicago.

 BODY:
Immigrants turned out for May Day demonstrations across the country in much smaller numbers than last year, with marchers pointing to uneasiness about the flu scare and job worries in the recession to explain why many people stayed home. 
 Organizers had called for marches and rallies as a show of support for immigration overhaul legislation that President Obama has said he will offer before the end of the year. But in Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami and New York, among other cities, turnout was sharply lower than expected as immigrants, many of them from Mexico, said they did not feel the time was right for marching in the street. 
 Mexican immigrants and businesses in the nation have not seen major negative impacts from the rapidly spreading flu epidemic, despite wide publicity that the illness first erupted in Mexico and has spread from there. But in New York, a major annual Cinco de Mayo festival was canceled because of fears of flu contagion. 
 And Mexicans around the country said the fallout from the swine flu had arrived in more subtle ways, from remarks that struck them as prejudicial, to friends who declined dinner invitations without giving a reason.
 In Boston, Jay Severin, a conservative radio talk show host on WTKK-FM who is known for outrageous banter, was suspended indefinitely from his afternoon show after he referred to Mexican immigrants in insulting terms, executives at the station said Friday. In comments about the flu epidemic in recent days, Mr. Severin had called Mexicans ''primitives,'' ''leeches,'' and ''criminaliens.'' 
 Immigrant advocates had hoped that Friday's rallies would help them build pressure on President Obama to move forward with broad immigration legislation, which would include measures to give legal status to about 12 million illegal immigrants in the country.
 But in Chicago, only about 5,000 people came out, a far cry from the estimated 65,000 who turned out a year ago. Some immigrants said that because of the flu, they did not feel it was safe to bring their families to a crowded rally; organizers supplied face masks and hand sanitizer to those who were fearful. 
 But some participants said the low attendance was also related to disappointment that Mr. Obama has not acted to end a crackdown on illegal immigrants. 
 ''People had hoped to see change sooner with our new president,'' said Sandra Cajas, an immigrant advocate. 
 In Los Angeles, there was no big march as in past years, as immigration groups chose to hold several smaller rallies. Police officials said six groups had received permits. 
 At one rally, with about 1,000 people carrying Mexican flags and wearing T-shirts saying ''Legalize America now,'' the mood was subdued. Dozens of marchers wore face masks as a precaution against the flu. 
 In one of the more dramatic effects of the epidemic, organizers in New York this week postponed the Festival del Cinco de Mayo in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, the largest of several events in the city celebrating the Mexican holiday. They cited concerns about flu contagion.
 ''We think it's very, very high risk to put thousands of people in this situation,'' said Carmelo Maceda, 49, vice president of Casa Puebla, a Manhattan-based advocacy group for Mexicans and the organizer of the annual festival.
 The event draws tens of thousands of spectators a year to see performances by dozens of popular Mexican musical groups. Mr. Maceda noted that some New Yorkers who had contracted swine flu attended schools near the festival site. 
 Casa Puebla and other sponsors of the event have lost about $100,000 in advertisements and nonrefundable city permits, plane tickets, and down payments for equipment and hotel rooms, Mr. Maceda said. 
 Other effects of the swine flu outbreak were less conspicuous. Maria Macaren, 42, an employee at La Bomba Records, a Latino music store in East Harlem, said she was heckled by a passing motorist when she was standing outside the store.
 ''Someone passed me and yelled, 'You should have a mask on because you're Mexican,' '' she said. 
 Erika Harrsch, 38, a Mexican artist living in Long Island City, Queens, said she returned last Sunday from a six-week trip to Mexico. 
 Even though Ms. Harrsch is in perfect health, she said Friday in a telephone interview, ''no one wants to see me -- I'm totally serious. People don't say it; they just play busy.'' 
 ''In Mexico,'' she added, ''everyone wants to be near you to help you when you're sick, but here nobody wants to be with you.
 ''I've never felt so lonely in this country,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Proposes Sales Tax Increase

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg proposed a budget Friday that would increase the city's sales tax by half a percentage point as the centerpiece of $1 billion in new taxes to help the city avoid deeper spending cuts and minimize layoffs. 
 Even clothing, which has long enjoyed at least a partial exemption from the city sales tax as a way to make city retailers more attractive than their suburban counterparts, would be subject to Mr. Bloomberg's proposal. 
 If approved by the City Council and the State Legislature, the increase would apply to the city's portion of the sales tax, which, when added to a state tax and transit tax, would lift the total rate to 8.875 percent, one of the highest in the country. Only once since 1974 has the city's part of the sales tax gone up, and that was a temporary 0.125 percentage-point increase from 2003 to 2005.
 But this time, Mr. Bloomberg did not utter the word ''temporary.'' So if the proposal is enacted, a typical household in New York City making $35,000 a year would have to pay an extra $129 a year in sales taxes, clothing included, according to estimates by the city's Independent Budget Office. A household making $125,000 would pay an additional $356 a year, and one making $500,000 would pay $840 more.
 Mr. Bloomberg announced the proposal while unveiling his $59.4 billion executive budget for the next fiscal year, which begins July 1. It represents a drop in spending from last year's budget of $61.2 billion, largely because tax revenues have dropped so much.
 And during a presentation at City Hall, he defended the sales tax approach, which would raise nearly $950 million a year, as well as a nickel surcharge on plastic bags, which would raise an estimated $100 million.
 He also dismissed calls from Democratic officials and labor unions for an increase in the income tax on the city's wealthiest residents, contending that such an increase would drive people, and businesses, out of the city. The state government recently passed an income tax increase on wealthy residents to try to close a budget deficit of its own.
 Mr. Bloomberg, a political independent who is also the wealthiest person in New York, conceded that the sales tax was hardly an ideal prescription during an economic freefall that he projected would not end until next year.
 ''It is true that sales tax, if you have the same rate, is a regressive tax, but the bottom line is, the people that have more money buy a lot more things, and they spend a lot more of it,'' he said. ''Is it a good tax? No. None of these taxes are good taxes.''
 If the initial reaction from other officials to the proposed sales tax increase was any indication, Mr. Bloomberg should be prepared for a vigorous fight.
 ''I continue to believe that increasing sales tax is a regressive way to generate revenue because it places an unfair burden on those who have the least,'' said the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, who has been a strong Bloomberg ally. ''The idea of eliminating the tax exemption on clothing only compounds that burden.''
 Retailers warned that such an increase could lead to the loss of jobs in city stores if customers choose to shop in places like New Jersey, which charges no sales tax on clothing, or online, where policies vary. 
 ''It could make the consumer say: 'You know what? I'll buy my underwear in Paramus next week,' '' said Ted Potrikus, executive vice president of the Retail Council of New York State.
 Mr. Bloomberg had outlined his intentions to raise the sales tax in January, when he unveiled his preliminary budget. But now that Albany has concluded its budget process, and the impact of the federal stimulus package can be assessed, Friday's proposal was intended to be a firmer blueprint.
 ''The mayor's budget will hurt the city's middle- and low-income communities by cutting vital social safety net services and the jobs of the workers who provide them,'' said Lillian Roberts, executive director of District Council 37, the city's largest public employees' union.
 The personnel reduction is a key component of the city's proposal to shave $3.4 billion in spending by its agencies. And, not surprisingly, the mayor's proposed cut displeased interest groups, which argued that the cuts were more severe than warranted.
 ''These are difficult times for everyone, but a 22 percent cut from the city will affect the people who need their libraries the most,'' said Paul LeClerc, president of the New York Public Library. ''Library visits are up 12 percent in the last year, and our branches and sites have been visited more than 17 million times. Libraries have been flooded with job seekers and others looking for an economic lifeline. Now more than ever, it is critically important to keep library doors open.''
 As is always the case in New York City government, politics was never far away from the minds of reporters, city officials and others who listened to the mayor's announcement. Mr. Bloomberg is favored to win a third term in November, and his proposal was immediately attacked by his likely Democratic opponent, Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr.
 But when Mr. Bloomberg was asked whether he found it politically treacherous to turn in a budget that raises taxes, slashes jobs and reduces services, he claimed that he had forgotten that it was an election year. ''It never occurred to me,'' he said, his voice betraying not the slightest trace of irony.

HEADLINE: Seeking Cudgel, Republicans Return to National Security Issue

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Stymied in so many of their efforts to put President Obama and Democrats on the defensive, Republicans are returning to national security, an issue that has served the purpose well for them in the past. 
 Trying to raise doubts about Mr. Obama's ability to protect the nation, they have raised the specter of terror suspects transferred from the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to prisons in American communities, issued warnings that the release of memorandums detailing secret interrogation methods has put Americans at risk, and presented a video montage ending with the Pentagon in flames on Sept. 11, 2001, and the question, ''Do you feel safer?'' 
 ''I think what I'm trying to do here,'' Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader, said in defending the video he and fellow Republicans have been circulating, ''is push the administration to tell us, What is the overarching strategy to take on the terrorists and defeat them and to help keep America safe?'' 
 Democrats say that the effort reflects desperation on the part of Republicans and that voters in the 2006 and 2008 elections squarely rejected what they viewed as an effort to frighten the public after Republicans capitalized on the issue in 2004. They say polls show Americans are exceedingly comfortable with Mr. Obama's emerging approach and are more focused on their own economic situation, paying little attention to Republican efforts to dent his popularity. 
 ''They are reverting back to their game plan, time and time again, which is fear,'' said Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ''When they can't succeed on policy, they pursue fear.'' 
 Mr. Menendez predicted that voters would not be moved.
 ''People wanted to see a change in our policy,'' he said. ''They wanted to see a change in Iraq; they want us to stand for our principles. We can have security and still stand for the Constitution. They understand that. That's the way they voted in the last election. Republicans are wasting their time and money.'' 
 But Republicans say the issue of national security resonates outside the bubble of Washington, from New York City, where the unannounced flyover by Air Force jets this week stoked panicked memories of the terror attacks and drew the wrath of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, to Virginia and Kansas where high-security prisons are being eyed for the transfer of detainees from Guantanamo.
 Senior Republicans say the focus on security is part of a broader effort to return the party to its core values: smaller government, lower taxes and spending, and a strong national defense. 
 In recent days, the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has regularly used his opening remarks on the Senate floor to explore the thorny question of what will happen to detainees when the detention facility in Cuba is closed, as Mr. Obama has promised to do by the end of the year. 
 On Thursday, Mr. McConnell hammered the administration for requesting $80 million for closing Guantanamo as part of an $83.4 billion war spending bill without explaining what would happen to the terror suspects being held there. 
 ''Rather than appear before the Senate to explain why these funds are necessary and what the administration plans to do with the terrorists housed at Guantanamo, Attorney General Holder chose to deliver a speech in Berlin yesterday in which he reiterated the administration's intent to close it,'' Mr. McConnell said.
 ''It is clear from these remarks that the administration is putting symbolism ahead of safety,'' he said.
 Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., Mr. McConnell added, ''clearly realizes what most Americans realize: closing Guantanamo is not a good option if no safe alternative exists.'' 
 Shutting down the Cuba prison is a top priority for many Democrats, who see it as necessary to close a sad chapter in American policy. Democrats counter that even some prominent Republicans have backed Mr. Obama's effort to expand the war against terrorists in Afghanistan. 
 But some of those lawmakers, including Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, say the administration has put itself in a bind on Guantanamo. 
 ''I think they made the announcement without understanding there's a number of really difficult issues associated with it,'' Mr. McCain said. 
 Some Democrats who otherwise staunchly support the administration are uneasy about moving the terror suspects to American soil. Their reluctance, coupled with Republican opposition, could force the White House to strip the money for closing Guantanamo from the larger war funding bill in order to win its quick approval.
 When the small town of Hardin, Mont., offered this week to place the detainees in an empty jail that it built two years ago, the state's two Democratic senators, Max Baucus and Jon Tester, swiftly denounced the idea. 
 And Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, said in an interview that he was deeply concerned about the possibility of some detainees being moved to the Marine base at Quantico in his home state, which, he said, ''is in a very populated area in the greater capital region.'' 
 ''Some of my local communities have expressed concern,'' Mr. Warner said, adding that he would wait to see the administration's plan before making a judgment. 
 ''Even President Bush agreed we needed to close Guantanamo,'' he said. ''The question is, How do you do it, and you do it in a way that provides the appropriate level of security for the detainees and safety for folks?'' 
 Still, Mr. Warner said he believed the Republican efforts to put Democrats on the defensive on national security would fail, particularly tactics like distributing the video showing the Pentagon shrouded in smoke. 
 ''I think Americans are appropriately turned off by people who try to use images of 9/11 in any kind of political format,'' Mr. Warner said.

HEADLINE: Same Data, Conflicting Forecasts

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
So where were we?
 In the month since I last wrote in this space, there has been a surge of financial optimism. Banks that are supposed to be in deep trouble have reported profits (though there were a few too many accounting gimmicks for my taste). Some of them, like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, are talking about wanting to give back their government bailout money. Bank stocks, moribund not so long ago, have been rising a bit. Other economic indicators suggest that, if the economy hasn't exactly turned around, at least the pace of decline is slowing. There has been talk of ''green shoots'' from the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, and ''glimmers of hope'' from President Obama.
 So perhaps the better question to ask this week is where are we? Can we come out of our financial fallout shelters yet, or are there more economic bombs still to drop? Will the results of the stress tests, due out next week, make things better or worse? Have the Obama administration and the Federal Reserve managed to stop the bleeding? Can we start breathing a little easier? 
 Because Wednesday was the 100th day of the Obama presidency, you could scarcely turn around without bumping into people at a conference or symposium asking, more or less, those same questions. This week, I dropped in on a few of them.
 Wednesday morning, the Regency Hotel, New York. A liberal group called the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute is holding a breakfast in which the featured speakers are the Columbia University economist (and Nobel laureate) Joseph Stiglitz, the M.I.T. economist (and Nobel laureate) Robert Solow, and the former Senate Banking Committee chief economist, Robert Johnson. 
 Mr. Stiglitz, though a supporter of the president, has been a vocal critic of the administration's response to the banking crisis, and he doesn't let up here. ''Obviously, I think there is a better way to deal with the crisis,'' he says. ''Banks made bad loans, and the question is: who is going to pay for those losses? It is almost a zero-sum game: the government or the bondholders?'' 
 He goes on to suggest that the government should stop trying to protect bondholders and instead force them to convert their debt into equity. This would help bolster the banks' capital without tapping any further into taxpayers' funds. It is also an idea that the Treasury Department stiffly opposes, fearing that it will create a new round of bank panic, and make it even harder for banks to raise private capital.
 Mr. Solow, meanwhile, criticizes the stimulus package as too small. ''The drop in consumer spending was too big, and probably couldn't be filled with a good $800 billion package, and this one was festooned with things that weren't going to stimulate spending soon.'' 
 Later, at a brief press conference, I ask Mr. Stiglitz how he would grade the new administration's efforts. To my surprise, he says, ''Compared to what went before, I would say it's an A plus plus.'' Then he lapses back into his complaint about the administration's coddling of bondholders. I then put the same question to Mr. Solow, who says he thinks the administration has done ''extraordinarily well'' -- and then complains that it should be doing more for individual homeowners. Do they really mean it? Or is that ''A plus plus'' a form of political grade inflation?
 Wednesday afternoon, the Princeton Club, New York. The American Society of Magazine Editors is holding a luncheon panel on the financial crisis, with Allan Sloan of Fortune, Mark Zandi of Moody'sEconomy.com, and, er, me. Mr. Zandi is practically overflowing with optimism. ''I think the totality of the policy response has been excellent,'' he tells me after our panel has finished. ''Aggressive. Creative. With a few tweaks it will ultimately work.'' He predicts that the stimulus will kick in this summer -- though he says that he would have favored a tax holiday. (''If they had eliminated the payroll tax for the second half of 2009,'' he says, ''it would have been a tremendous boost for both employers and employees.'') He sees a ''massive refinancing boom'' under way, which will save homeowners $25 billion on mortgage costs, and might prevent a few foreclosures. He thinks the stress test results -- according to news accounts, six banks will require more capital -- will bring about renewed confidence in the banking system because we'll finally be able to see what the truth is. He thinks Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner ''has found his footing.''
 On the way home, I pick up the latest copy of The Economist. It warns against ''the perils of optimism,'' and suggests that if we become too complacent about the prospect of better times, it will ''hinder recovery and block policies to protect against a further plunge into the depths.'' Sigh.
 Thursday morning, Drexel University, Philadelphia. A group called the Global Interdependence Center is holding a half-day conference on the financial crisis. First up, Christopher Whalen of Institutional Risk Analytics. He has been a scathing critic of the banks. ''My friends are all telling their clients the worst is over, it is time to buy,'' he says. ''My response is: what are you buying?'' 
 He adds that bondholders need to take some pain, and echoes Mr. Stiglitz's proposal to make the bondholders convert their debt to equity. A month ago, nobody was talking about this. Now it has become the idea du jour.
 Nancy A. Bush, a longtime bank analyst, says that the Troubled Asset Relief Program is ''the most destructive thing I have ever seen. The government has ensured mediocrity in the banking industry. It has done enormous damage in the eyes of investors, who are no longer sure that a bank is a safe investment anymore.'' She calls it the TARP Trap.
 Just then, the moderator takes the stage to announce that Chrysler has filed for bankruptcy. So much for optimism.
 Next panel: Robert A. Eisenbeis of Cumberland Advisors gives a talk titled ''Are things really that bad?'' His answer is, no. ''We are far from the Great Depression,'' he declares, and he has the charts to prove it. When measures like gross domestic product and corporate profits are charted against other recessions, this one looks pretty bad. But when they are charted against the Great Depression, they look like a piffle. In the depths of the Depression, for instance, G.D.P. dropped by a staggering 50 percent, compared with the current drop of 2 percent or so. ''The people who are fear-mongering are not looking at the data,'' Mr. Eisenbeis concludes.
 He is followed by a funny, fast-talking woman named Diane Swonk, the chief economist at Mesirow Financial. ''We've gone from a sense of free fall in the fourth quarter of 2008 to a point where we have pulled the ripcord and the parachute has opened. But we don't know where we are going to land, or whether it is going to be in enemy territory,'' she says. ''There are three areas where consumer spending has increased,'' she remarks at another point. ''Guns. Condoms. And alcohol.'' In between jokes, she says the deleveraging of America is going to be a painful process.
 Finally, the former St. Louis Federal Reserve president William Poole, now a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, gives a keynote speech arguing ''too big too fail'' is a concept that has done enormous harm. He wants to see some market discipline imposed on the banks -- so that if they mess up again, we won't have to come to their rescue. Who can disagree? 
 Thursday evening, the Metropolitan Museum, New York. The big guns are out tonight, on a panel sponsored by The New York Review of Books and PEN World Voices: Niall Ferguson of Harvard, Paul Krugman of Princeton (and The New York Times), Nouriel Roubini of New York University, former Senator Bill Bradley and George Soros, among others. The Met's big auditorium is packed.
 This is doom-and-gloom central. Lots of talk about zombie banks, failures to understand history, regulatory foolishness. Mr. Bradley, who speaks first, suggests that if the government's plan to save the banks doesn't work, it should simply buy Citibank -- ''its current market cap is about $17 billion,'' he said -- clean it up, and spin it off to the American people in a rights offering. Mr. Ferguson, a provocative historian, keeps saying that the United States is becoming akin to a Latin American economy: ''At what point do people stop believing in the dollar as a reserve currency?'' he asks ominously.
 ''The scale of the crisis has overwhelmed the response,'' Mr. Krugman says. To the extent there are green shoots, he added, ''it means that things are getting worse more slowly.'' Mr. Roubini practically scoffs at the notion that we might see positive economic growth in the second half of the year. Mr. Soros says that ''we are currently facing a deflationary situation. But when credit restarts, the fear of deflation will be replaced by fear of inflation, and there will be pressure for interest rates to rise.'' Something to look forward to, I suppose.
 I can't say that I left the Metropolitan Museum with any more clarity than when I began my little symposia tour. I'd heard some good ideas, and cheery news among the dire forecasts. What it did cause me to realize is that all these smart economists and forecasters are looking at the same set of data, and coming to radically different conclusions based on their politics, their temperament and their idiosyncratic reading of history. Just like the rest of us.
 Next week, the results of the stress tests will be unveiled, and we'll see it all over again. Some of the same people I saw on stage this week will say the tests are a whitewash, while others will claim that they're an important step on the road to recovery. Both sides will marshal persuasive data and strong arguments, providing plenty of fodder for the next round of conferences. 
 At least that much is certain.

HEADLINE: Mr. Bloomberg's Gloomy Budget

 BODY:
Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City presented the kind of election-year budget on Friday that every politician dreads. Facing a bottom line that keeps shrinking, he asked for new taxes, more cuts in services and few new projects. He salted his nearly $60 billion budget proposal with references to the lesser of unpleasant choices and how ''everybody sacrifices a little.'' His only encouraging news was a promise to maintain core services and thus, somehow, ''keep New York New York.'' 
 One of the mayor's toughest hurdles will be convincing state legislators to agree to the proposals that require their consent. The mayor and the City Council on their own can trim the budget and the work force. Mr. Bloomberg wants to lay off 3,700 employees and seeks $324 million in new cuts from library services, traffic enforcement, child care, parks and other municipal services. 
 But Albany's pro-union Democrats would have to approve changes in pension and other benefits for almost 300,000 city employees that Mr. Bloomberg says would save the city $1.4 billion. Albany should be able to figure out how to scale back pensions for new hires, but any effort to lower benefits across the board will ignite fierce union opposition.
 The State Legislature also must approve Mr. Bloomberg's proposal to raise the sales tax to almost 9 percent, including the tax on clothes and shoes that is now exempt. Sales taxes are regressive since both the rich and poor pay at the same rate. But the mayor has all but ruled out increasing the personal income tax after Albany raised state levies on people making more than $200,000 a year. 
 A more compelling idea, which would also require state approval, is his plan to charge 5 cents for every plastic bag at the checkout counter. The tax might bring in only $100 million, but it could also mean fewer plastic bags on the streets, in the gutters and the city's trees. 
 As downbeat as this budget presentation was, it could have been even gloomier. For instance, the mayor spent little time explaining how bad things will be if Albany does not come through with new taxes and union givebacks, and if the economy deteriorates further. 
 With the mayor facing a re-election campaign, that kind of news is too easily addressed later in the year, after the elections.

HEADLINE: Washington Prepares for Fight Over Any Nominee

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and JEFF ZELENY; David D. Kirkpatrick, Neil A. Lewis and Charlie Savage contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The nation's capital geared up Friday for a battle over a Supreme Court vacancy that appeared likely to test President Obama's success at skirting divisive social issues, with conservative groups saying they viewed the opening created by the retirement of Justice David H. Souter as an opportunity to regroup after a series of political setbacks.
 Even as Mr. Souter delivered a letter to the White House formally disclosing his intention to step down at the end of this term, liberal and conservative leaders prepared for another of the intense battles over Supreme Court appointments that have marked the past 20 years in Washington. Mr. Souter -- though appointed by a Republican, the first President George Bush -- has been a part of the liberal bloc of the court, so Mr. Obama's appointment is unlikely to shift the ideological makeup of the court. 
 Mr. Obama, who was president of the Harvard Law Review and taught law at the University of Chicago, praised Mr. Souter's tenure, and laid out what he was looking for in making a nomination. 
 ''I will seek someone who understands that justice isn't about some abstract legal theory or footnote in a casebook,'' Mr. Obama said during an unscheduled appearance in the White House briefing room. ''It is also about how our laws affect the daily realities of people's lives.''
 That formulation -- echoing what Mr. Obama had said while campaigning -- stirred concern among conservatives, who said it signaled that the president would nominate an activist judge with an expansive view of the Constitution. Anticipating that line of attack, Mr. Obama also proclaimed that his nominee would be someone ''who is dedicated to the rule of law, who honors our constitutional traditions, who respects the integrity of the judicial process and the appropriate limits of the judicial role.'' 
 Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said he had urged Mr. Obama to meet with Republicans and Democrats to discuss prospective nominees before making his selection. Mr. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, said he intended to have confirmation hearings completed before the court convenes in the first week of October.
 Asked whether he expected a reprise of the contentious nomination battles, Mr. Leahy replied: ''I would hope not. But lately they have always seemed to be.''
 Mr. Obama faces intense pressure to choose a woman for the vacancy, and lesser pressure to pick a black or Hispanic justice. There is only one women on the court now, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who underwent surgery in February for pancreatic cancer. 
 Among the candidates under consideration -- a group that includes white, black and Hispanic judges and lawyers -- are Sonia Sotomayor, who sits on the federal appeals court in New York, and Judge Kim M. Wardlaw, who is on the federal appeals court in California. Other leading candidates include Leah Ward Sears, who is the chief justice of the Georgia Supreme Court; Kathleen M. Sullivan, a professor at the Stanford Law School and former dean there, and Diane P. Wood, a judge on the appellate court based in Chicago.
 Mr. Souter, 69, announced the end of his Supreme Court career, which began in October 1990, in a two-sentence note that was devoid of any sentiment. The vacancy leaves the White House facing another big task, at a time when Mr. Obama and Congress have been grappling with the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, two wars and a potential flu pandemic. By occupying the Senate and the White House with an ideological battle, the drama of filling a Supreme Court position seemed likely to risk complicating what Mr. Obama had intended to be his major initiative in the months ahead: passing health care legislation. 
 Supreme Court battles have proved fertile ground for conservative and liberal groups to raise money and rally the troops, and conservatives leaders said they were heartened by the prospect of this fight. 
 ''There could not be a better issue to latch on to for a Republican renaissance to start building on -- drawing some distinctions on issues,'' said Wendy Long, counsel to the Judicial Confirmation Network, a conservative organization. ''I hope for and I expect a fight.''
 A coalition of conservative legal activist groups has spent the first months of the Obama administration researching the backgrounds and records of prospective nominees and charting the best ideological line of attack, said Curt Levey, the executive director of the Committee for Justice, one of the conservative groups. 
 Mr. Levey said the groups now expected Mr. Obama to nominate a candidate who supports abortion rights, and were focusing on other ''the issues that are really in play,'' like same-sex marriage, gun rights, religious rights and the death penalty, in preparing for the nomination battle.
 The conservative groups have agreed to divide up responsibilities for researching potential nominees and have completed about 30 dossiers, he said.
 As a senator, Mr. Obama voted against President George W. Bush's two nominees, John G. Roberts Jr. and Samuel A. Alito Jr., and backed unsuccessful efforts to filibuster their nominations. 
 ''I trust the president will choose a nominee for the upcoming vacancy based on their experience and even-handed reading of the law, and not their partisan leanings or ability to pass litmus tests,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader. 
 Senior White House officials said they had been aware for weeks that Mr. Souter intended to step down at the end of the term. They said preparation for filling a vacancy had begun in the early part of the transition process, and that Mr. Obama had given them a list of names to check even before his inauguration.
 On Thursday, before receiving official word from Justice Souter of his intention to step aside, senior White House officials met in the West Wing to begin mapping out a strategy for how to get a nomination through, officials said. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who voted on six Supreme Court nominations during his time in the Senate, will advise Mr. Obama as he makes his choice, aides said, but his role will largely be limited to helping the nominee through the confirmation process.
 Mr. Obama's advisers said they were prepared for this fight and were ready to use the resources of Mr. Obama's political organization, including its expansive e-mail list, to rally support for whoever he nominates. Liberal groups said they were gearing up not only to fight conservatives but also to make certain Mr. Obama puts forward a liberal choice.

HEADLINE: Lessons of the Chrysler Bankruptcy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Chrysler Files for Bankruptcy; U.A.W. and Fiat to Take Control'' (front page, May 1) makes it urgently clear that American industry must immediately re-examine how it does business in the 21st-century economy. 
 Our automobile companies have been going through a precarious debacle for many years as the businessmen who led them fiercely resisted making needed changes in the types of cars they made for a consumer population that has become increasingly more apt to buy fuel-efficient and ''cleaner'' cars made in Japan, South Korea and other countries. 
 Whether the actions taken to save Chrysler will work are less important than whether the long-term lessons are learned by General Motors, Ford and a host of other American companies in various sectors of the economy: adapt and change the way you do business, or go the way of business dinosaurs. 
 In the coming years, our government cannot keep stepping in to save every large failing enterprise. The next 10 years will be very telling regarding how our system adjusts or fails to adjust to how business must be transacted in the new economy.
 Alan Safron Woodcliff Lake, N.J., May 1, 2009
 To the Editor:
 President Obama, in announcing the bankruptcy of Chrysler, said that filing for bankruptcy is not a sign of weakness but that the company will come out stronger for it. So can somebody please explain why our government would spend billions of our tax dollars to stave off the inevitable, only to tell us after its plan failed that this would make the company stronger?
 Once again, we the taxpayers should be seeing that big government is not the solution but a large part of the problem. And when do we the taxpayers get our Chrysler bailout money returned to us?
 Barry Levy Hawthorne, Calif., May 1, 2009
 To the Editor:
 President Obama's activist role in the Chrysler recovery, along with his intervention in General Motors management and bank bailouts, has many raising red flags about big government's meddling in the private sector. Would they prefer former Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr.'s hands-off approach, which could not account for where $350 billion pumped into banks went? 
 President Obama's deep involvement in how private corporations respond to an unprecedented infusion of taxpayer dollars into for-profit companies is nothing less than any major investor would demand. It took several Wall Street firms barely six months to reinstate huge bonuses after getting vilified for irresponsible executive largess. 
 Our president is protecting taxpayer investments. Anything less would be right out of the Republican playbook.
 Jack Luft Sanibel, Fla., May 1, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Washington's action will ironically make it possible for Toyota and Nissan to accomplish something they were unable to attain in the market without government interference: a profitable North American sales share in large pickup trucks and S.U.V.'s.
 Michael Gorman Pinckney, Mich., May 1, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Latest G.M. Plan Cuts More Jobs, Halves Dealers'' (front page, April 28):
 The recent reports of the restructuring of General Motors describe a company that hopes to find a new and better life by laying off workers and closing plants. Some investors may find comfort in the cost-cutting measures: 21,000 jobs will be lost, and 13 plants will be closed.
 But I see it another way -- 21,000 families will suffer financially and psychologically, and 13 communities will find that the sources of good jobs and taxes are suddenly boarded up.
 General Motors may do well, avoiding bankruptcy or surviving bankruptcy. But in its wake there are so many sad stories that must also be told.

HEADLINE: Symptoms Of Ignorance And Bigotry

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The world is full of side effects. Earlier this week, a student arrived for a class on Photoshop at a social services center for Mexican immigrants inside an old church rectory.
 ''One of the students, a restaurant worker, said his boss told him, 'I'm going to hire some other workers, please tell your people and friends to apply and come in for an interview,' '' said Joel Magallan, the director of the center, Asociacion Tepeyac de New York, on West 14th Street in Manhattan. 
 ''Then the owner said, 'Please, don't bring Mexicans, because they could have the swine flu.' '' 
 So far this year, about 13,000 people have died from ordinary, garden-variety flu in the United States, about four people every hour, every day. There was not a recorded peep from Joseph R. Biden Jr., the vice president, about this.
 Then one person, a toddler in Texas, was reported to have died from swine flu. Mr. Biden went on television and said he'd advise his own family to stay off airplanes and subways. Later, the White House team in charge of pulling the vice president's foot out of his mouth issued a statement saying that what he really meant was that the people who should stay off airplanes and subways were those suffering from swine flu. 
 More people die of loneliness or lard. More people died in a few minutes when a man went berserk in Binghamton, N.Y., last month. Since August, there have been 14 deaths by gun in schools in the United States. 
 The difference with swine flu, of course, is not simply foolish remarks by the vice president. When seasonal influenza is lethal, it is usually older people who die, or those in poor health. But in Mexico, swine flu apparently killed young people. 
 Just because one problem may turn out to be less dangerous than others -- so far, no more than 25 people are confirmed as having died in Mexico from the swine flu, compared with more than 6,000 killed by drug violence in that country last year -- does not undercut the genius of modern public health surveillance, which quickly recognizes changes in the course of an illness. 
 This important news has been quickly outpaced by alarm that has traveled faster than the virus, and sprinted well ahead of the known facts. The gaps in information are spackled with guesses, ignorance, even bigotry.
 ''I've been hearing all week at college: Stay away from the Mexican restaurants,'' said Jocelyn Ponce, 18, who is in her first year at Baruch College. ''Friends are telling me to be careful about those kinds of places.''
 As Ms. Ponce spoke, she stood a few feet from a machine that is practically the foundation of Mexican restaurants around New York: the tortilla line at the Tortilleria Chinantla on Grand Street in Brooklyn. 
 The tortillas glide down the conveyor, six at a time, spilling into a basket. About a million a day come down the line. A machine stacks them. Then they are packed into plastic bags by four workers clad in hairnets and uniforms. One of them, Sandra Maceda, pressed the air out of the bags with the palm of her hand, then tied a red band at the top and loaded them into cardboard cases. 
 ''Yes, I do think the flu is a big problem,'' she said, speaking as her hands never stopped working the bags of tortillas. 
 Ms. Maceda, who is from Puebla, Mexico, has been following the news from home with anxiety. The Mexican economy has been frozen by the shutdown of businesses and schools. 
 In 1976, a young soldier died of an earlier version of swine flu; the United States launched a mass vaccination program that, some experts say, ultimately killed more people than the disease itself. In 2002, Dick Cheney, then vice president, urged that the entire country be vaccinated against smallpox, a disease that has effectively been eradicated from the world. Mr. Cheney argued that Iraq might have the ability to use a weaponized version of the smallpox pathogen to attack the United States. The side effects from a smallpox vaccination program, public health officials said, would probably have included several hundred deaths and thousands of serious illnesses. And, as it turned out, Iraq did not have any smallpox or any other biological weapons. 
 Before the news about the emergence of the new swine flu strain, Ms. Maceda said, her top worries were ''immigration, schools for the kid, my job. And the security of the subways -- the service cuts here, and the big fare increase.''
 Not quite what Joe Biden had in mind.

HEADLINE: 3 Americans And 2 Others Are Killed By Taliban

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
Three Americans and two other foreign service members were killed Friday in an attack in eastern Afghanistan, officials said.
 Insurgents attacked Afghan and international forces on Friday with rocket-propelled grenades and guns, NATO forces said in a statement. The coalition troops called in air support, forcing the militants to withdraw. They are being pursued, the statement said. 
 Col. Greg Julian, a spokesman for United States forces in Afghanistan, confirmed that three of the dead service members were Americans. The nationalities of the other two were not immediately known because NATO typically waits for countries to release such information.
 Three Afghan Army soldiers and 15 militants also died in clashes in the south and east on Friday, American military and Afghan officials said.
 The Taliban have vowed to increase ambushes and other attacks in Afghanistan as the United States increases its military presence here. The United States is sending an additional 21,000 troops to Afghanistan this summer in an attempt to stem the Taliban's resurgence and bolster security for the presidential elections in August.
 In a sign that electioneering is likely to be chaotic, Afghanistan's top vice president broke away from the president to join a competing ticket, a spokesman for the ticket said Friday.
 First Vice President Ahmad Zia Masood will join Gul Agha Sherzai, a former warlord, in his run against President Hamid Karzai, said Gul Khalid Pushtoon, a lawmaker serving as spokesman for Mr. Sherzai.
 Mr. Sherzai, now governor of Nangarhar Province, plans to file official papers on Saturday, Mr. Pushtoon said.
 Mr. Sherzai, who met with President Obama when he visited Afghanistan in July, has a mixed reputation. He helped the United States oust the Taliban from Kandahar Province in the first push against the militants, but he has also been accused of heavy-handed rule and corruption in the aftermath.
 A government spokesman, Waheed Omar, said he had not yet been informed of Mr. Masood's decision but that the government would not stand in his way.
 ''Masood is still the vice president of Afghanistan, but if he has decided that joining a different team will help, I don't think the president will have a problem because that is his constitutional right,'' Mr. Omar said.
 Spokesmen for Mr. Masood could not immediately be reached for comment.
 A spike in violence and the civilian death toll have eroded Mr. Karzai's popularity over the past year, and conservatives have argued that he is a puppet of Western powers.
 ''We think that President Karzai will not win the election, so therefore we want to keep the leadership in the region, as well as improve the economy of the country,'' Mr. Pushtoon said.

HEADLINE: Simon Property Group Cuts Dividend and Forecast

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Shares of the Simon Property Group, the biggest American shopping mall owner, fell 8 percent after the company cut its dividend and 2009 earnings forecast. The dividend will be 60 cents a share in the next three quarters, down from 90 cents, Simon Property said in a statement. Simon Property lost almost half its stock market value in the past year as the recession reduced consumer spending and spurred job losses. ''We're optimistic that we'll reinstate the full cash dividend'' as the capital markets improve, the chief executive, David Simon, said.

HEADLINE: The Private Lives of Pop Stars, Male Division

BYLINE: By JON CARAMANICA

 BODY:
In the past year the Jonas Brothers, three charming, talented, aggressively hairstyled, purity-ring-wearing brothers from northern New Jersey, transformed from a middling tween-focused band into perhaps the most significant pop juggernaut since 'N Sync. 
 They had a hit album and tour, experienced public romances and breakups and, in an unanticipated twist, earned some respect. They played -- a bit awkwardly -- with Stevie Wonder at the Grammy Awards. Rolling Stone magazine coordinated a surprisingly lively conversation between Nick Jonas, the band's main songwriter, and one of his idols, Elvis Costello. 
 But ''Jonas,'' the brothers' new Disney Channel sitcom, which begins Saturday, is a calculated, perhaps fearful step backward, a reclamation of innocence. Here Kevin, 21, Joe, 19, and Nick, 16, play the Lucas brothers, pop stars in retreat, trying to maintain normal lives at high school while fame rages just outside the door.
 And yet there's little innocent about ''Jonas,'' a blithe, thinly drawn, thus far unfunny show seeded with profound cynicism befitting a much older band. Nick chases a girl, Penny (Bridgit Mendler), a winsome blonde with a purple guitar who wants him only for his songwriting. And Stella (Chelsea Staub), the band's schoolmate and fashion designer, spends Saturday's episode designing tear-away Velcro clothing, a more economically efficient response to rabid shirt-grabbing fans. The show does neatly capture the many denizens of the rock star ecosystem. Here's Stella, the loyalist who styles the band, chatting with Macy (Nicole Anderson), a twitching, zealous fan-droid who shrieks on command:
 ''What do you do,'' Stella asks Macy, ''just follow them around all day?''
 Replies Macy, indignantly, ''No, of course not!'' And then, with a tragicomic exhale and hopeful fluttering eyelashes, ''Why, do they see me?''
 In the band's music life, Nick gives off the savviest air, so it's disappointing to see him here reduced to playing a dullard, a romantic incompetent resigned to life in the bubble. ''Read the fan magazines,'' he says to Penny. ''I'm the serious one!'' Or, as Macy describes him: ''All that intensity!''
 Because this premiere episode centers on Nick, Joe and Kevin have more room for tomfoolery, and it's welcome. The show's most credible moments come when the two oldest brothers needle the youngest about his crush; that sort of kid behavior never ages. But Nick has the air of an adult squeezed into children's clothing and behavior -- a glum, frustrated pop star playing a glum, frustrated pop star. Maybe he has never watched ''The Monkees.'' 
 The stench of obligation is overwhelming, except around Kevin, the least essential band member, but here on equal footing. In ''Camp Rock,'' last year's Disney Channel hit movie, which starred the brothers, Joe was the lead, a bratty pop star in need of reform, a clever tweak to the group's angelic image. In the initial, scrapped version for this show, the Jonas Brothers led double lives as spies, which, while a mockable conceit, at least was a conceit.
 That this show lacks any such twist is less forgivable given that it's not the Disney Channel's first foray into the double consciousness of teen-pop fame. ''Hannah Montana,'' the Miley Cyrus vehicle, is about a pop star who leads a dual life. But while Ms. Cyrus grew up in, and through, ''Hannah Montana,'' the Jonas Brothers are already famous well beyond tweens. Their audience is wider and smarter and probably expects more than this noxious, awkward mix of art, commerce and romance.
 ''Are you saying the song's available?'' Nick asks Penny about the song he wrote for her, which she unsuccessfully used to woo another boy.
 ''It's completely unattached,'' she replies.
 In that case, Nick proposes, ''I think we have a demo to record.'' All that intensity. Sigh.

HEADLINE: Here Comes the Sun. Right?

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH

 BODY:
Hillsboro, Ore.
BEHIND a giant solar factory here, backhoes are digging away, preparing for a new wing that will quintuple production. Inside, an outspoken German executive named Boris Klebensberger is fretting about the color of the new carpet. Samples perch on his window sill alongside floor plans.
Expanding a factory? Picking out carpeting?
Did anyone tell him that there's a recession?
Buoyed by the potential promise of a green economy, Mr. Klebensberger, who heads the American branch of SolarWorld AG, a company based in Bonn, Germany, is ramping up production of solar cells in a retrofitted factory that had its grand opening last October -- in the teeth of the financial crisis. 
''Was I worried about our position? No!'' says Mr. Klebensberger, dismissing any hint that he was nervous at the opening. And he remains just as bullish today. SolarWorld's plant here, which makes enough cells to fit 1,700 solar panels a day, is the biggest of its kind in the United States.
For the residents of Hillsboro, and for the Oregon economy, SolarWorld's presence is a welcome boon. Its employees enjoy being in start-up mode, while others like the cachet of working for a renewable-energy company -- which goes down well in outdoorsy Oregon.
''Green is the way to go,'' says Michelle Zillig, who worked at Intel for 18 years before joining SolarWorld as a technician. ''People can only have so many computers.''
At first glance, the timing of SolarWorld's decision to invest $500 million in the new site during a recession, in a state with an unemployment rate second only to Michigan's, couldn't have been worse. Prices for the company's solar panels have slid about 15 percent since the factory opened, a result of growing competition and slowing demand, especially in Europe. Two manufacturers, GE Energy's solar branch and BP Solar, have cut production in East Coast plants.
But new federal incentives to encourage renewable energy in the United States will give the industry a boost, analysts say.
The recent stimulus package included grants for businesses and utilities that install solar energy systems, and the bank bailout package last year removed the dollar cap on a 30 percent tax credit for home installations. Makers of renewable energy equipment also received help in the stimulus package, signed by President Obama.
''I think the writing on the wall is the U.S. is going to be the big market,'' says Jesse Pichel, a solar analyst at Piper Jaffray.
The message for solar companies, Mr. Pichel says, is ''get your butt over to the U.S. if you want to participate and get some of that stimulus package money.''
THE United States lost its status as the world's leading solar manufacturer in the 1990s as interest surged elsewhere. Now it makes little more than 5 percent of solar panels worldwide.
Even with federal support and positive buzz, only a fraction of 1 percent of the electricity in the United States comes from solar panels, leaving ample room for the market to grow.
Germany, SolarWorld's home, is at the same latitude as southern Alaska, often has cloudy skies and is a much smaller country than the United States. Yet the number of installed solar panels in Germany is more than three times the amount in America. Spain and Japan are also ahead.
''Germany is not a natural for solar, but they've had vision, and policy followed the vision, and industry growth followed the policy,'' says Raju Yenamandra, the vice president for sales at SolarWorld in California.
For manufacturers, the low penetration rate of solar in the United States spells opportunity. Companies lucky enough to still have financing are building or expanding operations in a range of states, including Oregon, Ohio and New Mexico.
As the German flag fluttering outside the SolarWorld factory in Oregon attests, foreign companies are largely driving the new American manufacturing push.
Mr. Klebensberger and his rivals are especially eager for solar to take off in the desert Southwest, where the sun beats down through often-cloudless skies. California has made a strong solar push, with the amount of solar power installed roughly doubling in 2008 from the previous year.
Recently, new installations of the type of rooftop-ready panels that SolarWorld makes have been growing strongly, with 70 percent more installed in the United States in 2008 than in 2007. In Europe, new installations roughly tripled last year, according to Emerging Energy Research, an independent research firm. But the European number is expected to fall sharply this year, in the wake of a decision by the Spanish government to cut its solar subsidy.
For its part, SolarWorld made its bet on manufacturing in the United States long before the stimulus package arrived. In 2006, it bought the solar division of the Shell Group, which operated factories in California and Washington. Mr. Klebensberger revamped the California factory, throttled back the existing facility in Washington and began scouting other sites in those states, as well as Alabama, Georgia and New Mexico.
''I don't know how many brochures we got from states that offered us incentives and upfront money,'' Mr. Klebensberger says.
The company ultimately settled on a semiconductor factory here that was built in the 1990s and swiftly abandoned after a downturn in the chip industry. Semiconductors are made from the same crystal material as solar panels, and having water and exhaust systems in place helped SolarWorld ramp up faster.
State incentives also helped: Oregon, which has been heavily recruiting wind and solar companies, provided SolarWorld with $40 million in business tax credits.
SolarWorld also gained access to a big pool of potential employees because it is situated in the heart of the Oregon ''Silicon Forest,'' surrounded by semiconductor plants and a short drive from a much larger Intel factory. SolarWorld's employment has swelled to more than 500, some of them temporary, which gets the company about halfway to its goal of 1,000 permanent workers by 2011; the company holds new-employee orientations each Monday.
Inside the plant, the factory floor combines the mild chaos and urgency of a start-up with the scale of a public company. In one room, orderly rows of cylindrical furnaces stand like so many trees; they are used to grow crystals weighing several hundred pounds. The crystals are made from polysilicon, a derivative of sand, and form the core ingredient of the solar panels.
In other rooms, the cooked and cooled crystal ingots -- looking like spent artillery shells -- are sliced by machines into what are called wafers. Then they are made chemically suitable for generating electricity and are overlaid with electric wires, and a slim, dark cell emerges. (The cells, which resemble drink coasters, are sent to SolarWorld's California plant to be strung together into the finished product that goes onto roofs.)
Many of the processes are still being automated, and the plant is also testing and expanding new systems in mid-production.
''I've got this radio here in case things go south,'' says Willie Owens, an equipment engineer in goggles and jeans. He was testing new furnaces and water cooling equipment. If there were a big problem, he explains, he would have to hit a button within one minute to activate emergency systems.
The job, he says with relish, provides ''an adrenaline rush sometimes.''
Like a number of other SolarWorld employees at all levels, Mr. Owens is a transplant from the semiconductor industry, whose big West Coast factories have suffered badly in the latest downturn. Hynix, for example, closed a plant in Eugene, Ore., last year, resulting in the loss of about 1,100 jobs.
Mr. Owens heard on National Public Radio that SolarWorld was coming to Oregon and decided to jump after seven years at a wafer manufacturer in Portland. ''I saw this as an opportunity to get into something that was growing,'' he recalls. ''Glad I did.''
Even as SolarWorld charges ahead, adding new equipment and breaking ground for its factory expansion, there are daily reminders of the challenges ahead. The company's share price has declined more than 30 percent in two years, to 21.05 euros ($27.80), largely because of slowing demand and a growing number of manufacturers.
Asia has also become a manufacturing hub for solar power, and many panels from China have entered the market, although the recession has forced some companies to cut back. Suntech Power, a leading Chinese manufacturer, is now using just 55 percent of its factories' capacity, though it, too, is looking for factory space in the United States for the long term.
Like the rest of the industry, SolarWorld is also trying to adjust to the decline in panel prices, which are likely to keep falling into the summer, given the oversupply and the continuing credit crisis.
Mr. Klebensberger tries to put a positive spin on this, noting that the first quarter -- whose results are due in a few weeks -- is always relatively weak because Europeans avoid installing panels during the winter.
For all of last year, the company's sales grew at a heady 31 percent. But the pace of growth in the fourth quarter slowed considerably.
Industrywide installations in the first quarter in California, the largest market in the United States, remain robust. Installers there are wary, however. They say demand dried up in the last six months because companies lack financing and homeowners are more worried about their mortgages than sinking $25,000 or more into making electricity on their roof.
Analysts say the first-quarter figures in California may have had a boost from projects that were already in the pipeline and that future numbers may be less robust. A year ago, installers say, they were calling manufacturers to ask for panels; now the situation is reversed, with manufacturers making sales calls.
In the meantime, the competition among manufacturers is likely to intensify. Even as some of the weaker solar companies resort to layoffs, a number of big names -- including Schott, First Solar, SunPower and Sharp -- are building, expanding or looking to build manufacturing plants in the United States. Sanyo, the Japanese electronics company, is building a solar wafer factory in Salem, Oregon's capital, that is to begin production this fall.
Mr. Klebensberger relishes the competition and the potential boost it can give the American economy. Solar energy can provide jobs and energy security, he says, ''so it's a way out of the crisis.''

HEADLINE: Brookhaven Finds Its Star On the Rise

BYLINE: By AILEEN JACOBSON

 BODY:
UPTON
GOOD news at the Brookhaven National Laboratory has been piling up fast in recent months. In the midst of a recession, the lab here is launching huge new projects and generating hundreds of jobs.
''The lab's a really exciting place right now,'' said Samuel Aronson, its director. ''Things are popping.''
Even a former critic agrees. ''B.N.L. is clearly on a roll,'' said Richard Amper, executive director of the Long Island Pine Barrens Society, an environmental group, and a member of the lab's Community Advisory Council, formed 10 years ago when the lab was being criticized by neighbors for incidents involving radioactive and chemical pollution.
''Their work is obtaining increased attention and appreciation,'' Mr. Amper said. ''They're being rewarded for their good work.'' 
The 5,300-acre laboratory, established in 1947 on the grounds of a former Army base called Camp Upton, has moved past its local villain status of a decade ago. It has never been a scientific slouch -- six Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work done at the lab -- but now its star is clearly on the rise.
In late March, Energy Secretary Steven Chu selected the lab as the site to announce how $1.2 billion in stimulus funds would be spent at the country's 10 national laboratories, with Brookhaven receiving a $184.3 million chunk.
Most of that money -- $150 million, more than any other single project in the package -- will be used to accelerate construction of the $912 million National Synchrotron Light Source II. It will be the world's most powerful X-ray microscope once it is finished in 2014 -- an expected completion date moved up a year because of the added money.
That news followed Gov. David A. Paterson's late February announcement that the largest solar energy project in New York history (and possibly the nation's) would be located at the lab, providing 37 megawatts of power to serve more than 6,500 households and tripling the state's solar energy output, perhaps in about two years.
Another facility, the Center for Functional Nanomaterials -- which, like the synchrotron light source, can study ultrasmall materials crucial for medical and energy breakthroughs -- opened a year ago. And last Monday the Department of Energy announced that the lab would be one of 46 new Energy Frontier Research Centers.
Over all, the laboratory is undergoing a nearly $1.5 billion expansion and upgrade (including updating buildings that were once Army barracks), said the director, Dr. Aronson.
The projects will result in at least 150 new jobs for scientists and staff members and up to 1,000 new construction jobs, lab officials said. The lab already employs 2,800 scientists, engineers and support staff and hosts more than 5,000 visiting researchers each year.
How has the lab managed to attract so much money? ''I attribute it to the fact that over the last 10 years the Brookhaven laboratory has paid particular attention to where the Department of Energy and its Office of Science believes research should be directed,'' said Michael D. Holland, the Brookhaven site manager for the Energy Department, which finances the lab. That direction, he said, is toward practical applications rather than pure science.
Other scientists at the lab agree that the focus has shifted to include real-world goals like making solar energy more economical for homes and building better fuel cells for electric cars.
Charles Black, a physicist, was hired three years ago as group leader in electronic nanomaterials at the recently opened Center for Functional Nanomaterials. Much of its work is aimed at developing solar cells that are better and cheaper than present ones so solar energy can compete economically with oil and gas, said Emilio Mendez, the center's director.
Dr. Mendez and Dr. Black helped install equipment worth $26 million into the sleek new building, which cost $55 million. ''We have beautiful machines,'' Dr. Black said. ''Some of them are unique in the world.''
Among those, he said, are a powerful electron microscope that can examine the arrangements of atoms. (Researchers see the images on computer screens.) That helped lure him to the lab, Dr, Black said, but so did the opportunity to aid the planet.
''When I was at school, I didn't think about anything like that,'' he said. ''I didn't think about helping the world.''
Now, when Dr. Black interviews potential hires, he tells them about his transformation. ''I see if that resonates,'' he said. If it does, they are more likely to get a job.
About 20 more scientists and staff members are to be added to the center within the next year and a half, Dr. Mendez said, bringing the total to 65.
The new synchrotron light source, called N.S.L.S.-II -- now an empty field with a fence around it -- will be next door to the nanomaterials center (and across the street from the present N.S.L.S.) because scientists will carry specimens back and forth, said James Misewich, associate laboratory director for basic energy sciences. He oversees the center and other departments.
The new synchrotron, a particle accelerator that will produce X-ray beams 10,000 times brighter than the current one, will be able to peer ''with a resolution we never had before'' into new types of batteries being developed at the lab that convert hydrogen to electricity, Dr. Misewich said.
Some of the batteries are already being tested by automobile companies, he said, but scientists are working on reducing even more their need for platinum, an expensive component.
Pointing to the fenced-in field ready for construction, Steven Dierker, N.S.L.S.-II project director, said the new accelerator would be about a half-mile long and would be housed in a ring-shaped building. As a light beam travels around the building and through a booster, it will get stronger.
At points along the way, the beam will be funneled to work stations -- there will be 60 to 80, Dr. Dierker said -- where researchers from around the world will use them for individual projects, like creating better drugs to treat HIV and Alzheimer's disease. (They will continue to wrap ordinary aluminum foil around the hot pipes to insulate them, Dr. Dierker said, a practice that gives the lab a strangely makeshift look.)
The new solar project -- which Dr. Aronson said he thought would be the largest in North America, not just the state -- will cover about 200 acres on the outskirts of the lab, while a smaller research-oriented one will cover 2 to 5 acres closer in. The power will be provided to the Long Island Power Authority and to the lab.
Among future projects the lab hopes to pursue, Dr. Aronson said, is a research alliance with the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and Stony Brook University to explore health and bioenergy issues, but a requested $30 million a year in state funding is pending. Also on the horizon, he said, are more federal projects.
Having Secretary Chu visit was an auspicious sign, Dr. Aronson said: ''It stoked up the lab.''

HEADLINE: Affordable Homes, via Foreclosures

BYLINE: By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER

 BODY:
Hempstead
JAMES J. VILARDI plans $70,000 worth of repair work to a three-bedroom Cape on Searing Street, one of four foreclosed homes boarded up on an otherwise tidy block in Hempstead, N.Y.
Mr. Vilardi, president of the Valley Stream-based Bedford Construction Group, hopes to close next month on the $144,500 house, one of six on Long Island that he bought from Fannie Mae in a new venture with Nassau County and the Long Island Housing Partnership.
The six are the Island's first bulk acquisitions in a state- and federally-financed Neighborhood Stabilization Program to acquire and redevelop foreclosed and shuttered properties that might otherwise blight a community. In the process, more affordable housing becomes available. 
Ranging in price from $195,500 to $301,750, the other homes that Mr. Vilardi plans to fix up as part of the program are in Elmont, Westbury, Valley Stream, Massapequa and Glen Cove. Each needs $10,000 to $65,000 in renovations -- and all, like the Hempstead Cape he is starting with, are being repaired with county money. Once it gets a new heating system, kitchen and bathrooms, and once the walls are reframed and painted, it will be sold for $190,000 -- discounted to a first-time buyer qualified under affordable-housing guidelines.
Working with teams of electricians, plumbers and carpenters, Mr. Vilardi said he hoped to complete all six houses within 60 to 90 days. The work ''will be basic but nice,'' with ceramic tile in the kitchens, the developer said
''If we can't provide affordable housing,'' Mr. Vilardi said, ''we can't keep young families here.''
Turning around the distressed properties will not provide a windfall for Mr. Vilardi. His fee, 7 percent of the total development cost of each home, comes out of its sales price. He described that amount as ''very minimal'' compared with his profit in private development.
''I'm really passionate about affordable housing,'' he said, ''and this is the way I give back.''
Last fall the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development allocated $3.92 billion for the stabilization program for areas across the country hurt by swelling foreclosure rates and the subprime crisis. The financing included nearly $7.8 million to Nassau County, $5.6 million to Suffolk County, $2.17 million to the town of Babylon and $3.72 million to the town of Islip.
Additionally, in April, Nassau County received $3.1 million and Suffolk more than $8 million from state coffers. Thomas R. Suozzi, the Nassau County executive, said he hoped to have nonprofits and private developers like Mr. Vilardi buy 100 homes, and then use the funds to fix them up and provide first-time homeowner down-payment assistance.
According to Propertyshark.com, an online company that tracks real estate data, there were 943 new foreclosures on the Island in the first quarter of this year, a two-year high, up 77 percent compared with the first quarter of 2008.
In Nassau County there were 626 new foreclosures in the first three months of the year, up 208 percent from a year ago, with the highest numbers in Hempstead, Westbury and Freeport.
Suffolk had 317 new foreclosures in the first quarter, up 14 percent from the last three months of 2008, with the highest numbers in Brookhaven, Islip and Babylon.
Mr. Suozzi says foreclosed homes are often clustered. ''These houses drag the neighborhood down,'' he said. ''We don't want blighted homes destroying the quality of life of the neighborhoods.'' He hoped the construction related to the rehabilitation would help ''put people to work and help the economy'' and ''put people who are qualified homeowners into affordable housing.''
Because the money to buy the homes is raised privately, Mr. Vilardi contended that the county would be able to fix up many more.
Peter Elkowitz, the president and chief executive of the Hauppauge-based Long Island Housing Partnership, which separately received $6 million in state funds, says this project is different from previous municipal rehabilitation efforts in that the homes are being fixed up before they are sold.
''Usually with a rehab,'' he said, ''it's after the person owns the home.''
The housing partnership, a nonprofit organization, will monitor rehabilitation of the homes and provide prospective buyers with eight hours of mandatory mortgage counseling. First-time buyers who earn no more than 120 percent of the local median income -- $122,200 for a family of four in Nassau or Suffolk -- will be eligible.
Once the house is sold, Mr. Elkowitz explained, participating developers and nonprofits will recoup from the stabilization program what they originally paid for it, plus the costs of any work done. On top of that, the program will provide a subsidy to each buyer, running $50,000 to $80,000, he said. In order to put more money into the rehabilitation, the houses have to be bought ''on average at a 15 percent discount,'' and the money must be spent within 18 months.
Jon Searles, a spokesman for Fannie Mae, said that ''the purchase of foreclosed properties demonstrates how the public sector and lending institutions can work together to assist at-risk neighborhoods, stabilize communities, and provide homes to qualified first-time home buyers.''
Priscilla Almodovar, the president and chief executive of New York State's housing finance agencies, said Nassau County was using a targeted approach -- ''not just rehabbing a home for the sake of rehabbing a home,'' but repairing entire neighborhoods ''one block at a time.''
Diana Weir, the executive vice president of the Long Island Housing Partnership, added that the stabilization program also aimed to stem the tide of speculators who might buy a house, quickly renovate it and ''milk it for the rent money.''
Renters aren't allowed in the program, and the homes must be occupied by the owner.
Ms. Weir added, ''We are really trying to build a community and stabilize it and bring in true homeownership.''

HEADLINE: Fame on the Half Shell

BYLINE: By SOPHIA HOLLANDER

 BODY:
LEAH COHEN, the 27-year-old head chef of Centro Vinoteca, an Italian restaurant on Seventh Avenue South near Barrow Street, was standing in the restaurant's exposed kitchen, assembling small plates of butternut squash croquettes and pushing them through the window carved in the kitchen's white brick wall.
Fashionably dressed 20-somethings clustered under the shimmering discs dangling over the bar on this recent Friday night, while a more sedate crowd settled in booths whose full-length windows faced onto the street.
No one approached Ms. Cohen, though she was clearly visible, her chef's coat still crisp white and her dark hair twisted into a tight bun. 
But they were watching her. Chris Stockel, a 22-year-old who lives around the corner from the nearly two-year-old restaurant, had come specifically for Ms. Cohen and her cuisine.
''I was excited to see the food and see what she can do,'' Mr. Stockel said. But he added, ''I don't know what she saw in Hosea.''
Ms. Cohen hears that a lot. Nearly three months ago, she was among the last contestants eliminated on Season 5 of the hugely popular Bravo reality show ''Top Chef.'' But what most viewers remember is a moment that occurred midway during the season when she shared a clandestine kiss with the eventual winner, Hosea Rosenberg, even though both were involved with other people.
Even now, the restaurant attracts patrons who point giggling toward the kitchen, and blogs critique Ms. Cohen's character as much as her cooking skills. The attention is something she is getting used to.
''I think it's something that you have to deal with, putting yourself out there, going on a reality show,'' said Ms. Cohen, who is one of at least a dozen former ''Top Chef'' contestants navigating post-show fame in New York. Although casting has been completed for Season 6, echoes from previous seasons continue to reverberate in this restaurant-obsessed city.
At least one contestant has successfully opened his own restaurant. Another is struggling to find investors. A third is trying to extend her brand into cookbooks, a line of chef's clothing and a new restaurant inspired by her signature cuisine on the show.
And Ms. Cohen, formerly sous-chef at Centro Vinoteca, is seeking to put gossip behind her and to focus on her new job as the restaurant's top chef, a job that started immediately after her return from the show.
''Having to think on the fly and in a really stressful environment just gave me the confidence and the ability to come back and take over the restaurant,'' Ms. Cohen said. And to greet well-wishers who approach Centro Vinoteca's open kitchen with the inevitable words, ''We love you, your food's great, how's Hosea?''
'That Was Television, This Is Reality'
Just around the corner from Centro Vinoteca, on Jones Street in the West Village, is an unassuming storefront with a sign bearing the single word ''Perilla.'' The pocket-size, 18-table restaurant, which specializes in seasonal new American cuisine, was created by Harold Dieterle, the 31-year-old winner of ''Top Chef's'' Season 1.
With its curving wood bar and vases overflowing with freshly cut flowers, the neighborhood restaurant is stylish but comfortable -- not the sort of place to eat at every night, but the favorite around the corner saved for special occasions. Perilla seems to occupy a different world from the scene at Centro Vinoteca, which is just how Mr. Dieterle wants it.
''I don't have head shots, I'm not going to an open call, I'm a cook,'' Mr. Dieterle said one recent afternoon as he stood in the restaurant's kitchen, shredding wild boar. Fixing a visitor with his intense blue gaze, he gestured at his worn, snap-down chef's shirt. ''I'm not an Armani suit kind of guy,'' he said with a slight smile.
Mr. Dieterle's path seems like a model for handling a ''Top Chef'' triumph: leverage a victory, along with the $100,000 in prize money, into owning and operating a restaurant.
But participating in the show nearly cost him his co-owner, Alicia Nosenzo. The two former colleagues talked about starting a restaurant together just before he left for filming.
''My biggest hesitation was the 'Top Chef' thing, because I knew his food was good,'' said Ms. Nosenzo, whose resume includes stints at upscale restaurants like Eleven Madison Park. ''I was like: 'I don't know; is this going to be awful? Am I going to be embarrassed?' The background that I came from, doing a reality show would be frowned upon.''
And Mr. Dieterle, for his part, quickly learned that investors were more interested in a solid business plan than a star turn on a reality show, and that his winnings wouldn't go far.
''It's kind of like being handed a case of vodka and saying, go open a bar,'' he said. ''It's not going to happen.''
Still, his success on ''Top Chef'' had an impact on everything from the donated zebrawood tabletops to the flurry of press surrounding the 2007 opening to customers who still flood the phone lines and Web site after every series marathon.
But for Mr. Dieterle, the crucial test was the first review in The New York Times, published on July 25, 2007. As he and Ms. Nosenzo kept scurrying downstairs to refresh the Web browser on their computer, friends began arriving spontaneously, ready to celebrate.
At 11 p.m., the pair was sitting side by side when a click revealed a new headline: ''That Was Television, This Is Reality.'' The Times critic, Frank Bruni, had dismissed the restaurant as ''a bit of a snooze'' and unworthy of the hype. Reluctantly, Ms. Nosenzo climbed the stairs to tell their friends there would be no party.
''I don't want to say I was heartbroken,'' Mr. Dieterle said, ''but I was extremely disappointed.''
But the same night ''Top Chef'' indirectly dealt the restaurant its worst blow, the program also gave it a boost. A retrospective episode was shown featuring Mr. Dieterle and other former contestants. The next morning, Perilla's phones were ringing off the hook.
Mr. Dieterle took some criticism from the review to heart. He has revamped the menu, infusing it with Thai influences after an overseas trip in November. He has hired a new pastry chef, added art to the walls.
''It's nice to hear that regulars are coming and saying the food keeps getting better and better,'' he said. ''But it's hard to get reviewers back in.''
Still, he added: ''I can't complain. I've got a restaurant. It helped me attain my dream.''
No Money, No Restaurant
Hung Huynh sat in a corner booth at the Oak Room in the Plaza Hotel, which is near his apartment, and extended his leg to display a freshly polished Prada loafer.
''Times are tough,'' explained Mr. Huynh, the 31-year-old, Vietnamese-born winner of Season 3. So instead of buying a new pair, he said sheepishly, ''I kind of shined them back up.''
In person, Mr. Huynh is slight and friendly, nothing like the persona he projected on national television.
''On the show, I came off as arrogant, cocky,'' he acknowledged. ''But in reality I'm a very humble person.''
After his victory was televised in October 2007, he ignored the snickers from friends and committed to a one-month stint at a kosher restaurant in Midtown called Solo, with the prospect of his own place at the end. ''I had no idea what it was,'' Mr. Huynh said of kosher food. ''I thought it was just boiled eggs and cabbage or something.''
But as Steven Traube, Solo's managing partner and a huge ''Top Chef'' fan, responded, ''The line I told Hung was, 'Cooking kosher is a ''Top Chef'' challenge every day.' ''
As the months dragged on, however, one location after another fell through. Finally, in January, Mr. Huynh decided to strike out on his own. But the offers that rushed in immediately after the show have slowed, and the current economic climate has made investors increasingly averse to risk.
''I'm dying right now,'' Mr. Huynh said with a grin to show he was joking, sort of. ''I'm not a celebrity chef. A celebrity has money. A chef has a restaurant. I have neither.''
His culinary journey began in Pittsfield, Mass., in the Berkshires. His family had emigrated from Vietnam after the war, and as a child, Mr. Huynh toiled beside his parents and siblings at the family's restaurant, Kim's Dragon. Mr. Huynh, who was 8 when he arrived in America, hated the work.
''I wanted to play sports,'' he said.
But by age 11, he was watching food shows, then zealously re-creating every dish.
His experience chopping vegetables, trimming meats and filleting fish served him well on ''Top Chef,'' where he was renowned for exceptional knife skills. His mother passed on other abilities, taking him with her to vegetable markets and teaching him to look for colors and textures among the piles of produce.
''If I didn't win, I couldn't face my mom,'' Mr. Huynh said. ''She's 67 years old, and she still runs circles around me.''
Nevertheless, his winnings went to traveling, donating to charity and paying off college loans, with some reserved for partying and making high-end purchases like a Rolex watch. His savings are dwindling, and his dream of opening a seafood restaurant or even a simple Vietnamese noodle shop remains elusive.
''I think it's good I didn't jump into everything right away,'' Mr. Huynh said. ''But now after a year I need a push.''
'A Human Pasta Machine'
Nikki Cascone, the 36-year-old chef and co-owner of the NoLIta restaurant 24 Prince, didn't hesitate to capitalize on the ''Top Chef'' cachet.
When Ms. Cascone was a contestant on Season 4, she heralded her participation with a sign pasted in the window of her restaurant, a 52-seat space that includes a private lounge and a garden. Among the many local residents who noticed the sign was Liz Pokora-Sadowsky, who lived down the block.
Although she and her husband had watched ''Top Chef'' only sporadically, they became captivated by their local chef, and after an episode featured her fresh lasagna, Ms. Pokora-Sadowsky insisted that they try the restaurant the very next night.
Only there was no lasagna on the menu. There was no fresh pasta at all. And Ms. PokoraSadowsky was not the only one inquiring about its absence.
Ms. Cascone noted with a weary smile that people still request pasta from her at least once a week.
''I just became a human pasta machine on 'Top Chef,' '' she said on a recent afternoon sitting her restaurant, where striped wallpaper and trailing plants suggest the warmth and intimacy of a living room. That is why she is planning to open a pasta bar downtown by the summer of 2010.
''It seems very capitalist,'' Ms. Cascone said. ''But it is something I love.''
It took her months to piece together her confidence after being eliminated from the show midway through the season. She burst into tears when her brother picked her up from the airport.
Then customers like Ms. Pokora-Sadowsky began streaming in, and Ms. Cascone decided to use her connection with the show to promote her restaurant more assertively.
In addition to planning a new establishment, she is working on a cookbook and designing her own line of chef's clothing. A sign reminding diners of Ms. Cascone's participation on the show still sits in the window and a notice is printed on every takeout menu.
She still has ''Top Chef'' nightmares, dreaming of quick-fire buzzers and dishes of avocado and citrus she can't quite get right.
''I could have done better,'' Ms. Cascone said. ''There was so much more I wanted to put out there, and I lost my chance.''
Ms. Cohen of Centro Vinoteca repressed bad memories as she plunged into her new position. Still, she faced new nightmares: She had never developed original dishes, or fully directed a staff. Over the first months, she worked seven days a week.
''For the first three months I wanted to kill myself,'' she said recently. ''Am I ready to do this? Do I really have the experience? Am I really good enough?''
She fired about half the kitchen staff for failing to execute dishes to her standards. And she made wholesale changes to the menu.
Her stint on ''Top Chef'' is reflected in several new items, like the slow-poached egg, to counter the undercooked eggs Benedict that was her undoing on the show. She has refined the chorizo broth that was criticized as greasy, adding extra ingredients and blending the liquid so that it turns a bright orange. She has concocted a recipe for black cod to prove that her undercooked fish during one episode was an aberration.
And she is working through the uncomfortable balance between chef and celebrity that a few weeks ago landed her -- and Hosea, who was in town to shoot a reunion episode -- on Page Six.
''It bothers me that people have their ideas on how I am as a person, as a cook,'' Ms. Cohen said. ''But at the end of the day, I have my friends, I have my family, I have a good following of people who come into the restaurant.
''I'm 27 and running a restaurant in New York City,'' she added. ''This was my dream.''

HEADLINE: Social Security Will Not Raise Benefits in '10, Forecasts Say

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
For the first time in more than three decades, Social Security recipients will not get any increase in their benefits next year, federal forecasts show.
 The absence of a cost-of-living adjustment, calculated under a formula set by law, will be a shock to older Americans already hit by plummeting home values, investment losses and rising health costs. More than 50 million people receive Social Security.
 ''Most seniors have never been through a year in which there was no Social Security COLA,'' said David M. Certner, legislative counsel at AARP, the lobby for older Americans. Beneficiaries have received automatic cost-of-living adjustments every year since 1975. The increase this year was 5.8 percent. 
 In theory, low inflation is good for people on fixed incomes. But it is creating political and policy problems for Congress, which is just learning of the implications for Social Security and Medicare.
 The forecasts, by the Obama administration and the Congressional Budget Office, indicate that Social Security beneficiaries will not receive any cost-of-living increase in 2010 or in 2011. The COLA is intended to preserve the purchasing power of Social Security, by increasing benefits to keep pace with consumer prices. In the last year, overall inflation has been low, largely because of the economic downturn and a decline in energy prices. 
 A freeze in Social Security benefits would have major implications for Medicare because the COLA, in effect, puts a cap on premiums for Part B of Medicare, which covers doctors' services. 
 If there is no cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security, about three-fourths of beneficiaries will not see any change in their basic Part B premiums, federal officials said. But some beneficiaries do not have this protection and could face substantial increases in their Part B premiums.
 In addition, millions of beneficiaries could see higher premiums for drug coverage, provided under Part D of Medicare.
 Social Security and Medicare trustees will describe the outlook for benefits and premiums in their annual reports this month.
 Officials have already said the condition of Medicare's hospital insurance trust fund is deteriorating because of the recession, which has reduced payroll tax revenues, the main source of money for the fund. Spending on Social Security and Medicare totaled more than $1 trillion last year, accounting for more than one-third of the federal budget.
 Most people on Medicare have Part B premiums deducted from their monthly Social Security checks. These premiums have historically increased much faster than Social Security benefits.
 Under federal law, most Medicare beneficiaries have some protection. Their basic Part B premiums cannot rise more than the dollar amount of the cost-of-living increase in their Social Security checks. So if there is no COLA, their basic Part B premiums will not increase.
 But one-fourth of Medicare beneficiaries are not protected by the law, and their premiums could increase.
 Most Medicare beneficiaries pay a monthly Part B premium of $96.40. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the basic premium will rise to $119 next year and $123 in 2011 for those who are not protected under federal law.
 Douglas W. Elmendorf, director of the Congressional Budget Office, predicted that inflation would remain low for several years, so Social Security might not pay a cost-of-living increase until January 2013. President Obama's budget assumes no increase in 2010 or 2011, then a 1.4 percent COLA in 2012.
 Mr. Certner, from AARP, described the outlook for consumers: ''If, as expected, there is no COLA in Social Security next year but premiums for drug coverage increase, as expected, millions of beneficiaries will see their Social Security checks reduced for the first time.''

 BODY:
 IN chaos there is opportunity.
 Or so goes a catch phrase in finance, according to Roy Sheinberg. He should know. He was in finance for a decade, earning a high-six-figure income working for hedge funds and investment banks and, among other things, trading that alchemist's brew known as credit default swaps. But a year ago, UBS, the Swiss bank, laid him off. Rather than leap into a comparable job, with draining hours and cutthroat politics, Mr. Sheinberg decided to pursue an enthusiasm that had long tugged at his heart: fine wines.
 Today he is working on nailing down a large importer to sell a line of Swiss wines -- a breed seldom found in American stores. A shipment of 400 bottles is on its way for the importer to taste. Mr. Sheinberg has this idiosyncratic notion -- untested, he admits -- that Americans who greeted Australian and Chilean wines with gusto may be ready for a wine from another land whose grapes are unfamiliar and are grown not that far from the Matterhorn. 
 ''I got a chance that I always wanted,'' he said. ''So you have to seize the opportunity.''
 There are more than a few people like Pleasantville's Mr. Sheinberg who have lost jobs during the recession but have seen a pink slip as a lottery ticket of sorts that lets them shift gears into some long-harbored enthusiasm. Rather than sulk over their rotten fate or grab an equivalent job, they are pursuing an ambition that life's twists never allowed them to realize. Their stories have no happy endings yet but offer something to think about for those who have lost less-than-beloved jobs.
 After working as an insurance agent in a listless economy, Maggie Carrel, 59, of Ardsley, is trying to make a living milking two hobbies: coaching people in the mysteries of gardening and selling weavings she makes on a home loom. Ted Berkowitz's headhunter business in Hartsdale collapsed, stifled first by the 9/11 downturn, then the death in 2003 of his wife, who worked alongside him, and the economy. So at 64 he is tending to that nagging itch he long had for painting. His acrylic sketches of jazz and folk musicians pop up at galleries and libraries all over Westchester, and some have sold.
 ''There's a fire in my belly for this,'' Mr. Berkowitz said, ''and hopefully if you go after your passion, that passion will pay for itself.''
 Mr. Sheinberg has long been beguiled by wines. He is a 36-year-old native of Israel who came over in 1995 for a two-week visit and stayed when he met a woman from Scarsdale at a nightclub one evening; she would become his wife. 
 Then, while studying business administration at Montclair State University in New Jersey, he took a job at a machine tool company whose owner, Jacob Katz, was, as Mr. Sheinberg put it, a ''wine freak.'' Mr. Katz became a father figure and over dinners at his home taught Mr. Sheinberg the difference between chardonnay and sauvignon blanc grapes and how to detect the subtle distinctions between the ordinary and the extraordinaire. The pupil became something of a maven -- but only as an amateur.
 Last May, after a career at hedge funds and finance houses, he found himself out of work as UBS's regional head of equity swaps. Mr. Sheinberg sensed it would not be easy to get another job at the same pay, and even if he did it would have the same drawbacks: ''crazy hours'' that last until 10 p.m. so he would never see his daughters, Ariel, 5, and Noa, 2. He remembers thinking, ''This would be a great time to do what I really want to do.'' 
 While he was mulling options, a relative e-mailed him about a Swiss artist, Nadja Aebischer, who was interested in exporting wines to the United States. Mr. Sheinberg learned that Switzerland grows delectable wines in cantons like Valais, wines like pinot noir and the local petite arvine that can handle the cold. Yet 95 percent of the wine is consumed within the country. The rest is exported elsewhere in Europe, so almost none winds up in the United States.
 In that gap, Mr. Sheinberg saw opportunity. He flew to Zurich and toured the wineries with Ms. Aebischer, sampling some of the nation's best wines. Soon they were negotiating with vintners, something not easy for Mr. Sheinberg, who spoke none of Switzerland's three major languages and had zero experience in the wine business. Ms. Aebischer did the translation, and somehow Mr. Sheinberg's chutzpah must have made up for the holes in his resume. Several wineries agreed to exclusive contracts and lowered their prices.
 '' 'Exclusivity? Who are you?' '' Mr. Sheinberg remembers the vintners first told him. He added, ''We had to get to them on a personal level.''
 Thus was born Ronavino, the company he owns with Ms. Aebischer. There is no revenue yet, but he has produced the first draft of a catalog. Mr. Sheinberg has the financial cushioning to take such a leap, but he admits there have been moments when a voice in his head screamed, ''What am I doing?'' Luckily for him, his wife, Maya, has encouraged the venture.
 How would he advise others in his boat?
 ''It's scary in the beginning, but make the first step,'' he said. ''Me, I feel it will eventually pay off. I'm doing something I'm passionate about, and I really believe I'm going to make a living.''

HEADLINE: Snark Attack

BYLINE: By TERI KARUSH ROGERS

 BODY:
AS unsold properties proliferate and encounters with the scalpel fail to move them, some New York City sellers are being undermined by an often nameless enemy. 
 Even as they rearrange the furniture and pray for a sale, their apartments are being picked apart online by anonymous strangers.
 Brutally frank discussions about specific listings can draw hundreds of comments on sites like StreetEasy, Curbed and Brownstoner, where traffic has increased as buyers and interested observers seek insight into the turbulent real estate market.
 Commenters scour these Web sites, attend open houses or study brokers' advertisements and then post their analyses. Recent postings included these:
 ''The layout is downright medieval; totally irrational.'' 
 ''The penthouse is a joke. Bachelor pad central, but '70s style.''
 ''If I am paying 1.6, I want my own washer/dryer in the apt. and to live in a building that doesn't look like a leftover from the Lefrak housing plan.''
 ''The bathroom looks like a Chinese bordello.''
 ''If that apartment's not ugly, what the hell is?''
 ''The brokers are doing a huge disservice to the owner of this place. It will sit, sit, sit and die a slow and painfully stale death.''
 Reviews of specific apartments are a growing phenomenon. ''This is something we've just noticed this past quarter -- our traffic has gone through the roof,'' said Dawn Doherty, the vice president for strategic development at StreetEasy.com, a Web site that publishes detailed information on listings, sales and comparables, and plays host to an increasingly active discussion board called Talk. The site's page views since last fall have more than doubled, to 10.5 million per month, as users display an appetite for more than just hard data.
 ''What's happening now is the numbers aren't enough,'' Ms. Doherty said, referring to the information published by StreetEasy. ''People are asking questions they can't ask their broker, and they're really interested in the qualitative perspective, in getting opinions of people.'' 
 There is certainly no shortage of opinions to be found online. Drawing on reams of publicly available data on sales prices, comparable listings, creditors' liens and even mortgage amounts (in the case of condominiums), commenters debate what an apartment is worth and how much a seller might be desperate enough to accept. They also pinpoint flaws ranging from imminent construction of a garbage facility nearby to crimes of linoleum. 
 For their part, sellers and their brokers are seething over what they perceive as a lack of accountability, hidden or misanthropic motives, and the fact that defending one's property -- even correcting a factual error -- can prolong or aggravate its turn under the collective microscope. Sellers also object to being typecast as Marie Antoinette in the French Revolution-style discourse.
 That accusation is not exactly refuted by the commenters themselves.
 ''All of us who were renters have endured a fair amount of ridicule from owners for our caution,'' said Michael Waxenberg, 46, an information technology director and renter who is shopping for a three-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side. ''There is an element of vindication in what's happening now -- maybe we were right in trying to play it safe.''
 Mr. Waxenberg spends about two hours a week on StreetEasy's forums, where among other things he posts reviews of the open houses he attends.
 ''The discussion runs along two tracks generally,'' he said. ''Pricing is one. The other half is how a property showed on a particular day -- the layout, the space, the light, the building, the location. Are they showing the property to its best advantage? Is the broker doing a good job, or is it made impossible by the way the owner inhabits the space? You don't need calla lilies on the console table, but just understand that anything that is glaringly bad is going to get mentioned by someone and it's never going away.'' 
 True enough, said Lockhart Steele, the founder and president of Curbed. ''We err on the side of giving readers freedom,'' he said. ''We remove comments that cross the line into personal slander, like making fun of someone or revealing extremely personal information, like posting a phone number.'' 
 Brownstoner and StreetEasy take a similarly hands-off approach.
 Sometimes, of course, the critics love everything except the price, a perennial sore point. But usually they find something to skewer, and opinions diverge sharply as to whether it's better to speak up or shut up when an apartment develops a bad rap online. 
 Alison Rogers, an agent with DG Neary Realty and a real estate blogger, posts on StreetEasy, where her balanced-for-a-broker remarks have earned her an unusual degree of respect from a set that is blatantly anti-broker. She noted that anger, defensiveness and denial will almost certainly set off a feeding frenzy, as will a post that seems to be written by the owner or broker without the appropriate disclosure. 
 She favors correcting factual errors and countering negative opinions -- but only to a point.
 ''You don't want to draw conclusions for people,'' Ms. Rogers said. ''You want to present your case and let them draw their conclusion. Like, 'I know there's not much of a view, but it has a fabulous bathroom.' Or, 'You might not think the light is as good as I do, but I said it faced south and it does.' However, you can't do that seven times -- you have to pick your battles.''
 One of Ms. Rogers's listings -- a one-bedroom prewar co-op at 731 Greenwich Street in the West Village listed for $517,000 -- came under attack on a StreetEasy thread by an open-house visitor posting under the handle nycjunior1. 
 ''They said, 'It's got no light -- it's a dungeon and you couldn't pay me to live there,' '' Ms. Rogers recalled. ''And I came back and pointed out the wood-burning fireplace and the lovely common gardens.''
 The critic responded with an even harsher review that ended by demanding that Ms. Rogers drop the asking price by $250,000. She chose not to respond. 
 Some brokerages forbid their agents to intervene except in extreme cases.
 ''We basically do not allow our agents to post comments without prior approval, because we think it's a can of worms,'' said Diane Ramirez, the president of Halstead Property. ''Unless something is egregiously incorrect, it's almost better to let it die, because if you comment on it, it takes on a life of its own.''
 Commenters tend to agree.
 ''Whether you act on it or not isn't going to change the fact that the threads are there and you can research it,'' said Kimberly Reyes, 31, a copywriter and two-time buyer who has been active on the StreetEasy boards for two years. ''If you react, the thread will move up to the top of the list again, and the more you respond, the more other people are going to respond.''
 Yet while it's true that what happens online usually stays online -- forever -- the influence on buyers is unclear.
 Some brokers say that the persistent negativity of the discussions dilutes their chilling effect.
 ''It's like the Page 6 of real estate,'' said Julie K. Pham, a senior vice president at Corcoran, referring to the tabloid gossip section. ''It's one negative comment after another, and they all start to sound the same after a while. You hope that informed buyers go and read all those comments on other properties and realize it's all kind of the same.''
 Still, plenty of buyers say they find the threads helpful.
 ''I don't troll the sites for specific apartments most of the time,'' said Eric G. Yeh, ''but when I do see them, I tend to believe them pretty quickly.'' Mr. Yeh, 32, an equities trader, is looking for a two-bedroom apartment in the $1 million to $2 million range. ''If someone says something is bad, it's another excuse to wait longer, especially since I see the market is falling anyway.''
 Ms. Reyes, who recently bought a one-bedroom condo in Park Slope, said she paid a moderate amount of attention to the discussion.
 ''If it was an apartment I was really interested in, I would research threads on it,'' said Ms. Reyes, who was particularly concerned about noise. ''If I picked up a red flag at the open house, I would maybe ask for advice online. It's a starting point -- helpful advice but you know not to take everything to heart.'' 
 The best insurance against online mudslinging is also the costliest: Price your place in bear territory -- somewhere between 2004 and 2006 prices. 
 ''Pricing it wrong is fatal, and pricing it right can make up for a lot of mistakes,'' said Mr. Waxenberg, the prolific StreetEasy poster. ''If you price with the same market sensibility I have, you're actually paying me a subtle compliment and telling me I'm right.''
 Cheaper ways to avoid drawing attention include avoiding puffy descriptions as well as getting the facts right, including square footage.
 ''Don't skimp on the photos and floor plan,'' said Jonathan R. Butler, the founder and publisher of the Brooklyncentric blog Brownstoner. ''Make it ready to go when the property launches.'' 
 In tones ranging from earnest to snarky, Mr. Butler's weekly write-ups draw scores of comments; lately his posts are accompanied by a widget that allows readers to vote on what the property should sell for. 
 Keith Copley, a senior vice president at Sotheby's International Realty, learned the photo lesson the hard way in March, when he took over a listing on a two-bedroom two-bath prewar apartment in the West Village. He had new photos taken, but they were not ready, so Mr. Copley used the unflattering old ones in his initial advertisement. 
 The next thing he knew, the apartment was featured in Curbed's ''Price Spotter'' column, which presents its audience with a new listing and solicits guesses about the price. 
 The photos made the place look dark, and commenters jeered that the beamed-ceilinged ground-floor apartment was ''cramped,'' ''creepy'' and ''depressing''; they also disparaged the broker's competence. Many guessed the place would list for $1.2 million to $1.6 million, while others said it was worth less than $1 million.
 ''There were 88 comments in a very short period of time,'' Mr. Copley recalled. ''There really wasn't anything we could do.''
 So Mr. Copley pleaded for reconsideration. Two days after the first mention, Curbed posted the new photos. The verdict: wonderful photos, but the asking price of $2.1 million was ridiculously high.
 Mr. Copley, who has since cut the price by $150,000, found something to grin about: The number of showings shot up, from just five in the week before the Curbed notoriety to more than double that number.
 ''Just having it on Curbed gets more traffic,'' he said, ''so even when someone says something negative, it's not so bad. These other people, maybe they should get a life.''
 Indeed, some sellers make a calculated bid for online exposure.
 After accepting a job in Philadelphia last fall, Diana Lind asked Mr. Butler to feature her two-bedroom prewar apartment in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, as a Co-op of the Day. (Mr. Butler is partial to prewar homes.) The resulting write-up was among the gentler of the breed, calling attention to the apartment's ''magazine-worthy stylings'' and ''reasonable'' asking price of $525,000. 
 ''I would not have done it if it were not a recession and because I needed to sell the apartment in a now-or-never situation,'' said Ms. Lind, 27, the editor in chief of an urban policy magazine, Next American City.
 Most commenters agreed that the price was reasonable, but some said that the bedrooms looked small and the location was less than prime.
 Ms. Lind defended her property anonymously. ''I responded that if the bedrooms were larger and it was nearer the park it would cost around $200,000 more.''
 Traffic increased after the apartment appeared on Brownstoner. Her apartment sold three weeks later for $487,000.
 Still, many brokers say courting attention online is tantamount to parading a fatted calf among jackals.
 ''The tone on StreetEasy and Curbed tends to be a lot more negative than positive,'' said Noah Rosenblatt, a real estate agent and the founder of the real estate blog UrbanDigs.com.
 ''Emotion enters these discussion forums. You may have someone really upset that they didn't buy 10 years ago and now they want the market to go down 60 or 70 percent, so they're writing all these things. If the property is really aggressively priced to move, it probably does more good than bad to put it on there. But let's be honest -- most properties are not.''

HEADLINE: The Hot Spots for Organic Food

BYLINE: By HANNAH FAIRFIELD

 BODY:
The map of organic farms in the United States is clustered into a few geographic centers, a strikingly different pattern than the map of all farms, which spreads densely over many regions, breaking only for the Rockies and Western deserts. 
 Areas in the Northeast and Northwest have many small organic farms that sell produce directly to consumers. Large organic farms, which some critics call organic agribusiness, have flourished in California.
 The largest organic markets by far are for vegetables, fruit and dairy products, according to Catherine Greene, an economist at the Agriculture Department.
 Organic vegetables now account for 5 percent of all vegetable sales; organic dairies, which are the fastest-growing sector, now produce 1 percent of the nation's milk.
 And what of the wide swaths of the country with a dearth of organic farms?
 They'll be waiting a few more years for local organic produce. Even if demand, which has lagged in the South and other Sun Belt states, picks up, the Agriculture Department requires a three-year waiting period for farms to win organic certification.

HEADLINE: A Motorcycle Rally Revs Up, Though It's No Longer Welcome

BYLINE: By ROBBIE BROWN

DATELINE: MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. 

 BODY:
Gentlemen, you can still ride your Harleys to the beer-belly and chicken-eating contests. Ladies, you can still strip to your pirate-pattern thongs at the drive-through motorcycle bar.
 But as far as the City of Myrtle Beach is concerned, you have enjoyed your last official Bike Week, one of the largest and oldest motorcycle rallies in America.
After years of complaints from local residents about noise, violence and indecency, the City Council adopted a series of antirally laws last fall in the hope of driving away the 500,000 motorcyclists who roar into this coastal town of 24,000 people every May. Mayor John Rhodes has declared the rally officially and permanently canceled. 
 But the bikers are coming anyway, since the city does not run the rally and most events occur beyond the city limits.
 ''They said, 'No more rally,' '' says a YouTube video created by rally supporters. ''A little clarification: We're not them,'' it says, adding, ''The spring rally is on!''
 Thus emerges another showdown between a Southern city and a prurient tradition. Just as Atlanta banished Freaknik, the former street party for throngs of black college students, by rolling up the welcome mat in the late 1990s, Myrtle Beach has a message for the motorcyclists: Go elsewhere.
 Bike rallies have existed in metropolitan Myrtle Beach for 69 years, but the tradition has rapidly grown over the past decade. What began as a weeklong gathering for motorcycle hobbyists has become a sprawling stretch of all-day parties that lasts most of May and drives away golfers and vacationing families, local politicians say.
 ''There's not a community in the country that would welcome three straight weeks of these motorcyclists,'' said Mark Kruea, a spokesman for the city. ''And if there is, then by gosh, move the bikers there.''
 Bike Week is a catch-all term -- Bike Month would be more accurate -- for the parties, concerts and motorcycle expositions from early May through Memorial Day weekend along a strip of the Atlantic coast that includes Myrtle Beach. There are actually two rallies, one for Harley-Davidson riders, who are mostly white, and another for black bikers.
 An average of five people die each year in traffic accidents during the rallies, almost half of the city's annual total. The rate of felonies nearly quadruples during May. And last year, a college student was shot to death during the rallies, generating outcry even though the culprits were locals, not bikers.
 The chorus of complaints -- from children who could not sleep, from locals who stumbled upon nudity -- reached a peak at public meetings last spring and summer. In response, the City Council voted unanimously in September to outlaw loud mufflers, engine revving, straight pipes, riding without a helmet and goggles, and parking more than two motorcycles in a space. 
 It also enacted curfews for minors and banned alcohol sales after 2 a.m., loitering in designated parking lots and displaying chairs, coolers, alcohol or food beside a road. 
 The public's response has been divided. 
 Letters to the editor swamped the local newspaper, mostly in support of the motorcyclists. A pro-business alliance printed T-shirts mocking the mayor and flew planes over another motorcycle rally in Daytona Beach, Fla., with signs saying, ''May Is On: Myrtle Beach.'' 
 South Carolina has an unemployment rate of 11.4 percent, the third highest in the nation. Motorcyclists wonder why the city would reject rallies that bring at least $400 million, according to organizers' estimates.
 ''A town known for tourism is pushing tourists away during this economy,'' said Kevin Ault, a former construction worker who was jobless for six weeks this spring before finding work at a local Budweiser plant. ''It's crazy.''
 But not all businesses benefit from the rallies. Many high-end resorts, restaurants and golf courses experience drop-offs each May.
 How much the ordinances, and the economy, will depress biker tourism remains unclear. Reservations of vacation homes for the first week of the rallies are down 32 percent compared with last year but are slightly up for the second week. And the oldest rally participant, the Carolina Harley-Davidson Dealers Association, has moved to New Bern, N.C., where its members say they feel more welcome.
 Motorcyclists and their supporters have filed four lawsuits against Myrtle Beach, although none are likely to be resolved by this year's Bike Week, which starts Friday. 
 Racial undercurrents have complicated the situation. In 2005, a federal judge ruled that Myrtle Beach had discriminated against black bikers by changing traffic patterns for their rally but not for the Harley-Davidson rally.
 Many motorcyclists say the city, which is 75 percent white, continues to treat the races differently. ''Myrtle Beach wants to get rid of us, the black bikers,'' said Hakim Harrell, the chief executive of Cycle Shoe International, an organizer of the black rally. ''They just coupled us together with the white bikers under these ordinances so they didn't get sued for discrimination.''
 But Mr. Kruea, the city spokesman, said that Myrtle Beach did not want either rally and that the ordinances applied to all bikers.
 Tom Rice, a local lawyer who founded a group called Take Back May in opposition to the rallies, said the identity of Myrtle Beach was at stake. Mr. Rice said he hoped the city could return to its roots as a quiet, peaceful enclave for golfers, retirees and families.
 ''Myrtle Beach used to be known as a family beach,'' Mr. Rice said. Then he gestured to a flier for a biker bar advertising contests for wet T-shirts, frozen T-shirts and bobbing for sex toys. 
 Mr. Rice shook his head. ''Bike Week,'' he said, ''has killed that image.''

HEADLINE: A Return to the Bronx: Who's Cursed Now?

BYLINE: By CHARLES McGRATH

 BODY:
The Boston Red Sox are coming to the new Yankee Stadium Monday, their first visit to the House That Ruth Didn't Build and the Taxpayers Did. If the Red Sox World Series victory in 2004, the team's first in 86 years, didn't exorcise it, this occasion ought to officially end the Curse of the Bambino, the fatwa supposedly visited upon the Sox in retaliation for the owner Harry Frazee's 1920 sale of Babe Ruth to the Yanks in order to finance a Broadway musical. 
 If you were a Yankees fan with a paranoid bent, however, you could be forgiven for fretting that reverse juju is now at work, going back to last spring, while the new stadium was still going up, when a construction worker with Boston sympathies buried a Red Sox jersey bearing the name of David Ortiz, the team's designated hitter, under some freshly poured concrete. Tipped off, the Yankees management went to considerable expense to excavate the offending garment. 
But maybe they should have left it there, or thought twice about changing homes in the first place. How better to explain the Yankees' sputtering start this season, or the astral winds wafting home-run balls out to right-center field with unnatural frequency? And not that baseball superstition can entirely explain the economic collapse, but the new stadium does seem to be suffering from an attendance jinx. There have been so many no-shows that management recently slashed the price of some of the most expensive seats, especially the embarrassingly visible ones behind home plate, and is offering freebies to many season-ticket holders.
 The Red Sox home, Fenway Park, meanwhile, unfailingly sells out, as it has for years. Not the least of the many smart moves made by John Henry, who bought the Sox in 2002, was that he resisted the experts who said the only way the franchise could survive was by abandoning Fenway, which was built in 1912 and held only 33,000 or so, and building a new ballpark with more seats, better parking, executive suites and all the other profit-making amenities thought to be essential. What these visionaries had in mind, only they didn't know it, was something very similar to the new Yankee Stadium.
 Instead, Mr. Henry decided to refurbish the old place, squeezing in additional seats wherever he could, even on top of the left field wall, Fenway's fabled Green Monster, and adding luxury boxes and an expanded glassed-in area behind home plate where high-rollers could be hermetically sealed off not just from the elements but from the sound of the game. The resulting ballpark, where many seats are not a whole lot cheaper than those at the new Yankees park, is no longer the ''little lyrical bandbox'' that John Updike once celebrated, comparing it to the inside of an Easter egg. It's more nearly like a summer cottage that some industrious homeowner has winterized and added onto so many times that it now amounts to a McMansion. 
 But from the street, at least, Fenway still looks like itself. It resembles a red brick factory, an old New England mill -- not a bad illusion to cultivate at a moment of economic hardship. The stuff they make inside used to resemble the cloth that hair shirts are sewn from: a fabric woven over years of loss and disappointment. With the lifting of the Curse, though, and the raising of two World Series banners, the Fenway fabric these days is altogether sleeker -- more like the superfine merino that lordly Yankee fans grew so accustomed to wearing.
 And with Boston's success, some of the charge has gone out of the Red Sox-Yankees rivalry. It was always a little one-sided, with the Boston fans needing to hate the Yankees far more than Yankees fans needed to feel much of anything about a team that was so often far below them in the standings. With parity, however, has come tolerance and respect. Even the players get along better. Just the other day, Mike Lowell, the Red Sox third baseman, talked about how much he admired Derek Jeter, the Yankees shortstop. 
 The people who probably have the most to gain from cranking up the old feud, in fact, are now the Yankees management, who need to do something about all those empty seats. With George Steinbrenner now clearly in decline, and occasional hints of sibling spats between his sons Hank and Hal, a Lear-like cloud sometimes seems to hover over the Yankees, and the new stadium, with its vast, mall-like spaces, its temples of conspicuous consumption, feels like something the ancient Romans might have dreamed up. 
 Fenway Park, too, has become a theme park of sorts. It sometimes feels a little treacly and self-congratulatory, in fact, with the strains of ''Sweet Caroline'' wafting into the muggy Beantown night. But the illusory values Fenway stands for are New England ones, not Roman: the old habit of patching over and making do. The park still has some of the most uncomfortable, fanny-squeezing seats in all of sports, and so you can take your family there any night, drop a whole week's pay on parking, admission and overpriced snacks, and still feel virtuous. 
 Even the curse was, in a way, a blessing, allowing Sox fans to feel superior in their embrace of failure as the default mode of the human condition. Yankees fans took the opposite for granted, and if some of the Fenway spell has now transferred itself to the Bronx -- into an awareness, for example, that even if you build it, they don't have to come -- that may not be the worst thing in the world. 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 10, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the rivalry between the Yankees and Red Sox quoted incorrectly from a description John Updike once gave of Fenway Park. He called it ''a lyric little bandbox of a ballpark'' not a ''little lyrical bandbox.''

HEADLINE: How Cheever Really Felt About Living in Suburbia

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

DATELINE: OSSINING 

 BODY:
 JOHN CHEEVER was perhaps America's foremost chronicler of suburbia, and in his quirky short stories and novels, fictional suburbs like Shady Hill are often pictured as a place of deadening commuter routines, liquor-fueled get-togethers, loveless affairs and forays of conspicuous consumption. These writings suggest that he seemed to take a jaundiced view of so manicured and lovely a setting.
 But there is evidence in a new biography of Cheever that he relished his life as a suburban burgher and did not disdain his fellow suburbanites as a class. Cheever was ''crazy about the suburbs,'' said Blake Bailey, whose book, ''Cheever: A Life,'' published in March by Knopf, was written with apparently unrivaled access to Cheever's journals. 
 ''He loved the natural beauty of the Hudson Valley,'' Mr. Bailey said. ''He loved walking through the woods along the Croton Aqueduct. He liked his neighbors.'' 
 Many of the signposts of Cheever's life in the suburbs are still around, along with members of his family. His wife, Mary, 90, still lives in the gently fraying house here on the rural eastern edge of Ossining, 35 miles north of New York City. It was here that Cheever spent his autumnal years. His son Ben, a writer, lives nearby in Pleasantville. Yes, they say, his fiction explored the chaotic, sometimes heartbreaking condition of those living in the suburbs, but his insights were as true of residents of Greenwich Village as of the tree-lined streets of Westchester.
 ''Most of that is not exclusive to the suburbs,'' Ben Cheever, 60, said of the grimmer aspects of suburban angst that some of his father's stories illuminated. ''You could be banal and boring in the North Pole. The suburbs was what he knew and that was his entry point for the studies of people. But he wrote about them deeply enough so that the things that were true about the suburbs would have been true anywhere.'' 
 Mrs. Cheever was glad to show a visitor around the house she and her husband bought in 1961 for $37,500. It is a rambling white Dutch Colonial with broad verandas and peeling wallpaper that was mostly built in the 20th century. Only now Mrs. Cheever lives there with a middle-aged woman she took in, whose 10 cats she seems to affect an annoyance with.
 ''I didn't know she was going to have 10 cats,'' she said. ''Now I need her. The children don't want to worry about me.''
 She pointed out the parlor and a living room lined with Cheever's books (an eclectic collection that includes his friends Bellow, Updike and Lauren Bacall), but curiously there is no study. He wrote on an Underwood typewriter or portable Olivetti in a guest room, his daughter Susan's room after she moved out, and in a small room above an Ossining barbershop that he rented for a time. 
 Mrs. Cheever casually took care to point out that her husband wrote only in the mornings because by the afternoon he was often drunk on gin.
 ''In those days, people did drink ever so much more than they do now,'' Mrs. Cheever said with a chuckle. ''It sounds shocking now, but it was not shocking then.''
 Mrs. Cheever told of how her husband gravitated to many classic suburban pursuits. He ate with friends at Ossining's Highland Diner. When he lived in the Briarcliff Manor hamlet of Scarborough, he was on the board of trustees of his children's private school. He liked to dig his hands in the soil and plant apple trees. He delighted in quiet walks with his Labrador retriever and liked bicycling from his house to the Teatown Lake Reservation. 
 In Scarborough, where he made his first suburban home, he was even a casual volunteer for the local fire department, though his family does not remember his ever actually fighting a fire. 
 ''He once got to drive the fire truck, and that was a big thrill,'' Mrs. Cheever said.
 If he had any misgivings about moving from the city to the suburbs -- as many transplanters do -- ''he accepted it because he found himself with his family living there,'' Mrs. Cheever said.
 The Cheevers moved to the suburbs in 1951 for the same reasons many city people do. Their apartment building on First Avenue and 59th Street in Manhattan was converting to cooperatives, and the apartment was too cramped. His baby son, Ben, and daughter, Susan, were sharing a room.
 ''Maybe we were snobs,'' Mrs. Cheever said. ''We didn't want to live in the Bronx.'' They were lucky in a fashion because the house in Scarborough they found to rent was on the estate of a millionaire banker, a house that, coincidentally, had been occupied before by another suburban chronicler, Richard Yates, who wrote ''Revolutionary Road'' (a title drawn subconsciously, Yates once said, from a street in Scarborough). Many of their neighbors were quite cultured and sophisticated, Mr. Bailey said.
 The Cheevers sent their three children (their third, the youngest, is Federico) mostly to private schools, including one founded by their landlord. Private school was not an easily affordable expense for someone whose income came largely from short stories for The New Yorker. But Mrs. Cheever said she did not think sending her children to private school was elitist.
 ''We were old-fashioned,'' she said. ''We were brought up in private schools.''
 Whatever status he carried as a writer, Cheever often brooded about his economic disparities, like getting snubbed by waiters at a country club they sometimes visited but could not afford to join. Like many suburban husbands at that time, Cheever did not want his wife to work, though against his wishes she taught freshman college composition part time. ''He was that old-fashioned,'' she said. ''People forget what a short time it has been that women have been working.'' 
 Mr. Bailey noted that Cheever came from a declasse family -- despite a name stretching back to the Puritans, his father was a shoe salesman and his mother a shopkeeper -- and he ''suffered a traumatic childhood of much economic embarrassment.'' So upholding his status as a suburban gentleman was important. When not working, Mrs. Cheever kept herself immersed in volunteer groups like the League of Women Voters.
 Mrs. Cheever remembered, with some bitterness, that her husband wrote a story, ''An Educated American Woman,'' that seemed to be modeled on her, about a suburban wife so preoccupied with civic organizations and a book she is writing on Flaubert that the story ends tragically, with the woman's son dying in the care of a neglectful babysitter. Mrs. Cheever, in tears, suggested she did not mind the echoes of her own life, but was upset that ''he had the woman leave her sick child.'' 
 She rejects those who attribute her husband's inner loneliness to his life in the suburbs.
 ''His was the loneliness of a writer, when he would sit by himself working alone,'' she said. ''They all complain about it. It's not a social craft.''
 Cheever's raw materials were his surrounding terrain and its inhabitants and, because he spent most of his writing career in Westchester towns like Briarcliff Manor and Ossining, he effectively created a Cheever country that lives on in the American imagination as quintessential suburbia. But his stories and more recent biographical unearthings indicate he found much to admire as well. In ''The Swimmer,'' the delusional protagonist decides to swim across the county through his neighbors' pools, yet he can extol his surroundings by remarking that living ''in a world so generously supplied with water seemed like a clemency, a beneficence.''
 AND the suburbs Cheever described have moved on. The blandly homogenous, dependably Republican towns and villages of the 1950s and 1960s, where fedora-wearing men commuted and women stayed home, are a thing of the past, with Westchester today as polyglot, polychrome and politically varied as most of America.
 What gave the standard suburban picture its irresistible complexity was that Cheever also lived a secret life. He was bisexual, and while married to Mary and raising his children, had numerous flings with men and women. The characters in his stories often harbor secrets that eat away at them or shadow their domestic lives, and Cheever projected onto them the futility of trying to seem happy while burying a gnawing unhappiness. Because of his own tortured inner life, Cheever approached his fiction with a sympathetic irony, Mr. Bailey said. 
 ''He identifies with their follies and deeply sympathizes with their foibles and suffering,'' he said. ''Those stories tell us that the suburbs are a radiant place of great natural beauty and human promise and because of that it's all the more tragic that we can't live in that world altogether happily.''
 In his early days in his first suburban house in Scarborough, Cheever felt ''out of water,'' according to his journals. He drove a secondhand Dodge and lived in what had been a rich man's tool shed near busy Route 9 while his wealthy neighbors lived in grand houses and drove Cadillacs. Cheever, Mr. Bailey's biography says, sometimes responded by outdoing his neighbors in affecting a courtly style that some saw as snobbishness. He also resorted, when drunk, to insults, and that increased the social isolation he came to feel.
 He captured seething middle-class envy in a story like ''The Housebreaker of Shady Hill,'' where a man consumed by the inferiority he feels next to his ostentatious neighbors sneaks at night into the bedroom of a sleeping couple and steals cash from the husband's wallet. The sense is that beneath the placid suburban exteriors, life is deeply troubled. Yet at the same time, Cheever could say in that story, ''If you work in the city and have children to raise, I can't think of a better place.''
 Indeed, a line that for Mr. Bailey best captured this paradox came from the story ''The Country Husband'' as it describes Shady Hill after the 7:14 has come and gone and dinner is finished.
 ''The village hangs morally and economically, from a thread,'' the story says. ''But it hangs by its thread in the evening light.''
 Cheever, who died in 1982 at the age of 70, had paradoxical views on many subjects, Mr. Bailey said, so he saw the suburbs in all their protean intricacy, which is why his stories live on. 
 ''Updike, in the New Yorker obituary, said many people have written about suburbia but only Cheever was able to make an archetypal place of it, a place we recognize wherever we are and wherever we have been,'' Mr. Bailey said

HEADLINE: Immaterialism

BYLINE: By ROB WALKER

 BODY:
DIGITAL GOODS
 A few months ago, a friend sent me an otter. It was a birthday gift, and it arrived via Facebook: a tiny digital representation labeled ''Lonely Otter.'' The person who sent it to me is someone I've never met or spoken to, a friend only in the Facebook sense of the term. The otter cost her a dollar. The dollar was filtered through the popular social network's ''gift points'' setup, but ultimately it wasn't a representation, the way the Lonely Otter is. It was an actual dollar. 
 Spending real money on things that don't exist still sounds ''fringe-y and aberrant'' to many United States consumers, observes Jeremy Liew, managing director of Lightspeed Venture Partners, a venture-capital firm. (Lightspeed has invested in some digital-goods sellers, although none of the ones mentioned in this column.) Yet it has been going on for years in elaborate games like World of Warcraft or Everquest, as players buy tools, weapons and the like for digital characters. Moreover, Liew adds, ''this is a set of behaviors that has been commonplace in Asia and, increasingly, in Europe.'' Indeed, in April, a company called Changyou.com Limited, based in China, went public on the Nasdaq stock exchange. With annual revenue of around $200 million a year, it is (unlike many well-known Web 2.0 companies in the United States) profitable, and it makes most of its money by selling pixelated goods to game players and virtual-world users in China; as of late April, the market's judgment put the company's valuation at more than $1.3 billion. 
 As more of us live more of our lives in digital contexts, it seems plausible that immaterialism will become more common. Consuming things made of bits might sound weird, but actually it offers a lot of the same attractions that make people consume things made of atoms. Facebook's digital gifting is one relatively mainstream example. Consider the Fort Worth, Tex., company Alamofire. Its best-known creation is a Facebook application called Pack Rat. While nominally a game, it's really premised on a virtual version of the urge to collect things: in this case, the things are ''cards'' that are basically little pixel-pictures. The company calls its wares ''digital collectibles.'' 
 Josh Williams, a founder of Alamofire, figured out the appeal of collecting pixelated stuff by accident. Originally he was in the business of designing digital icons, and he and his partners decided to make some of their creations available for others to use, free. There were thousands of takers, and he got curious about what they were doing with the icons. The most prominent answer turned out to be: Nothing much, just collecting them, trading them, using them as means of fun social connection with other collectors. ''A light bulb went off,'' Williams says. ''We were in the wrong business.'' Alamofire's new project is called Gowalla. This time, the product is more tied to mobile devices like the iPhone and involves ''collecting'' digital icons by (nondigitally) visiting certain spots in various cities. Really, he figures, it's not so different from what inspired earlier generations to collect postcards or other gewgaws. But, Williams adds, without ''all the physical crap.'' 
 There are plenty of other examples, like the teen-focused virtual worlds of IMVU and Gaia, where participants pay to deck out their avatars much as real-world consumers have long paid to deck out their physical bodies. Perhaps immaterialism comes more naturally to younger people who take the digital extension of quotidian life for granted, but the digital-stuff consumer base is clearly expanding. Facebook, which opened its virtual-gifts shop in 2007, doesn't comment on its finances, but Liew has estimated the social network's digital-stuff revenue at around $35 million a year. Expand the definition of immaterial goods to include things like iPhone apps, and it's tempting to think that despite, or maybe even because of, the recession, we're rechanneling basic shopping urges in a fundamental way. Consumption does seem different if it's only conspicuous in the digital world. 
 Liew talked me down from this point of view. ''People are behaving in exactly the same way they've always behaved,'' he said. They're simply doing so online ''because that's where most people are spending their time.'' And when I told him about my birthday otter, he immediately asked, ''Do you remember who gave it to you?'' Of course I did -- proving that it was a pretty effective gift, just like a traditional, physical birthday card, which expresses a sentiment but really has no other utility. In other words, the gap between materialism and immaterialism may not be as wide as it seems.

HEADLINE: Debts Gone Bad, Relations Gone Sour

BYLINE: By KEVIN COYNE

DATELINE: Newark 

 BODY:
 AS the dozens of litigants filed into the grand old courtroom, most couldn't help but gaze upward with widened eyes -- at the oak paneling that climbed to the coffered ceiling, the gold leaf trim, the Corinthian pilasters, the twin chandeliers, all the lavish civic grandeur of a sanctuary that seemed out of scale to the size of their complaints.
 They filled the 13 benches in Room 301 of the Essex County Hall of Records, and riffled through the documents their cases were based upon, making sure they were ready for their day in court. They stretched weary elastic around scuffed expandable files. They arranged their canceled checks in the proper chronology. They debated which photo of a botched kitchen renovation to show first. And they leaned in closer when the judge started to speak. 
 ''Please keep your voices up,'' said Judge Michael R. Casale, keeping his own up to make sure it was heard in a tall, echoey room that -- as a new air-conditioning unit in the rear corner rumbled on this unseasonably hot morning -- swallowed the words of those who didn't.
 Sitting in the third row, Julio Nunez, 73, unfolded his arms from across his barrel chest and reached into the back pocket of his jeans for the clear plastic envelope that contained his case: $13,000 in bad checks that were supposed to repay a loan he made to a building contractor who had been a friend for 15 years. When business soured, the friend turned out to be not so much of a friend after all, and disappeared.
 Mr. Nunez hoped to get ''maybe something, at least,'' he said, sounding the predominant theme here, and in many other places, too, these days: The everything you were counting on might be gone, but maybe some diminished part of it is still within reach. 
 He and the other litigants here had already raised their voices once, when their frustration over some transaction gone awry led them to file their cases in what is colloquially known as small claims court, and they raised them again, as the clerk called each of their names, plaintiffs and defendants. But first they listened as Judge Casale gave them the same quick lesson that he gives each new crop of litigants, and that has acquired new shades of meaning in these harsh times -- a lesson in the limits of what a seemingly omnipotent institution can actually do to make them whole again.
 ''Anyone can sue for anything -- I know because I see the lawsuits on a daily basis,'' said Judge Casale, 52, who spent a dozen years as a judge in the criminal courts in Essex County before switching to the civil division last fall, just as the economy was collapsing. His first assignment was in the Special Civil Part, which hears claims of up to $15,000 and disputes between landlords and tenants. ''But you can't get blood from a stone, as the saying goes.''
 The economic crisis can be seen in many quarters of the downtown courthouse complex here: the divorced fathers who have lost their jobs and are seeking a reduction in their support payments; the landlords who have waited longer before coming to seek eviction notices, because patience may be a more prudent option when new tenants are harder to find; the angry foreclosed homeowners who were turning up unannounced with such regularity on the days of sheriff's sales that the state started a special mediation program in March to handle them. 
 Here in Special Civil, the hopeful plaintiffs continue to arrive each morning, many of them expecting judgments as swift and satisfying as those meted out on television courts. But as each day unfolds, so grows their understanding that justice is not always a matter of truth, but of compromise. 
 ''If you sue for $500 and it costs you $700, you lost,'' Judge Casale told them. ''I know -- principles. I understand about principles, but principles don't pay the bills.''
 A few litigants were dispatched immediately to meet with the mediators who held the bright green case files, and the rest marched down the hall to wait in a smaller courtroom that was neither as lavish nor as cool as the one they were leaving. Mr. Nunez pulled out his envelope again, and surveyed his papers one more time. On the other side of the courtroom, Henry Roman, 45, waited with his fiancee, Aliya Onque, 35, hoping to collect the $2,590 owed them by the former tenant in the upstairs apartment of their two-family house in Newark's North Ward. A rental subsidy paid $622 of the tenant's $950 monthly rent; the tenant was supposed to pay the rest.
 A mediator finally called their names, and their tenant's, and they took their case behind closed doors for almost an hour. They emerged with an agreement -- a promise of a $100 payment each month for the next 20 months. 
 ''We didn't expect to walk out of here with everything -- it just wasn't happening,'' Ms. Onque said. ''We did get something.''
 No mediator could help Mr. Nunez, because there was no one to mediate with; his former friend had failed to appear. He took the checks from his envelope when his case was called, and handed them up to the bench.
 '' 'Insufficient funds' is stamped right over it,'' said Judge Ned M. Rosenberg, as he examined one check. He agreed that Mr. Nunez was owed the money, and gave him the papers that said so. 
 Mr. Nunez took his papers to another room, smaller and plainer still, and filled out some forms, including one in which he authorized a constable to try to collect on the judgment. Then he was sent to yet another room, the smallest, plainest and dimmest of all, where he had to fill out one more. No money was waiting for him there, and when the window clerk asked him a question, he leaned in closer to make sure he had heard right. Then he reached into his front pocket for some cash: $12 for a filing fee.
 ''I feel like I want to beat him up, but I can't,'' Mr. Nunez said of his former friend, as he walked out with the papers that said that the law, at least, was on his side. He folded them and put them in the same plastic envelope with the bad checks. ''Now I have to collect, something at least.''

HEADLINE: Depression Scares Are Hardly New

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. SHILLER. 
Robert J. Shiller is professor of economics and finance at Yale and co-founder and chief economist of MacroMarkets LLC.

 BODY:
WHAT is the chance that the current downturn will morph into another Great Depression? That question has been preoccupying people for months. 
 The popular mood has a huge impact on the economy, so it's worth noting what many people seem to forget: Depression scares come and go. And by one authoritative measure, the current outbreak of concern has been surprisingly mild. 
 The University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers have included in their regular measurements this specific question about fear of a prolonged depression: 
 ''Looking ahead, which would you say is more likely -- that in the country as a whole we'll have continuous good times during the next five years or so, or that we will have periods of widespread unemployment or depression, or what?''
 The Michigan surveyors produce a confidence score from the answer to this question. (It is one of the five ingredients in their combined Index of Consumer Sentiment, which is much more widely followed.) A high score on the question means that the answers tilted toward continuous good times, with a low score tilting toward unemployment or depression. Since 1960, the average score has been 94.
 If we define a depression scare as any time the score is below 65, there have been four such scares since 1951. They were in the periods from 1974 to 1975, during which 47 was the lowest score; from 1978 to 1982, with a low of 41; from 1990 to 1992, with a low of 54; and from 2008 to 2009, with a low (to date) of 59. Note that so far, at least, the worst reading in the current scare has not been as bad as those of the previous episodes.
 In each case, the scare's significance is further confirmed by electronically counting in news databases the number of articles containing the word pair ''great depression.'' There were huge peaks in the count during these periods.
 A study of the Michigan survey data published in 2004 by Nicholas Souleles at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania has confirmed that individual answers to the depression question can help in consumer-spending forecasts. He concluded that people who answered this question more positively tended to have bigger increases in spending. 
 The good news is that from March to April this year, the score on this question jumped to 81, from 63, implying that the scare has ended, at least for now. 
 But that upward trend cannot be trusted to continue. Historically, big jumps in the score have tended to reverse themselves in later months. When people's fear reaches depression level, the underlying emotion seems to persist for years, despite occasional oscillations.
 That is probably because fear of a depression seems to be related to a fundamental world view, and not just to the latest economic indicator, which may temporarily reduce anxiety.
 A review of prominent events in the depression scares of 1974-75 and 1978-82 suggests that they stemmed at least in part from a sense that inflation was dangerously out of control. During both periods, inflation moved into the double-digit range. There was widespread concern that the Federal Reserve had no good options and might need to plunge the economy into a depression to control inflation.
 And in these two periods, energy crises -- the first and second ''oil shocks'' -- contributed to the negative outlook. 
 The scare of 1990-92 had a different profile. Ravi Batra's best-selling 1987 book, ''The Great Depression of 1990,'' did not cause that scare, but some of its predictions were vindicated by events: There was the biggest one-day stock market crash ever, in 1987; a real estate bust after a boom; widespread savings-and-loan failures; and a government bailout. The financial system seemed unstable, and there was concern that domestic jobs were threatened by the new trend of outsourcing. 
 LIKE its predecessors, the current depression scare is characterized by serious problems that won't easily go away. After the bursting of bubbles in the stock market and housing market, balance sheets everywhere are out of whack, and millions of people are insolvent. So it's hard to expect that there will be a sudden and impressive recovery of confidence.
 But why is this new depression scare apparently weaker than the others, as measured by the confidence scores? Why aren't people reporting more fear these days, since there are far more stories of business failure or near failure than there were during the other scares?
 One can only speculate. Now that oil prices have moderated, it's possible that most people have less vivid worries than they did in 1974-75 or 1979-82 because their economic problems are not evident every time they shop or drive their cars. 
 During those earlier two scares, out-of-control inflation was widely visible, but today many people haven't personally experienced rising unemployment and foreclosures. And it's possible that the optimistic tone of the president and the Fed has assuaged some fears, and that people might believe that the government is fixing their problems. 
 This time, the reasons to fret about a possible depression may seem less concrete. For most people, the worries that consume economists and accountants, about things like bank stress-test results or the ''OIS-Libor spread,'' are rather hard to comprehend.
 As Franklin D. Roosevelt famously said during the Great Depression, ''the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.'' Let's hope that is true, and that the relative complacency in the general population is good news for the economy. Let's not expect any sudden return to full confidence, but instead hope that a real crisis of fear may be avoided if government policy succeeds.

HEADLINE: Your Left Foot: Now Left Out

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

 BODY:
A PORSCHE, to most people, is a sports car. To me, it can be a time machine. Even a new Porsche loaded with technogadgets-- a 2009 911 Carrera S Cabriolet, in this case -- stirs fond recollections.
 It takes me back to 1967. A red 356 Speedster of uncertain 1950s vintage, tossed from one corner to the next, in and out of fog banks, as I furiously shift through the gears on the drive south on California Highway 1 along the Big Sur coast. The tattered canvas top is flapping in the wind; my girlfriend, wearing a silk bandana and enormous Audrey Hepburn sunglasses, is smiling.
 Or late September 1979. I am driving across upstate New York in a decade-old silver 911E, the road unwinding before me through mile after mile of blazing fall colors. My tired old 911 and I are headed to the United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen. When I honk the horn, the lights go on. When I flick the light switch, every light in the car goes black. When I crank up the defroster, the side windows ice over. That's entertainment! 
 Or, some 20 years later, when I aimed a new millennium edition 911 straight as a bullet across the Seven Mile Bridge in the Florida Keys, the road ahead disappearing over the horizon. Turquoise waters flank me, a fireball sun in the sky ahead. Will we get to Mallory Square in time for the sunset bell?
 In each of these reveries, I am rowing my own boat, sawing through the gears, working all three pedals and listening to the engine sing.
 But my reverie is interrupted as I pull away in a 2009 model equipped with a newly domesticated version of Porsche's PDK transmission, originally developed for racing. It's as if someone has swatted the arm of my phonograph across the record. I was ready to drive this Porsche, not have it drive me.
 The PDK (its full name is Porsche Doppelkupplungsgetriebe, or double clutch gearbox) uses two wet clutches to shift its seven forward gears with minimal interruption in the flow of power to the wheels. And though it can make all the gear changes without any help from the driver, mechanically it's a manual transmission. It does not connect to the engine through the fluid coupling known as a torque converter that is used by conventional automatics. 
 Such distinctions aside, say ''auf wiedersehen''to the clutch pedal. 
 Porsche has been experimenting with automatics since the days of the 356 models, and first offered its semi-automatic Sportomatic in a 911 in 1968. The fully automatic Tiptronic, shifted by tapping the center console's gear selector, made its debut with the 1990 models. It was renamed the Tiptronic S a few years later when steering-wheel shift buttons were added. 
 Tiptronics proved popular with those who couldn't, wouldn't or shouldn't work a clutch. But now that they are being supplanted by the PDK transmission (except in the 911 Turbo and Cayenne S.U.V., for the time being), it seems hard to find anyone who will truly miss that gearbox when it is gone. A 6-speed manual continues to be available.
 Actually, the PDK preceded the Tiptronic, having been introduced in racing first on the 1983 Porsche 956 and later on the 962. The advantage in competition was that the dual clutches facilitated almost instantaneous gear changes -- faster than the driver's hand -- which helped to keep the turbochargers pumping at full pressure rather than losing boost during the shift. But the PDK, which was not particularly reliable, made the car 90 pounds heavier at the rear.
 ''It was like towing a trailer,'' said Derek Bell, who raced one back then.
 The PDK 962 was fast, but had a relatively short career in competition, at least as an official Porsche entry. Porsche withdrew from Group C racing in 1987, no longer racing as a factory team with the 962 and PDK.
 Audi, Volkswagen, Nissan and Mitsubishi would eventually come out with dual-clutch transmissions for their road cars years before Porsche decided to re-introduce PDK for 2009.
 Despite packaging and reliability refinements, the technology adds 66 pounds over the 6-speed manual, mostly to the 911's derriere. It also contributed $4,080 toward the $119,925 sticker price of my 911 S Cabriolet test car.
 Externally, 911s appear all but unchanged for 2009. Unseen changes, however, make them handle with greater precision, brake better and go faster. New 3.6- and 3.8-liter 6-cylinder engines get direct-fuel-injection systems that facilitate higher compression ratios. Horsepower increases by 20 in the 3.6, to 345, and up 30 for the 3.8, to 385.
 The engines are not simply more powerful, they run in a more relaxed manner, too, thanks to the PDK's seven forward gears (compared with the Tiptronic's five). Gearing is similar to the 6-speed manual in the lower gears, but the PDK's seventh speed permits cruising at far lower engine speeds (2,200 r.p.m. at 80 miles an hour). 
 Federal mileage ratings for my S Cabriolet test car are 19 m.p.g. in town and an impressive 26 on the highway. A 186 m.p.h. Porsche that gets 26 m.p.g.? That's almost ridiculous. 
 When ordered with the $960 Sport Chrono Package Plus, PDK gains Sport and Sports Plus settings for even faster shifts. That option also adds Launch Control, which helps the 911 do naughty things from a standing start -- like 0-60 sprints in less than 4.3 seconds. Without leaving those telltale twin strips of rubber on the pavement behind you.
 In Sport mode, the PDK is 0.2 second quicker than the 6-speed manual getting to 60 m.p.h., Porsche says; in Sport Plus mode, the margin doubles to 0.4 seconds.
 In milliseconds the PDK will unerringly pick both the right engine speed at which to shift and the correct gear. Its two clutches operate separately: one is assigned odd-numbered gears and reverse and the other clutch takes care of even-numbered gears. Imagine a dealer shuffling a deck of cards -- it's that fast.
 You can leave it in fully automatic mode or shift it manually -- just like the Tiptronic -- via the gear selector on the floor or the two sets of plastic buttons on either side of the steering wheel. The button-button method -- push to shift up, pull to downshift -- is a rather odd ambidextrous set-up. Paddle-shifters offered by most competitors execute upshifts with the right hand and downshifts with the left.
 In regular mode, for maximum fuel economy, upshifts occur early and often; I was in fifth gear by 29 m.p.h. So this really is a car that can be driven effortlessly by any member of the family (operator's license required). And that is the part that's tough for me to get my head around.
 Driving a Porsche has often been a daunting experience, best left to experienced drivers (ideally, holding high-risk insurance). Now, with systems like PDK, Porsche Stability Management and Porsche Active Suspension Management, some of the fear of God has been engineered out.
 Is this progress? Along with my lyrical memories of Porsches from bygone eras, there were terrifying moments, too: Hitting a patch of ice in a 911 -- which typically have a 38-62 front-rear weight balance -- while rounding a corner, feeling the rear end break loose and spinning more times than the Mad Hatter ride at Disneyland. Those outings won't be missed.
 INSIDE TRACK: Deal me in.

HEADLINE: Florida to California, Prom Dresses Selling

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
Families living in parts of the nation that have been hardest hit by the recession are still spending whatever they can to make sure their teenagers make it to prom. That means that gown and formalwear shops from Florida to California are thriving even in areas where customers have been directly affected by the housing collapse and the banking slowdown.
 ''Yes we are in a recession and we're in a bad recession,'' said Georgette Diaz, owner of Georgette's in Tampa, Fla. ''But they're going to forgo other things to make sure their daughter goes to prom.'' 
 Even in a state battered by the real estate slowdown, Ms. Diaz said, families are still spending $250 to $300 for gowns. She hung a framed sign on her shop door offering teenagers the opportunity to help earn their gowns by helping out at the store on Saturdays leading up to prom, and a few girls took advantage of the offer. But for the most part, she said, their families are paying for gowns. 
 While shoppers at Cardita Formalwear in Port St. Lucie may delay their prom purchases, boys are spending even more this year on tuxes, according to the shop's owner, Clifford Pearl. He said teenage boys were spending $150 to $160 for designer brands, though they typically spent about $120 to $135 last year. 
 Mr. Pearl said about 80 percent of his teenage customers tell him, ''I want to go all out.''
 Even in Southern California where many mortgage banking jobs were concentrated, girls are buying gowns ''like there's no tomorrow,'' according to Suzanne Aguila, owner of Carraz Gowns in Glendale and Torrance. Ms. Aguila said they are still spending what they did last year, $300 to $500.
 Bianca Cortez, an 18-year-old senior at John Burroughs High School in Burbank, still plans to attend her senior prom even though her family has been under financial pressure. Her grandmother was laid off from a manufacturing job, and Bianca's mother has had to help her out. Bianca is using her savings from working at an elementary school program to help pay for the $400 deep purple gown she bought at Carraz. Her mother Marlin Cortez said she had passed up shopping for staples for herself like shoes so that she could give her daughter $200 to pay for her gown. She would like to help her daughter out even more with paying for the evening.
 ''I didn't want her to miss out,'' she said. Ms. Cortez, 37, was not able to go to her own prom because ''there just wasn't money.''
 In markets like Charlotte, N.C., which depends heavily on the banking industry for jobs, some families are buying gowns by delaying purchases until prom night and taking advantage of layaway programs. Pam Funderburk, manager of Dar-Lynn's Bridal and Formal Wear in Matthews, a Charlotte suburb, said at least 25 percent more teenagers were trying to put prom gowns on layaway than a year ago. In the 27 years she has worked in the prom gown business, she said, she has never seen so many teenagers delay paying for their gowns until the weekend of the prom. They used to wrap up buying gowns by March.
 ''They're just waiting to see what their parents have to spend,'' she said.
 Ms. Funderburk also is seeing more mothers and daughters quarrel about the cost of prom gowns. She said she can appreciate the financial stresses because her husband's income has been cut back drastically in the past year. She feels grateful that she works in the business and can get her daughter her senior prom gown through work.
 ''I've had girls go out of here in tears when their mothers won't buy them something that they liked,'' she said. ''I'm sure it had something to do with the economy.''

HEADLINE: One's a Landmark, the Other's Marked for Demolition

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN. 
E-mail: theisland@nytimes.com

DATELINE: MASTIC 

 BODY:
 THE best-selling inventory item at Mastic Liquors, the 90-year-old red-shingle storefront that received a unanimous thumbs up this month from the Brookhaven Town Board at historic designation polling time, is the $10 liter of Georgi vodka. 
 ''No, let me rethink that,'' the shop's manager, Bob Kilroy, said on Tuesday afternoon as he -- standing in for the store's vacationing owner, Fred Wesemann, a Mastic native off taking a mini-breather at his second home in North Carolina -- basked in the afterglow that accompanies laying claim to a genuine, ongoing personal relationship with a landmark. 
 So what that for the past seven decades it has been a source of libations. What matters now is that, no matter what it sells or houses, this building has bragging rights to antiquity at one end and eternity on the other. The joint has character. And time is on its side. 
 The same cannot be said for its pseudo-sister (at least in age) structure farther east, the former Canoe Place Inn in identity-challenged Hampton Bays. The decrepit white elephant, fittingly known as the Whitehouse nightclub of late, was bought a few years back by the uber-developers (and cousins) Gregg and Mitchell Rechler, who want to raze it and replace it with a private residence/club/resort. 
 And unless the State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation opts to overturn its 2007 opinion denying the inn a landmark designation (a hue and cry from local preservationists has prodded the state to review the situation), the developers may have their way with a site that began life as a tavern and stagecoach stop in 1739. In 1921 the original inn was consumed by fire, and a replacement, designed by William Lawrence Bottomley, was erected; celebrity guests have included Lucille Ball and Albert Einstein (not together).
 The Rechlers say their $100 million project, if ''fully realized,'' will annually pump $24 million into the local economy and provide $250,000 in taxes to the needy school district. Seductive numbers -- albeit somewhat speculative, coming as they are in the crucible of this free-ranging recession. Citing time constraints, the developers declined, via their Huntington-based publicist, Lloyd Singer, to explain why they are convinced that the demolition of the inn is essential to their vision.
 The vision in Mastic seems driven by a different goal. ''Beauty is in the eye of the beholder,'' said Keith Romaine, a Brookhaven town councilman who championed the landmark designation for Mastic Liquors. ''This wasn't about preserving a liquor store, it was about saving a building with a unique sense of place and unique link to the area's history. That's it; end of story.''
 Mastic, known more for grappling with foreclosures, vagrants and drug traffic (crack is prominent) than nurturing historic sites, can use all the landmarks it can get. That Mastic Liquors and the building containing it -- originally a Texaco station when it first graced the horizon in 1918 -- is a functional, useful member of a community blighted by one too many strip malls makes its historic designation all the sweeter. 
 But back to casing out the inventory, which, by the way, is not arranged the usual way, in aisles; at Mastic Liquors, customers are surrounded by four walls of product. Quaint. 
 ''The most popular bottle is probably the pint; we are, after all, in a recession,'' Mr. Kilroy, 59 and a Boston transplant, said. Some discerning customers who used to buy, say Skyy, have dialed it back a notch. Cut back, but not cut off. Recessions and liquor seem to have a longstanding relationship, too.
 The Georgi pint sells for around $4.49. Plus tax. We're talking about affordable tippling. ''Let's just say that in this neighborhood, the liquor doesn't sit on the shelf for very long,'' Mr. Kilroy said. No dust collectors here. Not that the store doesn't sell its fair share of high-end potables: the Ruffino Ducale Chianti is a nice mover at about $50, and for a three-digit splurge, there's the Johnnie Walker Blue.
 According to Mr. Wesemann, 62, who weighed in by telephone Wednesday morning en route home from the Carolinas, the historic status afforded the building is just one more silver lining to a dream come true. He bought it in 1977 from the widow of the son of the owner, Clifford Hawkins, who had hired him to work here as a teenager some 44 years ago. 
 Mr. Wesemann loves his job, and he loves the building that houses it (and that for a time, used to house him in its now-vacant upstairs apartment). But this isn't about keeping his liquor store alive, he said, it's about preserving an oldie but goodie in an era of specious teardowns. ''I could put a real estate office in there if I wanted to,'' he said. Not that he wants to. 
 ''The town historian told me it's one of just three or four buildings of its vintage left along Montauk Highway in Mastic, and also that it is probably the oldest continuously operating business in the area,'' Mr. Wesemann said. ''No, George Washington never slept here. But the people who know about these things tell me this humble structure actually is a thing of beauty just because of the way it was built. They just don't make 'em like this anymore.''
 They don't make 'em like the Canoe Place Inn anymore, either. But the Rechlers have concluded that it isn't realistic, financially or physically, to try to restore the inn. Their concession to aesthetics thus far: They have lopped a floor (Level 4) off their proposed resort.
 Mr. Wesemann, when informed of the inn's endangered status, was empathetic. ''Too many things are being knocked down and thrown away for the sake of some better, fancier tomorrow,'' he said. ''If we don't care about preserving our past and our history, well, that's not a future where I really want to be.''

HEADLINE: When Home Turns Office for Two

BYLINE: By MARGARET FARLEY STEELE

 BODY:
WHEN Kathy Siever, an event planner, was laid off earlier this year after nearly 15 years with GE Capital, it helped that the company gave her a month's notice -- enough time for her and her husband, David, to work out a plan for both of them to use their Rowayton home as their new joint workplace. 
 Mr. Siever, 65, had already laid claim to the basement, where he runs an investment banking business that raises capital for clean and renewable energy projects. So his wife, 58, settled on a spare bedroom on the second floor, which she set up as an office with new furniture, and began working on her own business plan. Having the middle floor between them is ideal, so they are not in each other's face -- or space -- all day, they said.
 As layoffs rock families across the country, many professional couples like the Sievers are getting reacquainted from 9 to 5, sometimes because one partner already works from home or because both spouses find themselves unemployed and needing a home office. Sharing work space and toiling side by side can radically alter the dynamics of a relationship, said A. Susan Brenner, a marriage and family therapist practicing in Westport and Manhattan. 
 Nationwide, unemployment has soared to 8.5 percent. In Connecticut, where 58,000 workers have lost their jobs in the last 12 months, the jobless rate is 7.5 percent. As the ranks of the unemployed grow, more couples will feel the need to redefine their roles and boundaries at home. And those in tight quarters may have a harder time than couples able to spread out in a large suburban home, Ms. Brenner said.
 For couples who have successfully dealt with hardships before, job loss can bring the couple closer together. ''They partner up and get stronger helping one another,'' said Resa Fremed, a marriage and family therapist practicing in South Salem, N.Y., where she sees many Fairfield County couples. But if communication skills are already rocky, a job crisis will exacerbate problems, she said. 
 Jeffrey H. Roberts, who runs a real estate business out of his Stamford home, said it was a huge adjustment when his wife, Tina, was out of work for seven months a few years ago. ''The only thing that kept us sane is we had two computers,'' he said recently at a networking group in Stamford for at-home workers. Mr. Roberts, 50, said he was less social than his wife, 41, and by the second day he had to close the door to his home office because of her talkativeness. ''Honey, if my door is closed, it's inviolate. You have to think about it before crossing the threshold,'' he told her. It took a month for them to develop a system that worked, he said.
 When a spouse is unemployed, roles shift, Ms. Fremed said. ''The change could be positive or it could cause resentment,'' she said. It's nice if a father can step in and pick up the kids, but it may be uncomfortable for him. ''The women go out for coffee, but look at a stay-at-home dad as a misfit. It's not easy,'' she said.
 Good communication is essential to get through this period, experts said. ''Sit down and really have an open conversation with each other,'' Ms. Brenner said. '''What is it going to be like for us? What can we share or take care of separately? What do we expect of each other?' It's like renegotiating a contract.''
 Job-hunting is a full-time job, and access to phones and computers can be a source of friction if both partners need these tools and have to share them. Those who can't afford separate phones and computers should devise a mutually agreeable schedule for using them, Ms. Fremed suggests.
 Finding ''alone'' time is important too. Some folks retreat to the local library; others sign up for networking groups or classes. 
 For the millions of Americans who work at home, the perks include the freedom to labor when and how they please -- perhaps with documents strewn across the floor, a TV blaring in the background or in clothing that makes casual Friday attire look formal. Quirks like those can raise the eyebrows of someone who is used to a quiet, dignified office and that in turn will raise the hackles of the spouse no longer working in splendid isolation, say the experts.
 These days, Ms. Siever is often at her desk first thing in the morning -- but in her pajamas. ''For David, the downside is, I don't put makeup on any more, maybe just a little lipstick,'' she said.
 In busy households, maintaining an air of professionalism can be a challenge. Holli and Glenn Horine of Fairfield are both at home much of the week. She lost her part-time job in March; he lost a job as senior vice president of Velocity, a sponsorship and event marketing agency in Norwalk, in 2008 but still teaches at Iona College in New Rochelle, N.Y. He is trying to build a consulting business in the sports and entertainment field from his home. 
 Two children and two dogs in the house are a distraction. After school, Ms. Horine, 48, who worked at a promotion/marketing agency, said her husband ''barricades himself in his office and I try to keep the kids and dogs quiet.'' If anyone needs to reach him, they have to call his work phone.
 ''If the home phone rings, I won't answer it,'' said Mr. Horine, 46. ''I'm in work mode and have to stay focused or my day is shot.''
 Believing that optimism helps, many couples try to look on the bright side. Debbie Roberts, a landscape designer in Stamford and no relation to Jeffrey Roberts, said when her husband, Nick, was unemployed, he seemed blind to the fact that she had a set routine and work hours. ''He was always asking, 'What should we do today?' '' she said. But to his credit, ''he was much better at being a stay-at-home mom than I ever was. The laundry was done on a regular basis,'' she said.
 ''It's a stressful time for any marriage, but there is always a silver lining if you are open to finding it,'' said Ms. Roberts, 46.
 For the Horines, the silver lining is more family fun with their children. ''We take advantage of the fact that we do have a little extra time,'' Ms. Horine said. For Ms. Siever, ''If there's good news to share, he's right there,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Revenue Loss Putting Cities In Fiscal Vise

BYLINE: By DUNSTAN A. McNICHOL

 BODY:
UNTIL the economy collapsed last year, Berlin Borough had three school crossing guards on the payroll. Today the borough can afford only one.
 Hoboken, which expects its property tax revenue to fall this year, plans to lay off or demote dozens of police officers and firefighters, and trim the overall municipal work force by 10 percent, to balance a $75 million operating budget in a year of dwindling revenues. 
 And in Camden, two of the city's three ladder trucks are out of commission awaiting repairs, forcing the city to call in reinforcements from neighboring Collingswood so often that Collingswood is canceling its agreement to respond to calls in Camden.
 ''We can't afford to be doing anything like that,'' said Mayor Jim Maley of Collingswood, whose crews have been dispatched to Camden 40 times this year -- five times more than they were called in 2008. ''It's not what people in our town expect and deserve.'' 
 Throughout New Jersey's 566 local governments, the global economic crisis that has felled Wall Street icons and small countries is taking a toll at street level.
 ''I don't think there is any town that would not say they are in an economic crisis,'' said Susan Jacobucci, who is the chairwoman of the state's Local Finance Board, a post that in the last few weeks has given her a front-row seat on the woes of municipalities.
 Ms. Jacobucci's panel considers appeals from communities seeking to raise local taxes beyond the 4 percent maximum allowed by state law. Of 50 communities whose budget years end on July 30, 11 went before the panel this month seeking waivers. The hearings, held weekly, have provided a public glimpse into the desperate straits many cities find themselves in these days.
 Mayors across New Jersey are preparing to see revenues vanish through tax appeals meant to lower commercial and homeowners' payments, and the collapse of construction permit fees. Major land sales or concession agreements expected to generate millions of dollars in supplemental funds are being canceled by skittish developers. State aid is shrinking as income tax and other revenues decline. And in some towns, long-delayed union contracts are finally being resolved, prompting the need to cover months or years of retroactive pay increases in the midst of a revenue collapse.
 William G. Dressel Jr., executive director of the New Jersey State League of Municipalities, said circumstances in local government are the worst he has seen in his 35 years on the job.
 ''In municipal parlance, this is a train wreck,'' he said.
 In Weehawken, officials needed permission to raise taxes by $1.9 million more than the 4 percent cap would allow to avoid a 40 percent cut in municipal services before July 1. 
 Also, nine months into its budget year, Weehawken reached a contract settlement with its unions that requires $811,000 in retroactive salary payments. 
 With the increase approved by the Local Finance Board, the typical tax bill in Weehawken is scheduled to go up by $375. 
 In Gloucester Township in Camden County, a hiring freeze since 2007 means the police force totals 110 officers -- the same level that patrolled the township in 2004, when the township had 5,000 fewer residents. 
 Gloucester, with a budget of $45 million, illustrates in almost every way how the sinking economy is battering local governments.
 A developer recently canceled a signed agreement to buy a piece of municipal property, punching a $1.8 million hole in the local budget nine months into the fiscal year. 
 An arbitrator concluded two years of negotiation with the police union, granting retroactive pay increases of 3.5 percent annually that must be paid from the current budget.
 A special state aid payment of $500,000 was not renewed, and construction permit fees have dropped by $165,000.
 ''We have analyzed this budget over and over and over again,'' Thomas Cardis, Gloucester business administrator, said shortly before the Finance Board approved a tax increase that was $3.1 million more than the state's 4 percent limit would allow. ''We're running out of cash.''
 Taxes on the typical Gloucester home will increase by $240 this year, an increase of 10 percent from the year before.
 In other communities, the problem is tax appeals. As corporate landlords and new condominium owners survey the real estate market, thousands are petitioning for a cut in the property values on which their taxes are based.
 In Hoboken, 2,000 property owners in the trendy condominiums that have sprouted along the Hudson waterfront over the past two decades have appealed their property tax assessments this year, officials said. 
 Perth Amboy is facing more than 300 tax appeals, worth a total of $11 million. In a typical year, about 80 taxpayers challenge the assessments on their properties, said Jill Goldy, the city's chief financial officer.
 James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, said part of the reason the fiscal problems are hitting towns so hard is that many added to their work force during the boom years of the early 2000s, when municipal coffers were brimming. Since December 1999, he said, local governments and schools have increased their payrolls by 63,000 employees. Private employers, over the same period, have cut a total of 57,000 jobs since the new century began.
 ''If you're going to have a healthy public sector, you have to have a healthy private sector,'' he said. ''And that hasn't happened.'' 
 Cuts in state aid have also played a role.
 Ms. Jacobucci said Gov. Jon S. Corzine's decision to trim Extraordinary Municipal Aid by more than $10 million this year meant she had to adjust the level at which such aid was deemed to be needed.
 Last year, she said, the board tried to award towns enough so-called extraordinary aid to head off any local tax increase of more than $150 per household. This year, with less money to offer, the board could only offer aid to towns where the average tax bill was going to increase by at least $300, she said.
 Mr. Corzine said he tried to blunt the impact of the cuts by offering local governments the option of deferring half their required payments into the state pension system for public employees and the police and firefighters this year.
 About 70 communities had been approved for deferrals by the middle of last week.
 But those deferrals come with a price. The two pension systems that cover local government employees, the Public Employees Retirement System and the Police and Firemen's Retirement System, are underfinanced by a total of $11.4 billion, actuaries reported in April. Next spring, the payments due from local governments are scheduled to be almost 10 percent higher than the amount that was owed this year.
 That means the communities that skip half their pension payments this spring will have to find room in their coming budgets for the fully restored pension contribution as well as another 10 percent. Statewide, this year's $584 million pension contribution from local governments is scheduled to increase to $1.28 billion next year.
 ''Clearly, this is the start of a sustained, long-term crisis,'' Dr. Hughes said. ''The message is, 'Cheer up, the worst is yet to come.' ''
 The dire fiscal prospects have sparked a renewed interest in consolidation among New Jersey's 566 local governments.
 Princeton Borough and Princeton Township held a meeting last Monday to discuss for the third time the prospect of merging their local governments.
 Mr. Corzine, who has long said the state has too many governing bodies, welcomed talk of mergers.
 ''I'mvery encouraging of that,'' he said. ''If there's any light that comes out of this deep national recession it's that people have to take realistic views of things they would not otherwise consider at other times.''

HEADLINE: Investors Are Looking on the Bright Side

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The economy declined at a brisk pace in the first quarter and, by all accounts, it is still shrinking -- yet the stock market climbed last week, and in April it posted its best monthly returns since 1991. 
 The gross domestic product in the United States dropped at an annualized rate of 6.1 percent from January through March, marking the worst six months for the economy in 50 years.
 But the market evidently focused on signs that government rescue plans may be having their desired effect -- stabilizing the financial system and reducing the extent of the recession. And reports of the global spread of swine flu, the influenza A(H1N1), had scant effect on most markets.
 Caterpillar rose 10.8 percent for the best weekly performance among the Dow industrials. Citigroup lost 6.9 percent, putting it at the bottom of the heap.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 136.12 points, or 1.7 percent, to close at 8,212.41. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 11.29 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 877.52. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed to 3.15 percent from 2.99 percent.

AFRICA
 Altered States, Ordinary Miracles
 By Richard Dowden
 576 pp. PublicAffairs. $29.95
 Mention Africa in polite company, and those around you may grimace, shake their heads sadly and profess sympathy. Oh, all those wars! Those diseases! Those dictators!
 Naturally, that sympathy infuriates Africans themselves, for the conventional view of Africa as a genocide inside a failed state inside a dictatorship is, in fact, wrong. In the last few years, Africa over all has enjoyed economic growth rates of approximately 5 percent, better than in the United States (although population growth is also higher). Africa has even produced some ''tiger cub'' economies, like Botswana and Rwanda, that show what the continent is capable of. (A new Web site, See Africa Differently, specifically aims to present a more positive image of the continent.) 
 The bane of Africa is war, but the number of conflicts tearing apart the continent has dwindled. The murderous old buffoons like Idi Amin are gone, and we're steadily seeing the rise of highly skilled technocrats, who accept checks on their power and don't regard the treasury as their private piggy bank. The Rwandan cabinet room is far more high-tech than the White House cabinet room, and when you talk to new leaders like Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia you can't help wondering about investing your 401(k) in Liberian stocks.
 Richard Dowden's ''Africa: Altered States, Ordinary Miracles'' aims in part to correct the negative stereotypes. Dowden, a veteran British journalist who now heads the Royal African Society, has been bouncing around the continent since 1971 and covers a great deal of ground. Much of the text is travelogue that I found a yawn. But Dowden is at his best when looking at grand themes -- like the degree to which Africa is more promising than journalists or aid workers often acknowledge.
 ''The media's problem is that, by covering only disasters and wars, it gives us only that image of the continent,'' Dowden writes -- and 90 percent of the Africans reading this are now nodding at that line. ''Persistent images of starving children and men with guns have accumulated into our narrative of the continent.''
 ''The aid industry too has an interest in maintaining the image of Africans as hopeless victims of endless wars and persistent famines,'' Dowden continues. ''However well intentioned their motives may once have been, aid agencies have helped create the single, distressing image of Africa. They and journalists feed off each other.'' 
 In particular, Dowden lets loose at celebrities like Bob Geldof and politicians like Tony Blair with their ''messianic mission to save Africa.'' As Dowden writes: ''That set teeth on edge. It sounded like saving Africa from the Africans.''
 I've thought a good deal about these issues, partly because I'm often a purveyor of columns about war and disaster in Africa, from Darfur to Congo to AIDS in southern Africa. And frankly, it's discomfiting to feel that I'm helping Africa by exposing such catastrophes, and then have African leaders complain -- as they do -- that such reporting undermines their access to foreign investment and their ability to expand their economies and overcome poverty.
 My own take is that we in the news media and in the aid world can and should do a much better job providing context and acknowledging successes. Yet the problem surely isn't that the news media have overdone coverage of the disasters. Congo is the most lethal conflict since World War II, costing about five million lives since 1998, and it has dragged on partly because journalists haven't done a better job propelling it onto the international agenda. You'll never persuade me that we've overcovered the slaughter in Congo -- our sin is that we didn't scream enough, not that we screamed too much.
 I agree more with Dowden's point that Africans must be more central to the narrative. As he writes: ''Aid agencies, Western celebrities, rock stars and politicians cannot save Africa. Only Africans can develop Africa. Outsiders can help, but only if they understand it, work with it.'' It's true that the most successful and cost-effective interventions are typically not those started by a grand conference in a capital; rather, they are the grass-roots efforts started by local people with local knowledge addressing local needs. We could do much more to support such efforts, with us Westerners serving as aides and financiers to African social entrepreneurs.
 After discussing these themes in the opening of his book, Dowden takes us on a wearisome sight-seeing excursion through Somalia, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Burundi and Rwanda. But then the journey abruptly livens up when, hidden in a chapter on Senegal, there is a thoughtful discussion of why Africa is poor. Dowden chronicles the problems of colonialism and geography, but he also bluntly points the finger at wretched leadership. He quotes Jerry Rawlings, the former Ghanaian ruler, as acknowledging that outsiders were not to blame and adding, ''We broke the pot.''
 One of Africa's problems to this day is that there is very little manufacturing of the kind that is powering Asia's industrial revolution. The sweatshops of Asia look unpalatable to Westerners, but it's sometimes said that in a poor country the only thing worse than being exploited is not being exploited. Employment opportunities in Africa are meager and rarely involve wealth creation.
 ''Many African friends who tried to get a business enterprise going,'' Dowden writes, ''all reported the same problems: workers did not turn up on time, they had no urgency and they delivered sloppy work. Often they found themselves blocked by rivals. The elites who made money out of importing and exporting had an interest in preventing the development of local manufacturing or processing.''
 One of the best American aid programs is almost unknown but addresses this problem. It's called AGOA -- the African Growth and Opportunity Act -- and it offers duty-free import of African manufactured goods into America, to encourage the rise of a vibrant business sector in Africa.
 Dowden tends to be skeptical about the benefits of aid. ''It is significant that none of the most passionate advocates of aid for Africa are African,'' he says. He acknowledges that aid can help with vaccination programs and emergency relief and in some kinds of development but adds that ''aid from the outside cannot transform whole societies.'' This is also the argument of a controversial new book by an Oxford-educated Zambian, Dambisa Moyo, called Dead Aid: Why Aid Is Not Working and How There Is a Better Way for Africa (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $24).
 Dowden would like to see Western countries help in ways other than simply offering aid. Ending agricultural subsidies in the West, for example, would be a huge benefit to the many African farmers who have to compete. West African cotton farmers suffer not only from droughts, corruption and wretched roads, but also from America's cotton subsidies.
 I'm more sympathetic to aid (while acknowledging its myriad shortcomings) than Dowden is, but he's on target in most areas. In particular, I think his basic optimism is well founded, with the caveat that climate change may wreak particular havoc in Africa.
 We journalists tend to cover Africa in stark and simple contrasts, but countries live and grow and falter in grays. So it's refreshing to encounter not only Dowden's hopefulness, but also his reliance on shading and nuance, on the recognition that the world does not have to feel sorry for Africa to care about it.

HEADLINE: Communists' Land Plan Could Backfire in India

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA

DATELINE: NANDIGRAM, India 

 BODY:
Promising land to the landless, the Communists won Abdul Bakir Shah's heart decades ago. Under an ambitious land reform drive, Mr. Shah, a sharecropper all his life, got title to nearly one fertile acre. His village and others like it have voted Communist since, keeping the party in power for an uninterrupted 32 years here in West Bengal State. 
 But things went topsy-turvy two years ago. As Bengal belatedly joined India's slow but inexorable march to capitalism, the Communist-run state government sought to scoop up this entire cluster of mud-and-thatch hamlets to make way for the construction of a multinational chemical industrial complex. The Communists, under whose leadership factory after factory had been shuttered across this state, said it was time to bring private industry and jobs back to Bengal. 
 ''Reform or perish,'' became their rallying cry. 
 That is when the Communists lost Mr. Shah's trust. 
 ''We don't have any faith in them anymore,'' he said.
 Now, in the parliamentary elections under way, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) faces one of the toughest political fights of its long history. It is a party divided between the pull of industrial capitalism -- not unlike in China -- and its tradition of championing the rural poor. That struggle reflects much of the conflict that has bedeviled India in recent years, and bitter discord over land acquisition has broken out in many parts of the country.
 How the Communists perform here in their stronghold of West Bengal will, to a large extent, determine how much influence they have over the next government of India, and by extension, over the nation's economic and foreign policy. 
 Even though the Communists here are unabashedly capitalist, at the level of the central government they hew to more traditional ideology, blocking a slew of economic reforms and raising a ruckus over India's deepening friendship with the United States.
 In the past five years, controlling one in 10 seats in India's 543-member Parliament, they have been particularly influential. This time, they may not be, having been made vulnerable by the turn away from their old core principles. The fight for the hearts of men like Mr. Shah is at the heart of their challenge.
 ''Our basic constituency is the rural poor,'' insisted Mohammad Salim, a veteran member of Parliament in the party. ''Their thought processes were hijacked by a powerful coterie, by big noise.'' 
 Much of that ''big noise'' has come, on the one side, from the feisty political opposition leader, Mamata Banerjee, who has usurped the Communist Party rhetoric and cast herself as the savior of the rural poor. 
 On the other side, Maoist guerrillas have begun gaining ground, particularly among indigenous people in remote, destitute corners of the state. The other day, wielding bows and arrows, hundreds of them blocked traffic in the center of the state capital, Calcutta. 
 As Bengal's voters went to the polls on Thursday, suspected Maoists planted bombs, ambushed a car, killing three election workers and imposed a fairly successful boycott call in pockets of the state.
 Acquiring the land of folks who know no other life is difficult any way. But here in Bengal, the fury is even greater than elsewhere. The land is fertile and exceptionally crowded -- with an average of 904 people in each square kilometer -- and, as Mr. Salim acknowledged, all the more coveted by those who were landless for so long. 
 Ms. Banerjee has seized on that anxiety, and has succeeded in blocking several industrial projects that the Communists sought. 
 A factory to build the world's cheapest car, the Tata Nano, was forced to move out of the state. Plans for a nuclear power plant have been scrapped. The same has happened to the would-be chemical plant, which the state proposed relocating near the Sunderbans delta; that, too, has faced protests. A steel plant farther east is a target of Maoist attacks. 
 Ms. Banerjee, for her part, once aligned with the rightist Bharatiya Janata Party, has turned herself into a friend of the have-nots. ''You used to say, 'Long live Karl Marx,' '' she said of the Communists while on the campaign stump the other day. ''Now you say, 'Long live Tata, Karl Marx, you go.' '' 
 She promises reopening factories shuttered under the Communists. She pledges more money for those who lose land. She accuses the Communists of intimidating voters. Ms. Banerjee is often seen on television scuffling with the police at street protests. 
 ''Today they will take your vote, tomorrow they will take your land, the third day they will ask for your daughter, your son,'' she warned darkly. ''This fight is for your survival.''
 Her critics call her an opportunist. A Communist Party campaign billboard, in the center of Calcutta, shows a young man with a briefcase and his head hung low, and a slogan that blames Ms. Banerjee for driving jobs out of the state. 
 Another, a cartoon, shows a portly Ms. Banerjee, holding a begging bowl and placards that read: ''No Industry,'' ''No Progress,'' ''No Roads.'' 
 Each party accuses the other's cadres of murder and mayhem. Their campaign posters contain graphic images of maimed, charred bodies. 
 Part of the problem is that Bengal, after more than 30 years of leftist leadership, remains among the country's most destitute and dysfunctional states. It has one of the highest school drop-out rates. Nearly half the poor do not have access to public food subsidies, as they are supposed to. Land reform slowed to a crawl in the last decade. 
 In Nandigram, discontent had piled up against the government. It exploded over its bid for the land. In the spring of 2007, at the height of the troubles, at least 14 people died in clashes between Communist Party supporters and opponents. 
 A year later, Ms. Banerjee's Trinamool Congress Party swept the local village council elections for the first time in more than three decades. So tense does it remain that in one hamlet, a conversation with visiting journalists nearly brought supporters of the two rival parties to blows. 
 The people of Mr. Shah's hamlet were all once Communists. Now, the few Communist holdouts cluster together on one side of the main road. They say they are forbidden from the tea shop on the main road. They are afraid to vote. They seethe at Ms. Banerjee for having driven a potential factory from their area. 
 ''She just wants the poor to stay poor,'' said Zahidul Mullick, who guessed his age to be around 18. He said he dropped out of school after the fifth grade and worked as a tailor, as most of the men in the hamlet do. 
 ''Look, we are not educated,'' said Halima Begum, 22, balancing a baby on her hips. ''We couldn't work in the factory. But we could clean the houses of the people who come to work there.'' 
 Across the street, Mr. Shah said he was immediately suspicious of the proposed chemical complex. He was terrified of being displaced. For the first time in more than 30 years, he and his neighbors turned against the Communists. 
 ''They thought the party was so strong we would do whatever they say,'' said one of his neighbors, Atibul Shah, 22. 
 His family, he said, had voted Communist for three generations. This time, he had ridden the train for two days from Mumbai, where he works in a garment factory, for the chance to vote the Communists out.

HEADLINE: Helping Poor Indian Children

BYLINE: By RANDY COHEN

 BODY:
I'm going to India in a couple of weeks, and I'm troubled by the children who beg for money. Do I give them money or food or neither? If I give money, exploitative adults may take it. My family regularly contributes to Indian charities, but that is small consolation in these heartbreaking situations. What do I do? D.S., MINNESOTA
 Your desire to help a child in distress is commendable, whichever of those options you choose. The spectacle of a suffering child is so harrowing, our inability to relieve that suffering so demoralizing, that even experts differ about how best to respond. Martha Nussbaum, a professor of law and ethics at the University of Chicago who has devoted much work to third-world poverty, told me: ''My Indian activist friends have different views about giving anything to beggars. Some do it occasionally, some make a policy of not doing it.'' 
 It can be argued that giving money to beggars sustains a culture of begging and, in the most horrifying cases, motivates criminals to force children to beg and even to maim those children to make them more poignant and profitable beggars. But it is poverty itself, not ad hoc generosity, that perpetuates begging. The real, albeit daunting, solution is to lift these children -- these nations -- out of poverty. That is the approach Nussbaum herself takes, as your family does, by steadily contributing to organizations with the expertise and commitment to take on this challenge. ''I think that Unicef is probably the best choice,'' she says, ''since it has excellent programs in India.'' But there are many groups doing admirable work.
 update: D.S. has returned from India, where she responded ''on a case-by-case basis.'' She sometimes gave money to a child whose parents were present and seemed by their dress to be rural migrants, newly arrived in the city and struggling to find work. More often she gave food, particularly to children she feared might be exploited by adults who would steal her donated money.
 I was terminated by a major corporation for what they said was misconduct. Subsequently, two separate investigations by an outside agency cleared me, and I was awarded unemployment compensation. Need I disclose any of this to a prospective employer when I seek a new job? N.P., STUART, FLA. 
 You were not fired for misconduct, as two investigations confirmed, and so there is no ethical obligation to tell a prospective employer that you were (falsely) accused of such a thing. Similarly, you'd have no obligation to tell a prospective employer that you were falsely accused of a crime. What would you say at a job interview? ''Incidentally, I never robbed every casino on the Vegas strip on the same night. That wasn't me. It was George Clooney and Brad Pitt. And it wasn't actually them. It was just a movie. And I may be muddling the plot.'' An employer is entitled to know if you've engaged in actual wrongdoing that would disqualify you for a job, not to have an account of every lie told about you.
 But while ethics does not compel you to reaffirm your innocence, you should consider how you'll account for gaps in your resume or explain why you left that major corporation. You might prefer to mention the episode yourself rather than have to rebut an account from a disgruntled former employer.

HEADLINE: There's Hope In Those Dividends

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
FACED with the biggest credit crisis and longest profit recession in recent memory, businesses are fighting to conserve cash.
 Yet so far this year, 70 companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index have either started paying dividends or raised the cash payments they already make to their shareholders. That compares with 59 S.& P. 500 companies that have trimmed or eliminated dividends over the same period, according to S.& P.
 Companies that have managed to increase their payouts in this tough economic climate may be a good target for a time-tested conservative investment strategy: buying shares of solid dividend-payers. 
 Over the long run, this approach has outperformed the stock market. Since the end of 1979, investing in dividend-paying stocks in the S.& P. 500 would have earned you 11.6 percent a year, on average, on a total return basis, versus 10.5 percent for the overall index. And the ability to sustain dividends is often regarded as a sign of a solid company, even in the current environment.
 ''Dividends are a wonderful gauge for management's confidence in forward-looking profitability,'' said Robert D. Arnott, chairman of Research Affiliates, an investment consulting firm in Pasadena, Calif. That's because raising dividends is not an automatic decision. ''It takes a conscious, deliberate act,'' he said.
 Jeffrey N. Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial in Boston, pointed out that recent dividend increases haven't been concentrated only in defensive areas of the market, like health care and utilities, where one would expect generous payouts under any market conditions.
 Many of the increases, in fact, have come from economically sensitive areas, like the consumer discretionary, industrial and technology sectors. Among the companies that have recently raised or started payments are Coach, the retailer; Qualcomm, the wireless equipment maker; and Norfolk Southern, the railroad transportation company.
 ''I like the fact that it's showing up in cyclical sectors,'' said Mr. Kleintop, adding that this could be a sign that the economy might not be in as bad a shape as investors assumed earlier this year -- or that corporate executives were starting to see enough hopeful signs for a future recovery that they were willing to part with cash.
 At the very least, the positive ratio of dividend increases to cuts shows that ''there are pockets of the economy that are actually weathering this mess surprisingly well,'' Mr. Arnott said.
 Still, the statistics on dividends hardly suggest that the overall economy is strong. 
 Dividend increases usually outnumber cuts in the S.& P. 500, partly because, under normal economic conditions, only a handful of companies have to resort to pulling the plug on their payouts. In 2007, for example, there were only 12 decreases to 298 increases. Even last year -- a terrible one for the financial sector, which once supplied a huge percentage of corporate dividends -- there were 62 cuts to 241 increases. So this year's tally of 70 increases to 59 decreases looks pale by comparison. 
 What's more, when translated into dollars, the dividend cuts this year have swamped the increases, because many companies that lowered their payments eliminated them altogether. So far this year, the 70 dividend increases raised payouts by $5.1 billion, while the 59 cuts reduced payments by $45.1 billion, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S.& P. 
 ''The decreases are geometric in scale, while the increases are significantly less dramatic,'' Mr. Silverblatt said. 
 But Mr. Arnott said that this was to be expected. ''When you're cutting dividends, you don't want to trickle out the bad news -- you want to get it out there and get it done,'' he said.
 On the other hand, ''when you're raising dividends, you want to be cautious, because you want to leave yourself some operating cushion in case you're wrong,'' he said. ''And you want to leave yourself room for future additional hikes.''
 The real test is to come: Will the trend continue into the next quarter -- and will companies that raised their cash payments avoid having to reverse course if liquidity issues resurface? 
 Mr. Silverblatt cautions that the dividend outlook remains decidedly mixed. For example, he says it's worrisome that not even halfway into the year, the number of dividend cuts among S.& P. 500 companies rivals the 2008 total of 62. And on a dollar basis, the $45.1 billion in payment reductions just among companies that cut their dividends has already set a record for a full calendar year.
 This makes dividend investing tricky. Market strategists suggest spreading one's dividend bets across the broad market, rather than concentrating on just a handful of sectors. 
 Consider the experience of investors who recently focused their bets on dividend-paying financial stocks. At their peak in 2007, financial stocks accounted for around a third of all the dividend payments in the S.& P. 500. 
 But as the sector plummeted in the global financial meltdown, the dividends didn't cushion the blow. Instead, financial stock prices and dividend payments sank in unison. Today, financial stocks generate less than 10 percent of total S.& P. 500 dividends. 
 In addition to seeking greater diversification, investors might look to stocks that have consistently managed to raise their dividends over several years, rather than just gravitating toward stocks with the biggest cash payments. That's partly because companies that have the financial wherewithal to consistently raise dividends are likely to have strong cash flows and balance sheets.
 And the market often favors such companies. For example, Mr. Kleintop has found that the shares of companies that have increased their dividends this year were up 0.3 percent, on average, so far in 2009. By comparison, the shares of companies that cut their payments this year were off by 12.9 percent.

HEADLINE: Smarter GPS to Let Cellphones Point the Way on the Highway

BYLINE: By ROY FURCHGOTT

DATELINE: Las Vegas 

 BODY:
 LOOKING over the latest satellite navigation products at a wireless industry trade show here last month, you could almost hear dirt being shoveled onto the grave of the familiar portable GPS unit.
 It's not that sales of personal navigation devices have collapsed. On the contrary, some 8.4 million dash-top GPS units were sold in 2008, up from 5.9 million in 2007, according to the NPD Group, a market research firm. But if you listen to forecasters in the automotive and electronics industries and consider experiments like the Mobile Millennium Project in Berkeley, Calif., you may agree that its days are numbered.
 The problem is that the traditional GPS unit is a one-way device, receiving signals from satellites that enable it to calculate where you are, which the unit then uses to map a route to where you are going. In a connected world, though, that is not enough.
 The emerging generation of navigation devices have the ability to connect to the Internet and to one other. They communicate among themselves to give drivers up-to-the-minute traffic information; when one GPS gets bogged down in a traffic jam, it tells the others. They use the Internet to make sure that information traditionally filed under points of interest, including where restaurants are and what they serve, never goes out of date. 
 They tell not only where a gas station is, but how much its gas costs that day. They hold an address book with names and numbers of all your friends and business contacts. 
 And, in all likelihood, you already own one. It's called a cellphone.
 In recent years there has been a convergence between cellphones and the GPS units that drivers put on their car's dashboard or suction-cup to the windshield. That convergence was especially evident at the CTIA Wireless industry show here last month. Ostensibly a mobile phone trade show, the major GPS companies were there, as well as companies that sell map data and navigation software, much of which can turn a phone into a dash-top GPS clone.
 One of the main drawbacks of using a cellphone as a navigation device is the tiny display, though newer phones like the BlackBerry Storm and the iPhone have screens larger than 3 inches, about the same size as basic dash-top GPS. 
 The convergence of telephones and GPS units accelerated in July 2008, when a company called Dash Navigation introduced an Internet-connected dash-top GPS. Its Web connection, over a cellphone band, let owners find not just a static list of Mexican restaurants, but to search specifically for breakfast burritos and find them. It also offered real-time traffic reports based on information provided by Dash units in other cars. When a Dash-equipped vehicle encountered a slowdown, all the units in its network were alerted.
 But sales were slow and the quality of the traffic reporting, largely dependent on how many Dash units were in use, never reached its potential. Last November Dash announced it would stop making its dash-top units in favor of selling its system to ''other platforms.'' Read: cellphones.
 A Silicon Valley company, TeleNav, picked up the banner and offered a two-way dash-top device called the Shotgun, which sells for $300 including three months of service. But TeleNav is hedging its bets: it also sells a software version for the BlackBerry, among others, that is used with the AT&T Navigator service ($10 a month for unlimited use). GPS giant Garmin also sells a software version of its popular Nuvi unit for GPS-enabled cellphones. Install it and a phone performs exactly like a Nuvi GPS device, offering the same graphics and turn-by-turn directions. 
 TomTom introduced its first connected dash-top GPS for the United States, the Go 740 Live ($400 including three months of service), at the trade show. And the 800-pound gorilla of mobile phones, the Apple iPhone, will be able to give turn-by-turn directions by the summer.
 Perhaps the biggest hedge is being placed by Garmin, which is going into the cellphone business, producing two new phones in the first half of this year. ''It's their acknowledgment that their market is at a dead end,'' said Seth Wallis-Jones, a telecommunications analyst at Global Insight in London.
 Magellan, which does not have a connected GPS, argued that the markets for stand-alone dashtop navigation won't disappear overnight, noting that most people just want to get from point A to point B.
 Mike Wagner, senior manager of product marketing for Magellan, said that for those people, a stand-alone device is the best choice because the price is low and no subscription is required. He pointed to the failure of both Dash and Best Buy's Insignia units as evidence that people aren't ready to buy another subscription service. But he acknowledged that some sort of connected device is in Magellan's future.
 Meanwhile, Nokia, the world's largest phone maker, purchased one of the world's largest digital map makers, Navteq, in July 2008. Notably, TomTom bought the other, Tele Atlas, a month earlier.
 Nokia may have the solution to the problem that faced Dash, which is getting enough devices in service for the traffic reporting to pay off. Nokia already has millions of phones in people's hands; all it has to do is add software to turn them into two-way GPS probes. Which is exactly what it has done with the Mobile Millennium Project.
 After a pilot test of 100 cars in February 2008, the project has expanded the test; it now includes more than 3,000 volunteers with a goal of 10,000 users in the Bay area.
 When the Nokia reporting software is switched on by a volunteer in the project, the phone will send speed and position information anonymously to a central computer. The volunteers get as-it-happens traffic reports on their phones that are more timely and accurate than those available through current traffic reporting subscription services.
 If Nokia moves ahead with the project, every owner of a phone with a built-in GPS -- that includes many current models -- will have access to advanced traffic reporting with only the addition of a bit of software.
 But having a GPS unit installed in the car has some advantages over a phone-based GPS, namely, room for a big screen -- certainly bigger than you'd want to carry or suction cup to the windshield. There are also economic reasons carmarkers have little incentive to share the dashboard with others. Right now, car companies control what goes in the dashboard and reap the profits from those high-margin electronic options. For instance, the optional in-dash GPS for a BMW 335i is $2,100. Garmin's top-of-the-line Nuvi 885T GPS offers features that the BMW in-dash unit does not, but lists for $600. It is available online for even less.
 There are many ways that car companies might incorporate phones into the cars and not sacrifice the options money. ''They will make exclusive deals,'' said Kirk Parsons, a wireless industry analyst at J. D. Power & Associates. So if you wanted connectivity through the car, you'd have to buy the optional installed Nokia or LG phone package, he said. But who wants their choice of phone dictated by their car, or even worse, the reverse?
 Automakers are beginning to see past the immediate dollars. In less than a year Ford intends to have its Sync voice control system integrate various smartphones and their functions into a car, said Doug VanDagens, director of connected services for the Ford Motor Company.
 In essence, the company is preparing the dashboard for the traffic reporting phones Nokia will produce in the future. 
 Although that means giving up some of the profits that optional equipment can bring, it may be a better long-term policy. ''People will feel our cars are cool,'' Mr. VanDagens said. ''We will sell more cars because people will like our cars.''

HEADLINE: Closer Look At Sharing Town Services

BYLINE: By ABBY GRUEN

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS 

 BODY:
 FRED A. YANNANTUONO of Bronxville wants to understand why his Town of Eastchester property taxes are skyrocketing. That's why on April 25 he went to a tax-cut rally attended by 300 people outside the Westchester County government office building here on Martine Avenue.
 ''My Eastchester taxes went from $2,100 to $4,100 in the past two years,'' said Mr. Yannantuono, 60, who owns County Chair Party Rentals in Mount Vernon. He recently had to make major layoffs for the first time in 30 years, letting half of his 15 full-time permanent employees go. ''Business is bad for everyone, and there is real pressure,'' he said.
 In the face of increasingly angry taxpayers, public officials in Westchester are scrambling to shrink their budgets. The financial crisis has given new urgency to a municipal consolidation movement that has sputtered in the county since the 1970s. 
 Some municipalities are considering their own elimination or merging with others, and many more towns and villages are considering sharing services more widely. Westchester has an abundance of governments and taxing agencies, including 6 cities, 17 towns, 22 villages, 42 local police departments, 46 school districts and 54 fire departments. 
 ''I think we are at a tipping point right now about consolidation,'' said Lorraine A. Cortes-Vazquez, New York's secretary of state, who gave out $22.5 million in local-government efficiency grants to municipalities last year. ''I think we are going to see people explore consolidation more on health benefits, police departments, dispatch systems and schools.''
 Gov. David A. Paterson, who has pledged to fight property tax increases, has kept pressure on municipalities to find ways to save money. Last year a state commission recommended that New York's 5,000 local governments share services on a countywide or regional basis and also consider merging. 
 Many contiguous towns in Westchester already cooperate on public works like garbage pickup, but now the Town of Eastchester and the Villages of Bronxville and Tuckahoe are joining forces on highway material purchasing, road repair and sewage maintenance equipment. The Town of Ossining and the Villages of Ossining and Briarcliff Manor are also sharing more public works expenses and have applied for a state grant to study sharing police services. 
 For decades, proposals to merge police and fire departments in Westchester have faced opposition from taxpayers who prefer community-based services and unions that want to protect jobs. Experts say those attitudes have begun to shift because of the magnitude of the recession. 
 ''With the economy in crisis and more people out of jobs and trying to reduce their cost of living, taxes have become the big issue,'' said Michael A. Genito, executive director of the Michaelian Institute for Public Policy and Management, which provides research and training on governance issues at Pace University in White Plains. 
 Gladys Mandujano, a homemaker in Port Chester, said property taxes were driving her and her husband, Julio Olivera, a factory worker, from their home. ''When I bought my house 10 years ago, I paid $6,000 in taxes; now I pay $12,000,'' said Ms. Mandujano, 46, who wore a tea bag pinned to her shirt at the anti-tax rally. ''We can't do it anymore. As soon as the housing market gets better, we're moving.''
 Mr. Genito said that for the first time in his 25 years of experience, there was serious consideration of sharing services and consolidation, not just by elected officials, but also by residents and municipal employees. He said he had recently completed a study of merging fire districts where the firefighter unions said they would consider consolidation.
 In Greenburgh, the largest town in Westchester, with six villages and an unincorporated area, there are three independent fire districts, each with its own board. Past efforts to consolidate fire services faced a lot of resistance, said Paul J. Feiner, town supervisor, who last proposed a merger 18 years ago.
 The districts' longtime chiefs are closer to retirement, improving the chances for consolidation, Mr. Feiner said. And the template for sharing services exists, he said, because a mutual aid call goes out for each fire call.
 Police operations are also under review by the Village of Dobbs Ferry and the Town of Greenburgh, which received a $75,000 state efficiency grant this year to study shared police services and possible consolidation. Greenburgh's police force has 116 officers; Dobbs Ferry's has 28.
 Not everyone favors merging the departments. Dobbs Ferry's Police Benevolent Association, a union group, opposes consolidation or elimination of the Dobbs Ferry department because the village benefits from having members of the community on the force, said Andrew Quinn, a lawyer for the union. But the police are not opposed to sharing services, he said.
 In the Town of Yorktown, Supervisor Don S. Peters announced in April that the police force was looking into consolidating with the county's Department of Public Safety. Yorktown has a 58-member force with an annual budget of $9 million. When the Town of Cortlandt consolidated its force with the county's 10 years ago, it lowered its police costs by 40 percent. 
 Mark Muro, a fellow and policy director at the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said that Westchester towns would benefit most from collaborating on a county or regional level. 
 ''More and more of the challenges that communities face are on a regional scale,'' Mr. Muro said. ''Local municipalities are simply too small to provide responses to the kind of issues that are bedeviling communities. Your village cannot shape traffic patterns.''
 Westchester government is actively promoting countywide collaboration and is sponsoring a conference on shared services on June 2 for local governments, schools and special districts.
 In an effort to eliminate taxes in the Town of Rye, Supervisor Joseph E. Carvin has proposed that the town consider dissolving.
 The Town of Rye, which includes the Villages of Port Chester and Rye Brook and a section of the Village of Rye Neck, administers property taxes and assessments and oversees two parks. It has 10 employees and had a $3.3 million budget last year. The average household pays $50 to $75 a year in property taxes for the town to perform these mostly administrative functions. 
 ''I don't think there will be any resistance to eliminating the town,'' said Mr. Carvin, a hedge fund manager. The town is applying for an efficiency grant to study merging some or all services with the villages within its borders, he said.
 Recently the Town of Mamaroneck took over the Village of Mamaroneck's Section 8 housing program and the senior centers serving the Town of Mamaroneck and the Villages of Mamaroneck and Larchmont, saving taxpayers $270,000 annually, said Valerie M. O'Keeffe, the town supervisor. By combining resources, both the senior center and the Section 8 program have been able to expand services, she said.
 ''I am very open to consolidating services,'' said Mrs. O'Keeffe, who is up for re-election this year. ''But I am reticent to breathe down the necks of people who live in villages that originally broke off from the town to develop their own unique ability to govern themselves.''

HEADLINE: Kindergarten Cram

BYLINE: By PEGGY ORENSTEIN

 BODY:
About a year ago, I made the circuit of kindergartens in my town. At each stop, after the pitch by the principal and the obligatory exhibit of art projects only a mother (the student's own) could love, I asked the same question: ''What is your policy on homework?''
 And always, whether from the apple-cheeked teacher in the public school or the earnest administrator of the ''child centered'' private one, I was met with an eager nod. Oh, yes, each would explain: kindergartners are assigned homework every day. 
 Bzzzzzzt. Wrong answer.
 When I was a child, in the increasingly olden days, kindergarten was a place to play. We danced the hokeypokey, swooned in suspense over Duck, Duck, Gray Duck (that's what Minnesotans stubbornly call Duck, Duck, Goose) and napped on our mats until the Wake-Up Fairy set us free.
 No more. Instead of digging in sandboxes, today's kindergartners prepare for a life of multiple-choice boxes by plowing through standardized tests with cuddly names like Dibels (pronounced ''dibbles''), a series of early-literacy measures administered to millions of kids; or toiling over reading curricula like Open Court -- which features assessments every six weeks. 
 According to ''Crisis in the Kindergarten,'' a report recently released by the Alliance for Childhood, a nonprofit research and advocacy group, all that testing is wasted: it neither predicts nor improves young children's educational outcomes. More disturbing, along with other academic demands, like assigning homework to 5-year-olds, it is crowding out the one thing that truly is vital to their future success: play.
 A survey of 254 teachers in New York and Los Angeles the group commissioned found that kindergartners spent two to three hours a day being instructed and tested in reading and math. They spent less than 30 minutes playing. ''Play at age 5 is of great importance not just to intellectual but emotional, psychological social and spiritual development,'' says Edward Miller, the report's co-author. Play -- especially the let's-pretend, dramatic sort -- is how kids develop higher-level thinking, hone their language and social skills, cultivate empathy. It also reduces stress, and that's a word that should not have to be used in the same sentence as ''kindergartner'' in the first place.
 I came late to motherhood, so I had plenty of time to ponder friends' mania for souped-up childhood learning. How was it that the same couples who piously proclaimed that 31/2-year-old Junior was not ''developmentally ready'' to use the potty were drilling him on flashcards? What was the rush? Did that better prepare kids to learn? How did 5 become the new 7, anyway?
 There's no single reason. The No Child Left Behind Act, with its insistence that what cannot be quantified cannot be improved, plays a role. But so do parents who want to build a better child. There is also what marketers refer to as KGOY -- Kids Getting Older Younger -- their explanation for why 3-year-olds now play with toys that were initially intended for middle-schoolers. (Since adults are staying younger older -- 50 is the new 30! -- our children may soon surpass us in age.)
 Regardless of the cause, Miller says, accelerating kindergarten is unnecessary: any early advantage fades by fourth grade. ''It makes a parent proud to see a child learn to read at age 4, but in terms of what's really best for the kid, it makes no difference.'' For at-risk kids, pushing too soon may backfire. The longitudinal High/Scope Preschool Curriculum Comparison Study followed 68 such children, who were divided between instruction- and play-based classrooms. While everyone's I.Q. scores initially rose, by age 15, the former group's academic achievement plummeted. They were more likely to exhibit emotional problems and spent more time in special education. ''Drill and kill,'' indeed.
 Thinkers like Daniel Pink have proposed that this country's continued viability hinges on what is known as the ''imagination economy'': qualities like versatility, creativity, vision -- and playfulness -- that cannot be outsourced. It's a compelling argument to apply here, though a bit disheartening too: must we append the word ''economy'' to everything to legitimize it? Isn't cultivating imagination an inherent good? I would hate to see children's creativity subject to the same parental anxiety that has stoked the sales of Baby Einstein DVDs.
 Jean Piaget famously referred to ''the American question,'' which arose when he lectured in this country: how, his audiences wanted to know, could a child's development be sped up? The better question may be: Why are we so hellbent on doing so? 
 Maybe the current economic retrenchment will trigger a new perspective on early education, something similar to the movement toward local, sustainable, organic food. Call it Slow Schools. After all, part of what got us into this mess was valuing achievement, speed and results over ethics, thoughtfulness and responsibility. Then again, parents may glean the opposite lesson, believing their kids need to be pushed even harder in order to stay competitive in a shrinking job market. 
 I wonder how far I'm willing to go in my commitment to the cause: would I embrace the example of Finland -- whose students consistently come out on top in international assessments -- and delay formal reading instruction until age 7? Could I stick with that position when other second graders were gobbling up ''War and Peace'' -- or at least the third Harry Potter book? 
 In the end, the school I found for my daughter holds off on homework until fourth grade. (Though a flotilla of research shows homework confers no benefit -- enhancing neither retention nor study habits -- until middle school.) It's a start. A few days ago, though, I caught her concocting a pretend math worksheet. ''All the other kids have homework,'' she complained with a sigh. ''I wish I could have some, too.''

HEADLINE: The Honor of Your Cash Is Requested

BYLINE: By SARAH MASLIN NIR

 BODY:
WHEN times were good, Daniel Marks could make $1,700 a week at his job selling luxury men's wear. But starting in January, not even his brightest smile could sell a French cuff. That month, consumers spent $68 million less on men's clothing than they had a year earlier, according to the Department of Commerce. 
 Mr. Marks's income is based on commissions, so when his weekly take fell to $325 last month, he couldn't afford the $850 he pays for his third of a 1,700-square-foot apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. 
 ''I had struggled when I was younger,'' said Mr. Marks, 29. ''But after several years of relative prosperity you forget how to do that.'' 
 A history buff, Mr. Marks had read about rent parties in Harlem in the first half of the 20th century, and the idea appealed to him. ''The climate's right for it right now,'' he said. 
 So on March 14, he gave his first rent party, serving potato chips and Georgi vodka from plastic jugs -- and charged $12 a head. Mr. Marks cast a wide net for guests through Facebook, inviting 200 people, from close friends to some he had not seen for years. The invitation featured a vintage poster from a 1946 film called ''House-Rent Party'' and made plain Mr. Marks's situation. The 40 guests who turned up paid willingly, Mr. Marks said, for several reasons.
 On a pragmatic level, ounce for ounce, house parties cost revelers less than an evening spent in a bar. ''Even during happy hour that's what, two drinks?'' said Christina Dunham, 27, a guest who was laid off from Morgan Stanley in February. ''You may as well spend it with your friends who can use the help.'' 
 Having a cause made it more appealing, not less, she said. ''It's not just scenesters looking for the next big underground party,'' Ms. Dunham said, ''It's people who care that you have a place to live.'' 
 Mr. Marks made $400 that night. Until things pick up, he plans to hold events monthly and hopes he can find enough people willing to pay. ''I don't think I've tapped out my friends,'' he said, ''but I did have a few people say that they couldn't afford my party. They were having trouble paying their own bills.'' 
 The rent party's genesis was in Harlem during the early 1920s, said Cary D. Wintz, the author of ''Harlem Speaks: A Living History of the Harlem Renaissance.'' As blacks immigrated to the city from the South, they moved into Harlem's formerly white, middle-class brownstones, which had been divided into apartments. Landlords charged high rents and managed to get them because racial segregation meant black tenants had few other options. 
 ''It was a cheap way to help a friend in need,'' said Frank Byrd, who in 1938 lived on West 135th Street and tells his story in Works Projects Administration documents now held by the Library of Congress. ''It was such a good, easy way out of one's difficulties that others decided to make use of it.'' 
 Now as then, it looks like a way out for creative renters in the region. 
 But not just anyone can organize a successful rent party, said Rob Alicea, 25, an aspiring actor who turned to the rent party because he had lost his bartending job. According to Mr. Alicea, it takes a certain type of personality to inspire friends to pay for events they once attended free. Mr. Alicea, who channels Joey Tribbiani from the sitcom ''Friends,'' is in the clear.
 ''I've got ample charm,'' he said. ''My ample charm gets me out of situations more than anything.''
 On Feb. 28, Mr. Alicea sponsored ''Rob's Help Me Make My Rent Recession Extravaganza'' at his apartment in Astoria, Queens. For a suggested admission of $5 to $10, guests got only the pleasure of the host's company; the party was B.Y.O.B. ''I can't afford to buy booze,'' he said. 
 ''It wasn't a give-and-take thing,'' said Kristy Parda, 28, a childhood friend of Mr. Alicea's. Ms. Parda gave more than any other guest -- $40 -- as well as a case of Corona. ''I didn't go there with any expectations to get something in return,'' she said, ''but to give him whatever he needed.''
 After losing his job in November, Mr. Alicea needed three months to land a job at another bar, during which time his $600-a-month rent and payments for $4,000 in college loans cleaned out his savings. ''I remember sitting in my kitchen barely being able to afford to eat, eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches like every day because I couldn't afford to buy anything,'' he said. Only pride kept him from moving back home with his parents. The tag line on the invitation to the ''extravaganza'' -- ''because if I can't pay, on your couch I'll stay'' -- is close to coming true. 
 Customers now are spending and tipping less, he says, and as a result he cannot afford to cover his living costs and his student loans. Though he couldn't provide alcohol, Mr. Alicea offered some bait. ''I'm friends with lots of models,'' he said. ''For the guys, to come to my party to hang out with really hot chicks, and for the girls, to get to watch my guy friends drool over them.'' 
 By the end of the night Mr. Alicea was $240 closer to paying his rent.
 Not everyone, of course, is willing to pay to go to a party. On a Saturday night in a basement in New Brunswick, N.J., a young blond woman sullenly refused to cough up the requisite $6 for the rock show that was about to begin. She seemed caught off guard by the fact that this house party had a cover charge. 
 ''So leave,'' said the organizer, Daniel Pelic, 25. She did.
 Mr. Pelic doesn't waste time with freeloaders. Without paying customers at his parties, he can't make his rent. 
 In New Jersey, in Mr. Pelic's basement-cum-subterranean concert hall, guests huddle around a singer contorting in musical fervor. They were tattooed, pierced and clad in black sweatshirts almost without exception; their hooded heads nearly grazed the low ceiling of exposed insulation, copper pipes and a lone bra nailed to a rafter.
 Mr. Pelic has been holding these bimonthly parties for two years, and has always charged $6 a person. Until recently, however, he never took a cut for the rent. The proceeds went to cover damage to the house or to pay the bands, or for charity. Now he takes 25 percent.
 Last May, Mr. Pelic learned he had Crohn's disease, which is costing him $400 a month or more for drugs and vitamins. Recently, he was laid off from his job delivering medical supplies. ''The shows now are uber-vital to my very meager existence,'' he said. 
 In some cases, people hold the parties for others. Shaheed Muhammad, 41, is a concert lighting designer for musicians like 50 Cent. When a colleague confided that she had 72 hours until she was evicted, Mr. Muhammad worked connections. The hip-hop stars Q-Tip and DJ Scratch commandeered a velvet-roped-off corner of Santos Party House, a club in Manhattan, and Mr. Muhammad's three sisters cooked a feast of Southern comfort food. The centerpiece was a white box with a large red bow. There were fewer than a dozen guests, but the box was soon full of cash. Even some who were not present pledged donations. By the time the last chicken drumstick was polished off, they had raised $2,300. 
 Though he is thinking about TV spinoffs or a club where membership dues would secure a sort of party-based insurance against eviction, Mr. Muhammad, who also faces eviction, has yet to give himself a rent party. ''It would be a humbling experience,'' he said. ''These are people who've known you for 20 years, working, making money and driving cars. It kind of makes them look at it like, 'I'm next, I'm close.' ''

HEADLINE: The Fictional Advance

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Michael Meyer's essay ''About That Advance . . .'' (April 12) discusses fiction publishing in terms that hardly ever apply in reality, or that are more relevant to the publishing of nonfiction. While advance payment is the rule for memoirs or informational books, only the minutest fraction of published fiction writers command up-front cash for work still unfinished. 
 The wildly lucky Audrey Niffenegger and her ilk notwithstanding, most fiction writers -- even those with one or more novels to their credit -- must labor, often for years, sans payment. What's more, in our increasingly doctrinaire publishing climate, even the finest among them labor sans any guarantees of eventual publication or income; one could argue -- and demonstrate persuasively -- that the greater number of literature's real practitioners (those who have not let cynicism and status anxiety eat away their gifts) work under such conditions. Laboring slowly, unhonored and unpaid and bound toward an immaterial prize far more meaningful than ''success'' as New York parlance would have it, these writers have destiny for incentive -- and perhaps the exemplars of bygone literary gods for inspiration. Unsung, they sing, and reap rewards that more than mitigate the annoyances of obscurity. Quietly, faithfully, their late-paid, ill-paid or altogether unpaid works go into the world untrumpeted, unreviewed and unbought, to give the lie to the fallacy denounced by Annie Dillard a quarter-century ago: ''that the novelists of whom we have heard are the novelists we have.''
 Rather than discuss contemporary literature or even contemporary publishing, Meyer's article does little more than survey the New York Cult of Success. The art of language and story lives elsewhere, sustained by the unwavering economics of the spirit.

HEADLINE: How Lehman Got Its Real Estate Fix

BYLINE: By DEVIN LEONARD

 BODY:
BACK when he was a major Wall Street deal maker, Mark A. Walsh, the former head of the global real estate group at Lehman Brothers, had a running joke with Carmine Visone, one of his managing directors. Mr. Visone, 10 years older than his boss, would lecture Mr. Walsh about the importance of fundamentals: land values, construction cost and rents. 
 As Mr. Visone remembers it, Mr. Walsh would wave his hand dismissively and would argue just as emphatically that the best way to make office buildings spew cash was through the magic of financial engineering. Typically, Mr. Visone gave in. 
 ''He was too smart for me,'' Mr. Visone recalls. 
 Many others were equally in awe of Mr. Walsh's intellect. Until Lehman Brothers collapsed last September, Mr. Walsh was considered the most brilliant real estate financier on Wall Street. In the '90s, he pioneered the art of lending to office building developers and then slicing up and repackaging the debt for investors. Less risky pieces went to institutional investors; the lower-rated chunks to hedge funds and others hungry for juicier returns. Lehman pocketed a fee every step of the way, and it often retained a risky piece or two to give its own earnings a kick.
 ''That was one of Lehman's strengths,'' says Brad Hintz, a former chief financial officer at Lehman who is now an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. ''In fact, a lot of Wall Street firms tried to duplicate Lehman's commercial real estate strategy.''
 Mr. Walsh, who wore rumpled Brooks Brothers suits and could be painfully awkward in front of crowds, was one of Lehman's biggest profit producers. Former Lehman executives say Richard S. Fuld Jr., the bank's chief, relied on Mr. Walsh to bankroll the firm's swanlike transformation from a second-tier bond trading shop into a full-service investment bank. Former members of his unit, who requested anonymity because they were concerned about being swept up in lawsuits and investigations surrounding Lehman's collapse, say it generated more than 20 percent of Lehman's $4 billion in profits at the peak of the real estate boom in 2006. 
 Many factors, of course, contributed to Lehman's demise last fall. Near the end, it carried $25 billion in toxic residential mortgages. It was wildly overleveraged. And the federal government made the fateful decision not to rescue Lehman from its mistakes. But when real estate overheated in the years before Lehman's implosion, Mr. Walsh made billions of dollars in loans and equity investments that also ultimately helped bring down the bank. 
 Lehman's bankruptcy hasn't quelled the controversy about Mr. Walsh's activities. Last fall, the United States attorney's office in Manhattan subpoenaed him and other former Lehman executives as part of an investigation into whether the firm improperly valued its commercial real estate holdings, among other things. In March in a civil complaint, Anne Milgram, the New Jersey attorney general, accused Mr. Walsh and 17 other former Lehman officials of defrauding the state's pension funds by misrepresenting Lehman's real estate exposure.
 Mr. Walsh, 49, declined to be interviewed for this article.
 His former co-workers and clients remain staunchly loyal. ''I have the greatest respect for him personally and professionally,'' says Richard S. Ziman, the former C.E.O. of Arden Realty, a company based in Los Angeles that Mr. Walsh helped take public in 1996 and sell in 2006. ''I'd testify in court if that was necessary.''
 But even among Mr. Walsh's supporters, a nagging question remains: How could a real estate wizard who built a thriving business by creating new ways of managing risk by sweeping loans off Lehman's balance sheet end up doing deals that contradicted everything he seemed to stand for -- and contribute to the collapse of one of Wall Street's most venerable firms? 
 MR. WALSH grew up in Yonkers, the son of a lawyer who once served as chairman of the New York City Housing Authority. He attended Iona Preparatory School in New Rochelle; the College of the Holy Cross, where he majored in economics; and, finally, the Fordham University School of Law. 
 After receiving his law degree in 1984, he worked as a real estate lawyer in Miami and handled a lot of foreclosures. That came in handy when he took a job at Lehman in 1988, at the end of an earlier real estate boom that left banks and insurers saddled with mountains of bad loans. 
 Mr. Walsh bought and sold loans on properties that were often in foreclosure. There were bargains galore. He generated hundreds of millions of profits for the firm and won the confidence of Mr. Fuld, who gave him the authority to make huge loans. Then, along with Ethan Penner of Nomura Securities and Andrew D. Stone of Credit Suisse First Boston, Mr. Walsh discovered securitization. This created an entirely new market for commercial real estate debt. No longer would lenders have to shoulder all the risk from real estate lending. Wall Street could make the same loans and sell them off. The challenge then became lassoing the right kind of developers to back. 
 The three men marketed their services very differently. Mr. Penner hired Bob Dylan, Stevie Nicks and the Eagles to serenade clients, while Mr. Stone jetted around the country with the likes of Donald Trump. The publicity-shy Mr. Walsh was more understated. Mr. Ziman says Mr. Walsh went fly-fishing with clients in Colorado and Montana. 
 Developers also loved the fact that Mr. Walsh was willing to lend them enormous sums. In 1997, Barry Sternlicht, then the chief executive of Starwood Hotels and Resorts, needed $7 billion to buy ITT. 
 ''I called up Mark and Goldman Sachs and said, 'Would you be interested?' '' he recalls. ''Goldman said they were. They came to see us. But we needed to get it done really quickly. Mark said, 'Yeah, we'll do it.' I said, 'Really? You are going to do it yourselves?' He said, 'Yup.' '' 
 Mr. Sternlicht says Mr. Walsh brought Mr. Fuld himself to a meeting at the hotelier's home to assure him that Lehman would back his acquisition. ''Dick Fuld sat there in my living room and said: 'You have our word. We'll get this done,' '' Mr. Sternlicht recalls. ''We paid a $20 million fee. I was never so happy paying a fee.'' Mr. Fuld declined to be interviewed for this article.
 During the late '90s, Mr. Walsh forged close ties with many of the most prominent developers in New York. He bankrolled Tishman Speyer in its purchase of the Chrysler Building in 1997. He backed Steven C. Witkoff in his purchase of the Woolworth Building in 1998. And he financed the acquisitions by the German real estate developers Aby Rosen and Michael Fuchs of the landmark Lever House and Seagram Building. 
 Mr. Rosen recalls that he and Mr. Walsh closed the $375 million Seagram Building deal in four weeks. ''He was fast,'' says Mr. Rosen. ''He doesn't try to kill you or retrade. To be honest, there are very few people in the industry you can say that about.''
 Mr. Walsh was also skilled at making all that debt vanish from Lehman's balance sheet before the firm choked on it. On the eve of the financial crisis brought by the near collapse of Long Term Capital Management in 1998, Lehman flushed $3.6 billion in commercial real estate loans through its securitization machine, avoiding some of the losses that crippled other firms, including Nomura and Credit Suisse.
 Mr. Walsh was rewarded with more responsibility, and in 2000 was named co-head of a new private equity group dedicated to real estate investments. After raising $1.6 billion from pension funds and university endowments and delivering an internal rate of return of more than 30 percent, the equity franchise easily raised $2.4 billion for a second fund, which closed in 2005. While the market was heating up and low-priced deals were harder to find, the second fund still generated a 15 percent return. 
 But the funds' structure created perverse incentives within Mr. Walsh's group, according to two former members of his team who requested anonymity because of confidentiality agreements they had signed with Lehman.
 Lehman owned 20 percent of the funds. Institutions and wealthy investors controlled the rest. Mr. Walsh, in order to raise money, promised to give the outsiders a first peek at deals. 
 If institutional investors and others passed, Mr. Walsh's bankers were free to make the same investments with the firm's money -- which was just fine with his troops: they received bigger bonuses on the riskier deals because Lehman didn't have to share the profits. 
 But it also meant that more deals that could go wrong ended up on Lehman's balance sheet. And this is exactly what happened with a set of deals known as ''bridge equity'' financings. 
 As real estate went into overdrive in 2003, Mr. Walsh, in order to help clients pump up their offers in heated bidding wars, started frequently putting Lehman's own cash into deals -- alongside the debt they raised. With its cash on the line, Lehman would be dangerously exposed in any downturn, so, once a deal closed, the firm would try to sell its equity stake as quickly as possible.
 Lehman made ripe 4 percent fees for its equity investments -- twice the going rate for loan securitization. As long as the market was rising, Mr. Walsh's group was fine. But if the bank couldn't sell the bridge equity and if real estate prices fell, it could end up with nothing. 
 ''It was a classic assumption that values are going to be higher a year from now,'' says Mike Kirby, chairman of Green Street Advisors, a research firm. ''That was the mentality at the time.''
 Bridge equity quickly became one of Lehman's signature products, and Mr. Walsh's group deployed it in dozens of deals, including Tishman Speyer's $1.7 billion purchase of the MetLife Building on Park Avenue in 2005 and Beacon Capital Partners' acquisition of the News Corporation's headquarters on the Avenue of the Americas for more than $1.5 billion in 2006. 
 ''Guys like Tishman Speyer wanted as much of this product as they could get,'' says a former real estate banker at a competing Wall Street firm, who requested anonymity because of confidentially agreements he had signed with the bank. ''For them, it was a no-brainer. It was like, 'Bring as much of this on as possible.' '' 
 By all accounts, Mr. Walsh made piles of money. He had perks like a corner office over Park Avenue with a private conference room. Yet his ego never matched the size of his deals. Friends say Mr. Walsh lived in a modest home in Rye, N.Y., with his wife, Lisa, and their three boys. His main interest outside of work and family was fishing. 
 ''At the end of the day, he is content to throw a line in the water and fish by himself,'' says his friend Dan McNulty, co-chairman of DTZ Rockwood, a real estate investment bank in New York. ''He's a very reflective guy.'' 
 IF Lehman and Mr. Walsh were convinced about the virtues of bridge equity, outside investors weren't. ''It was a gray area,'' says a former Lehman executive who asked not to be identified because of his confidentiality agreements with the firm. ''It wasn't the kind of risk that the investors had signed up for. The funds never participated in those deals.''
 One partnership pursued by Mr. Walsh exemplified his newfound appetite for ever riskier deals: transactions with the SunCal Companies of Irvine, Calif., an operation with an intriguing business model. It bought land, primarily in its home state, and sought government approval for residential development. If it got the green light, it sold the land to builders for an enormous profit. Mr. Walsh lent SunCal more than $2 billion and formed a close relationship with its founder, Boris Elieff. Mr. Elieff did not return calls seeking comment.
 ''We had other Goldman Sachs and other people who were clamoring to do business with us,'' says Louis Miller, a lawyer for SunCal. ''Lehman said, 'No, we want to you to be exclusive with us.' They loved SunCal.''
 But because the cash flow from the SunCal deals was hard to predict, Lehman's loans to the company were nearly impossible to syndicate. After all, how do you estimate income from raw land that may or may not be approved for development?
 After putting about $140 million from the funds into SunCal deals, Mr. Walsh discovered that the investors wanted out. In 2006, he cashed them out with a tidy profit in exchange for effectively transferring their ownership stake onto Lehman's balance sheet. That left Lehman with even more SunCal exposure, just before the emergence of the subprime crisis that would pummel the Southern California real estate market.
 Others were already sensing danger, and some of Mr. Walsh's longtime clients started to pull back. Mr. Ziman of Arden Realty sold his company to GE Capital in 2006. He said the real estate market -- and, indeed, the entire financial system behind it -- was becoming increasingly bizarre.
 ''Every Monday, I'd get these e-mails from all the investment banks about the deals of the week,'' Mr. Ziman recalls. ''I kept saying, 'Where is all this money coming from?' ''
 Lehman wasn't the only bank throwing bridge equity into real estate. In October 2006, Wachovia and Merrill Lynch pledged $1.5 billion for Tishman Speyer's $5.4 billion acquisition of Stuyvesant Town, the huge apartment complex in Manhattan. In February, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns put up $3.5 billion into the Blackstone Group's $32 billion deal to buy Equity Office Properties Trust.
 Missing out on the Stuyvesant Town deal stung Lehman, said one of the firm's bankers who declined to be identified because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly about his time at Lehman. It wasn't just the lost fees. Mr. Walsh considered Tishman Speyer a core client. What's more, Tishman Speyer's chairman, Jerry Speyer, had a close relationship with Mr. Fuld. They were both board members of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; Mr. Speyer and Mr. Fuld's wife, Kathleen, were trustees of the Museum of Modern Art.
 And it wasn't long before Mr. Walsh found a way to do an even bigger deal with Mr. Speyer's company. In May 2007, Lehman and Tishman Speyer offered to buy Archstone-Smith Trust, a $22 billion deal struck at the peak of an already dangerously frothy market. Tishman Speyer put up a mere $250 million of its own equity. Lehman, in a 50-50 partnership with Bank of America, put up $17.1 billion of debt and $4.6 billion in bridge equity financing.
 As the credit crisis began to set in during the following summer, the financing for the Archstone deal appeared imperiled. With the markets spiraling downward, rumors were rife that Lehman was having problems and that it might walk away from the Archstone transaction. 
 Mr. Speyer phoned Mr. Fuld to make sure that he still had Lehman's backing. ''When I placed that call, I knew it was preposterous,'' Mr. Speyer recalled in an interview with The New York Times in 2007. ''I placed it because I had to. But I knew when I was dialing how the conversation would come out.''
 Lehman stuck by Mr. Speyer, and the deal was completed in October 2007. Had Lehman walked away, the partners would have absorbed a $1.5 billion breakup fee. In hindsight, it would have been smart to swallow that loss. But several people involved in the deal say the parties thought that the subprime mortgage crisis would actually help Archstone because people who could no longer afford houses would rent the company's apartments. 
 And for his part, Mr. Walsh was reluctant to jeopardize an important client relationship.
 A former Lehman executive, who declined to be identified because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly about his time at the firm, said: ''We were very loyal to our clients and had a culture of standing by our clients, even when the road got bumpy. We did not back away from commitments. We could not have built such a dominant franchise with any other approach. That culture, of course, has its risks and downside, including losing money on some transactions.''
 Mr. Walsh tried to limit Lehman's risk. He sold $8.9 billion of the Archstone debt to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and persuaded Bank of America and Barclays to buy $2.4 billion of the bridge equity. Even so, Lehman ended up with nearly 25 percent of a hugely overpriced deal just as real estate was imploding. This time, Lehman couldn't sell its immense hunk of bridge equity, and it was stuck with a $2.2 billion ownership stake that nobody wanted. 
 Still, there were no hard feelings between the partners. ''Mark is an extremely talented investor and a great partner,'' Mr. Speyer says. ''We look forward to working with him in the future.'' Of course, the most that Tishman Speyer could lose on Archstone was $250 million -- a pittance next to Lehman's total $5.4 billion exposure.
 Lehman soon had much bigger worries. In March 2008, Bear Stearns nearly collapsed and was sold to JPMorgan Chase in a government-supported deal. Wall Street wondered which bank might be next to fall. Short-sellers thought they knew: Lehman Brothers.
 Mr. Walsh and his crew rushed to sell their inventory. Between November 2007 and February 2008, Lehman shed $2.8 billion of its commercial real estate exposure. But that still left $36 billion of hard-to-value leftovers, including debt and equity from Archstone and SunCal. 
 Last spring, the hedge fund investor David Einhorn, who was shorting Lehman's stock, suggested that the bank's positions in Archstone and SunCal might be worthless. Mr. Einhorn said share prices of Archstone's competitors had tumbled as much as 30 percent since the acquisition was announced. As for SunCal, he pointed out that publicly traded home builders had written down their Southern California land holdings to ''pennies on the dollar.'' 
 Mr. Einhorn called for Lehman to take a multibillion-dollar write-down on its Archstone holdings. Lehman said it was valuing its commercial real estate fairly, based on the prices that Mr. Walsh's group had been getting on the open market as it struggled to free up the bank's balance sheet. 
 Lehman ended up with $29 billion in commercial mortgage exposure on its books in the second quarter of 2008 -- 30 percent more than Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley and 70 percent more than Goldman Sachs. 
 In early September, Lehman announced that it would stuff its toxic commercial mortgages into a new public company to be spun off to shareholders. The idea went nowhere. ''They couldn't get that commercial real estate off their books to save their lives,'' says Mr. Hintz at Sanford C. Bernstein. 
 In short order, Lehman collapsed.
 SOON after Lehman's bankruptcy, a former executive who declined to be identified because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly about his time at the firm went to Mr. Walsh's office to talk. But they sat in silence. After two minutes, the executive left. ''It became clear that neither one of us was going to say something that the other didn't already know, or that we were going to actually have a new idea or bring greater clarity to the situation,'' he recalls. 
 Ultimately, Barclays scooped up part of Lehman's operations. But it dismissed Mr. Walsh and most of his team. Now the United States attorney's office and the New Jersey attorney general are trying to determine whether Mr. Walsh did anything wrong. 
 But according to former Lehman executives who requested anonymity because of confidentially agreements, the values of commercial real estate holdings were determined by an independent committee outside his division. 
 Mr. Walsh has hired Patrick J. Smith, a former federal prosecutor who is now a partner at DLA Piper, to defend him in these investigations. Mr. Smith declined to comment for this article.
 In the meantime, Mr. Walsh is staying busy. He is helping the estate of his former employer dispose of its private equity holdings. His friends say they believe that Mr. Walsh will eventually emerge from the rubble of Lehman's collapse and return to deal-making. 
 ''Guys like this are very rare,'' says Mr. Rosen, the developer. ''He'll be back. He picked up the phone and people listen. Nobody can take that away from him.''

HEADLINE: Retro but With Touches Of Contemporary Taste

BYLINE: By PATRICIA BROOKS

 BODY:
ENTERING Lushe's SoNo Diner is like stepping into an Edward Hopper Depression-era painting -- until you notice that all the glistening chrome on chairs and tables looks new and the gray-maroon color scheme seems coordinated and fresh.
 This retro diner is the creation of Lushe Gjuraaj, who brought Habana to South Norwalk, a lively place with creative food that flourished for 10 or more years. It has now given way -- in name, decor, menu and prices, but with the same ownership -- to a theme more attuned to the current economy. 
 At a recent lunch, with few tables occupied, two of us were asked by the waitress, as part of an April promotion, to pay what we thought our lunch was worth. The meal was difficult to assess, so with some embarrassment we paid the full tariff, which was moderate enough. 
 In fact, lunch and breakfast are the best times to visit SoNo Diner. At lunch an abundance of salads, sandwiches, burgers and wraps is available, ample in portion, moderately priced and capably prepared. Breakfast, too, is reliable, with old-fashioned staples -- buttermilk pancakes, waffles, French toast and eggs in omelets or any way you'd like them cooked. Most breakfast items are priced below $7.
 Like diners and other inexpensive restaurants of an earlier era, SoNo has a menu that is cholesterol-heavy -- from chili cheese French fries and deep-fried onion rings (well-seasoned, but in a batter that made the rings as thick as mini-inner tubes) to the supermelt (barbecue chicken breast smothered in Cheddar, served with tomato on rye bread). 
 But not all on the menu is retro. There are a few contemporary touches, especially in the salads. The spinach comes with mushrooms, tomatoes, bacon and Gorgonzola, all in a balsamic vinaigrette. The China Town Express combines teriyaki chicken breast with mandarin orange segments, sliced almonds and tortilla chips served over mixed greens in a sesame-ginger vinaigrette. And the healthful mango salad consists of mixed greens, blackened chicken strips, fresh mango slices, toasted walnuts and a balsamic dressing. 
 As a bow to calorie watchers, there is also a low-cal platter (Jello, cottage cheese and fresh fruit served over mixed greens) and a veggie burger (just tell them to hold the fries). 
 Portions at every meal are more than generous, but quality is less predictable at dinner time. The menu offers 15 entrees and 10 pasta dishes. The experience that our table of four had one evening was spotty, to say the least. The batter on the ''London style fish and chips'' was tasteless and so thick you could hardly find the fish entombed within. Grilled salmon in a pesto cream sauce was dried at the edges and more cream than pesto. Skirt steak chimichurri, while tender and flavorful, came swimming in an unappetizing inch of oil; the chimichurri sauce spread over the beef was bland and the accompanying mashed potatoes lumpy. 
 Our only dinner success was fettuccini Alfredo with grilled chicken strips and broccoli florets, although the thin ribbons of pasta were more like linguini than fettuccini.
 Best to stick with breakfast or lunch, and do take the children. SoNo Diner is especially suited to an informal family outing. The setting is casual and child-friendly, and the large menu has 11 dishes sized and priced for children, as well as numerous juices and soft drinks and desserts designed for them. That means Jello, ice cream sundaes, banana split, three puddings (tapioca, chocolate and rice), banana milk shakes, ice cream sodas and egg creams.

HEADLINE: How Cheever Really Saw Suburbia

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

DATELINE: OSSINING, N.Y. 

 BODY:
 JOHN CHEEVER was perhaps America's foremost chronicler of suburbia, and in his quirky short stories and novels, fictional suburbs like Shady Hill are often pictured as a place of deadening commuter routines, liquor-fueled get-togethers, loveless affairs and forays of conspicuous consumption. These writings suggest that he seemed to take a jaundiced view of so manicured and lovely a setting.
 But there is evidence in a new biography of Cheever that he relished his life as a suburban burgher and did not disdain his fellow suburbanites as a class. Cheever was ''crazy about the suburbs,'' said Blake Bailey, whose book, ''Cheever: A Life,'' published in March by Knopf, was written with apparently unrivaled access to Cheever's journals. 
 ''He loved the natural beauty of the Hudson Valley,'' Mr. Bailey said. ''He loved walking through the woods along the Croton Aqueduct. He liked his neighbors.'' 
 Many of the signposts of Cheever's life in the suburbs are still around, along with members of his family. His wife, Mary, 90, still lives in the gently fraying house here on the rural eastern edge of Ossining, 35 miles north of New York City. It was here that Cheever spent his autumnal years. His son Ben, a writer, lives nearby in Pleasantville. Yes, they say, his fiction explored the chaotic, sometimes heartbreaking condition of those living in the suburbs, but his insights were as true of residents of Greenwich Village as of the tree-lined streets of Westchester.
 ''Most of that is not exclusive to the suburbs,'' Ben Cheever, 60, said of the grimmer aspects of suburban angst that some of his father's stories illuminated. ''You could be banal and boring in the North Pole. The suburbs was what he knew and that was his entry point for the studies of people. But he wrote about them deeply enough so that the things that were true about the suburbs would have been true anywhere.'' 
 Mrs. Cheever was glad to show a visitor around the house she and her husband bought in 1961 for $37,500. It is a rambling white Dutch Colonial with broad verandas and peeling wallpaper that was mostly built in the 20th century. Only now Mrs. Cheever lives there with a middle-aged woman she took in, whose 10 cats she seems to affect an annoyance with.
 ''I didn't know she was going to have 10 cats,'' she said. ''Now I need her. The children don't want to worry about me.''
 She pointed out the parlor and a living room lined with Cheever's books (an eclectic collection that includes his friends Bellow, Updike and Lauren Bacall), but curiously there is no study. He wrote on an Underwood typewriter or portable Olivetti in a guest room, his daughter Susan's room after she moved out, and in a small room above an Ossining barbershop that he rented for a time. 
 Mrs. Cheever casually took care to point out that her husband wrote only in the mornings because by the afternoon he was often drunk on gin.
 ''In those days, people did drink ever so much more than they do now,'' Mrs. Cheever said with a chuckle. ''It sounds shocking now, but it was not shocking then.''
 Mrs. Cheever told of how her husband gravitated to many classic suburban pursuits. He ate with friends at Ossining's Highland Diner. When he lived in the Briarcliff Manor hamlet of Scarborough, he was on the board of trustees of his children's private school. He liked to dig his hands in the soil and plant apple trees. He delighted in quiet walks with his Labrador retriever and liked bicycling from his house to the Teatown Lake Reservation. 
 In Scarborough, where he made his first suburban home, he was even a casual volunteer for the local fire department, though his family does not remember his ever actually fighting a fire. 
 ''He once got to drive the fire truck, and that was a big thrill,'' Mrs. Cheever said.
 If he had any misgivings about moving from the city to the suburbs -- as many transplanters do -- ''he accepted it because he found himself with his family living there,'' Mrs. Cheever said.
 A copy of Mr. Bailey's book was lying on a parlor table as Mrs. Cheever gave her recent tour of the house, but she said she had not yet read it.
 The Cheevers moved to the suburbs in 1951 for the same reasons many city people do. Their apartment building on First Avenue and 59th Street in Manhattan was converting to cooperatives, and the apartment was too cramped. His baby son, Ben, and daughter, Susan, were sharing a room.
 ''Maybe we were snobs,'' Mrs. Cheever said. ''We didn't want to live in the Bronx.'' They were lucky in a fashion because the house in Scarborough they found to rent was on the estate of a millionaire banker, a house that, coincidentally, had been occupied before by another suburban chronicler, Richard Yates, who wrote ''Revolutionary Road'' (a title drawn subconsciously, Yates once said, from a street in Scarborough). Many of their neighbors were quite cultured and sophisticated, Mr. Bailey said.
 The Cheevers sent their three children (their third, the youngest, is Federico) mostly to private schools, including one founded by their landlord. Private school was not an easily affordable expense for someone whose income came largely from short stories for The New Yorker. But Mrs. Cheever said she did not think sending her children to private school was elitist.
 ''We were old-fashioned,'' she said. ''We were brought up in private schools.''
 Whatever status he carried as a writer, Cheever often brooded about his economic disparities, like getting snubbed by waiters at a country club they sometimes visited but could not afford to join. Like many suburban husbands at that time, Cheever did not want his wife to work, though against his wishes she taught freshman college composition part time. ''He was that old-fashioned,'' she said. ''People forget what a short time it has been that women have been working.'' 
 Mr. Bailey noted that Cheever came from a declasse family -- despite a name stretching back to the Puritans, his father was a shoe salesman and his mother a shopkeeper -- and he ''suffered a traumatic childhood of much economic embarrassment.'' So upholding his status as a suburban gentleman was important. When not working, Mrs. Cheever kept herself immersed in volunteer groups like the League of Women Voters.
 Mrs. Cheever remembered, with some bitterness, that her husband wrote a story, ''An Educated American Woman,'' that seemed to be modeled on her, about a suburban wife so preoccupied with civic organizations and a book she is writing on Flaubert that the story ends tragically, with the woman's son dying in the care of a neglectful babysitter. Mrs. Cheever, in tears, suggested she did not mind the echoes of her own life, but was upset that ''he had the woman leave her sick child.'' 
 She rejects those who attribute her husband's inner loneliness to his life in the suburbs.
 ''His was the loneliness of a writer, when he would sit by himself working alone,'' she said. ''They all complain about it. It's not a social craft.''
 Cheever's raw materials were his surrounding terrain and its inhabitants and, because he spent most of his writing career in Westchester towns like Briarcliff Manor and Ossining, he effectively created a Cheever country that lives on in the American imagination as quintessential suburbia. But his stories and more recent biographical unearthings indicate he found much to admire as well. In ''The Swimmer,'' the delusional protagonist decides to swim across the county through his neighbors' pools, yet he can extol his surroundings by remarking that living ''in a world so generously supplied with water seemed like a clemency, a beneficence.''
 And the suburbs Cheever described have moved on. The blandly homogenous, dependably Republican towns and villages of the 1950s and 1960s, where fedora-wearing men commuted and women stayed home, are a thing of the past, with Westchester today as polyglot, polychrome and politically varied as most of America.
 What gave the standard suburban picture its irresistible complexity was that Cheever also lived a secret life. He was bisexual, and while married to Mary and raising his children, had numerous flings with men and women. The characters in his stories often harbor secrets that eat away at them or shadow their domestic lives, and Cheever projected onto them the futility of trying to seem happy while burying a gnawing unhappiness. Because of his own tortured inner life, Cheever approached his fiction with a sympathetic irony, Mr. Bailey said. 
 ''He identifies with their follies and deeply sympathizes with their foibles and suffering,'' he said. ''Those stories tell us that the suburbs are a radiant place of great natural beauty and human promise and because of that it's all the more tragic that we can't live in that world altogether happily.''
 In his early days in his first suburban house in Scarborough, Cheever felt ''out of water,'' according to his journals. He drove a secondhand Dodge and lived in what had been a rich man's tool shed near busy Route 9 while his wealthy neighbors lived in grand houses and drove Cadillacs. Cheever, Mr. Bailey's biography says, sometimes responded by outdoing his neighbors in affecting a courtly style that some saw as snobbishness. He also resorted, when drunk, to insults, and that increased the social isolation he came to feel.
 He captured seething middle-class envy in a story like ''The Housebreaker of Shady Hill,'' where a man consumed by the inferiority he feels next to his ostentatious neighbors sneaks at night into the bedroom of a sleeping couple and steals cash from the husband's wallet. The sense is that beneath the placid suburban exteriors, life is deeply troubled. Yet at the same time, Cheever could say in that story, ''If you work in the city and have children to raise, I can't think of a better place.''
 Indeed, a line that for Mr. Bailey best captured this paradox came from the story ''The Country Husband'' as it describes Shady Hill after the 7:14 has come and gone and dinner is finished.
 ''The village hangs morally and economically, from a thread,'' the story says. ''But it hangs by its thread in the evening light.''
 Cheever, who died in 1982 at the age of 70, had paradoxical views on many subjects, Mr. Bailey said, so he saw the suburbs in all their protean intricacy, which is why his stories live on. 
 ''Updike, in the New Yorker obituary, said many people have written about suburbia but only Cheever was able to make an archetypal place of it, a place we recognize wherever we are and wherever we have been,'' Mr. Bailey said

 Mr. Bailey noted that Cheever came from a declasse family -- despite a name stretching back to the Puritans, his father was a shoe salesman and his mother a shopkeeper -- and he ''suffered a traumatic childhood of much economic embarrassment.'' So upholding his status as a suburban gentleman was important. When not working, Mrs. Cheever kept herself immersed in volunteer groups like the League of Women Voters.
 Mrs. Cheever remembered, with some bitterness, that her husband wrote a story, ''An Educated American Woman,'' that seemed to be modeled on her, about a suburban wife so preoccupied with civic organizations and a book she is writing on Flaubert that the story ends tragically, with the woman's son dying in the care of a neglectful babysitter. Mrs. Cheever, in tears, suggested she did not mind the echoes of her own life, but was upset that ''he had the woman leave her sick child.'' 
 She rejects those who attribute her husband's inner loneliness to his life in the suburbs.
 ''His was the loneliness of a writer, when he would sit by himself working alone,'' she said. ''They all complain about it. It's not a social craft.''
 Cheever's raw materials were his surrounding terrain and its inhabitants and, because he spent most of his writing career in Westchester towns like Briarcliff Manor and Ossining, he effectively created a Cheever country that lives on in the American imagination as quintessential suburbia. But his stories and more recent biographical unearthings indicate he found much to admire as well. In ''The Swimmer,'' the delusional protagonist decides to swim across the county through his neighbors' pools, yet he can extol his surroundings by remarking that living ''in a world so generously supplied with water seemed like a clemency, a beneficence.''
 And the suburbs Cheever described have moved on. The blandly homogenous, dependably Republican towns and villages of the 1950s and 1960s, where fedora-wearing men commuted and women stayed home, are a thing of the past, with Westchester today as polyglot, polychrome and politically varied as most of America.
 What gave the standard suburban picture its irresistible complexity was that Cheever also lived a secret life. He was bisexual, and while married to Mary and raising his children, had numerous flings with men and women. The characters in his stories often harbor secrets that eat away at them or shadow their domestic lives, and Cheever projected onto them the futility of trying to seem happy while burying a gnawing unhappiness. Because of his own tortured inner life, Cheever approached his fiction with a sympathetic irony, Mr. Bailey said. 
 ''He identifies with their follies and deeply sympathizes with their foibles and suffering,'' he said. ''Those stories tell us that the suburbs are a radiant place of great natural beauty and human promise and because of that it's all the more tragic that we can't live in that world altogether happily.''
 In his early days in his first suburban house in Scarborough, Cheever felt ''out of water,'' according to his journals. He drove a secondhand Dodge and lived in what had been a rich man's tool shed near busy Route 9 while his wealthy neighbors lived in grand houses and drove Cadillacs. Cheever, Mr. Bailey's biography says, sometimes responded by outdoing his neighbors in affecting a courtly style that some saw as snobbishness. He also resorted, when drunk, to insults, and that increased the social isolation he came to feel.
 He captured seething middle-class envy in a story like ''The Housebreaker of Shady Hill,'' where a man consumed by the inferiority he feels next to his ostentatious neighbors sneaks at night into the bedroom of a sleeping couple and steals cash from the husband's wallet. The sense is that beneath the placid suburban exteriors, life is deeply troubled. Yet at the same time, Cheever could say in that story, ''If you work in the city and have children to raise, I can't think of a better place.''
 Indeed, a line that for Mr. Bailey best captured this paradox came from the story ''The Country Husband'' as it describes Shady Hill after the 7:14 has come and gone and dinner is finished.
 ''The village hangs morally and economically, from a thread,'' the story says. ''But it hangs by its thread in the evening light.''
 Cheever, who died in 1982 at the age of 70, had paradoxical views on many subjects, Mr. Bailey said, so he saw the suburbs in all their protean intricacy, which is why his stories live on. 
 ''Updike, in the New Yorker obituary, said many people have written about suburbia but only Cheever was able to make an archetypal place of it, a place we recognize wherever we are and wherever we have been,'' Mr. Bailey said

HEADLINE: Mayor Dogged by Rivals and Fiscal Downturn

BYLINE: By STEVE STRUNSKY

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY 

 BODY:
 WHEN Jerramiah T. Healy was elected as mayor here, this former railroad town had been transformed into an extension of Lower Manhattan's financial district, with skyscrapers along the waterfront housing major financial firms that employed tens of thousands in white-collar jobs.
 In November 2004, Mr. Healy, a former city councilman and municipal court judge, handily won a special election to fill the unfinished term of Mayor Glenn D. Cunningham, who had died after a heart attack. Mr. Healy just as easily won a full term the following May, with 75 percent of the vote. 
 But now, Wall Street's woes have come to roost in Jersey City. The city's unemployment rate rose to 9.5 percent in February, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, up from 5.5 percent in April 2008. Many of the job losses were in the lucrative financial sector that had created a demand for new housing and supported a lively dining and entertainment industry in the city's downtown.
 It is in this context that the mayor is seeking a second four-year term in the city's elections on May 12.
 Mr. Healy is facing a large field of opponents for the job, among them Louis M. Manzo, a former state assemblyman making his fifth bid for mayor, and Assemblyman L. Harvey Smith. Others include Dan Levin, a civic activist, and Phil Webb, a former city police detective. The city's steep job losses have made Mr. Healy, 58, a better target for his rivals, but he is not acting like he's worried about winning re-election.
 ''We're not expecting to get those kinds of numbers this time around,'' Mr. Healy said about his winning margin with 75 percent of the vote last time around. ''Hopefully, the voters and the citizens will think we've done a good enough job to merit another four years.'' 
 With much more name recognition than the other candidates and his campaign signs outnumbering theirs several times over, Mr. Healy did not even bother to show up for two debates last month attended by the other four candidates, where taxes and crime were topics of discussion. 
 Mr. Healy has the support of Gov. Jon S. Corzine and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, among others, and he is attracting financial support from the city's development community. Mr. Healy was one of the state's first elected officials to endorse President Obama's campaign back in May 2007, and his supporters say that relationship could help the city win stimulus funds or other aid for projects like a proposed westward extension of the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail Line. 
 ''It can never hurt to have a friend in the president of the United States,'' said Senator Robert Menendez, a fellow Democrat. 
 Mr. Bloomberg was recently a host for an event for Mr. Healy that raised $200,000. The two mayors are longtime allies on gun control and other issues, and Mr. Healy said he viewed New York as a ''big brother'' to Jersey City, not a rival. Mr. Healy said he has kept taxes level for the past two years, increased the police force and persuaded developers to hire local residents. 
 But some of Mr. Healy's recent behavior has drawn criticism from his opponents and others. In 2007, he was convicted of obstructing justice and resisting arrest in Bradley Beach, after trying to intervene in a scuffle outside a bar.
 Mr. Manzo has publicly called the mayor ''an embarrassment.''
 Mr. Manzo also said that the mayor -- like some of his predecessors -- has not paid enough attention to neighborhoods away from the waterfront.
 ''Despite our blossoming waterfront, we have double-digit unemployment in our minority areas,'' Mr. Manzo said.
 All of his opponents have criticized Mr. Healy for granting tax abatements to waterfront developers including Donald Trump, even during peak boom years.
 Mr. Healy shrugged off the criticism in a recent interview. 
 ''I happen to think that investment and development in Jersey City is a very good thing,'' he said.

BYLINE: By PHILIP GALANES. 
For help with an awkward social situation, send queries to socialq@nytimes.com or Social Q's, The New York Times Style Department, 620 Eighth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10018. Please include a daytime telephone number.

 BODY:
After my 43-year-old son died, I immediately told my brother, and he contacted my niece, with whom I had always been close.
 Two days passed, and I didn't hear from her. So I called and told her I was hurt. She said she had been busy and was waiting until she had more time. I told her that was no excuse. Later, I left a message apologizing for my outburst, but I haven't heard back. Now I'm afraid our years of closeness are over. How do I handle this?
 N.V., Orlando, Fla. 
 I'm sorry for you: suffering such a heavy loss, only to feel as if you're losing even more because of a single, intemperate phone call.
 Any niece with a heart already knows that you made your call in grief and anger at your terrible predicament -- and not at her. I understand completely why you made your call, and you've already apologized. 
 What's more, if your niece is anything like the rest of us, she wasn't entirely truthful. She may have been waiting until she had more time, but she was probably also struggling with her monumental task: making a really hard phone call. So she inexcusably dragged her feet, and you dialed first.
 Try to forgive yourself for phoning in anger. And give yourself -- and your niece -- a little breathing room. Time may not heal all wounds, but it should do wonders for a phone call made in haste. 
 Ever Heard of Photoshop?
 My husband and I have been happily married for just over a year. Both of us were divorced. On visits to his family, I've noticed that both my new parents-in-law and sister- and brother-in-law display framed photographs of my husband with his ex-wife, taken in a group at a family wedding. Can I ask them to remove them?Anonymous
 Yes, by all means, dearie! Simply insist that your brand-new in-laws get rid of their precious family photos -- especially if you want them calling you names behind your back in time for your second anniversary.
 It would be one thing if they were hanging oil portraits of Wifey No. 1 -- like the first Mrs. De Winter in Daphne du Maurier's ''Rebecca.'' But these are group shots, commemorating family events from days gone by. They're sentimental favorites -- and not just because everyone looks younger and hotter than they do right now.
 Suck it up. There was life before us, and sadly, it will continue after we're gone. 
 The Boss Shares Too Much
 My manager tells me all about his love life. I'm happy he's found a girlfriend, but spending hours hearing about her is wearing thin. How can I let him know to step back?
 Anonymous, New Jersey
 Boring boss on Line 2!
 Unfortunately, our paychecks prevent us from pulling the plug on conversations that our bosses really want to have -- especially in this economy, with layoffs looming large. And a ready supply of topic-changers works only from time to time. 
 But if you're prepared to be creative, we may just cancel that subscription to Office Cube Confessional once and for all. Invite your supervisor and his new gal pal to dinner. (I know, I know. There is a 10th circle of hell.) Spend the evening in lively chatter with his newfound mate. 
 Then, when your boss wants to dissect his relationship, simply tell him you feel much too close to his girlfriend to talk about her behind her back. Voila! The unwanted confidences are banished -- until your boss blows it with this girlfriend, anyway, and moves on to the next squeeze. 
 No Thank You
 I shipped a wedding gift to a couple, but five months later I still have not received a thank you note. I sent an electronic message to the bride, asking if she'd received my gift, adding that if she hadn't, I wanted to contact my credit card company.
 One month later, I still haven't heard from her. Now I'm offended. Is there anything more I can do?
 Katie, Minneapolis
 Short of ordering a hit on the happy couple, I don't believe there is, Katie. They are either mute with mortification or blithely rude and clueless. 
 Technically, of course, all the old-fashioned etiquette guides give newlyweds three months to mail their thank you notes. But that's always seemed ridiculous to me and probably harks back to the days when extended honeymoons ''on the Continent'' were all the rage. 
 But anything you do at this point -- given the couple's silence -- will make you look like a rabid dog with a bone, and probably increase your blood pressure to dangerously high levels.
 So how about thinking of them as a couple whose anniversary you can safely skip, instead?
 And to all you tardy brides and grooms out there, just blame the post office. Everyone else does.

HEADLINE: Mexico, Once in Demand, Loses Its Brides and Grooms

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
ADD swine flu to the list of potential pre-wedding worries. Many couples who had planned on destination weddings in Mexico this spring or summer are now scrambling to find an alternative spot or postponing their events indefinitely. 
 ''My situation right now is completely up in the air,'' said Natalia Velasquez, a graphic designer from Minneapolis, who was planning to marry her fiance, Jake Erling, a martial arts instructor, next week before 15 friends and family members at the Dreams Tulum Resort & Spa, south of Playa del Carmen. But because of swine flu fears and the fact that Mr. Erling has cystic fibrosis, making him especially vulnerable to any type of flu, they have decided to postpone their event and are now considering either taking the wedding to Jamaica on another date, or waiting it out. ''We're trying not to panic,'' she said.
 ''Brides are notably petrified,'' said Carley Roney, editor in chief at the Knot (theknot.com), a wedding planning Web site that recently devoted a forum to Mexico weddings because of the flood of concern from couples with weddings planned in the region. ''But because they've invested so much around this psychologically, most of them can't even imagine not continuing on with the plans,'' she said. 
 Their guests, however, can. 
 Earlier this week, JoAnn Gregoli, owner of Elegant Occasions, a wedding planning agency in New York, sent a young New York couple off to Mexico's Riviera Maya, south of Cancun. This was before the World Health Organization had raised the alert level of the fast-spreading swine flu to Phase 5. As the days wore on and the virus spread, however, the guest list dwindled to 26 from 88. 
 ''It's just awful,'' said Ms. Gregoli, who sent her staff down to the resort with a suitcase full of protective masks and gobs of hand sanitizer. Those who could get a prescription brought along Tamiflu. ''I can't tell you how my heart breaks for this girl.''
 Until the recent economic downturn put a damper on travel, the destination wedding industry had been booming. And according to a 2008 survey of 18,000 users of the Knot, Mexico was a top locale, accounting for roughly 12 percent of international destination weddings, thanks to easy access from both the East and West coasts of the United States, comparatively low prices and exotic appeal. 
 Where would you rather get married, Ms. Roney asked, ''Detroit or Los Cabos?'' 
 But the swine flu has blighted its wedding appeal. 
 ''We have had cruise passengers call, freaking out; brides with weddings in July having panic attacks -- just wonderful!'' said Terry McCabe, a travel agent at Altour in New York.
 While some resorts are waiving cancellation fees and penalties for brides who want to switch venues, others are not being so accommodating. ''I have one such couple who have been paying on their honeymoon for over a year and have no recourse but to cancel with a current 50 percent penalty of a $5,000 booking or take the trip,'' said Lindsay Wendt-Sheikh, president of the Destination Wedding Association, a trade group.
 For now, there seems to be one upside to the destination wedding fallout in Mexico. As brides look for alternative locales, the Caribbean is benefiting from a rise in bookings. 
 Travel agents say that owing to the general downturn in travel, finding alternatives hasn't been too much of an issue -- particularly where the affected resorts are part of large chains. 
 ''We're not having a problem rescheduling for other Marriott hotels,'' said Catherine Leitner, a spokeswoman for the chain's Caribbean and Latin American properties. Marriott has moved several groups, including some wedding parties, from Puerto Vallarta, Cancun and Mexico City to Caribbean resorts, she said.
 The Ritz-Carlton hotel in San Juan has picked up more than a hundred rooms from its sibling property in Cancun and other Mexican hotels. 
 Ocean Club Resorts in the Turks and Caicos says it has received an increase in group bookings, including weddings, relocating to the resort from Mexico. ''It's not that we're thrilled that they're having to relocate and that their plans will be disrupted,'' said Julia Maximo, who heads up its group and wedding sales. But, she added, ''It's certainly good for us.''

HEADLINE: Also Out This Week

BYLINE: By DAVE KEHR

 BODY:
BOSTON LEGAL: SEASON 5 James Spader and William Shatner star in the final 13-episode season of David E. Kelley's network drama. (Fox, $49.98, not rated) 
 THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON From the director David Fincher (''Zodiac''), an epic contemplation of mortality centered on the metaphorical figure of a New Orleans foundling (a digitally enhanced Brad Pitt) who is born an old man and ages in reverse. In The New York Times in December, A. O. Scott said of the movie that ''the puzzles it invites us to contemplate -- in consistently interesting, if not always dramatically satisfying ways -- are deep and imposing, concerning the passage of time, the elusiveness of experience and the Janus-faced nature of love.'' With Cate Blanchett, Julia Ormond and Tilda Swinton. (Criterion Collection, Blu-ray $39.99, standard definition two-disc edition $34.98; Paramount, standard definition single-disc edition $29.98, PG-13)
 ENCHANTED APRIL The long-delayed American DVD debut of Mike Newell's 1992 romantic comedy, in which a group of variously disenchanted British women (Josie Lawrence, Miranda Richardson, Polly Walker and Joan Plowright) seek refuge on an Italian vacation. The film, Janet Maslin wrote in The Times in 1992, ''revolves around the appealing notion that a trip to Italy, specifically to a medieval castle with a glorious view of the surrounding countryside, will cure any ills.'' (Miramax, $29.99, PG)
 LAST CHANCE HARVEY Two lonely misfits -- an American jingle writer (Dustin Hoffman) and a British survey-taker (Emma Thompson) -- cross paths at Heathrow and romantic comedy ensues, as written and directed by Joel Hopkins. Manohla Dargis wrote in The Times in December that ''there's something irresistible about watching two people fall in love, even in contrived, sniffle- and sometimes gag-inducing films like 'Last Chance Harvey.' '' (Anchor Bay, Blu-ray $39.98, standard definition $29.98, PG-13)
 WENDY AND LUCY Kelly Reichert's independent feature stars Michelle Williams as an unemployed and apparently unwanted young woman named Wendy working her way across the Pacific Northwest in the company of her dog, Lucy. ''What happens to Wendy -- and to Lucy -- matters a lot, which is to say that 'Wendy and Lucy,' for all its modesty, matters a lot too,'' Mr. Scott wrote in The Times in December. (Oscilloscope, $29.95, R)

HEADLINE: A Prom With All the Glitz, But Every Dollar Squeezed

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY. 
Pat Wiedenkeller and Mary Jo Patterson contributed reporting.

 BODY:
FOR four years, Lindsay Rescott has been planning for the moment when she gathers with her fellow seniors at Northport Village Park on Long Island to pose for their prom photos in the June twilight. Lindsay, a 17-year-old horse lover who plans to study animal science in the fall, has carefully chosen her beaded and swirled zebra print gown, decided on the side ponytail she will ask her hairdresser to shape for the event and received enthusiastic approval from her grandmother to dip into her jewelry box for earrings and her closet for an evening bag.
 ''I always knew it was a big thing for Northport,'' she said. ''It's the one really big thing we have.''
 Meanwhile, her mother, Dina Rescott, has been trying not to let her financial worries cloud her daughter's endless prom reverie. With her work as a graphic designer slowing, money has been tight. Her husband, a creative director at a pharmaceutical advertising agency, hasn't received a raise or a bonus this year. While Ms. Rescott understands that Lindsay has looked forward to prom ''forever,'' she said, she is ''constantly worrying about money.'' 
 So the Rescotts are trying to help their daughter pay for the prom while bracing for what lies ahead: more job uncertainty, along with bills for Lindsay's tuition at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. They have helped pay $300 toward a gown and $200 for prom tickets and are sorting out how to pay for smaller expenses like hair styling and after-party spending.
 ''Yes, it's the recession,'' Ms. Rescott said. ''But it's a one-time thing. Everyone remembers their prom. I wouldn't want to take that away from her.''
 As the recession forces families to redefine their financial priorities, many are still trying to pay for an event they consider a rite of passage. Even parents who are unemployed or facing declining wages are cutting back elsewhere to make sure that their teenagers attend the prom. In fact, interviews with parents, teenagers, dress shop owners and other prom-related vendors show that families are still spending on gowns, party buses and postprom events, no matter the financial hardship.
 ''Girls are going to prom no matter what,'' said Elia Rubinstein, owner of the Magic Moments shop in Port Jefferson, N.Y., where she finds that seniors especially are still spending on nicer gowns. ''They're going to prom, and trust me, a lot of the girls will not compromise. They will have an aunt pay for it, a godmother, a friend.''
 The prom gown business is doing so well in the recession that it's expected to outperform last year. Michael Kasher, owner of the Los Angeles-based gown line La Femme Fashion -- whose La Femme gowns cost about $350 and whose Gigi gowns cost about $225 -- called the Northeast his ''strongest territory,'' with sales in New York growing by ''double digits'' in the last year. 
 At Cooper's Dress Shop in Orange, Conn., the owner, Evelyn Cooperstock, said girls have been waiting up to three hours on weekends to try on gowns and have passed up cheaper gowns she ordered for the recession for ones that cost more than $300. 
 While prom shoppers at Fontana Couture in Scarsdale, N.Y., are buying fewer dresses that cost $800 to $1,000, the owner, Frank Fontana, noted that they are still buying $200 to $500 dresses. Steven Citron, owner of the Perfect Dress in Lawrenceville, said his revenues were up by about 50 percent from last year. On weekends, he has noticed lines for the dressing room, he said, and has hired more salespeople to handle crowds.
 ''Our business has not been affected,'' he said.
 Prom-related businesses across the nation are experiencing a similar trend. The prom industry expects its sales to be 6 percent higher this year compared with the year before, said Mike Denton, director of the International Prom Association, a group based in Jefferson City, Tenn., which has 74 member retailers and vendors. 
 The recent enthusiasm for the prom mirrors how proms were treated during the later years of the Great Depression, according to Stephen Mintz, a Columbia University history professor who studies families. The prom, which originally was created in the late 19th century as a middle-class version of the debutante ball, grew popular during the Depression. Even during the Depression, families would do whatever they could to look as if they could continue to spend, just as parents are continuing to spend on the prom today, Dr. Mintz said.
 ''They would do anything to maintain appearances,'' he said. ''It doesn't matter what it costs.''
 Hearst, which has cornered the market on prom-related publications, surveyed 2,811 teenagers nationwide and in a study released on March 30 found that 65 percent said they would not cut back on spending on prom gowns because of the recession.
 While much of prom spending starts with the purchase of the dress, other economic indicators are thriving, too. Teenage boys are spending an average of 20 percent more than they did last year, requesting designer brand tuxedo rentals and ordering more accessories like hats, Mr. Denton said. Party bus companies so far have not had to cut their prices. Tommy Radalj, marketing director for the Party Ride, based in Brentwood, N.Y., said that business was on par with 2008 figures. Last year the company provided buses -- with room enough for 20 to 44 passengers -- that cost $1,200 to $7,500 for 700 groups of teenagers attending proms throughout the metropolitan area.
 But there are plenty of signs that spending on these events is causing families financial strain. Florence Catherine Remy, owner of Princess Bridals in Farmingdale, N.Y., has noticed mothers and daughters openly arguing about money in a different way than in the past. ''The kids want these dresses so badly,'' she said. ''Money is a big factor.''
 Prom donation programs also are being flooded with requests for gowns. Noel D'Allacco, founder of the Yonkers-based group Operation Prom, which is part of the national program DonateMyDress.org, said she had received five times more requests from school districts in Westchester than she did a year ago. She has already given away 475 dresses, compared with 300 this time last year. Requests are also coming in from parents who live in wealthier suburbs like Somers and New Rochelle, whose teenagers sometimes attend private schools. When Ms. D'Allacco tells parents that their daughters need to be referred by their guidance counselors for gowns, parents say they don't want school employees to know about their financial problems. She said they tell her, ''People will talk if they knew she got a free prom dress.''
 But for the most part, parents are cutting their personal spending to pay for the prom. Mindy and Ron Rockower are bracing for three college tuitions ahead. So far, Mr. Rockower's work as a self-employed accountant and lawyer has held up. They are still making sure that their oldest, Corey, 17, attends his senior prom at Plainview-Old Bethpage John F. Kennedy High School on Long Island by helping him pay for his tuxedo, his $70 prom ticket, the $135 party bus and possibly postparty activities in the Hamptons. They are cutting out clothes shopping and dinners out, and they are grateful that he is attending a SUNY campus in the fall.
 ''Let him go, have fun and, most important, be safe,'' Ms. Rockower said. ''It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.''
 Other teenagers are trying to pay part of the bills themselves. Michelle Marchese, an 18-year-old senior at Passaic Valley Regional High School in Little Falls, hopes to use her savings from working in a card shop to pay for her prom expenses. Her father, a construction worker, was laid off a couple of months ago, and her mother works in a bank. So she wants to pay for her gown, hair, nails, tickets for the prom and the limousine taking her there. All told, the price tag is about $700.
 ''My parents aren't the type to say, 'You have to pay for part of this yourself,' but I want to,'' she said. ''Since I'm working, and put most of my money away for college next year, I want to help.'' 
 Some teenagers who have to help pay more prom expenses are deciding it's not worth it. Meghan Sabas, a 17-year-old junior at Jonathan Law High School in Milford, Conn., decided to pass up her junior prom, since she went last year.
 She has some savings from her $7-an-hour job as a receptionist at a hair salon, and she could wear her older sister's $300 gown from last year. When she considered the expenses -- $70 fees for tanning ''because everyone else is tanned,'' her makeup and a party bus -- and that she didn't want to be seen in photos wearing a ''used dress,'' she decided to pass.
 ''It would be a lot of work just to go to prom,'' she said.
 Her mother, JoAnn Sabas, said that she spent about $1,600 last year for Meghan, her twin sister and her older sister to go to the prom. But this year, the family is on a tighter budget because her husband, who works in the kitchen department of a local store, has seen his pay decline. Ms. Sabas, who works at a local bank, is determined not to let her family fall into the financial troubles she sees many others struggling with. She won't put her daughter's prom on credit cards.
 ''If they really want it and they have the money, they'll do it,'' she said. 
 Then there are teenagers who are still battling their parents over whether they will go. Angelina Ambrosino, a 17-year-old senior at Nelson Mandela High School in Mount Vernon, N.Y., would like to go to her prom. She said she is considering Ms. D'Allaco's offer to help her pay for an $80 prom ticket and give her a gown from Operation Prom.
 But she knows she will need money for her nails, a limo and going out afterward with her friends. She also has to figure out how to pay for graduation expenses like a yearbook and a cap and gown, along with expenses when she attends Mercy College in the fall. She knows that she can't turn to her parents for extra cash. After her father's $28-an-hour manufacturing job relocated to the South last year, he took a job that pays $10 an hour.
 ''Every time I ask my parents, 'Can I have money for this, this and that?' they say, 'Money is hard,' '' she said. Her mother, Tammy Ambrosino, a custodian at a local school, said she would rather her daughter save money for the future; she will be the first member of their immediate family to attend college.
 ''I'd rather see her get her education,'' she said. ''College has got to be No. 1.''

HEADLINE: Crime May Not Pay, But in This Town, Fighting It Sure Does

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

DATELINE: CLARKSTOWN, N.Y. 

 BODY:
The police chief here likes to say that he can count the number of homicides in 2008 on one fist, because there were none. 
 According to one national ranking, Clarkstown, in Rockland County, is consistently among the safest towns in America with at least 75,000 people, based on its crime statistics. In 2007, it was the second safest, and in 2008, it was the sixth.
 But Clarkstown is also at the top of another category that Chief Peter T. Noonan is less thrilled to discuss: police pay. In 2008, Chief Noonan, 56, made $332,529.88. He was not even the highest paid: One of his two captains earned $335,676, while working two days a week because of a disability and spending three days a week undergoing physical therapy. The other captain earned $311,369. 
 The 50 highest-earning Clarkstown employees were all members of the 173-member Police Department, with those 50 earning roughly $10 million, or about $200,000 each on average. 
 An article in The Journal News last month that listed this and other salary information got people talking in Clarkstown, population 83,000. It comprises a handful of hamlets just west of the Hudson River, north of the Tappan Zee Bridge, and a half hour's drive from New York City.
 ''It's incomprehensible, it's outlandish how the pay ever reached this level,'' said Gerry O'Rourke, president of the Congers Civic Association in town. ''They're good police, but they're making Wall Street salaries. Are we going to be paying them $400,000 in a couple years?''
 By comparison, the New York City police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, makes $189,700, and average annual pay for city police officers ranges from $43,062 for a cadet entering the academy to $90,829 for an officer with five and a half years on the job, including overtime and other earnings, according to Paul J. Browne, the department's chief spokesman. In New York City, salaries for captains start at $108,342, and grow after four years to $135,524. 
 Many Clarkstown officers are able to augment their salaries by collecting hundreds of hours of overtime a year -- in some cases earned in previous years -- and extra earnings for unused holiday, vacation, personal and sick time.
 As a gesture of good faith during tough economic times, Chief Noonan has agreed to take a modest pay cut. 
 ''The number is high, I admit it,'' he said of his earnings. In addition to his salary ($289,947, roughly $60,000 of which is mandated because of his seniority), there is $41,732 for unused vacation and sick days and overtime accrued over multiple years. Then there are the smaller accrued payments, including an $850 equipment allowance. 
 Chief Noonan, a native of the Bronx, moved to Rockland County in the late 1970s when he was hired as a Clarkstown police officer at a base pay of $11,250. Over his 32-year career, he moved up the ranks, from officer to sergeant to lieutenant to chief, which he has been for five years. These days, he says, he works 12-hour days and is ''always on call.''
 The waiting list to get hired is long, and many members of the force are former New York City police officers who defected for better pay and a quieter job.
 No doubt, the force keeps the area safe, and seems highly professional, housed in a modern headquarters with an elaborate communications center where police officials scan a multitude of screens and monitors and work the radio and phones. 
 Clarkstown, which ranges from upscale suburban areas to more rural sprawling sections with no sidewalks, had a median household income of $96,223 in 2007, compared with $52,944 for New York State, census figures show.
 In his spacious office in New City, the county seat, the chief mentioned the CQ Press national safety index for 2008, which indicates that Clarkstown has little crime. 
 Clarkstown is not the only well-paid department in the New York suburbs. Westchester has its share. And on Long Island, most of the members of the Nassau and Suffolk County Police Departments, large forces that are widely regarded as two of the highest-paid departments in the country, earn six-figure salaries. Still, Clarkstown stands out.
 ''He may well be the highest-paid chief in the country, surpassing even L.A., New York, Chicago, Dallas, Denver and Detroit,'' said Chief Jack L. Rinchich, president of the National Association of Chiefs of Police. ''Those salaries are astounding -- I've never heard anything in that range. It's a heck of a package. I mean, we have a chief in West Virginia making $7 an hour.'' 
 Clarkstown's top local elected official, the town supervisor, Alexander J. Gromack (annual salary: $153,000), could not even crack the top 50 highest-paid town employees. Mr. Gromack called the department proficient, and said many municipalities pay multiple police forces to patrol overlapping areas. Clarkstown's Police Department is covering the entire town on its own, he said, and so therefore it is doing the job of two or more departments.
 Still, he said, police compensation accounts for 25 percent of the town's roughly $130 million budget, and puts an undue strain on a budget that he struggles to keep balanced. ''I have the highest regard for the job they are doing,'' Mr. Gromack said. ''We have to protect the people of Clarkstown, but we also have to protect their pocketbooks.''
 Perhaps predictably, Mr. Gromack blamed the situation on previous administrations, which he said allowed salaries and benefits to balloon with every contract negotiation. During his four years in office, he said, he has been working to limit overtime and scale back some perks.
 ''I inherited these obscene salaries, and I've been attempting to turn them around and bring some reality and sanity to the salary structure of our police,'' Mr. Gromack said.
 The Clarkstown police contract has expired, and town and union officials are ''miles apart'' on the terms of the new contract, he said. Town officials refuse to increase the salaries further. Mr. Gromack said the negotiations would probably go to arbitration, which he feared would result in yet another salary increase, since, he said, the arbitrators always seem to find in favor of the unions.
 ''It's been snowballing for years, and I'm trying to slow it down, but we're all handcuffed by New York State law, which stacks the deck against us,'' he said. ''But I will not give in, and I understand the outrage of what these salaries mean to our community.''
 That outrage was palpable recently among locals at a shopping center in New City, a short walk down South Main Street from police headquarters. The first dozen people who were approached while exiting a supermarket called the salaries unreasonable, but refused to give their names for publication, for reasons that included fear of police retaliation.
 Finally, someone agreed to be quoted by name: Ann-Mari Stein, 57, who called the salaries well deserved.
 ''They work hard to keep us safe -- I don't even lock my door sometimes,'' said Ms. Stein, a teacher's aide in Clarkstown. ''Some people complain, but I think they deserve it. My only complaint is, I wish I had the job.''

HEADLINE: Filling the Telegenic Seats

 BODY:
As New York's two baseball teams unveiled their opulent new stadiums this spring, an overreach was evident to fans watching on television. As the cameras followed the pitches, grand swaths of the most expensive upholstered seats around home plate and the dugouts -- up to $2,500 per at Yankee Stadium and $495 at the Mets' Citi Field -- were revealed to be empty. 
 Where were all of the playful plutocrats for whom they were designed? Could they be out trying whiffle ball for free with the kids? 
 Those seats became a riveting distraction, especially when, during a national broadcast, one sportscaster intoned on the Yankees' luxury gap. (No proposal was heard for a federal elite-seat retention bailout.) The vacancies had to be a treat for Gotham loathers everywhere. But also for local fans inside the $1.5 billion stadium straining to watch all of the action from the $14 bleacher seats beyond deep center field.
 The Yankees' money-is-no-object management is rarely embarrassed. But this time it was -- up to a point. The team cut the price of a few hundred of its most telegenic teak-trimmed seats in half. That's still as much as $1,250. The Mets, whose park cost a relatively more populist $875 million, stood pat with their top prices, though they were forced to auction scores of the most expensive seats for opening day to try to fill the gaps. 
 ''Don't ever think sports is anything but a business,'' was the advice of New York's richest fan, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, as he defended the value of the taxpayer-subsidized stadiums. This raises the question of whether the recession mercy extended to the richest fans might be wisely trickled down to the less affluent. 
 They face stiff prices of $50 or $150 for the sort of family seats where a fresh generation of fans presumably will grow, if they can afford to. New York has a lesson to learn from Toronto, where the Blue Jays are already offering ''Messin' With Recession'' games with tickets as low as $5 and hot dogs for $1.

HEADLINE: Problems, and Deals, in Thailand

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS; Alex Frew McMillan contributed reporting from Phuket, Thailand.

 BODY:
JUST how many hits can the tourism industry of Thailand take? Will the anti-government protests in Bangkok in mid-April -- which escalated into two days of rioting during the traditional Thai New Year and caused the cancellation of a summit meeting of Asian nations in Pattaya -- keep away the visitors who have been gradually returning since the devastating tsunami of 2004?
 The clashes, in which two people were killed and more than 100 injured, were quelled after government troops stepped in. But images of burning buses and armed soldiers in the streets of Bangkok came just four months after another group of demonstrators blockaded airports, stranding passengers for about a week. And the prospect of continued turmoil has already prompted some travelers to rethink their travel plans. 
 For a three-week vacation abroad, John D. Long, of Washington, had been trying to decide between a trip to Europe or a tour of Southeast Asia, using Bangkok as a hub to reach Cambodia, Vietnam and Myanmar. 
 ''I was ready to make a reservation for either place but as I began to read about the unrest in Thailand and remembering what happened the last time the political party currently in power was in the opposition,'' he said referring to the airport shutdowns, ''I began to think it was more prudent for me to opt for the European trip.'' 
 It wasn't so much the nature of the recent strife that worried Mr. Long, but how his trip might be affected if the demonstrations were to have an impact on his travel plans. ''If I get to Bangkok and can't get out,'' he said, he would never make it to places like Yangon, the former Rangoon, in Myanmar, ''a major draw for that trip.'' 
 Thailand tourism had already taken a hit from the global economic crisis. The Tourism Authority of Thailand was anticipating about 14 million international visitors this year, down from about 14.6 million in 2008. But the Bangkok riots are expected to direct an additional blow at the travel market -- an estimated drop in international visitors of 20 to 30 percent for the first half this year, according to the tourism authority.
 The Thai government has tried to tamp down tourist jitters. On April 21, Kasit Piromya, the foreign minister, said, ''The protests in Thailand were confined to only a few, one or two spots of Bangkok,'' and in the rest of the city, ''99 percent was life goes on as usual.'' 
 While the United States Embassy advised citizens to avoid areas of demonstration and ''exercise caution anywhere in Bangkok'' during the protests, the State Department did not issue a separate warning or travel alert for the region. It does, however, advise American citizens visiting Bangkok ''to monitor events closely, to avoid any large public gatherings, and to exercise discretion when moving about'' the city. 
 As a result, some travel companies expect visits to drop.
 ''There is always a short-term effect when things like this occur,'' said Rod Cuthbert, founder of Viator.com, which links travelers with local tour operators for sightseeing, including 94 activities in Thailand. Though traffic to the site's Thailand pages remained strong throughout the period of upheaval, he said, ''we expect April and May bookings will be well down.''
 The uncertainty about the situation in Thailand may well damage the country's increasing reputation as a place where travelers can find affordable luxury -- five-star treatment at three-star prices.
 Certainly, some recent deals make Thailand seem like the place to go. Through April, the Metropolitan Bangkok, part of the high-end COMO Hotels and Resorts, offered rooms that are normally $260 a night for $99. 
 The Anantara Golden Triangle Resort and Spa in Northern Thailand, which has an on-site Elephant Camp, is offering three nights for the price of two, with rates from 9,200 baht a night, about $255 at 36 baht to the dollar. Travelers can get an even lower rate (7,600 baht) by booking 50 days in advance. 
 Its sister property Si Kao Resort and Spa, on a southern beach an hour from Krabi's airport, is offering discounts of up to 40 percent off the usual rates of 6,000 baht and up a night, based on how far ahead travelers make their reservations (see www.anantara.com for both resorts). 
 On top of such deals, American travelers have about 11 percent more buying power in Thailand compared with a year ago because the baht has dropped against the dollar. 
 DESPITE televised images of burning buses and armed soldiers squaring off with angry protesters in the streets of Bangkok, some visitors to the city were oblivious to the state of emergency. Agneta Mallenberg, 38, an interior architect, and her friend, Agnieszka Mrugala, 37, a computer programmer, both from Warsaw, were there when the riots started.
 ''I didn't know what happened in Bangkok while we were there,'' said Ms. Mallenberg, while taking a break from shopping in the Jungceylon mall in Phuket. ''My mum wrote me on Facebook that I'm supposed to avoid big crowds. That was the first I heard about it.'' 
 Other vacationers in Thailand also appeared unfazed. Just days after the riots, the boisterous night-life scene in Patong, on Phuket, was still raging, its bars and street stalls thronged with people. 
 Friendly Planet Travel, based in Jenkintown, Pa., sent a group of 26 tourists to Thailand on April 16 for a 12-day tour from Chiang Mai to Bangkok. No one canceled.
 ''September 11 changed forever our way of viewing the world,'' said Peggy Goldman, Friendly Planet's president. ''We have found that our travelers are much more sanguine about facing the world, even during times of instability and unrest.'' 
 Ms. Goldman is planning to go to Bangkok herself this month. 
 ''Quite honestly, we don't have any concerns at this moment,'' she said. ''While there is political instability at this moment, these are generally peaceful, welcoming people who love visitors and treat them with a great deal of respect.''
 Sibel Mulard, 39, an insurance account manager from France who was vacationing in Thailand with her husband, Lionel, and their two young boys, had just arrived on Phuket when the Bangkok riots started and received many calls from concerned family members in France urging her to come back right away. 
 But Ms. Mulard, who said she was more concerned about a tsunami than getting caught up in any violence, was determined to see out her vacation. She pointed out to her family that Phuket is a long way from Bangkok, adding: ''I said, 'I am going to stay. I am not coming back.' '' 
 The Mulards did alter their plans so they would avoid the capital, however, due to the protests. Instead of sightseeing in Bangkok, Ms. Mulard said, ''We will go to the islands.''

HEADLINE: The Homeless Team, Rooting For a New Life Through Soccer

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
The scruffy players in brick-red jerseys and secondhand shoes hailed from Haiti, Togo, Mexico, Honduras and Harlem. The fresh-faced team in black had neatly trimmed hair, new gear and degrees from Carnegie Mellon, Syracuse, Pace and universities in China and Australia. 
 Most of the players in black work together at the Royal Bank of Canada, bonded by the financial cloud hanging over their industry. The reds, too, are united by financial circumstance, sharing a temporary address, 1 Wards Island: a homeless shelter.
 They faced off the other night at Chelsea Piers, perhaps Manhattan's premier soccer spot for young professionals, and this spring also the base for the newest team in Street Soccer USA, a 16-city network of homeless players that started in 2005 in Charlotte, N.C., and is under the umbrella of Help USA, a national homeless services provider.
 The idea behind homeless soccer is something like this: Take a group of poor people, disconnected from the regular rhythms of life, lacking both physical exercise and much to look forward to. Add soccer. 
 In Ann Arbor, Mich., and Austin, Tex., Minneapolis, St. Louis and Washington, the program has been credited with helping players pull themselves out of homelessness. There is even a Homeless World Cup. This year's, the seventh, is scheduled for September in Milan.
 ''When I'm out there, I feel like I can't do any wrong,'' said Dexter Burnett, 47, who played soccer in his native Jamaica, where his speed earned him the nickname Pepper. He was laid off last fall from a job as a medical assistant. ''It allows me not to think about my situation so much and just relax and enjoy the moment.''
 The league is the brainchild of Lawrence Cann, 31, once a nationally ranked soccer player at Davidson College, who moved in the fall from Charlotte to New York, with one of the nation's largest homeless populations, estimated at 35,000, but no established homeless soccer team.
 With the help of a few volunteers, Mr. Cann cleared out a dusty gymnasium that had previously been used for storage at the shelter on Wards Island, a patch of land in the East River. He recruited a few reluctant players, promising they would not be punished for missing the standard 10 p.m. shelter curfew.
 At an early practice on a rainy night in March, a couple of the 15 people standing expectantly in a circle had evidently been drinking. Most spoke little English. And they did not even know one another's names. 
 ''Hey, you,'' one player called out before kicking a clumsy pass that landed far from its target. 
 Taking note, Mr. Cann imported a drill familiar to early practices of soccer teams everywhere: Before making a pass, the kicker had to call out the name of the receiver. He gave instructions in English and Spanish. He declared that anybody who showed up drunk or high would not participate that night (but could return the next week). And between running, passing and shooting, players are expected to talk to the coach about their goals outside soccer, their job searches and their state of mind.
 Of the 30 people who have turned out for a practice, only six have not returned a second time.
 ''You need something to occupy your time around here,'' said Woods Matthews, 45, a regular whose long braid swings when he plays. ''That's why people get so mad around the shelter. We don't get any exercise, we're all cooped up, and then people get in fights.'' 
 As the players smoothed their ragged edges, Mr. Cann began to look for opponents.
 Chelsea Piers, with its state-of-the-art facilities, is among the city's most expensive places to play -- $2,450 per team for 10 games -- and normally has a waiting list of more than 25 teams. But the bad economy led a lot of corporate-sponsored teams to drop out. Mr. Cann raised the entry fee, Nike donated equipment, and Chelsea Piers provided matching jerseys, as it does for all the teams that play there.
 Just getting to the field is a 70-minute trek: the M35 bus to Harlem, a downtown train, then a half-mile walk to the West Side Highway. 
 The homeless players lost their debut game, 14-4, playing without a single substitute. The next week, they faced a team from Bloomberg, the financial information company, whose players were politely intrigued.
 ''I guess I figure being homeless, they'll play pretty aggressively,'' predicted Louis Brun, 22. 
 Street Soccer NY lost again, 11-5. As the teams headed to the locker room, Mr. Burnett chatted up an opponent, asking if Bloomberg was hiring. 
 ''If these guys can get out there, feel comfortable talking to new people, and not get frustrated, then it's really going to help them integrate,'' Mr. Cann said. ''Then eventually they'll keep jobs and not get kicked out of their apartments.'' 
 He is already seeing progress: One player left the shelter and returned to his family. Another, Jarvis Strose, who had refused to meet with caseworkers and regularly missed curfew over two years of homelessness, arrived promptly at practice every week. A caseworker told Mr. Cann that a third man, who had developed a nervous disorder after being beaten in prison, was beginning to recover from his trauma because of the exercise.
 On Tuesday, Street Soccer NY met the team made up mostly of Royal Bank of Canada workers, called the Gunners.
 Chris Lodgson, 25, who plays center back on the homeless team, came straight from his new job at the cafe at Bloomingdale's; he was planning to move from the shelter to an apartment in Washington Heights. He will continue to play with Street Soccer, which he said has been instrumental in his getting back on his feet.
 ''I don't want to say it's a return to being normal, but it makes me feel like myself again,'' he said. ''Two weeks ago, that was, like, the first time in a while that I forgot. I forgot where I was and what was going on.'' 
 The red team took an early lead, passing fluidly, players calling one another by name. Players from the adjacent field wandered over to watch. 
 ''Is that the homeless team?'' asked one. ''Wow,'' he said, cocking an eyebrow. ''They're good.'' 
 Mr. Strose scored his fourth goal of the game, panting with exhaustion as he ran off the field. When Mr. Matthews, sent in to substitute, kicked for a goal but missed the ball entirely, his teammates shouted encouragement.
 ''When we started, they didn't know how to play,'' Mr. Cann said. ''They didn't know how to pass. They didn't trust each other.'' 
 Final score: Homeless 10, Bankers 4. 
 Mr. Cann, surrounded by celebrating players, looked relieved. ''We really needed a win,'' he said.
 Still clapping, he called out to his team, ''Shake hands!''

HEADLINE: Gliding Along the 'Forgotten Coast' of Florida

BYLINE: By TRISTRAM KORTEN

 BODY:
ON the morning we launched our kayaks from the boat ramp, it was sunny with a few fat white clouds drifting across a blue sky. We pushed off and glided out of the mouth of the Apalachicola River, slipping pass stalks of cattails and muddy little peninsulas, and into Apalachicola Bay off the Florida Panhandle. 
 From there, we paddled for three hours to St. George Island, where we hugged the shore, thick with spindly slash pines and gnarled coastal live oaks, for 13 miles. There were no fishermen, no boats and no one combing the bone-white beaches. Herons stalked the shoreline, freezing in midstep to cock their heads and stare at us. The scenery was so devoid of humanity that we could have been Seminole Indians push-poling cypress dugouts 200 years ago.
 This was the beginning of a three-day journey along Florida's so-called Forgotten Coast that I took with Peter Taylor, a friend from North Carolina. We were following part of the Florida Circumnavigational Saltwater Paddling Trail, a 1,600-mile byway that was charted by the state's Office of Greenways and Trails between 2004 and 2007. 
 It starts at the Big Lagoon State Park near Pensacola and follows the Florida peninsula down the west coast, along the Keys and back up the east coast before ending at Fort Clinch State Park near the Georgia border. Its epic length is the saltwater equivalent of the Appalachian Trail. 
 Twenty-six map segments, available online, were meticulously charted right down to GPS coordinates for all the campsites.
 I've never been an ambitious kayaker, but hearing about the trail triggered my wanderlust. Poring over the online maps, I learned the route is not exactly a direct loop. Since muscle-powered crafts need protection from the dangers of open water, the byway snakes through rivers that parallel the coast, veers into the Intracoastal Waterway and courses in and around the state's many islands.
 Doug Alderson, the Florida Paddling Trails coordinator, spent four years mapping the trail. He recommended following a portion of the Forgotten Coast, a 300-mile stretch of largely pristine shoreline along the Gulf of Mexico, where Florida's Panhandle meets the state's Big Bend region. ''You could go a couple of days and not see any buildings,'' Mr. Alderson said. 
 That would make a nice contrast to the motorboat-clogged waterways near my home in South Florida. We started the trip in Apalachicola, about 80 miles southwest of Tallahassee, launching from the boat ramp of the Wheelhouse restaurant (since renamed the Up the Creek Raw Bar). We arranged with the owner, Larry Covell, who also runs an eco-tour company, to pick us up (for a small fee) at the end of our journey. 
 We pushed off into the bay against a dogged headwind, gliding past wooden oyster boats bobbing at anchor. Each boat's two-man crew was collecting oysters the same way their great-grandfathers did: One man stood on the gunwale with long tongs clawing up mouthfuls of bay mud. He then dumped his haul in front of a culler, who sifted through the debris for the delicious mollusks. On many of the boats, the culler sat under an umbrella for shade. 
 Sit-on-top kayaks carried us through the water. Many paddlers prefer the drier sit-inside kayaks for expeditions, but ours had watertight bulkheads in the bow and stern to store our gear: tents, small coolers with ice, watertight sacks stuffed with clothing and food, and jugs of water. (The general rule is to carry a gallon a day a person.) The water was a balmy 68 to 70 degrees that September day, so getting splashed was not exactly a hardship.
 My shoulders, meanwhile, were beginning to feel the burn of paddling for several hours against the wind. When the shoreline of the 28-mile-long St. George Island came into view, I picked out a slash of white beach amid the gray tree trunks, alerted Peter, and made a sprint with the last of my energy to get there.
 Apparently, my depth perception was off. It wasn't a beach, but a sandbar several yards offshore, a naked tongue of sharp oyster shells with no trees for shade. We hauled up and collapsed on what felt like a bed of nails.
 St. Vincent, Little St. George (created by a manmade channel), St. George and Dog Islands are the last in a chain of barrier islands formed by sediment from several mainland rivers. They are sandy and sparsely inhabited, and much of their area is park or preserved land. The terrain is a cross between a lush bayou and a Caribbean island. Eagle and osprey nests loom atop dead tree trunks draped in Spanish moss, and palmetto shrubs fan out in the underbrush.
 After resting for an hour, we pushed east along the north side of St. George Island, hoping to reach our campsite before sundown. We found our spot in the park just as dusk was descending, pulling the kayaks onto a sandy spit amid sea oats and sawgrass. We staked our tents and began stoking a fire in an old fire pit. That's when a park ranger pulled up in an S.U.V. 
 I should mention here that despite the fact that the trail's maps all code the campsites with GPS coordinates, Peter and I scorned that crutch of modern technology. We decided to be old fashioned and used a hand-held compass and paper map. The ranger pointed out that we had missed our mark and landed in a camp reserved for Boy Scouts. Our campsite was a half-mile across the water, which might as well have been 100 miles given how tired we were. 
 The ranger, thankfully, took pity on us and called her supervisor, who cleared us for the night, a glorious three-quarter-moon affair. 
 Sleeping arrangements settled, we started on dinner. Peter began excitedly waving around a plastic bag with what looked like wood chips in it -- I later learned the chips were some sort of dehydrated ''food'' used by campers. I countered with two marbled rib-eye steaks, which had been on ice since morning. 
 Then, while waiting for the fire to ash over, I made some ti-punch -- lime juice, sugar and rum. The key to roughing it, after all, is not really roughing it, something a kayak makes imminently more easy than it would be hiking. A couple of filets mignons remained frozen in the cooler. Then, we relaxed as stars crowded out the night sky.
 In the morning, I stepped out of the tent to a cool breeze and whitecaps on St. George Sound. My aching shoulders drooped at the sight. Just then, an osprey with a six-foot wingspan dropped out of the sky 20 yards in front of me, crashed into the water and skewered a writhing mullet with its talons. I was stunned out of my self-pity.
 By midmorning, the wind died down, transforming the day into another ideal one for a paddle. We glided over glassy water. Peter spotted a bald eagle. We both noticed a lemon shark swim sinuously beneath us. Undaunted by aerial assaults, mullets continued to splash. 
 At lunchtime, we pulled up onto another crystalline beach on St. George and ate sandwiches under the shade of cabbage palms and oaks. By midafternoon, we made our way to the easternmost end of the island and began crossing the mile-long East Pass to Dog Island. Glancing to my right, I caught my first glimpse of the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico. 
 Once across the pass, we stopped for what should have been a quick rest before crossing St. George Sound back to the mainland, since there were no legal campsites on Dog Island. But it turned into a lazy late afternoon. We took a relaxing swim, then ran alongside two massive spotted eagle rays as they skimmed the shoreline in ankle deep water. 
 By then, dark storm clouds were gathering, making us less inclined to jump back into our kayaks and madly paddle back about three miles across the water. Resigned to our fate as outlaw campers (which had everything to do with our poor planning, and nothing to do with the trail map), we seared the filets mignons on a portable grill and lounged in the tepid surf. 
 By morning the storm had passed, but the wind was blowing a good 20 miles an hour, whipping up three-foot seas. Groggy as I was, I didn't recoil in horror this time. I looked forward to the challenge, now seemingly much more fun than when we had started out. My muscles had grown used to the paddling, and the way the wildlife kept thrusting itself upon us made me wonder what might be next. 
 For the first time during the trip, I felt the need to strap on a life vest as we launched into the surf. The town of Carabelle, back on the mainland, was a glimpse on a bobbing horizon. Saltwater slapped my face. 
 A mile out, with the water crashing over my bow, Peter pointed off his starboard side: cresting the waves a few yards away was the gleaming gray back of a dolphin. It was sidling alongside us, as if it knew we needed all the help we could get navigating home. 
 GRAB A PADDLE
 Maps of all 26 segments of the Florida Circumnavigational Saltwater Paddling Trail are available at www.dep.state.fl.us/gwt/paddling/saltwater.htm. Though the maps include GPS coordinates and contact information for campsites, the office of Greenways and Trails recommends supplementing them with NOAA charts and a GPS unit. 
 Tallahassee Regional Airport is the closest airport to Apalachicola, about 75 miles northeast.
 Apalachicola has several lodging options, including the Water Street Hoteland Marina (888-211-9239; www.waterstreethotel.com), where rooms start at $139, and the Apalachicola River Inn (850-653-8139; www.apalachicolariverinn.com), where rooms start at $119.
 On St. George Island, there are only two lodging options other than campsites: the St. George Inn, (850-927-2903; www.stgeorgeinn.com), which offers a third night free during the week, has rooms from $90; and the Buccaneer Inn (800-847-2091; www.buccinn.com), with rooms from $85. 
 Wheelhouse Tours (850-653-6032; www.wheelhousetours.com), with advance notice, can supply kayaks and a shuttle service for kayakers venturing upriver or along the Saltwater Paddling Trail. Rates depend on distance. 
 Journeys of St. George Island (850-927-3259; www.sgislandjourneys.com) rents kayaks for $50 or $60 a day and $100 to $150 for five days. It also offers overnight guided kayak trips from October through December, starting at $150 a day, and provides a shuttle service, at 60 cents a mile, for the independent-minded overnight paddler. 
 Options abound for good seafood, including a mainstay of the area's economy, the Apalachicola Bay oyster. The oysters cost $5.99 a dozen at Up the Creek Raw Bar (313 Water Street, Apalachicola; 850-653-2525). On St. George Island, they are $8 a dozen at Eddy Teach's Raw Bar (850-927-5050).

HEADLINE: Do Our Universities Need a Makeover?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''End the University as We Know It,'' by Mark C. Taylor (Op-Ed, April 27):
 Scholars in the United States have grown accustomed to the crass anti-intellectualism of some of their critics outside the academy. It is alarming and embarrassing to hear the same rhetoric within the ranks of my own institution. 
 Mr. Taylor's absurd and dangerous proposals to abolish departments and tenure would risk trading serious -- and sometimes, yes, specialized and unpopular -- scholarship for fashionable but intellectually shallow and incoherent commodities. 
 Good interdisciplinary work often presupposes expertise within traditional disciplines, just as tenure protects scholars and teachers from prevailing prejudices and the whims of the market. 
 Mr. Taylor's bizarre comparison of academic peer review with unregulated financial markets demonstrates incomprehension of the nature and purpose of higher education.
 Taylor Carman New York, April 27, 2009
 The writer is a professor of philosophy at Barnard College, Columbia University.
 To the Editor:
 Mark C. Taylor's argument is intended to poison the waters of higher education without offering a real antidote. Further, it plays into the hands of the vociferous but uninformed skeptics of education (too often state and local legislators) who seem to have all the answers but little data to support them. 
 Mr. Taylor's complaint about ''narrow scholarship'' doesn't acknowledge the importance of specialization. His suggestion to do away with tenure provides no provision for protecting academic freedom, even though the dangers that existed when tenure was originally created still exist. He would discriminate against older professors and punish deserving, productive faculty members in the name of reform. 
 Real reform and restructuring are desperately needed, but not the type driven by political pandering or trendy notions about obsolescence in academia.
 James Leve Flagstaff, Ariz., April 27, 2009
 The writer is an associate professor of musicology at Northern Arizona University.
 To the Editor:
 Mark C. Taylor, a former colleague, raises some good points. Abolishing tenure is not one of them. 
 Fellow professors across the country will be surprised at the hidden inference that tenure is now old-fashioned because McCarthyism is dead. It was only a few months ago that Sarah Palin attacked Barack Obama for associating with ''yet another radical professor from the neighborhood.'' 
 Tenure protects free thinkers (like Mr. Taylor) from the pitchforks of the current mob, and until human nature changes will always be needed. 
 Steven B. Gerrard Williamstown, Mass., April 27, 2009
 The writer is a professor of philosophy and chairman of the Program in Jewish Studies at Williams College.
 To the Editor:
 Michael C. Taylor's admirable vision of the university is one in which scholars from varied disciplines and institutions are in continual dialogue, where words, topics and problems are evolving with new discoveries and insights, and where teaching is intertwined with learning. But it is not clear that the reforms he proposes will bring us there. 
 To take one of Mr. Taylor's proposed ''problem-focused'' topics: it is nice to imagine that the topic of ''Mind'' would be pursued by neuroscientists, psychologists, novelists and philosophers working together, and that they would draw on both Aristotle and the latest experimental findings. 
 But would that actually happen? Or would a powerful kind of groupthink concerning what is important arise, as less ''useful'' and ''relevant'' forms of knowledge were shunned? 
 Whatever its flaws, the present structure of universities is preferable to what Mr. Taylor proposes, unless it is accompanied by a radical change in ethos. 
 William Selinger Cambridge, Mass., April 28, 2009
 The writer is a graduate student in the department of government at Harvard.
 To the Editor:
 Doctoral programs that fail to place their graduates in research positions should not respond by attempting to become M.B.A. or M.P.A. programs. Instead, they would better serve their prospective students by setting the right expectations through full disclosure of their recent graduate placement history. With this information, applicants could make informed decisions when choosing a graduate school. 
 Rather than attempting to compete with the many excellent graduate programs that already exist to train managers, doctoral programs that cannot place their graduates in research positions should consider accepting fewer students and concentrating their resources.
 James F. Mahon III Chicago, April 27, 2009
 The writer, a research assistant at the University of Chicago, will be a doctoral student in the political economy and government program at Harvard in the fall.
 To the Editor:
 Mark C. Taylor's suggestions for ending the university as we know it will not lead to significant change, and what he leaves out is more important than what he puts in his formula for change. 
 Who is going to make the decision after seven years on program and faculty renewal? Who is going to decide which ''problems'' are going to be part of the bold new curriculum? Probably the faculty or a faculty-administrative team will make such decisions -- so why should we expect any significant changes? 
 Universities will not change until three things happen. The first is the need for strict accountability and assessment of learning outcomes. The second is developing a faculty that is much more representative of the students it teaches. And third, American higher education should not be treated as a business and run as one. 
 The bottom line should be intellectual and not financial. The American university must be responsible for increasing the intellectual capital so important to the country's future. 
 David A. Caputo New York, April 27, 2009
 The writer is emeritus president of Pace University.
 To the Editor:
 My fellow ''underpaid graduate students'' at Columbia and I were extremely disappointed by Mark C. Taylor's characterization of the goals and principles of academia.
 First, absent the intellectual frameworks provided by disciplines, scholars would be no more insightful about things like ''Space'' or ''Water'' than middle-schoolers working on a science-fair project. 
 It may be true that in a department with a broad topical focus like religion, approaches are varied. But my fellow political scientists will tell you that our discipline, and many others, provide unique approaches to our questions.
 Second, the article betrays a far too market-centered approach to academia. Doctoral candidates are aware that their chosen fields may not bring them the material rewards Mr. Taylor emphasizes. But we would do well to remember that we do so above all for the knowledge -- and, indeed, the theoretical and methodological tools -- that we acquire in our intellectual pursuits.
 Jessamyn Blau New York, April 27, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Duns Scotus's reputation is safe, as is Gerard Manley Hopkins's wonderful sonnet to the Subtle Doctor, ''of realty the rarest-veined unraveller.''
 In fact, it would do us good to ask some of the basic questions that the medieval scholastics pondered about: the nature of things, objects and ideas. There are nasty gaps in our education.
 The public scorn of not-understood subjects has been the prerogative of elected officials, not scholars. I hope we are not about to have a cultural revolution from the top, with the automatic presumption that scholarship corrupts. 
 If a medievalist finds something interesting or innovative in the old philosophers' use of citations, it's for the other medievalists, her peers and mentors, to judge and to help her with. 
 By what right do we ridicule a scholarly topic as if it is a government order for thousand-dollar toilet seats?

HEADLINE: 619,284.5 Miles and Counting

BYLINE: By RICHARD S. CHANG

DATELINE: SIMSBURY, Conn. 

 BODY:
 IF you visit Richard Fuchs, an inventor with six patents -- ''all income generators,'' he says -- you are likely to see a few curious things.
 Mr. Fuchs might walk you to the back patio and ask you to push a metal switch, which automatically opens an umbrellalike line for drying clothes.
 In the kitchen, you would encounter a sink that operates without faucet handles. Nudge the left cabinet door below the sink with your knee to get hot water. Push the right cabinet for cold. 
 There are other inventions, devices and models lying around his modest suburban house, but you are most likely to end up in the garage where he parks his 1971 Ford Mustang, which has gone more than 600,000 miles and counting.
 And counting is what Mr. Fuchs does.
 Actually more than count -- he has two 2-inch-thick binders in which he has logged every mile, every trip, every hour and every fill-up relating to the car. Indeed, counting does not do Mr. Fuchs's endeavor justice. While the Mustang packs a 351 cubic-inch Cleveland V-8 with a four-barrel carburetor, Mr. Fuchs has spent most of his life in pursuit of low fuel consumption.
 ''First drive, 13 miles, from the dealership,'' reads the first line of the log, which included details of his first fill-up. ''I averaged 16.3 miles per gallon and spent $6.81 on gas.'' 
 Wearing a loose red-and-green flannel shirt and dark brown corduroy pants, Mr. Fuchs sat at a table in his clean, sparse kitchen, hunched over the log as if he were analyzing satellite data. He is 81 years old and ''speeding up,'' he says. The log charts are neatly delineated in columns for date, mileage, fuel economy and notes. He brought out a magnifying glass.
 ''Here, I changed the rear axle ratio from 3.25 to 2.75,'' he said. ''I guessed I would get a 12 percent improvement. That's what I got.''
 There was a vacation in 1974. ''Gas at Youngstown, I got 18.85 miles per gallon, driving between 60 and 70 miles per hour,'' he said softly, running his index finger down the page. ''Gas at Joliet, 19.4. Gas at North Platte, Neb., 16.8. Gas at Rock Springs, Wyo., 23.4. Gas at Rigby, 20.6.''
 He went to Lake Powell on the Utah-Arizona border. ''I got 20.3,'' he said. ''The next time I gassed up, I got 19.5.'' ''I went to Bremerton, Wash., where my brother was stationed and got 20.5.'' He moved his finger down the page, and one can almost see Mr. Fuchs roaming the west in the black Mustang. ''Here, I gassed in Kansas City and used the air-conditioner for four hours and got 22.5.''
 Keeping the engine clean is an important factor in fuel efficiency. Every once in a while, Mr. Fuchs takes the entire ignition system out of his car (spark plugs, plug wires, distributor and ignition coil) and hooks the various parts up to a diagnostic machine he keeps in his basement. (He built that machine, too.) 
 It basically provides an EKG for the ignition system. Thumbing through his log, he came across a detailed graph dotted with points, all connected by lines drawn in pencil and red ink.
 Mr. Fuchs has always built things. When he was a child he built scooters. ''I made one out of a Rollerfast bicycle, put in a Briggs & Stratton engine,'' he said.
 He built two cars before he was old enough to drive and parked them in front of his family's apartment
 ''The chief of police lived upstairs,'' Mr. Fuchs recalled. ''He saw the cars and told me, 'I know you're not old enough for a driver license, but get plates.''' 
 Mr. Fuch's first solo invention was a putty remover. ''It takes out one foot of hard putty in a minute and a half without damaging the wood,'' he said. It was a success, paving the way for a career as a full-time inventor. His other inventions are an ignition diagnostic gauge and an electric knife sharpener, for which he recently reacquired the rights and is making improvements. Asked how he became an inventor, he paused and said, ''The thing is, there has to be a better way.'' He smiled.
 Mr. Fuchs bought his Mustang new in 1971. ''I paid a dollar a pound,'' he said. The car weighed about 3,400 pounds. His bill of sale, which is the first page in the first binder, lists the price he paid: $3,310.
 The car is almost completely original, he said. Though not restored, it is kept in great shape. A small crease mars the trunk lid, and there are some cracks in the paint here and there. He took out the back seat some time ago (''They're useless unless you're 4 or 5 years old'') and replaced the front ones with Volvo seats from a junkyard. In the trunk, Mr. Fuchs installed a second gas tank to give him a total of 40 gallons of capacity.
 ''Here I did local sloppy driving, averaging 58.11 miles an hour, and got 21.86 miles per gallon,'' he said. ''Dragging my little trailer with a boat in the back: 58.63 miles an hour and got 18.57 miles per gallon.''
 He went on: ''Here's a weird one. Local driving and trip to Mystic, the seaport, for the boat show'' -- 49.38 and 18.43.
 To date, Mr. Fuchs has driven the Mustang a total of 619,284.5 miles in 12,339.5 hours (an average of 50.2 miles an hour over that span). He said that when he first bought the Mustang he expected to drive it for 400,000 miles.
 But why would someone look for fuel economy in a sporty car with a V-8 engine?
 ''Every man has his weakness,'' he said. ''It can be booze, women, gambling. I have a weakness. I can't refuse a challenge.''

HEADLINE: With Ties Around Globe, Marathoner Racks Up Miles

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY

 BODY:
If geography is indeed destiny, Mara Yamauchi has been in all the right places for a marathoner.
 Her early childhood was spent in Kenya, where she was named for the Mara River and grew up in the high-altitude heartland of the long-distance runner. Her adolescence and early adulthood were spent in Britain, the same nation that would produce the world-record holder Paula Radcliffe. And Yamauchi's first career and the love of her life deepened her ties with Japan, where she lives and trains in a culture that places marathoners and personal sacrifice on a pedestal, and has produced two of the last three women's Olympic champions.
 ''I love Mara's story; I think she's got the best of all worlds in many ways,'' said Mary Wittenberg, president of the New York Road Runners and race director of the New York City Marathon. 
 Remove one link from the intercontinental chain that runs through Yamauchi's colorful, high-achieving life and she probably would not have been where she was last Sunday: finishing the London Marathon in second place at age 35 in 2 hours 23 minutes 12 seconds, her best.
 That was quick work for someone who has been a full-time runner only since 2006. Late bloomers are not uncommon in the marathon, but no late arrival has bloomed quite to this extent in marathon's professional era.
 ''Wear and tear over the years probably counts for something,'' Yamauchi said last week in a telephone interview. ''If you look at really great marathon runners of the past, a lot of them have only had a certain number of years or races where they've really performed at their best, and then they've gotten injuries or just haven't been able to produce performances like they previously had. But because I'm still sort of young as an athlete, I still have room for improvement.''
 In 2006, Yamauchi took a leave from the British Foreign Office, where she had been working as a diplomat since earning degrees from Oxford University and the London School of Economics.
 ''I'm really glad I did spend years working, because I think it does give you perspective on life outside the sport, and I learned a lot of skills that have been very useful in my running career,'' she said. ''Things like setting objectives, problem solving and identifying what you need in terms of resources to achieve your objective. Of course, ability and how hard you train is important at the level I'm at, but I think things which are more important are things like how you organize your life, and who you have around you helping you, along with your mental attitude and leadership. 
 ''It's almost like you are the head of a little company, and you have to lead it and manage it and make sure it has the right resources. It probably sounds terrible, me talking about people like my husband in that way, but it's true.''
 Yamauchi's husband is Shigetoshi Yamauchi, who is her trainer and full-time support system. They met in 2001 near the end of her four-year diplomatic posting in Tokyo, where her running was largely recreational.
 ''I tried just to keep my fitness going,'' she said. ''Cycling to work, netball and running three or four times a week. But I never gave up this dream to become a top athlete.''
 Her older sister Malindi, named for the Kenyan port city, had achieved it: winning a world championship in rowing in lightweight pairs in 2000. Now it was time for Mara, an accomplished cross-country runner during her years at Oxford, to focus on the finish line. After she and Shigetoshi married in 2002, they moved to Britain, where she became a part-time employee for the foreign office to increase her training load. Though Shigetoshi worked in financial services and had no elite running background, they gradually came to the mutual decision that for her running career to flourish, they would both need to dedicate to it full time. 
 The decision was made in the run-up to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.
 ''Financially, it was quite a gamble, but we thought it was a once-in-a-lifetime thing,'' Mara said.
 It may not work out that way. Yamauchi finished sixth in Beijing, equaling the best Olympic performance by a British woman in the marathon. Her times have continued to drop, and, if she can remain healthy and motivated, she intends to push on to the London Olympics in 2012, when she will be 38, like Radcliffe.
 Consider that last year's winner in Beijing was Constantina Tomescu-Dita of Romania, was 38.
 Radcliffe is a major star in part because the British have followed her big highs and brutal lows for more than a decade. Socks pulled high and head twisting with effort, she has won the world championship, won marathons in New York and London and set an ethereal world record of 2:15:25 in 2003. But she also ended up in tears at the last two Olympics, wilting in the Athens heat in 2004 and placing 23rd last year.
 Radcliffe's travails in Beijing were a much bigger story than Yamauchi's angst-free sixth-place finish, although the British news media is beginning to dig in to the possibilities of Paula versus Mara.
 But Yamauchi is a compelling story. Her British parents lived in Kenya for 25 years before returning to Oxford when she was 8. Her father, Norman Myers, now a prominent environmentalist and professor, once held the record for the fastest ascent and descent of Mount Kilimanjaro.
 Yamauchi credits some of her aerobic endurance to the early years spent at altitude in Nairobi.
 ''Because I grew up there, and it was a very special place for my parents and I have a Kenyan name, I feel quite a strong link with Kenya,'' she said. ''But because I was 8 when I left, which is really quite a young age, I have quite a patchy memory of my life there.''
 She speaks only a few words of Swahili. Her Japanese is much stronger, as is her link to a place where marathon running is a major sport. But that link was created because the foreign office assigned her to Japan in 1998 instead of one of her other four choices: Indonesia, Singapore, Venezuela and the Philippines.
 ''Had I gone to any of those places, my life would be totally different now,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Wartime Wives, Living in a Shadow of Uncertainty

BYLINE: By NAOMI SIEGEL

 BODY:
Reality television's saucy, often spacey ''real housewives'' of Orange County, Atlanta and New York City should sit up and take notice. ''The Housewives of Mannheim'' have come to town -- working-class Brooklyn neighbors, circa 1944. Single mothers, their husbands serving in the military, they struggle with food rations and black-market haggling, with rumors of unimaginable atrocities in Europe and with their own inchoate yearnings for growth and change. 
 Giving voice to these women whose lives and dreams informed his own youth, the playwright Alan Brody exploited his finely tuned ear for dialogue and keen sense of place and time to produce this deeply satisfying 1995 work. If ''Housewives'' becomes somewhat polemical as Act II unfolds, it remains engrossing drama. 
 New Jersey Repertory Company, under SuzAnne Barabas's sterling direction, is presenting an exquisitely acted production of the play, the first in what Mr. Brody calls his ''Victory Blues Trilogy.'' The title refers to a fictitious painting by Vermeer that figures in the plot; Ms. Barabas used elements from four of the artist's works to create a collaged image that appears onstage at the end of the play. 
 ''The Housewives of Mannheim'' captures the yin and yang of everyday living in the shadow of a looming catastrophe. Strains of ''Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy'' are in the air as the period-perfect kitchen of May Black, the vortex around whom the action swirls, comes into view. (Where did Jessica Parks, the properties manager, ever find those hulking white-enamel appliances, that ancient radio console, the battered cooking utensils that enliven Quinn K. Stone's wonderfully detailed setting?)
 The alluring May, played with a luminous ingenuousness by Phoenix Vaughn, is chatting with her yenta neighbor, the censorious know-it-all Alice Cohen (Wendy Peace in a spot-on portrayal). Before long, another neighbor, Billie Friedhoff, appears. Smartly dressed in a black fedora and clinging knit ensemble (Patricia E. Doherty's costumes are sensational), Billie wastes no time in letting us know she is one tough cookie. Bad-mouthing her dentist husband, Irving, the only spouse of the three women not in the service, she inspires Alice to make a quick exit. Corey Tazmania is moving as Billie, hardboiled yet heartbreakingly vulnerable. 
 May notes that her neighbors, the Kaufmans, have moved out from the apartment across the way. Thinking about her absent husband, Lenny, she ruefully wonders what she and her friends will be like ''when the men get home...how different he'll be, how different I'll be.''
 Enter Sophie Birnbaum, a former concert pianist and refugee from the Holocaust who is settling into the Kaufmans' apartment. Played elegantly with a heady dose of Old World mystery by Natalie Mosco, Sophie has moved from Greenwich, Conn., where she lived with her husband, who has recently died. Sophie becomes a mentor and spiritual guide to the questing May. Their burgeoning friendship disturbs the equilibrium of all four women's relationships and is the catalyst for a shocking confrontation between May and Billie that ends Act I.
 Mr. Brody studiously works the themes of difference, change and growth as his characters grapple with issues of sexuality and gender identity. Once Sophie's arrival opens their emotional floodgates, the ''Mannheim housewives'' are never the same. With a comforting and upbeat Act II resolution, it would seem that Mr. Brody truly believes in the power of sisterhood to effect healing and catharsis.

HEADLINE: New Yorkers Miss Refinancing Spree

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
REFINANCING typically soars when long-term mortgage rates drop, and recent history is no exception -- except in New York.
 There was a 92 percent rise in mortgage-refinancing transactions nationwide in the first three months of this year over the corresponding period last year. But New York State had just a 6 percent bump.
 In a state filled with expensive homes and big mortgages, the below-5-percent interest rates being dangled in front of borrowers are not available to many New York homeowners, for various reasons. Others may be deterred by the high mortgage tax. 
 ''It's shocking to see that New York fared so badly,'' said Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance Publications, a provider of data and analysis in Bethesda, Md., which provided the state and national statistics. 
 Analysts at Inside Mortgage Finance recently looked at mortgages refinanced with loans backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored businesses that buy mortgages from lenders. Those loans make up a vast majority of the nation's mortgages, but have strings attached.
 One is that the lowest rates are only for mortgages of up to $417,000 -- rarer in New York than elsewhere, because of high house prices -- made to applicants with stellar credit, plenty of equity in the home and a steady, documentable income. Mortgages of up to $417,000 are known as ''conforming'' loans.
 Fannie and Freddie also accept bigger mortgages -- known as agency-jumbo loans -- in costlier areas like Manhattan and some New York City suburbs. In Manhattan and Hudson County, N.J., for instance, the loan limit is $729,750, and in Fairfield County, Conn., the limit is $708,750. The limits earlier this year were lower. 
 But even those who can refinance a home with a loan of $417,001 to $729,750 cannot get the best deals, because lenders view such borrowers as riskier than those below the $417,000 threshold. Lenders charge as much as a quarter of a percentage point more for such loans.
 And that's just a starting point. Fannie and Freddie will add other fees for borrowers who, for instance, have credit scores of less than 720, or for co-op owners with less than 25 percent equity, to name just two factors. Lenders typically build those fees into a loan's interest rate -- which is how an advertised rate of 4.5 percent can quickly turn into an actual rate of 5.25 percent or more.
 But Connecticut and New Jersey also have substantial areas of high-cost housing, where agency-jumbo loans would come into play, and refinancing there has risen sharply. Connecticut's refinance rate has jumped 73 percent from last year, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, and New Jersey's 72 percent.
 One explanation is New York State's mortgage tax, which generally has to be paid each time there is a new mortgage, even to the same owner. That makes the cost of refinancing higher than it is in most other states. The tax varies by county; in New York City, it is 2.05 percent on loans under $500,000. Borrowers who refinance can sometimes avoid the tax if the lender agrees to treat the new loan as essentially an extension of the old one. These so-called ''consolidation and extension'' arrangements have been harder to arrange recently, however. Without one, a borrower refinancing a mortgage just under $500,000 in Manhattan would face about $10,000 in taxes. 
 Richard J. Biondi, president of the New York Association of Mortgage Brokers, said that many people who want to refinance owe more on their homes than they are worth. In industry parlance, this is known as being ''underwater'' on one's loan.
 Until recently, such owners had few good prospects for refinancing. But Mr. Biondi says that is changing, with the introduction last month of the Refi Plus program from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
 Under this program, borrowers who are slightly underwater can qualify for new loans covering the amount of the remaining mortgage at the best-prevailing rates, if they have a history of on-time mortgage payments and are otherwise financially sound.
 Mr. Biondi says one limit of the program is that borrowers with Freddie Mac loans have a harder time qualifying for a refinance than those with Fannie Mae loans.

HEADLINE: After the Great Recession

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
David Leonhardt is an economics columnist for The Times and a staff writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
On April 14,President Obama gave a speech at Georgetown University, trying to explain why he was taking on so many economic issues so early in his administration. He argued that the country needed to break its bubble-and-bust cycle and cited the New Testament in calling for a new economic foundation for the nation. This foundation would be built on better schools, alternative energy, more affordable health care and a more regulated Wall Street, he said. Later that afternoon (shortly before the Obama family introduced its new dog, Bo, on the South Lawn of the White House), I sat down with the president to talk about how his agenda might change daily life in this country.
 This was our third interview about the economy, the first two occurring during last year's campaign. And while the setting was decidedly more formal this time -- the Oval Office -- the interview felt as conversational as those earlier ones. We sat at the far end of the office from his desk and spoke for 50 minutes. None of his economic advisers were there. As the conversation progressed, Obama spoke in increasingly personal terms. What follows is a lightly edited transcript of that interview. 
 At the end of our conversation, when I asked him if he was reading anything good, he said he had become sick enough of briefing books to begin reading a novel in the evenings -- ''Netherland,'' by Joseph O'Neill.
 I. The Future of Finance
 Q:The idea here is to look beyond the current moment and try to think about what American life is going to be like on the other side of the so-called Great Recession. And so I thought it might make sense to start where the trouble started -- finance. People who want to get a sense for how you think about education and jobs and all sorts of other issues can get a really good sense for your thinking by reading ''The Audacity of Hope,'' or by reading your old speeches, where you basically lay out your learning curve. But there's no chapter on finance in ''The Audacity of Hope.'' And so I wonder if you would be willing to describe a little bit of your learning curve about finance, and what you envision finance being in tomorrow's economy: Does it need to be smaller? Will it inevitably be smaller?
 THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, I think that we should distinguish between finance as the lifeblood of our economy and finance as a significant industry where we have a comparative advantage -- right? So in terms of just growing our economy, we've got to have enough credit out there to fund businesses, large and small, to allow consumers the flexibility to make long-term purchases like cars or homes. So that's not going to change. And I would be concerned if our credit market shrunk in ways that did not allow for the financing of long-term growth.
 What that means is not only do we have to have a healthy banking sector, but we're going to have to figure out what we do with the nonbanking sector that was providing almost half of our credit out there. And we're going to have to determine whether or not as a consequence of some of the steps that the Fed has been taking, the Treasury has been taking, that we see the market for securitized products restored.
 I'm optimistic that ultimately we're going to be able to get that part of the financial sector going again, but it could take some time to regain confidence and trust.
 What I think will change, what I think was an aberration, was a situation where corporate profits in the financial sector were such a heavy part of our overall profitability over the last decade. That I think will change. And so part of that has to do with the effects of regulation that will inhibit some of the massive leveraging and the massive risk-taking that had become so common.
 Now, in some ways, I think it's important to understand that some of that wealth was illusory in the first place. 
 So we won't miss it?
 THE PRESIDENT: We will miss it in the sense that as a consequence of 25-year-olds getting million-dollar bonuses, they were willing to pay $100 for a steak dinner and that waiter was getting the kinds of tips that would make a college professor envious. And so some of the dynamic of the financial sector will have some trickle-down effects, particularly in a place like Manhattan. 
 But I actually think that there was always an unsustainable feel about what had happened on Wall Street over the last 10, 15 years, and it's not that different from the unsustainable nature of what was happening during the dot-com boom, where people in Silicon Valley could make enormous sums of money, even though what they were peddling never really had any signs it would ever make a profit.
 That doesn't mean, though, that Silicon Valley is still not a huge, critical, important part of our economy, and Wall Street will remain a big, important part of our economy, just as it was in the '70s and the '80s. It just won't be half of our economy. And that means that more talent, more resources will be going to other sectors of the economy. And I actually think that's healthy. We don't want every single college grad with mathematical aptitude to become a derivatives trader. We want some of them to go into engineering, and we want some of them to be going into computer design.
 And so I think what you'll see is some shift, but I don't think that we will lose the enormous advantages that come from transparency, openness, the reliability of our markets. If anything, a more vigorous regulatory regime, I think, will help restore confidence, and you're still going to see a lot of global capital wanting to park itself in the United States.
 Are there tangible ways that Wall Street has made the average person's life better in the way that Silicon Valley has? 
 THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think that some of the democratization of finance is actually beneficial if properly regulated. So the fact that large numbers of people could participate in the equity markets in ways that they could not previously -- and for much lower costs than they used to be able to participate -- I think is important.
 Now, the fact that we had such poor regulation means -- in some of these markets, particularly around the securitized mortgages -- means that the pain has been democratized as well. And that's a problem. But I think that overall there are ways in which people have been able to participate in our stock markets and our financial markets that are potentially healthy. Again, what you have to have, though, is an updating of the regulatory regimes comparable to what we did in the 1930s, when there were rules that were put in place that gave investors a little more assurance that they knew what they were buying.
 There was this great debate among F.D.R.'s advisers about whether you had to split up companies -- not just banks -- you had to split up companies in order to regulate them effectively, or whether it was possible to have big, huge, sprawling, powerful companies -- even not just possible, but better -- and then have strong regulators. And it seems to me there's an analogy of that debate now. Which is, do you think it is O.K. to have these ''supermarkets'' regulated by strong regulators actually trying to regulate, or do we need some very different modern version of Glass-Steagall, (1) 
 THE PRESIDENT: You know, I've looked at the evidence so far that indicates that other countries that have not seen some of the problems in their financial markets that we have nevertheless don't separate between investment banks and commercial banks, for example. They have a ''supermarket'' model that they've got strong regulation of.
 Like Canada?
 THE PRESIDENT: Canada being a good example. (2) And they've actually done a good job in managing through what was a pretty risky period in the financial markets. 
 So -- that doesn't mean that, for example, an insurance company like A.I.G. grafting a hedge fund on top of it is something that is optimal. Even with the best regulators, if you start having so much differentiation of functions and products within a single company, a single institution, a conglomerate, essentially, things could potentially slip through the cracks. And people just don't know what they're getting into. I mean, I guarantee you that the average A.I.G. insurance policyholder had no idea that this stuff was going on. And in that sense I think you can make an argument that there may be a breaking point in which functions are so different that you don't want a single company doing everything.
 But when it comes to something like investment banking versus commercial banking, the experience in a country like Canada would indicate that good, strong regulation that focuses less on the legal form of the institution and more on the functions that they're carrying out is probably the right approach to take.
 II. The Ticket to the Middle Class
 Staying on the Great Depression, it led to a surge in high-school graduation. A high-school diploma during that decade or two went from being elite to the norm, and it became a ticket to the middle class. I'm curious what you think today's ticket to the middle class is. Do you want everybody aspiring to a four-year-college degree? Is a two-year or vocational degree enough? Or is simply attending college, whether or not you graduate, sufficient to reach the middle class?
 THE PRESIDENT: We set out a goal in my speech to the joint session that said everybody should have at least one year of post-high-school training. And I think it would be too rigid to say everybody needs a four-year-college degree. I think everybody needs enough post-high-school training that they are competent in fields that require technical expertise, because it's very hard to imagine getting a job that pays a living wage without that -- or it's very hard at least to envision a steady job in the absence of that.
 And so to the extent that we can upgrade not only our high schools but also our community colleges to provide a sound technical basis for being able to perform complicated tasks in a 21st-century economy, then I think that not only is that good for the individuals, but that's going to be critical for the economy as a whole.
 I want to emphasize, though, that part of the challenge is making sure that folks are getting in high school what they need as well. You know, I use my grandmother as an example for a lot of things, but I think this is telling. My grandmother never got a college degree. She went to high school. Unlike my grandfather, she didn't benefit from the G.I. Bill, even though she worked on a bomber assembly line. She went to work as a secretary. But she was able to become a vice president at a bank partly because her high-school education was rigorous enough that she could communicate and analyze information in a way that, frankly, a bunch of college kids in many parts of the country can't. She could write --
 Today, you mean?
 THE PRESIDENT: Today. She could write a better letter than many of my -- I won't say ''many,'' but a number of my former students at the University of Chicago Law School. So part of the function of a high-school degree or a community-college degree is credentialing, right? It allows employers in a quick way to sort through who's got the skills and who doesn't. But part of the problem that we've got right now is that what it means to have graduated from high school, what it means to have graduated from a two-year college or a four-year college is not always as clear as it was several years ago. 
 And that means that we've got to -- in our education-reform agenda -- we've got to focus not just on increasing graduation rates, but we've also got to make what's learned in the high-school and college experience more robust and more effective.
 I was in West Virginia recently talking to some college students, and these are kids in college, fully intending to graduate, and yet they were still telling me they're not sure whether a college education is worth it. They're going to be graduating in a recession. They're worried their jobs will go to China. You hear these things all the time. What would you say -- there are a large number of very thoughtful people who have those concerns -- what would you say to them?
 THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, I'd start off by saying just look at the statistics. The unemployment rate for high-school graduates is at least three times what it is for a college graduate. So it's true that in this recession you're seeing white-collar jobs impacted. Even before the recession, it's true that you saw some outsourcing of white-collar jobs. But if you're working the odds, your likelihood of getting a job that pays you a good, solid middle-class wage is vastly increased upon graduating from college -- unless you're LeBron James. And so I think the evidence (3) speaks for itself. 
 Now, what is true is that a postgraduate education that isn't giving you skills that are measurable in some way, that provide you with some differentiation, means that you're going to have a little bit of a harder time. I would argue that anybody -- that young people generally are going to benefit from a good, solid liberal-arts education. That's what I got. 
 If you're only going to go to school for two years, though, then making sure that you're enrolled in a program where at the end of that journey you can see a job or a career or a field that's growing instead of contracting certainly can make some sense.
 But, again, I think the big challenge that we've got on education is making sure that from kindergarten or prekindergarten through your 14th or 15th year of school, or 16th year of school, or 20th year of school, that you are actually learning the kinds of skills that make you competitive and productive in a modern, technological economy. 
 That's why I don't just want to see more college graduates; I also want to specifically see more math and science graduates, I specifically want to see more folks in engineering. I think part of the postbubble economy that I'm describing is one in which we are restoring a balance between making things and providing services, whether it's marketing or catering to people or servicing folks in some way. Those are all good jobs, and we're not going to return to an economy in which manufacturing is as large a percentage as it was back in the 1940s just because of automation and technological advance.
 And there are advantages to service jobs, right? Less injury --
 THE PRESIDENT: Less injury, less strain. And I've always claimed that if a Wal-Mart associate was getting paid 25 bucks an hour like the autoworker, then there's no reason for complaint. 
 Although I do think that there's a culture of making things in a factory that appeals to people and that I understand. Whenever I'd walk into a factory during the campaign and would see these big turbines -- things that, you know, you'd say, well, this is neat stuff -- in a way you wouldn't when you walk into a retail store.
 But the broader point is that if you look at who our long-term competition will be in the global economy -- China, India, the E.U., Brazil, Korea -- the countries that are producing the best-educated work force, whose education system emphasizes the sciences and mathematics, who can translate those technology backgrounds or those science backgrounds into technological applications, they are going to have a significant advantage in the economy. And I think that we've got to have enough of that in order to maintain our economic strength.
 III. The New Gender Gap
 Those factories are obviously filled disproportionately with men. There's a way in which that reminds me of your grandparents, even though I know your grandfather wasn't a factory worker. You talk about the fact that your grandmother outearned your grandfather. And in a way your family was a forerunner of a much larger trend: There's still sexism, there's still a pay gap, clearly, but the pay of men has stagnated, and the pay of women has gone up.
 I think there are a lot of men out there today, working at G.M. and Chrysler and other places, who feel the same kind of dejection (4) that your grandfather did. What do you think the future of work looks like for men?
 THE PRESIDENT: I think it's an interesting question, because as I said, you know, you go in to factories all across the Midwest and you talk to the men who work there -- they've got extraordinary skill and extraordinary pride in what they make. And I think that for them, the loss of manufacturing is a loss of a way of life and not just a loss of income.
 I think a healthy economy is going to have a broad mix of jobs, and there has to be a place for somebody with terrific mechanical aptitude who can perform highly skilled tasks with his hands, whether it's in construction or manufacturing. And I don't think that those jobs should vanish. I do think that they will constitute a smaller percentage of the overall economy. And so what we're going to have to do is, with a younger generation, find new places for that kind of work. 
 The possibilities are there, though. I spoke during the campaign of this company that I visited, McKinstry, in Seattle, where you've got a bunch of welders and tradesmen who are now retrofitting buildings. They're not performing the same kind of manufacturing that their fathers might have, but with similar skill sets they are now making hospitals and schools and office buildings much more energy efficient, and then that's providing enormous value to the economy as a whole.
 In shaping our recovery package, one of the things I was pushing very hard was the smart grid (5) as a big project similar to the Interstate that could have some enormous ramifications for energy utilization. One of the biggest constraints that we've got in building a smart grid in addition to siting issues, which are sort of classic political jurisdictional battles, is actually we don't have enough trained electricians to lay down those lines. Now, you can't tell me that there aren't a whole bunch of men and women out there who are interested in those jobs. But somehow we have not done a good job of matching up the training with the need out there. And that's one of the things where government can help, help to guide and steer our education process in a way that meets future needs and not just the needs of the past.
 Would you also encourage men to become more comfortable working in fields that they traditionally have not? I mean, nursing is a very well-paying field. There's a shortage there.
 THE PRESIDENT: I mean, nursing, teaching are all areas where we need more men. I've always said if we can get more men in the classroom, particularly in inner cities where a lot of young people don't have fathers, that could be of enormous benefit.
 Now, as you and I both know, in a lot of those fields they have been underpaid because they were predominantly women's fields. And so part of what we have to do is to recognize that women are just as likely to be the primary bread earner, if not more likely, than men are today. As a consequence, eliminating the pay gap between men and women, and the pay gap between fields, becomes critically important. And we've already taken action, for example, with the Lilly Ledbetter bill (6) to try to move in that direction.
 I think that if you start seeing nursing pay better and teaching pay better, and some of these other professions, you're going to see more men in those fields, although there's a little bit of a chicken and an egg -- if you start getting more men in those fields, then the stereotypes about this being a woman's field and all the gender stereotypes that arise out of thinking that somehow they're not the primary breadwinner, those stereotypes start being whittled away.
 Did Michelle ever make more than you did?
 THE PRESIDENT: Oh, sure.
 Probably only for a brief time, because I was working three jobs most of the time that I was in the State Senate. I was still practicing law and I was still teaching. So when you kind of put everything together, I think I was still making a little bit more. But when I started campaigning for the U.S. Senate and I had to drop some of those jobs, then she carried us for a couple years.
 IV. Where the Economists are Coming From
 I want to talk broadly about policy. When you and I spoke during the campaign, you made it clear that you had thought a lot about the economic debates within the Clinton administration. And you said that you wanted to have a Robert Rubin type and a Robert Reich type having a vigorous debate in front of you. And clearly you have a spectrum of Democrats within your economic-policy team. 
 THE PRESIDENT: But I don't have Paul Krugman or Joseph Stiglitz. (7) (Laughter.) 
 No, this wasn't about them. But they have made it clear that they are not working in your administration, haven't they? 
 But in your inner circle, it really is dominated by Rubin proteges. And I'd be interested if --
 THE PRESIDENT: You know, the -- I mean, look, Larry Summers and Tim Geithner obviously worked at Treasury under Rubin. 
 And Peter Orszag, I think.
 THE PRESIDENT: And Orszag -- fair enough. You know, Christy Romer didn't. 
 Jared Bernstein doesn't -- and Jared sits here every morning as part of my economic team. And Austan Goolsbee doesn't. (8) 
 I mean, the truth is that what I've been constantly searching for is a ruthless pragmatism when it comes to economic policy. It is probably true that, given the financial crisis that had arisen, that the fact that both Tim and Larry had familiarity with financial crises was a plus, because I thought that we needed some people who could hit the ground running and would be comfortable dealing with some very large and difficult economic issues. And frankly, that list is pretty small, because the last Democratic president we had was Bill Clinton; he was on the scene for eight years, and for a big chunk of that time, Bob Rubin was his primary economic-policy maker. So it's not surprising that anybody who had experience in those fronts was going to be coming out of a shop that would have been influenced by that.
 Keep in mind, though, I mean, I have enormous respect for somebody like Joe Stiglitz. I read his stuff all the time. I actually am looking forward to having these folks in for ongoing discussion. Somebody who has enormous influence over my thinking is Paul Volcker, who is robust enough that, having presided over the Carter and Reagan years, he's still sharp as a tack and able to give me huge advice and to provide some counterbalance. 
 The last point I'd make, though, is I think that -- and I may have mentioned this to you -- but now that I think about it, maybe it was post-election. When I first started having a round table of economic advisers, and Bob Reich was part of that, and he was sitting across the table from Bob Rubin and others, what you discovered was that some of the rifts that had existed back in the Clinton years had really narrowed drastically.
 They agree a lot more than they used to, but not entirely.
 THE PRESIDENT: Not entirely. But, I mean, the fact is that Larry Summers right now is very comfortable making arguments, often quite passionately, that Bob Reich used to be making when he was in the Clinton White House. Now Larry might not like me saying that --
 Larry Summers is the new Bob Reich --
 THE PRESIDENT: -- that he's become a soft touch. But, no, I think that one of the things that we all agree to is that the touchstone for economic policy is, does it allow the average American to find good employment and see their incomes rise; that we can't just look at things in the aggregate, we do want to grow the pie, but we want to make sure that prosperity is spread across the spectrum of regions and occupations and genders and races; and that economic policy should focus on growing the pie, but it also has to make sure that everybody has got opportunity in that system. 
 I also think that there's very little disagreement that there are lessons to be learned from this crisis in terms of the importance of regulation in the financial markets. And I think that this notion that there is somehow resistance to that -- to those lessons within my economic team -- just isn't borne out by the discussions that I have every day.
 If anything, the only thing I notice, I think, that I do think is something of a carry-over from Bob Rubin -- I see it in Larry, I see it in Tim -- is a great appreciation of complexity.
 And a willingness to admit what you don't know, in many cases.
 THE PRESIDENT: Yes, exactly. And so what that means is that, as we're making economic policy, I think there is a certain humility about the consequences of the actions we take, intended and unintended, that may make some outside observers impatient. I mean, you'll recall Geithner was just getting hammered for months. But he, I think, is very secure in saying we need to get these things right, and if we act too abruptly, we can end up doing more harm than good. Those are qualities that I think have been useful.
 V. Postreform Health care
 You have suggested that health care is now the No. 1 legislative priority. It seems to me this is only a small generalization -- to say that the way the medical system works now is, people go to the doctor; the doctor tells them what treatments they need; they get those treatments, regardless of cost or, frankly, regardless of whether they're effective. I wonder if you could talk to people about how going to the doctor will be different in the future; how they will experience medical care differently on the other side of health care reform.
 THE PRESIDENT: First of all, I do think consumers have gotten more active in their own treatments in a way that's very useful. And I think that should continue to be encouraged, to the extent that we can provide consumers with more information about their own well-being -- that, I think, can be helpful.
 I have always said, though, that we should not overstate the degree to which consumers rather than doctors are going to be driving treatment, because, I just speak from my own experience, I'm a pretty-well-educated layperson when it comes to medical care; I know how to ask good questions of my doctor. But ultimately, he's the guy with the medical degree. So, if he tells me, You know what, you've got such-and-such and you need to take such-and-such, I don't go around arguing with him or go online to see if I can find a better opinion than his.
 And so, in that sense, there's always going to be an asymmetry of information between patient and provider. And part of what I think government can do effectively is to be an honest broker in assessing and evaluating treatment options. And certainly that's true when it comes to Medicare and Medicaid, where the taxpayers are footing the bill and we have an obligation to get those costs under control.
 And right now we're footing the bill for a lot of things that don't make people healthier.
 THE PRESIDENT: That don't make people healthier. So when Peter Orszag and I talk about the importance of using comparative-effectiveness studies (9) as a way of reining in costs, that's not an attempt to micromanage the doctor-patient relationship. It is an attempt to say to patients, you know what, we've looked at some objective studies out here, people who know about this stuff, concluding that the blue pill, which costs half as much as the red pill, is just as effective, and you might want to go ahead and get the blue one. And if a provider is pushing the red one on you, then you should at least ask some important questions.
 Won't that be hard, because of the trust that people put in their doctors, just as you said? Won't people say, Wait a second, my doctor is telling me to take the red pill, and the government is saving money by saying take the blue --
 THE PRESIDENT: Let me put it this way: I actually think that most doctors want to do right by their patients. And if they've got good information, I think they will act on that good information.
 Now, there are distortions in the system, everything from the drug salesmen and junkets to how reimbursements occur. Some of those things government has control over; some of those things are just more embedded in our medical culture. But the doctors I know -- both ones who treat me as well as friends of mine -- I think take their job very seriously and are thinking in terms of what's best for the patient. They operate within particular incentive structures, like anybody else, and particular habits, like anybody else.
 And so if it turns out that doctors in Florida are spending 25 percent more on treating their patients as doctors in Minnesota, and the doctors in Minnesota are getting outcomes that are just as good -- then us going down to Florida and pointing out that this is how folks in Minnesota are doing it and they seem to be getting pretty good outcomes, and are there particular reasons why you're doing what you're doing? -- I think that conversation will ultimately yield some significant savings and some significant benefits. 
 Now, I actually think that the tougher issue around medical care -- it's a related one -- is what you do around things like end-of-life care --
 Yes, where it's $20,000 for an extra week of life.
 THE PRESIDENT: Exactly. And I just recently went through this. I mean, I've told this story, maybe not publicly, but when my grandmother got very ill during the campaign, she got cancer; it was determined to be terminal. And about two or three weeks after her diagnosis she fell, broke her hip. It was determined that she might have had a mild stroke, which is what had precipitated the fall.
 So now she's in the hospital, and the doctor says, Look, you've got about -- maybe you have three months, maybe you have six months, maybe you have nine months to live. Because of the weakness of your heart, if you have an operation on your hip there are certain risks that -- you know, your heart can't take it. On the other hand, if you just sit there with your hip like this, you're just going to waste away and your quality of life will be terrible.
 And she elected to get the hip replacement and was fine for about two weeks after the hip replacement, and then suddenly just -- you know, things fell apart.
 I don't know how much that hip replacement cost. I would have paid out of pocket for that hip replacement just because she's my grandmother. Whether, sort of in the aggregate, society making those decisions to give my grandmother, or everybody else's aging grandparents or parents, a hip replacement when they're terminally ill is a sustainable model, is a very difficult question. If somebody told me that my grandmother couldn't have a hip replacement and she had to lie there in misery in the waning days of her life -- that would be pretty upsetting.
 And it's going to be hard for people who don't have the option of paying for it.
 THE PRESIDENT: So that's where I think you just get into some very difficult moral issues. But that's also a huge driver of cost, right?
 I mean, the chronically ill and those toward the end of their lives are accounting for potentially 80 percent of the total health care bill out here.
 So how do you -- how do we deal with it?
 THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think that there is going to have to be a conversation that is guided by doctors, scientists, ethicists. And then there is going to have to be a very difficult democratic conversation that takes place. It is very difficult to imagine the country making those decisions just through the normal political channels. And that's part of why you have to have some independent group that can give you guidance. It's not determinative, but I think has to be able to give you some guidance. And that's part of what I suspect you'll see emerging out of the various health care conversations that are taking place on the Hill right now.
 VI. Out of the Rough?
 Do you think this recession is a big-enough event to make us as a country willing to make some of the sorts of hard choices that we need to make on health care, on taxes in the long term -- which will not cover the cost of government -- on energy? Traditionally those choices get made in times of depression or war, and I'm not sure whether this rises to that level.
 THE PRESIDENT: Well, part of it will depend on leadership. So I've got to make some good arguments out there. And that's what I've been trying to do since I came in, is to say now is the time for us to make some tough, big decisions.
 The critics have said, you're doing too much, you can't do all this at once, Congress can't digest everything. I just reject that. There's nothing inherent in our political process that should prevent us from making these difficult decisions now, as opposed to 10 years from now or 20 years from now.
 It is true that as tough an economic time as it is right now, we haven't had 42 months of 20, 30 percent unemployment. And so the degree of desperation and the shock to the system may not be as great. And that means that there's going to be more resistance to any of these steps: reforming the financial system or reforming our health care system or doing something about energy. On each of these things -- you know, things aren't so bad in the eyes of a lot of Americans that they say, We're willing to completely try something new.
 But part of my job I think is to bridge that gap between the status quo and what we know we have to do for our future.
 Are you worried that the economic cycle will make that much harder? I mean, Roosevelt took office four years after the stock market crashed. You took office four months after Lehman Brothers collapsed. At some point people may start saying, Hey, why aren't things getting better?
 THE PRESIDENT: It's something that we think about. I knew even before the election that this was going to be a very difficult journey and that the economy had gone through a sufficient shock and that it wasn't going to recover right away.
 In some ways it's liberating, though, in the sense that whether I'm a one-termer or a two-termer, the problems are big enough and fundamental enough that I can't sort of game it out. It's not one of these things where I can say, Oh, you know what, if I time it just right, then the market is going to be going up and unemployment will be going down right before re-election. These are much bigger, much more systemic problems. And so in some ways you just kind of set aside the politics.
 What I'm very confident about is that given the difficult options before us, we are making good, thoughtful decisions. I have enormous confidence that we are weighing all our options and we are making the best choices. That doesn't mean that every choice is going to be right, is going to work exactly the way we want it to. But I wake up in the morning and go to bed at night feeling that the direction we are trying to move the economy toward is the right one and that the decisions we make are sound.

Afterward, Obama's grandfather had ''a look of dejection and rage,'' Obama writes.

The Supreme Court ruled against her discrimination claim in 2007 because the statute of limitations had expired. 7 Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman, both Nobel Prize winners, have been vocal critics of Obama.

PERSON: Jack Kemp 

HEADLINE: Jack Kemp, 73, Star on Field And in Politics

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

 BODY:
Jack Kemp, the former football star turned congressman who with an evangelist's fervor moved the Republican Party to a commitment to tax cuts as the central focus of economic policy, died Saturday evening at his home in Bethesda, Md. He was 73. 
 The cause was cancer, said his son Jimmy Kemp. Jack Kemp's Washington consulting and lobbying firm, Kemp Partners, announced in January that he had cancer but did not disclose the type. 
 Mr. Kemp was secretary of housing and urban development under the first President George Bush and the Republican vice-presidential nominee in 1996. But his greatest legacy may stem from his years as a congressman from Buffalo, especially 1978, when his argument for sharp tax cuts to promote economic growth became party policy, one that has endured to this day. 
 Mr. Kemp, having embraced a supply-side economic theory, told the House that year that the nation suffered under a ''tax code that rewards consumption, leisure, debt and borrowing, and punishes savings, investment, work and production.'' 
 Ronald Reagan adopted the issue as a central one in his 1980 presidential campaign, and in 1981 he won passage of a 23 percent cut over three years. The legislation was known as Kemp-Roth, named for Mr. Kemp and William V. Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican and his Senate co-sponsor. 
 Mr. Kemp's other great cause, in his 18 years in the House and for three decades thereafter, was to get his party to seek more support from blacks and other minorities. 
 ''The party of Lincoln,'' he wrote after the 2008 election, ''needs to rethink and revisit its historic roots as a party of emancipation, liberation, civil rights and equality of opportunity for all.''
 Mr. Kemp won his House seat in 1970 because of his celebrity as an all-star quarterback for the Buffalo Bills, twice champions of the American Football League. He connected his concern for minorities with his respect for his black teammates, especially the linemen who had protected him from pass rushers. 
 Vin Weber, a former congressman from Minnesota and a close friend, said Mr. Kemp would often say, ''I can't help but care about the rights of the people I used to shower with.''
 Mr. Kemp was an unlikely leader for a political cause based on a theory of economics. He had majored in physical education while playing football at Occidental College in Los Angeles. When he entered politics, many Washington veterans dismissed him as a ''dumb jock,'' and as a junior House member in 1977, he did not even serve on the tax-writing Committee on Ways and Means. 
 But though Mr. Kemp had not studied a lot at Occidental, he had been making up for it for years. On long team flights, his reading habits -- Ayn Rand and William F. Buckley Jr., among others -- stood out. The wide receiver Elbert Dubenion recalled this year, ''He was reading these political books, and we were reading the Katzenjammer Kids.'' 
 Mr. Kemp first heard about supply-side theory, as advanced by Arthur B. Laffer, a University of Southern California economist, in 1976. Soon he immersed himself in the case for tax cuts, reading deeply from the works of the Laffer camp as well as its critics. When he debated the subject on the House floor, he cited studies on the money supply, the experience of Britain and Sweden, and the impact of past tax cuts in the United States. 
 He persuaded his House colleagues to bring the idea to a vote in 1977 and three times more, in 1978. Each time they sought to reduce taxes across the board, starting with the 70 percent marginal rate, which was then imposed on the highest incomes. They lost each time -- once by only five votes -- but they had an election issue.
 Mr. Kemp had also convinced Bill Brock, chairman of the Republican National Committee, that the issue was political gold. ''He said, in effect, we need to restore the essence of our party, which is growth, which is jobs, which is creativity,'' Mr. Brock said in an interview this year. ''And the way to do that is to free people of the burden of excessive taxes.'' 
 Mr. Brock said the issue was central to the Republicans' gaining 15 seats in the House of Representatives and 3 in the Senate in the fall of 1978.
 While some allies wanted him to seek the Republican nomination himself in 1980, Mr. Kemp supported Reagan. In 1979 he organized a seminar in Los Angeles to explain the intricacies of the policy to Reagan and his campaign advisers. Reagan, who thought his own taxes as a movie actor had been too high, seized on the idea as one that would appeal to blue-collar voters.
 After his election, Reagan called for a three-year, 27 percent tax reduction, straight out of the Kemp-Roth bill, which had been introduced earlier. The three-year, 23 percent reduction that the president ultimately agreed to was supported by Mr. Kemp. Although its formal name was the Economic Recovery Tax Act, it became known as the Kemp-Roth tax cut.
 ''Jack Kemp is the indispensable political leader of the modern conservative economic revival,'' Edwin J. Feulner, president of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research institution in Washington, said recently, adding, ''Jack's role in developing and exploring the potential of supply-side economics in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for Reagan's economic program.'' 
 Norman J. Ornstein, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said of Mr. Kemp: ''I think there is no doubt that he had a greater impact on conservative and Republican economic philosophy than anybody else. More than Laffer, more than Reagan.'' And the change he helped bring about was not just in the party's attitude toward taxes, Mr. Ornstein said; Republicans, he said, were ''no longer worshiping at the shrine of a balanced budget, for better and for worse.'' 
 John French Kemp Jr. was born in Los Angeles on July 13, 1935. He had wanted to be a professional football player from the age of 6 but recognized that he did not have the bulk to be recruited by a major college team. Still, he wanted to join a football program that used a professional system, so he chose Occidental, where he started at quarterback. 
 It was also at Occidental that he met Joanne Main, who became his wife of 50 years. She survives him, as do two sons, who also played professional football, Jeff Kemp of Redmond, Wash., and Jimmy Kemp of Washington; two daughters, Jennifer Kemp Andrews of Middleburg, Va., and Judith Kemp of Potomac, Md.; and 17 grandchildren.
 The Detroit Lions drafted Mr. Kemp in 1957 (as the 203rd pick), but he did not make the team. He played briefly with the Pittsburgh Steelers and was cut by the New York Giants and the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League. Finally, with the founding of the American Football League in 1960, he was chosen by the Los Angeles Chargers. 
 He went on to star as quarterback for the Chargers and was named to the all-A.F.L. team. In 1962, Mr. Kemp injured his passing hand, and the Chargers put him on waivers to open up his roster spot -- temporarily, they hoped. But the Buffalo Bills claimed him for $100.
 After his hand healed, his first game in Buffalo was against that year's league champions, the Dallas Texans. Mr. Kemp completed 21 of 35 passes for 230 yards and two touchdowns as the Bills upset the Texans, 23-14. 
 ''The fans stormed the field after the game and carried Kemp off on their shoulders,'' Larry Felser, a sportswriter at the time for The Buffalo Courier-Express, recalled earlier this year. ''It was a scene from a bad movie, but it happened.''
 Mr. Kemp led the Bills to league championships over the Chargers in 1964 and 1965, when he was chosen as the league's most valuable player.
 Billy Shaw, a Bills teammate and a member of the Hall of Fame, said in a recent interview: ''Jack Kemp is probably the most intelligent football player I ever played with. Jack had what I consider better than average ability or skills as a player, but because of his ability to use his head and to make good decisions on the field, his results were probably better than the talent that he had.'' 
 Mr. Kemp was a founder and president of the A.F.L. Players Association. In January 1965, he supported a boycott of an all-star game in New Orleans by the league's black players after they had been barred from nightclubs and cabs in the city. Mr. Kemp helped get the game moved to Houston, where the black players participated. 
 His last season as a professional player, in 1969, was a losing one in Buffalo, but he was named an all-star for the seventh time. It was also the league's last season before merging with the National Football League. Among A.F.L. quarterbacks, Mr. Kemp ranked first in number of passes (3,055), completions (1,428) and passing yardage (21,130).
 His transition to politics was smooth. As a popular football player he had campaigned in New York for Nelson A. Rockefeller and in California for Ronald Reagan in their gubernatorial races and for Richard M. Nixon and Barry Goldwater in their presidential bids. And he was a name in Buffalo. With a House seat open in the 1970 election, local Republicans persuaded Mr. Kemp to campaign for it. He won with just 51.6 percent of the vote, but in seven of his next eight races he cruised to victory with at least 70 percent of the vote.
 After helping the Reagan campaign in 1980, Mr. Kemp was elected chairman of the House Republican Conference, the third-ranking leadership post. In that role he sometimes clashed with Reagan, who was quicker to compromise on taxes than Mr. Kemp. ''Jack Kemp now knows I'm teed off with him,'' Reagan wrote in his diary in 1982. 
 But the president hailed Mr. Kemp on his retirement from the House in 1988, writing in a letter, ''We showed this town that -- if you want to make the government move -- let a guy from Hollywood and a football quarterback call the plays.''
 Mr. Kemp had hoped to succeed Reagan, running earlier that year for the Republican nomination and offering himself as the conservatives' alternative to Vice President George Bush and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader. But Pat Robertson, the television evangelist, took so much of the party's conservative base, finishing second to Mr. Dole in Iowa, that Mr. Kemp's hopes deflated. 
 Mr. Kemp dropped out of the race in March 1988 and endorsed Mr. Bush, clearly hoping for the vice-presidential nomination. That went instead to Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana. But after his victory in the fall elections, Mr. Bush did choose Mr. Kemp to take over the Department of Housing and Urban Development in 1989.
 His biggest task was cleaning up the corruption and favoritism that had marked the housing department during the Reagan administration. Again he was a bundle of energy. He met black leaders, visited homeless shelters and presided over the destruction of failed housing projects like Cabrini-Green in Chicago. He also offered proposals like tax preferences for inner-city ''enterprise zones'' and urged that public housing tenants be enabled to buy their homes. Most of these ideas went nowhere. One successful measure was the Affordable Housing Act, a block grant program that has spent about $1.5 billion a year since 1992.
 Mr. Kemp's final turn on the national stage came as Mr. Dole's vice-presidential candidate in 1996. It was a surprising choice. The two men differed on economic policy: Mr. Dole advocated balanced budgets; Mr. Kemp wanted tax cuts and did not worry about deficits. They also disliked each other. In one exchange, in 1985, Mr. Dole said, ''Kemp wants a business deduction for hair spray.'' Mr. Kemp retorted: ''In a recent fire, Bob Dole's library burned down. Both books were lost. And he hadn't even finished coloring one of them.''
 But the choice of Mr. Kemp balanced the ticket. It pleased conservatives, who were skeptical about Mr. Dole, and it added Mr. Kemp's East Coast and California ties to Mr. Dole's Midwestern support. Plus, Mr. Kemp was 12 years younger than Mr. Dole, who was 73. 
 In the fall campaign, Mr. Kemp made a point of going to minority neighborhoods that rarely saw Republicans. But those efforts appeared to make little difference as President Bill Clinton won re-election comfortably. The Dole-Kemp ticket won 12 percent of the black vote, compared with 10 percent for the Bush-Quayle ticket in 1992.
 After 1996, Mr. Kemp became involved with charitable and political associations and headed Kemp Partners, a lobbying and consulting firm in Washington. But he never ran for office again, ending a political career that in many ways reflected an answer he had given in 1970, when asked how his football experience qualified him for Congress. 
 ''Pro football,'' he replied, ''gave me a good sense of perspective to enter politics: I'd already been booed, cheered, cut, sold, traded and hung in effigy.''

HEADLINE: Hearings for Nominee Will Reflect a Reversal

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE; David M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The tables will be turned as a Democratic Senate prepares to consider the Supreme Court nominee of a Democratic president for the first time in 15 years, reversing the control Republicans held over the last two appointments to the court.
 Given the political nature of modern court selections, the likely engagement of special interest groups and the already tense partisan atmosphere in Congress, both sides predict there will be some level of confirmation combat no matter whom President Obama selects to succeed Justice David H. Souter, who is retiring. 
 ''Clearly, there will be a number of Republicans who will try to block any choice of the president,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, a senior member of the Judiciary Committee. 
 Mr. Schumer noted that the 60 seats Democrats could occupy by the time of any confirmation vote would give them, and the president, a strong advantage. 
 Republicans said they awaited Mr. Obama's choice and encouraged him to nominate someone considered to be in the mainstream of judicial thought, an approach they said would ease the way to Senate approval. 
 ''I will be resistant to giving the nominee an unfair hardship,'' said Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a Republican member of the judiciary panel. ''But they do need to be challenged on their philosophy and experience.''
 Senator John Cornyn of Texas, another Republican committee member, said, ''That is our responsibility.''
 The Supreme Court opening comes as the Senate is already contending with major health care and energy legislation, the national economic crisis and a Pentagon procurement overhaul sought by the president, to name just a few issues. 
 Congressional officials suggested that the hearings and confirmation vote, which Democrats would like to hold by August, could slow any new immigration legislation, which is also in the purview of the Judiciary Committee. And should the nomination review turn ugly, lawmakers and others said, the tension could spill over to other policy matters.
 There is another wild card. Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, who as a Republican was chairman of the two most recent Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings -- for Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. in 2005 and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. in 2006 -- became a Democrat as of last week. 
 Still, Mr. Specter said his support for a nominee picked by Mr. Obama should not be taken for granted, making him a potential pivotal figure in the outcome of the first Supreme Court nomination by a Democrat since President Bill Clinton sent the name of Stephen G. Breyer to the Senate in 1994.
 ''It depends on who the nominee is,'' Mr. Specter said. ''I am not in anybody's pocket on this.'' 
 At the same time, Mr. Specter's defection to the Democratic Party has caused complications for Republicans because he was the senior party member on the Judiciary Committee. Now, other Republicans are jockeying to fill that void and the opportunity to be the party's leading voice on the pending nomination. 
 The three Republicans who could get the job -- Senators Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, Orrin G. Hatch of Utah and Jeff Sessions of Alabama -- would bring distinctly different styles and experience to any confirmation battle. Mr. Sessions, the most conservative of the three, saw his own nomination to the federal bench rejected by the committee in 1986. 
 Republicans expect to sort out the Judiciary Committee issue this week.
 Democrats said they were confident Mr. Obama would make a strong choice and were hopeful of avoiding the rancor that had become a staple of Senate review of Supreme Court nominees.
 ''I have faith the president will pick someone who is qualified and up to the challenges of the court,'' said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota. ''I would hope Republicans give the president the opportunity to put his person on the court with some civility.''
 Republicans said they understood that Mr. Obama was not going to nominate a conservative, but they said a selection seen as leaning too far left would draw heated opposition even if they no longer held the votes to block such a nomination. They said such a choice could provide a rallying point for their beleaguered party and help them emphasize the theme that Democrats were unchecked in their tightening control of the federal government.
 Some Republicans also said a liberal nominee would pose risks for Senate Democrats representing conservative states
 ''It puts a lot of pressure on Democrats in red states, particularly those running for re-election in 2010, if it is someone who is dramatically outside of the mainstream,'' said Mr. Cornyn, who, as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, has a deep interest in the politics of the nomination.
 As for their treatment of any court candidate, Republicans said Democrats had hardly been shy in confrontations with nominees of Republican presidents, noting that Democrats forced a vote to cut off a filibuster of Mr. Alito, who was opposed overwhelmingly by Democrats. 
 They are also well aware that Mr. Obama, while a senator, was one of 22 Democrats to vote against Mr. Roberts and was one of 25 who voted to filibuster Mr. Alito.
 ''President Obama should hope,'' Mr. Graham said, ''that Republican senators are fairer than he was when he was a senator.''

HEADLINE: Enough Is Enough April 26-May 2

 BODY:
THE NEWS Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania announced that he was leaving the Republican Party to join the Democrats. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS Mr. Specter, a five-term moderate who faced a likely primary defeat to a conservative challenger in 2010, found himself growing farther out of step with the rightward drift of his old party, especially after he broke ranks to vote for Mr. Obama's stimulus plan. He was wooed for months by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. His defection and the likely victory of Al Franken in Minnesota would give the Democrats 60 senators, enough to keep Republicans from blocking Mr. Obama's initiatives with filibusters. 
 THE NEWS Time Warner said in a regulatory filing that it was preparing to spin off AOL, the Internet services business it merged with in 2000, to its shareholders. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS The move would finally unwind what is widely regarded as the worst merger in corporate history. In hindsight, AOL was hugely overvalued, and the merger resulted in far more damaging integration problems and far fewer benefits than promised, destroying hundreds of billions of dollars in shareholder value. AOL's core business, a portal for dial-up Internet use, has dwindled, and Time Warner had little hope of finding a buyer willing to pay more than a fire-sale price.
 THE NEWSChrysler filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, with a plan to emerge again soon in a new strategic alliance with Fiat. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS The filing was orchestrated by the Obama administration, which injected billions into the struggling automaker to keep it afloat and set a deadline of May 1 to arrange an overhaul outside of bankruptcy. The company's unions and banks went along, but the months-long effort foundered on the resistance of one group of bondholders who said they would fare better if Chrysler were liquidated. Mr. Obama angrily dismissed them as ''speculators'' who expected sacrifices of others but made none of their own.
 THE NEWS Shareholders of Bank of America voted to strip the bank's chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis, of the chairman's title.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Ousters of chairmen by shareholders of large publicly traded companies are exceedingly rare. But Mr. Lewis, a 40-year veteran of the bank and its predecessors, had become a lightning rod for investors' fury because of two ambitious acquisitions he oversaw, of Merrill Lynch and Countrywide Financial, that now look to many like overpriced, trouble-filled blunders. The bank has had to be bailed out twice by the Treasury in recent months. With all that, though, Mr. Lewis managed to keep his board seat.
 THE NEWS After burning through most of the $100 million pledged toward the start-up Portfolio, an ambitious, glossy business magazine, Conde Nast Publications shut it down after just two years.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Portfolio was just the latest magazine to fall victim to the recession. Magazine advertising pages fell nearly 26 percent in the first quarter of the year; the industry expects a decline of 11 percent for all of 2009. Conde Nast said Portfolio was a good concept launched at the wrong time. Critics suggested that a monthly magazine about the fast-moving world of business didn't make sense in the digital age. About 85 people lost their jobs.

HEADLINE: The Great Enigma

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER CALDWELL. 
Christopher Caldwell's book, ''Reflections on the Revolution in Europe: Immigration, Islam and the West,'' will be published this summer.

 BODY:
THE REBELLION OF RONALD REAGAN
 A History of the End of the Cold War
 By James Mann
 Illustrated. 396 pp. Viking. $27.95
 THE MAN WHO SOLD THE WORLD
 Ronald Reagan and the Betrayal of Main Street America
 By William Kleinknecht
 317 pp. Nation Books/Perseus Books Group. $26.95
 Even those who count Ronald Reagan among the handful of great American presidents have a hard time saying exactly where his greatness lay, or how it made itself felt. Reagan was an enigma: affable but friendless, a nonintellectual man of ideas, an ingenuous power politician. His presidency seemed like a success until 1986 and a failure thereafter, yet his most important legacy -- the ending of the cold war -- dates from those last two lame-duck years. The central puzzle is whether Reagan actually ''won'' the cold war at all. Did he cannily bring the Soviet Union to its knees, vindicating decades of activism by American anti-Communists? Or was he lucky enough to be standing around when a real revolutionary -- Mikhail Gorbachev -- came to power? 
 James Mann answers these questions subtly and exhaustively in ''The Rebellion of Ronald Reagan.'' He approaches his subject through four interlocked essays -- on Reagan's relationship with Richard Nixon, on his informal tutorials about Russia with the author Suzanne Massie, on the 1987 speech he made at the Berlin Wall and on his summits with Gorbachev. Mann, the author of a rich account of George W. Bush's foreign-policy team, ''Rise of the Vulcans,'' argues that Reagan's role in ending the cold war was crucial. But it was not the role his backers often claim, nor the one his allies wished on him at the time.
 Reagan's anti-Communism, Mann notes, was ''personal and moralistic in nature, driven by his experiences with people he considered sophisticated and devious'' -- specifically the party members and sympathizers he met as president of the Screen Actors Guild in the 1940s and '50s. He skipped the funeral of the Soviet leader Yuri Andropov in 1984, telling an adviser that he didn't want to honor the man.
 But Reagan was an idiosyncratic hawk. While he was cynical about peace as a means, he was devoted to it as an end. ''My heart is with you,'' he said during his visit to Bonn in 1982, referring to the 300,000 marchers who turned out to protest the NATO deployment of intermediate-range missiles. ''I would be at the head of your parade if I believed marching alone could bring about a more secure world.'' A part of Reagan also found nuclear weapons repugnant, in the way that, say, Jonathan Schell does. At Reykjavik in 1986, he would contemplate doing away with them altogether. Henry Kissinger complained that Reagan ''stigmatized nuclear weapons with arguments all but indistinguishable from the Committee for Nuclear Disarmament.''
 Reagan believed that the Soviet economy would eventually collapse of its own inefficiency and imperial overstretch. This analysis put him at odds with Nixon and Kissinger, the C.I.A., the right wing of his party and the Nixonians in his immediate circle, led by Brent Scowcroft, Alexander Haig and Vice President George H. W. Bush. It also led, Mann shows, to a divergence when Gorbachev came to power. ''Anyone who reaches the top in the Soviet hierarchy is bound to be a dedicated Communist,'' Nixon warned, and Bush was bothered by Reagan's ''sentimentality'' about Gorbachev. But Reagan saw a man responding to a predictable economic emergency that Communism was predictably inadequate to handle. As Gorbachev reduced the constitutional say of the Communist Party, forced out the Soviet foreign-policy eminence Andrei Gromyko, ended much of the jamming of foreign radio broadcasts and renounced military intervention in Eastern Europe, it became obvious, Mann argues, that Reagan was right and the Nixonians were wrong.
 The nitty-gritty of arms control never interested Reagan. During the 1987 Washington summit, he kept asking his national security adviser, Colin Powell, who was trying to brief him about Gorbachev, ''When do you think I ought to give him the cuff links?'' What did interest Reagan was Russian culture. He acquired a simple and romantic idea of it through a series of private meetings with Suzanne Massie. Reagan came to accept her view that there was a hunger for religious belief in Russia. He even tried to convince Gorbachev of the existence of God. 
 Secretary of State George Shultz did the intellectual sparring. He emerges from Mann's account as the pivotal diplomat in the Reagan administration. ''Shultz in particular had developed a new set of themes to offer Gorbachev, ones that were well attuned both to the Soviet leader's interests and to his vulnerabilities at the time,'' Mann writes. Armed with data provided by his friend, the former Citibank chairman Walter Wriston, he undertook to explain globalization to Gorbachev. Shultz was a top-echelon economist; Gorbachev was insecure about his knowledge of the economy and easily dazzled. Shultz gave Gorbachev an accounting of the speed of capital and information flows, and a theory of what they meant. For instance, the censorship on which Communist rule depended would no longer be practicable. One diplomat called Shultz's seminars ''a kind of psychological warfare,'' but in a way they were the very opposite. With a shared understanding of globalization, neither country had to bow to the other's bullying. Both could bow to changing realities.
 Mann is a dogged seeker after evidence and a judicious sifter of it. His verdict is convincing. Some have painted Reagan as brilliantly bankrupting the Soviets through his ''Star Wars'' missile-defense proposals, which ignited an arms race Gorbachev could not compete in. Mann doesn't buy it. The lead role belonged to Gorbachev. While Star Wars heightened the economic contradictions of Communism, Mann writes, it ''did not persuade Gorbachev to sit passively by in 1989 while the Berlin Wall was torn down.'' Ending the cold war was a matter neither of just being tough against the Soviets nor of just being trusting. It required a subtle mix of both approaches, and Reagan found that mix.
 ''The Man Who Sold America,'' by William Kleinknecht, a crime correspondent for The Newark Star-Ledger, is a different kind of book. For Kleinknecht, Reagan is an ''obvious enemy of the common people,'' ''arguably the least patriotic president in American history.'' Along with the ''mean-spirited religious zealots, thinly veiled racists, law-and-order extremists'' and ''warmongers'' his election brought to power, he is to blame for virtually all the ills that have befallen the United States over the past three decades. That includes the subprime crisis, the slow progress of median household income in the 1990s and even a drug search ordered by an overzealous school principal in rural South Dakota in 2002. ''Kindergartners rousted in their classrooms by police dogs may seem an abomination,'' Kleinknecht writes, ''but it is part and parcel of Ronald Reagan's vision for America.''
 Others have called Reagan's program a failure or a mistake. Kleinknecht, though, sees it as the natural expression of a warped personality. ''As a father, husband, friend or neighbor, Ronald Reagan had few personality traits that stood out in a moral sense,'' he writes. He is astonished that Reagan has been ''regarded by a large portion of the public as a man of pristine values.'' The administration's ''immorality'' arose from Reagan's own, Kleinknecht insists, and the consequences were momentous, ''clearing away barriers to the final conquering of the human soul by the corporation.'' This is an ad hominem vision of politics in which differences are never the result of disagreement and misunderstanding, always of evil and dishonesty. It will appeal only to those already running a high partisan fever.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Before Tea, Thank Your Lucky Stars'' (Economic View, April 26), in which Robert H. Frank said that ''talent and hard work are neither necessary nor sufficient for economic success'': 
 To me, however, most people in a capitalist society see a strong if not perfect relationship between success and working hard, smart and persistently. At least that is my experience as someone who went from the lower middle class to being financially very successful. In doing so I found the adage that ''the harder I work the luckier I get'' to be very true.
 Besides, I can't imagine how a society could get anyone to work hard if everyone thought that his or her fate was a matter of luck and genes.

 To the Editor:
 I agree with Robert H. Frank's view that President Obama's proposals will make the tax system fairer and more efficient. 
 Some people who have protested the Obama plans at ''tea parties'' could well be paying less, not more, under the proposals. And many of the more fortunate Americans who do face tax increases would simply be returning to the rates they were paying in the 1990s, before the Bush tax cuts. 
 The last time I checked, the tax policies of the Clinton administration in the 1990s did not lead to economic Armageddon, but instead contributed to strong economic growth.

HEADLINE: What Clunker Cash Might Buy

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
WITH the support of President Obama, Congress is considering two plans aimed at helping automakers and dealers to lift sales, cut emissions and reduce reliance on foreign oil.
 Often called ''cash for clunkers,'' these programs would give drivers vouchers worth as much as $5,500 if they turned in an old car or truck and replaced it with a newer, more efficient vehicle.
 The proposals are modeled on programs already operating in California and Texas, as well as in Germany, Japan and a growing number of other countries. 
 The differences in the two Congressional proposals are still being ironed out and a compromise could be made final as early as this week. Still, a program is unlikely to be in place before fall. 
 Both plans assume that newer models are cleaner-running and more fuel-efficient than older cars -- an assumption questioned by some critics -- and that giving consumers vouchers will get them spending again on automobiles, helping automakers and dealers.
 But the bills have notable differences that would affect the vehicles eligible for purchase with the vouchers.
 In the bill sponsored by Representative Betty Sutton, Democrat of Ohio, car owners would receive vouchers worth up to $5,000 based on the age of the vehicle they turn in and the mileage rating of the car or truck that they buy to replace it. The replacement vehicle can cost no more than $35,000. Cars must have a federal mileage rating of 27 miles a gallon on the highway (24 m.p.g. for trucks).
 Controversially, the bill states that drivers can use their vouchers only to buy new cars or trucks that have been assembled in North America, a clause that has won support of automakers with plants in the United States, Canada and Mexico.
 The list of vehicles eligible for purchase under the Sutton plan includes the Dodge Journey, Saturn Vue and Toyota RAV4 crossovers and the Chevrolet Malibu, Ford Fusion, Hyundai Sonata and Nissan Altima midsize sedans. 
 Even sporty cars make the cut, including the Mitsubishi Eclipse and the two-seat Pontiac Solstice roadster. Large family vehicles on the Sutton list include the Chevrolet Traverse and Toyota Venza crossovers and the Honda Odyssey and Chrysler Town & Country minivans.
 A second bill, sponsored by Representative Steve Israel, Democrat of New York, and nine other representatives, would give a driver up to $5,500 for an old car or truck depending on its age and assuming it had a combined city-highway rating of less than 18 m.p.g., as calculated by the Environmental Protection Agency. 
 The vouchers could be used to buy new or used vehicles that have a fuel economy rating at least 25 percent higher than the corporate average fuel economy standard, or CAFE, for vehicles in their class. (Vouchers are worth an additional $1,000 for vehicles that are at least 50 percent above the class CAFE standard.)
 Consumers can use their vouchers only for vehicles that were built in 2004 or later and cost no more than $45,000.
 Thanks to the more generous upper limit and absence of any requirement that the car be built in North America, the list of eligible cars under this plan is longer than under the Sutton plan, according to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. 
 The Ford Focus and Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid are on a list of eligible vehicles drawn up by the environmental advocacy group, but so is the Mini Cooper, the Hyundai Elantra and the Mazda 3.
 A number of vehicles classified as trucks would be included under the Israel plan, including the Ford Escape 4-cylinder and Escape Hybrid S.U.V.'s; 4-cylinder versions of the Ford Ranger, Mazda B2300 and Toyota Tacoma pickups; and the Nissan Rogue and Subaru Forester crossovers. 
 Complete lists of vehicles that may be eligible for purchase under current versions of the two proposals are posted at nytimes.com/autos.

HEADLINE: A Nation Of Typhoid Marys

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
Thomas L. Friedman is off today.

 BODY:
As swine flu spreads around the country, it's only appropriate that the next political donnybrook may concern health care.
 Vice President Joseph Biden said a few days ago that for the second 100 days of the administration, ''the top of the agenda, the very top, is health care.'' Lacing its armor across the field, a group called Conservatives for Patients' Rights is airing commercials denouncing (and distorting) President Obama's health care proposals.
 Not to be impolite, but Republicans like Karl Rove and Senator Susan Collins (along with some Democrats) lost credibility on this front when they scolded Mr. Obama a few months ago for proposing stimulus spending on something as frivolous as ... preparations for a flu pandemic. (Note to Senator Collins: You might want to remove from your Senate Web site the February article citing your opposition to pandemic preparation.) 
 The flu crisis should be a wake-up call, a reminder that one of our vulnerabilities to the possible pandemic is our deeply flawed medical system.
 ''From SARS to avian flu to the current escalating outbreaks of swine influenza, it has become increasingly clear that we are risking a major catastrophe unless we act to restore the safety net,'' noted Deborah Burger, the co-president of the California Nurses Association/National Nurses Organizing Committee.
 Think of the 47 million Americans who lack insurance. They are less likely to receive flu vaccines (which might or might not help), less likely to receive prompt care when they get sick, and less able financially to stay home from work -- and thus they are more likely both to die and to spread the virus inadvertently.
 ''These are, in effect, 47 million 'Typhoid Marys' of the next pandemic -- at risk themselves and to their families and neighbors,'' said Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health.
 ''This is a most dangerous brew: a dysfunctional health care system, vast numbers of Americans without access to health care, a severe recession, overextended and highly stressed hospitals, and the prospect of a nasty new killer virus,'' Dr. Redlener said.
 The American health care system is exceptionally good at cutting-edge technologies. The top five American hospitals together conduct more clinical trials than any entire European country.
 Yet over all, our health care system has failed us. Troll through World Health Organization data and cringe: Americans live shorter lives than Greeks, our kids are twice as likely to die by age 5 as Portuguese children, and American women are 11 times as likely to die in childbirth as women in Ireland. Over all, we rank well below most European countries in our health statistics (for which you can also blame the Danish in your hand as you read this).
 The larger problem is that we over-invest in clinical care like CAT scans and underinvest in public health. There should be a Nobel Prize for Public Health, so that we might get more great minds wrestling with nonmedical pieces of the health puzzle, like industrial hog farms that can serve as breeding grounds for viruses and bacteria, from swine flu to MRSA.
 President George W. Bush did an excellent job making preparations specifically for a flu epidemic, partly because of the avian flu scare and partly because he read a book about the 1918 influenza epidemic. But he and other presidents starved the broader public health system, so that today it is in desperate shape.
 Hospitals lack spare beds, ventilators and staff to cope with an epidemic. One study found that a flu epidemic would mean that 10 million Americans would need to be hospitalized -- compared with a total of nearly one million beds in America, about two-thirds of them occupied. Last year, Representative Henry Waxman ordered a review of ''surge capacity'' in hospitals available for a terror attack, and found that more than half the emergency rooms studied were already operating above capacity.
 We don't know whether this swine flu will be as lethal even as a typical flu season (the boy who died in Texas last week has already received more attention than all 36,000 Americans who die in a typical year of the flu). So far it has been mild in this country, but we know that the first wave of flu in 1918 caused few deaths but was followed three months later by a different form that killed tens of millions of people around the globe.
 We do know we need to take precautions. These include not only washing our hands with soap and water, but also instituting far-reaching health care reform in the coming months.
 ''If a severe pandemic materializes,'' Dr. Redlener said, ''all of society could pay a heavy price for decades of failing to create a rational system of health care that works for all of us.''

HEADLINE: I'm Honored. No, Actually, I Can't Afford It.

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI

 BODY:
WHEN Terry J. Lundgren, the chief executive of Macy's, received Carnegie Hall's Medal of Excellence in April 2008, he beamed with pride. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg presented the award, which goes to a business leader who supports the arts. More than 1,000 guests, including Martha Stewart, Leonard Lauder and Tommy Hilfiger, cheered from their tables in the Waldorf-Astoria's Grand Ballroom. Tony Bennett sang his heart out. And Carnegie Hall raised $4.2 million. 
 But when it came time to select an honoree for this year's medal, Carnegie Hall's board and management were stumped. They canceled the benefit. 
 Why? Because an honoree is not chosen just to give a speech and be feted. He or she must be willing to make a big donation, usually from the company's coffers, and -- more important -- to invite friends and contacts to the gala who will buy $20,000 tables or single tickets for $2,000 to $3,000, bringing new support to the organization. 
 With banks, brokerage houses, real estate firms, hedge funds and even law firms struggling for survival, Carnegie Hall realized it had nowhere to turn as it contemplated a gala for this year.
 ''We simply didn't feel that last fall was the right time to be asking companies and business leaders to make large event commitments,'' said Susan J. Brady, director of development. 
 The time-honored system of black-tie charity tributes is breaking down, another casualty of the worst economic climate in decades. ''This idea of getting on the phone and saying, 'Wouldn't you like to be honored at our gala?' -- that's more difficult, more challenging now than in my 30 years of experience at this,'' said Will Maitland Weiss, executive director of the Arts and Business Council of New York, which encourages companies to support the arts. 
 With honorees in short supply, the entire fund-raising ecosystem on which many nonprofit institutions depend -- especially those reliant on the financial sector -- is endangered. Despite the high costs of mounting a benefit, most nonprofit groups -- environmental, health, social service, cultural and educational -- try them at one time or another. How much a group gleans from a gala varies dramatically: for some, it's a few percentage points of the annual budget; for others, one big party in a hotel ballroom pulls in the bulk of a year's expenses. 
 The most coveted honorees are men and women who can lean on the people they do business with. ''The issue,'' says Jason H. Wright, a former senior vice president for public affairs at Merrill Lynch who sits on three nonprofit boards, ''is 'Do you have a list?' When you're a corporate executive, you've got suppliers from accountants to printers to whatever to ask.'' When you're a chief executive, other chief executives reciprocate. And when you're an executive from a glamour business -- Wall Street once qualified -- your appeal goes further, to people who will pay for a chance to meet you. 
 (On April 27, the Film Society of Lincoln Center honored Tom Hanks; it was no coincidence that tables at up to $50,000 for 10 guests were bought by Sony, Imagine Entertainment and Creative Artists Agency, companies that depend in part on the star.) 
 IN the past, the call to be a gala honoree was coveted in the business world. It signified arrival, achievement, statesmanship. Some on-the-rise executives even hired public relations experts to find them honors. 
 But not this annus horribilis. Nonprofit endowments -- like everyone's 401(k) -- are down 25 to 30 percent, and fund-raisers are scrambling to fill budget gaps. Although it's too early to measure the decline in giving statistically (reports won't be out for a year or two), over all, Mr. Weiss said, ''There's no question that this is the worst -- worse than 1987, worse than 9/11.'' 
 ''If you pick up the phone now and call somebody and say, 'We want to honor you this year,' the answer is 'Not now, not this year,' '' he added. ''They are saying, 'I am not going to give you a list of vendors and telling them I expect them to buy a $25,000 table.' ''
 Deborah Hays, deputy director for development at ArtsConnection, which provides arts education programs for schools, is one of those who decided not to make a call. ArtsConnection -- which had recently honored Kerry K. Killinger, the onetime chief executive of the defunct Washington Mutual bank -- dispensed with its traditional spring benefit in favor of small dinner parties.
 ''People don't seem to want to be high profile and corporations don't want to be high profile,'' Ms. Hays said. 
 Just as potential honorees don't want to pressure contacts to buy tables, neither do they want to be embarrassed if their ''list'' doesn't buy enough tickets. 
 Across New York -- where the spring benefit season is in high gear -- development officers, benefit organizers and nonprofit board members told similar stories; some said they had heard that many executives had declined the honors. But most refused to go on the record. ''We don't want our honoree to know he was the third or fourth choice,'' one explained. 
 Some groups solved the problem by choosing someone from deep in their midst, already committed to the cause. Trouble is, they don't add a new constituency of supporters, and they often lack the requisite cachet. 
 Whereas, for example, Big Brothers Big Sisters of New York City paid tribute to Leslie Moonves, the chief executive of CBS, in 2007, and Brian L. Roberts, the chief of Comcast, the cable TV company, in 2008, this year it honored Edward L. Gardner on April 28. Mr. Gardner, a trustee for more than 44 years who has raised more than $20 million for the group, heads the Industrial Solvents Corporation. 
 The ''Bigs NYC,'' as the groups term themselves, declined to comment on Mr. Gardner's glamour quotient. Instead, Michael A. Corriero, the executive director, sent a statement, reading in part: ''Without Ed, Big Brothers Big Sisters would be nowhere near the organization it is today.''
 Instead of canceling a gala, some groups have gone ahead without an honoree. Others, particularly those in culture, can draw from the artistic, rather than the business, community, capitalizing on their glamour. The Martha Graham Dance Company, for example, will honor the musician Phoebe Snow, whose mother danced for the company, and Paul Szilard, the dance impresario, on May 14. 
 A few groups did manage to recruit honorees from Wall Street. Boys & Girls Clubs nabbed Kenneth Chenault, the chief executive of American Express, for its June 3 gala at the Waldorf, even though the company has scaled back its philanthropy budget for 2009. ''This is a cause that resonates with many of our local merchant partners,'' said Joanna G. Lambert, an American Express spokeswoman. Equally important, Boys & Girls Clubs asked Mr. Chenault last year, before the worst occurred and before everyone adopted a bunker mentality.
 Other groups smartly avoided the financial world. Last year, for example, the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation was delighted when John M. Angelo, a hedge fund manager, volunteered to be the honoree at its benefit, which raised a $2 million. 
 This year, the Runyon foundation is honoring Richard T. Clark, the chief executive of the drug maker Merck, at the Rainbow Room on May 27. ''When you do an event in New York City, the financial sector is key to success,'' said Lorraine W. Egan, the group's executive director. ''But we were aware that getting someone from the financial sector would be difficult this year, so it was a natural thing for us to look to our other constituency.'' 
 Even when an honoree is listed on a gala invitation this year, it may not mean what it once meant. Some executives agreed to be honored but declined to provide a list of contacts, benefit organizers said. Some committed to buying one table, and that's it. At the Runyon foundation, ''Merck made a three-year commitment to us to fund a program at a significant level, in lieu of reaching out to its vendors,'' Ms. Egan said. ''We are completely comfortable with that.'' 
 THE honoree problem portends less money from benefits, which have already been retooled for the new era. Cost-cutting has forced switches from dinner events to cocktail receptions, from live music to D.J.s, from filet mignon to chicken. ''We lowered our entry-level ticket price, from $750 last year to $500 this year,'' said LaRue Allen, executive director at Martha Graham. ''Many of our supporters are like family, and we wanted to make it possible for our supporters to come.'' 
 If anything, nonprofit officials expect the honoree problem to worsen. ''We're always thinking about next year, and next year will be as hard, if not harder, than this year,'' Ms. Egan said. 
 Even forward-planning carries risks, though. Just ask the New York Botanical Garden. Last summer, it chose John A. Thain, then head of Merrill Lynch, to receive its Founders Award at its annual May benefit dinner. Then came Mr. Thain's downfall: he sold Merrill, whose billions of dollars in losses kept worsening, to Bank of America; pressed for a masters-of-the-universe-size bonus even after the injection of taxpayer money; was forced out of his job; and has been subpoenaed to testify about Merrill's bonuses by New York's attorney general. He's become a symbol of Wall Street hubris, with no vendor list, and hardly a draw.
 So, along with Mr. Thain and his wife, says a botanical garden spokesman, the benefit this month will also honor Gregory Long, the institution's president.

HEADLINE: 100 Days in the Footsteps of F.D.R. and L.B.J.

BYLINE: By SAM TANENHAUS

 BODY:
In American politics, the symbolic and the concrete are seldom far apart. Consider the fanfare surrounding President Barack Obama's 100th day in office.
 On the surface it seemed a classic instance of what the historian Daniel Boorstin once described as a ''pseudo-event,'' an exercise in public relations masquerading as news. ''The celebration is held, photographs are taken, the occasion is widely reported,'' Mr. Boorstin wrote of such staged episodes.
 The Obama administration itself took an equally jaundiced view at first. Robert Gibbs, Mr. Obama's press secretary, promised that the 100th day, which fell on Wednesday, would be ''not a ton different than the 99th.'' David Axelrod, a senior adviser to the president, called the milestone a ''Hallmark holiday.'' 
 But in the end the administration seized the moment, arranging a town-hall meeting for the president in a Missouri high school gym and then a prime-time news conference in Washington.
 Yet buoyant displays of this kind serve a civic function. Many of the re-examinations of the most celebrated of 100-day periods, Franklin D. Roosevelt's in 1933, have noted that Americans felt better because they liked Roosevelt himself, even if they couldn't be sure his policies would actually work.
 The same appears to be true of Mr. Obama. His strong approval ratings seem to reflect hope in him at a time when the economic news continues to be bad. 
 In his news conference, Mr. Obama subtly emphasized the link with Roosevelt. His vow to build a ''new foundation for growth'' on the ruins of America's collapsed banking and credit system, echoed Roosevelt's promise of ''a New Deal for the American people.''
 In concrete terms Mr. Obama's indebtedness to Roosevelt's approach is just as direct. His decision to assert regulatory control over an anarchic marketplace parallels Roosevelt's bold interventions. And Mr. Obama's denunciations of investors who declined to back Chrysler rang with the same scorn Roosevelt heaped on the sinister ''money changers'' he blamed for the Great Depression.
 But while Mr. Obama is preoccupied with the economy, his presidency owes its historic quality to another realm, race, in which the concrete and the symbolic are entwined even more complexly.
 This, too, was brought home on Wednesday, when the Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the constitutionality of a key provision of the Voting Rights Act designed to protect minority voters in states and counties with histories of discrimination.
 The constitutionality of this provision, included in the bill first passed in 1965 and reauthorized in 2006, is a matter of contention. Yet no one doubts that the legislation made it possible for Mr. Obama to be in the White House.
 But does a nation with an African-American president really need to have ''preclearance'' of any change to election laws for fear of discrimination? If so, what does this say about the conditions of race in America today? 
 One answer came on Tuesday, when a New York Times/CBS poll was released; it showed that the percentage of blacks who think racial relations in the country are ''generally good'' rose from 53 percent to 66 percent in less than a year. But the next day came the findings of a federal report, noting that achievement gaps separating white and minority students remain as wide as they were before the No Child Left Behind law was enacted in 2004.
 All this suggests that in the months to come the most useful precedent for Mr. Obama's presidency may not be Roosevelt's first 100 days but the ''Second Hundred Days'' of Lyndon B. Johnson, the president who steered the Voting Rights Act to passage while cautioning, in a memorable speech at Howard University in June 1965, that not even the most far-reaching ''rights'' legislation could eradicate inequality.
 Many African-Americans, whose loyalty since the Civil War had been with ''the party of Lincoln,'' switched party allegiances because the New Deal included them, not because of particular steps Roosevelt took on their behalf. ''While racial equality was rarely a stated goal'' in Roosevelt's programs, ''the New Deal opened for them new avenues of participation,'' G. Calvin Mackenzie and Robert Weisbrot wrote in their recent book, ''The Liberal Hour.'' 
 Johnson, a protege of Roosevelt, was determined to complete the unfinished business of the New Deal by tackling racial injustice -- not only through laws but through social policy. ''Freedom is not enough,'' he declared. He promised to cure the ills of inequity ''through our poverty program, through our education program, through our medical care and our other health programs and a dozen more of the Great Society programs.''
 Some aspects of this ambitious vision succeeded. Others failed. More broadly, the Great Society was undermined by the increasing costs of the Vietnam War and by urban discord -- a sequence of riots that began in Watts, a black neighborhood in Los Angeles, less than a week after the Voting Rights Act was signed. 
 Johnson tried to make the case that the Watts uprising was rooted in the social injustices he meant to cure. In fact Watts was a model of Great Society progress, rich in public services; a study by the National Urban League had rated it the most livable black neighborhood in the country. In any case, the riot helped fracture the coalition that had elected Johnson in a landslide in 1964 and helped turn many Democrats against the Great Society. 
 For now, Mr. Obama seems to be holding the New Deal and the Great Society models in careful balance. At his news conference on Wednesday, he struck a decidedly Rooseveltian note. When asked what he would do to help racial minorities, he replied, ''Keep in mind that every step we're taking is designed to help all people.'' Although blacks and Latinos would benefit from his programs, it was only because they were the ''most vulnerable'' in bad economic times. 
 But in an interview in The New York Times Magazine, published today, Mr. Obama sounded more like Johnson when he talked of making sure that ''prosperity is spread across the spectrum of regions and occupations and genders and races.'' 
 These strains of liberalism are not incompatible. But they are not identical. The question is whether Mr. Obama will be forced to choose between them in the days ahead or be able to fuse them into a single vision.

HEADLINE: Just Miles Apart, 2 Arenas Compete

BYLINE: By JEFFERY C. MAYS

 BODY:
MAYOR CORY A. BOOKER of Newark now refers to the letter he wrote to Gov. Jon S. Corzine criticizing plans to upgrade the Izod Center in the Meadowlands as his ''J.V. mistake.'' The letter that he sent last month, in which Mr. Booker called the plans ''fiscally irresponsible'' and ''injurious'' to the Prudential Center in Newark, reignited a big-league argument over the wisdom of having two sports and entertainment arenas less than 10 miles apart.
 After hearing of Mr. Booker's letter, Christopher J. Christie and Steve Lonegan, who are both seeking the Republican nomination for governor, chimed in, calling any expenditure on the Izod Center unwise, given the current economic climate. Other politicians jumped into the fray as well. Several Bergen County legislators -- including Senator Paul A. Sarlo -- who have largely opposed the Prudential Center and whom Mr. Corzine would like to have as allies in his re-election bid, expressed support for the Izod Center. 
 The fight over which arena will serve as New Jersey's prime sports and entertainment destination could not have come at a worse time for Mr. Corzine, as he faces a tightening election race. The Izod versus Prudential issue has increased debate over how best to use public dollars during a deepening recession and how to make such decisions in the context of the notorious regional tussles that typify New Jersey politics.
 ''I don't think anybody wants to shut the Izod Center before an election,'' said the State Senate president, Richard J. Codey. ''This question about the two arenas has been hanging around too long. After the election, the governor has to make a decision.'' 
 It's no surprise that this debate heated up again during election season, said Ingrid W. Reed, director of the New Jersey Project at Rutgers University's Eagleton Institute of Politics. 
 ''There's an old saying: 'Where you stand depends on where you sit.' You have a lot of people looking at this for their own self-interest and we know there are competing values here but any decision should be based on an analysis of how this serves the larger region,'' said Ms. Reed.
 The Izod Center, which opened in 1981 at the cost of $85 million, is operated by the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority and was financed with public dollars. The New Jersey Nets basketball team has a lease at the arena until 2013, but team officials said they plan to relocate to a Frank Gehry-designed arena in downtown Brooklyn in time for the 2011-2012 season. There is growing doubt about whether that arena will be completed. 
 The Prudential Center is the home of the New Jersey Devils hockey team. Newark and the state have contributed at least $263 million in taxpayer dollars to its construction and surrounding road and utility projects. Since opening in October 2007, the center has attracted close to three million people to the state's largest city, said Jeffrey Vanderbeek, president and vice chairman of Devils Arena Entertainment.
 ''All you have to do is come here at 6:30 p.m. before a game and see people coming to Newark and partaking in the bars and restaurants to see what it means to the city,'' Mr. Vanderbeek said.
 The views of the two arenas vary widely. Mr. Lonegan said the Prudential Center was located in a ''crime ridden'' area and should have never been built. The two arenas should compete, he said, and if one venue cannot sustain itself it should close.
 Mr. Booker said the success of the Prudential Center was good for the entire state.
 ''We have got to find a way to create two arenas that work,'' Mr. Booker said in Harlem two weeks ago, after endorsing the re-election of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York. ''My vision for Newark is that it will become an engine of economic opportunity for everyone. This is the first real opportunity for our region to show we can come together along a greater vision.''
 Mr. Codey said a solution might be on the horizon. Talks are under way for the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, which operates the Meadowlands sports complex, to have a role in managing the Prudential Center. Mr. Corzine has also called for cooperation between the two arenas.
 AEG, a Los Angeles-based company, manages the Prudential Center. Mr. Vanderbeek said he would like to see more cooperation between all of those involved in planning events at both places.
 ''We have had a couple of meetings centered on the coordination of concerts and acts so that both parties are not taken advantage of by the leverage acts and promoters have,'' Mr. Vanderbeek said.
 Dennis Robinson, chief executive of the sports authority, said the two centers could thrive under a cooperative agreement. He cited the events of April 15 when the Prudential Center hosted a Devils home playoff game while the Izod Center presented a concert featuring the Dave Matthews Band. In the Prudential Center's first year of operation, New Jersey had 125 more arena events than it did the previous year, Mr. Robinson estimated.
 ''That Dave Matthews event would not have happened if there is only one facility,'' he said.
 In order for such an agreement to work, Ms. Reed said, the language must be clear. ''Coordination doesn't get far unless you know what the rules are and everyone agrees to them,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Chrysler's Fall May Help Obama To Reshape G.M.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and BILL VLASIC

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Fresh from pushing Chrysler into bankruptcy, President Obama and his economic team are hoping that the hard line they took last week gives them leverage to force huge changes in General Motors, a far larger and more complex company.
 Officials say that, difficult as Mr. Obama's decision was on Wednesday to take all the risks of a Chrysler bankruptcy, the politics of reshaping G.M. will be far harder. Already a shadow of the company that once dominated the American landscape, G.M. will be forced to eliminate tens of thousands of additional jobs and close factories and dealerships nationwide. 
 In Chrysler's case, the tough job-cutting decisions had already been made and the government is taking only a small stake. An alliance with Fiat envisions selling the company's cars in new markets around the world and adding cars that use Fiat's fuel-efficient technology. 
 But in G.M.'s case, Mr. Obama will be forcing deeper cuts and becoming the controlling shareholder. He will also be overseeing the radical downsizing of G.M.'s work force as he is trying to reverse rising unemployment. 
 ''G.M. is very different than Chrysler,'' Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama's chief of staff, said Friday. ''But I suppose the one lesson for G.M., and all the other players, is that this is a moment when a Democratic president said, 'I am really willing to let a company dissolve, and there's not going to be an open checkbook.' There's got to be real viability.''
 No one thinks Mr. Obama is going to allow G.M. to be broken up, its assets sold or abandoned.
 But if the Chrysler legal process unfolds as the White House hopes it will in coming weeks, the bankruptcy option may look increasingly attractive for G.M. as well, officials on Mr. Obama's automotive task force said. Bankruptcy may also be the only way to force the kind of paring down that Chrysler, with a third of G.M.'s workers and half the number of plants, did not have to endure.
 ''The threat of bankruptcy is very important in the negotiations with the bondholders and the dealers and others,'' said David E. Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. ''Without a clear and present danger to them, they won't make a reasonable deal.'' 
 G.M.'s latest restructuring plan -- which the White House has yet to approve -- calls for trimming 47,000 jobs worldwide, closing more than a dozen plants in the United States, eliminating four brands and shuttering 2,600 dealerships.
 Even that may not be enough. As the leaders of Mr. Obama's task force faced down recalcitrant Chrysler creditors on Wednesday, a team of more junior officials was in Detroit assessing whether G.M. was cutting deeply enough to turn a profit. 
 ''Our marching orders were to do both Chrysler and G.M. the way we would do a strictly commercial deal,'' said a senior official on the task force, who would not speak on the record because the negotiations with G.M. were still in progress. ''We're not going to sit there and tell G.M. how many jobs to cut, or what models to eliminate. But we are going to look at the financials, the balance sheet, and see if the plan they come up with passes that test.''
 Because Chrysler was already the most marginal of what were once called the Big Three -- this will be its third corporate reincarnation in a decade -- Mr. Obama could afford to take a hard line. But when dealing with a company as politically sensitive and as large as G.M., the administration will have a far harder time separating the economic decisions from the political challenges.
 In Chrysler's case, a handful of the company's 46 lenders presented the biggest roadblock. Mr. Obama could portray them as obstructionists who put their demands for repayment ahead of preserving the company. 
 But General Motors' creditors number in the tens of thousands and include pension funds that bought the company's unsecured bonds. G.M. bondholders have no claim on its plants or inventory, but they will probably attract more sympathy than Chrysler's Wall Street lenders did. 
 The Treasury Department will pay $2 billion to Chrysler's bondholders, but it is offering only stock in a new G.M. to its creditors -- 225 shares for each $1,000 in debt held, making them minority owners who are invested in the company's success. ''That's the bargaining chip,'' said Mr. Cole of the Center for Automotive Research. 
 Ahead of the June 1 deadline, Mr. Obama holds all the leverage: The bondholders' only alternative would be to get in a long line of creditors who will be paid relatively little, because G.M. bonds are trading at about 10 cents on the dollar. It ''may not be such a bad deal in the end,'' Mr. Cole said.
 G.M.'s case also differs from Chrysler's in another crucial sense: there is no Fiat in the wings, no big private investor ready to bring new money and new technology. Instead, Mr. Obama will effectively use taxpayers as that investor, with the federal government getting slightly more than a 55 percent stake in the company in exchange for forgiving $10 billion in the automaker's outstanding federal loans. The United Automobile Workers' retiree trust would have just under 40 percent of the stock, under the G.M. plan. 
 The huge federal stake in G.M. -- even if temporary -- means that for all of Mr. Obama's protests that he is a reluctant investor, eager to fix the company and sell the controlling interest ( hoping for a hefty profit), he will be judged by whether his plan actually works. 
 Mr. Obama has said repeatedly that he is not an automotive engineer and has no desire to pick models, engines, factories or corporate governance structures. But while he may not be choosing automotive designs, he has already started dictating the company's direction.
 The president has made it clear that G.M. must produce small, fuel-efficient, low-carbon-emitting cars -- steps G.M. has taken only haltingly. Its vehicles range from the Cadillac Escalade, which gets 12 miles to the gallon in the city, to the experimental Chevy Volt, an electric car that it says will go 40 miles gas-free.
 Members of Mr. Obama's auto task force say that even after the government owns a majority of the company, it will have no role in management. That, they say, will be farmed out to professionals, the work supervised by government-appointed members of a new G.M. board.
 But at some point, some task force members acknowledge, the drive for profitability is likely to collide with Mr. Obama's fuel-efficiency and low-emission goals. G.M. produced heavy gas-guzzlers because they were among the most profitable in its line and, for a long time, the most popular. It is unclear whether smaller cars can be as profitable -- or, for a few years, competitive with offerings from Toyota and Honda and a raft of inexpensive cars under development in China.

HEADLINE: Enough With the 100 Days Already

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
BELIEVE it or not, there are Americans who have a ''very negative'' opinion of Barack Obama (13 percent, in the Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll). Some are even angry at him (10 percent, New York Times/CBS News). As the First 100 Days hoopla started to jump the shark last week, I tried, as an experiment in empathy, to see the world through their eyes.
 It was difficult at first, but an interview with the official White House photographer, Pete Souza, on CNN, pushed me over the edge. Souza was showing all those beguiling behind-the-scenes pictures that, though government issued, were more or less passed off as journalism by virtually every news outlet in the land. 
 Inevitably we got to The Dog. ''I want to show this picture because I find this to be a fascinating picture,'' said the CNN anchor John King, who found almost every picture fascinating. ''The president running down the hall with his new jogging partner there, Bo.'' What, he asked Souza, is it like ''to add this to the diversity of your work at the White House?'' 
 I'll leave the photographer's answer to your imagination. But for a second, anyway, I could imagine what it's like to be among the Limbaugh-Cheney deadenders who loathe Obama. Those who feel the whole world is against them. Those who think the press corps is in the tank. Those so sickened by the fawning that they'd throw a brick through the television screen if the Bush-Cheney economy had left them with enough money to buy a new set.
 But only for a second. I confess to being among the 81 percent (per Wall Street Journal/NBC) who like the guy. And I share the belief of nearly two-thirds of the American people (per every poll) that he has made an impressive start. The new president is largely doing what he promised, and he is doing it with the focus, brainpower and preternaturally calm temperament that kept his campaign on track even as the political press dismissed him as a hope-mongering naif next to the supposedly far more organized and more moneyed Hillary. 
 That the same crowd is over the top now in its praise says more about the news business than Obama. The journalism industry is fighting for its life. Obama is the one reliable product that moves the market for newspapers, magazines and television. No wonder so many special sections, special issues and special cable marathons have alighted on the 100 Days. 
 All those great report cards! Trying to stand out in this over-caffeinated throng of hagiographers, a Time pundit sprinkled his evaluations with A-pluses. One of them was for Michelle Obama, whose approval rating is even higher than her husband's. Hard to believe that just a year ago some of the same commentators were questioning her pride in America, and that Christopher Hitchens, writing in Slate, was seriously arguing that her 1985 Princeton thesis linked her by association to the views of Stokely Carmichael and Louis Farrakhan.
 Of course the high marks, mine included, are all ludicrously provisional. It's too early to judge the results of any Obama policy. What we do know is that his leadership is restoring the country's faith in itself and the future; the spike in the number of Americans who say we're on the ''right track'' is eye-popping. And, for all the politicians and pundits who complain that Obama is attempting too much at once, many of us like the breadth of his ambition. Doing too much at the same time, even at the risk of failure, is a core American trait that built the nation. It's as American as Benjamin Franklin, ''Moby-Dick,'' the New Deal and a double cheeseburger with all the toppings. 
 We'll see how Obama's vast plans play out. We'll see what unexpected nightmares, bigger than the swine flu, materialize on his watch. The 100 Days celebrations could not fade soon enough, because neither he nor the country should be lulled into resting easy. There are at least two toxic fiefdoms to keep the president and us awake at night: Pakistan and Wall Street. Both could wreak further untold catastrophe. Obama has control over neither, and in the case of the financial sector, he is fielding a team dominated by Robert Rubin proteges whose wisdom remains, to put it generously, unproven.
 But if those are the obvious hotspots for this presidency, there is also the domestic political culture to worry about. The Republican Party has collapsed, and that is not a good thing for the country or for Obama. We need more than one functioning party, not just to ensure checks and balances and pitch in ideas at a time of crisis, but to temper this president's sporadic bursts of overconfidence and triumphalist stagecraft. No one is perfect. We must remember that there is also an Obama who gave us ''You're likable enough, Hillary,'' a faux presidential seal and a convention speech delivered before what Sarah Palin rightly mocked as ''Styrofoam Greek columns'' hauled out of a ''studio lot.''
 That Obama needs a serious counterweight in the political arena. But the former party of Lincoln and liberty has now melted down to a fundamentalist core of aging, rural Dixiecrats and intrusive scolds -- as small as 20 percent of the populace in the latest polls. Its position on the American spectrum of ideas is somewhere between a doomsday cult and Scientology. 
 Arlen Specter's defection is the least of the Republicans' problems, a lagging indicator. Though many characterize his departure as a ''wake-up call'' for the party, it's only the most recent of countless wake-up calls the party has slept through since 2006. That was the year that Specter's Pennsylvania Republican colleague in the Senate, Rick Santorum, lost his seat by a margin of more than 17 percentage points. Despite that rout and many more like it of similar right-wing candidates throughout America, the party's ideological litmus test is more rigid than ever. The G.O.P. chairman, Michael Steele, and enforcers of Republican political correctness like William Kristol and the blogger Michele Malkin jeered Specter and cheered his departure. A laughing Limbaugh seconded e-mail from listeners commanding Specter to ''take McCain with you -- and his daughter.'' 
 You can't blame the president if he is laughing, too. As The Economist recently certified, the G.O.P. is now officially in the throes of ''Obama Derangement Syndrome.'' The same conservative gang that remained mum when George W. Bush praised Putin's ''soul'' and held hands with the Saudi ruler Abdullah are now condemning Obama for shaking hands with Hugo Chavez, ''bowing'' to Abdullah, relaxing Cuban policy and talking to hostile governments. Pollsshow overwhelming majorities favoring Obama's positions. But his critics have locked themselves in the padded cell of an alternative reality. Not long before The Wall Street Journal informed its readers that 81 percent of Americans liked Obama, Karl Rove wrote in its pages that ''no president in the past 40 years has done more to polarize America so much, so quickly.'' 
 From derangement it's a small step to madness. Last week, the president of a prime G.O.P. auxiliary, the Concerned Women for America, speculated that the president's declaration of ''a state of emergency about the flu was a political thing'' to push through Kathleen Sebelius's nomination as secretary of health and human services. At those tax-protesting ''tea parties'' on April 15, signs and speakers portrayed Obama as a ''fascist,'' a ''socialist,'' a terrorist and Hitler. Republican governors have proposed rejecting stimulus money for their states (only to fold after constituents rebelled) or, in the notorious instance of Rick Perry of Texas, toyed with secession from the union. 
 But this is funny only up to a point. It was in 1937 -- the year after the Democratic landslide left the Republican national ticket with a total of eight electoral votes -- that a hugely empowered F.D.R. made two of the biggest mistakes of his presidency. He tried to pack the Supreme Court with partisan allies and, overconfidently judging the economy recovered, retreated from the New Deal by instituting spending cuts that prompted a fresh economic tailspin.
 In the current climate Obama mustn't drink his own Kool-Aid. As the 100 Days rollout reminded us, he remains a master at promoting and controlling his and his family's image for maximum effect, down to each picture of Bo. The Obama White House has been more adept and broad-based than any of its predecessors at working the media, whether ''Access Hollywood'' or ESPN, Leno or YouTube, Us Weekly or what remains of newspapers. As Angela Burt-Murray, the editor of Essence, a magazine aimed at black women, recently told The Los Angeles Times after negotiating access to the Obamas for a photo spread, ''There's definitely a science to the way they're approaching this.''
 That's why it was alarming to learn that a White House official had authorized that idiotic public-relations photo shoot for Air Force One at the Statue of Liberty. We've just lived through a hubristic presidency that delighted in staging propagandistic stunts to remake reality -- Friday was the sixth anniversary of ''Mission Accomplished'' -- and we don't need another. The real Obama, unlike his predecessor, is more than strong enough as he is, without the steroids of excessive stage management. It will be incumbent on him now to remain grounded when there is so little opposition, in the political arena or most anyplace else, to challenge his high-flying course.

HEADLINE: Division, Unity and the Euro

BYLINE: By DEVIN LEONARD

 BODY:
THE rap mogul Jay-Z caused quite a stir two years ago when he flashed a bunch of 500-euro notes in a video. For a lot of Americans, it was enlightening. Sure, we knew that the euro had been surging in value against the hitherto almighty dollar. But if a star like Jay-Z preferred to display his net worth in euros instead of dollars, the buck must be in worse shape then we had thought.
 Since the euro's creation in 1999, its rise has indeed been spectacular -- and not just in the eyes of the MTV set. In ''The Euro: The Politics of the New Global Currency'' (Yale University Press), David Marsh notes that it swept away ancient currencies like the French franc, the Dutch guilder, the Greek drachma and newer but no less symbolically potent ones like the German mark and the Italian lira. 
 ''All contained the seeds and the spirit of centuries of European experience,'' Mr. Marsh writes. ''The coins for Cortez's men looking out on to the Darien; the money of Mozart for his music and Moliere for his manuscripts; of Tiberius for his treasure and Krupp for his cannon: all this was fused and remolded into a new currency for a new age.''
 The tale of how 16 nations forged a common monetary policy with the dream of putting centuries of conflict behind them and creating a counterweight to the dollar has all the ''the stuff of a political thriller,'' as George Soros writes in a blurb on the book's cover. Unfortunately, however, Mr. Marsh hasn't exactly written a beach book.
 Mr. Marsh has formidable qualifications. An investment banker in London, he certainly understands finance. His prose isn't bad, either; he has worked as a journalist at The Financial Times and Reuters. He's also a very good reporter. The author interviewed more than 100 important participants in the euro's inception, including Helmut Schmidt and Gerhard Schroder, the former German chancellors; Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the former French president; and John Major, the former British prime minister.
 But more than anything, Mr. Marsh is fascinated with monetary policy, the behavior of currency and how it is influenced by interest rates and budget deficits. He goes into exhaustive detail about concepts like ''narrower exchange rate fluctuation margins.'' That's fine. But he doesn't seem to have much interest in reducing this complex subject matter to simple ideas that can easily be grasped by those outside his guild. And he uses way too many numbers. The effect can be mind-numbing. 
 That's unfortunate, because this monetary maneuvering was part of a global power struggle that dates back to World War II, if not earlier, and couldn't be more interesting. After World War II, the United States helped Germany get back on its feet economically with a new currency and a strong, independent central bank that evolved into the powerful Bundesbank. The leaders of the new bank were determined not to repeat the monetary excesses of the 1920s and '30s that helped to pave the way for Hitler. 
 The Bundesbank was successful -- maybe too much so. The mark became so strong that France had to repeatedly devalue the franc, and French leaders referred to the mark as Germany's atom bomb. 
 Mr. Schmidt, who took office in 1974, knew that Germany couldn't afford to alienate the rest of Europe, which was haunted by the war's ghosts. In what Mr. Marsh describes as a ''secret speech'' to the Bundesbank council, Mr. Schmidt argued that his country should seek closer economic and monetary ties with its neighbors. 
 Germany was vulnerable partly ''because of Auschwitz,'' he said. ''The more successful we are in the fields of foreign, economic, social and defense policy,'' he added, ''the longer it will take for Auschwitz to fade from the fore of collective consciousness.''
 So Germany and France, the European continent's two largest economies, began a clumsy mating dance. Germany had the stronger currency and economy. But France had the moral authority, to say nothing of an actual nuclear arsenal. Mr. Marsh writes that Francois Mitterrand, who was elected president of France in 1981, used these things to enhance his negotiating power.
 Not everybody was happy to see these former enemies making nice. Margaret Thatcher of Britain, for example, had no interest in joining the party. 
 In one deliciously juicy instance, Mr. Marsh writes, Mrs. Thatcher asked a German ambassador at a Buckingham Palace dinner: ''So you want me to go to Her Majesty the Queen and explain to her that, in a few years, her picture will no longer be on our bank notes?'' 
 France and Germany resolved their outstanding differences after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. Germany reunified, and French political leaders were so intent on keeping it out of Russia's embrace that they grudgingly agreed to a plan to model the European Central Bank after the Bundesbank itself. Mr. Marsh writes that in January 2002, the central bank pumped eight billion new bank notes and 38 billion coins into banks, retail stores and vending machines in an area reaching from Finland to the Canary Islands without a glitch. Leave it to a group of European bureaucrats to get that kind of thing right.
 So the euro is a success. Or is it? 
 Mr. Marsh says it's too soon to say. He is concerned about opinion polls showing that most people in France, Italy, Spain and German think the new currency has had a negative impact on their economies. Then again, who is happy about their economy these days? He argues that the euro's popularity with investors -- and, one would think, rappers -- has more to do with the dollar's weakness than with the euro's strength. Granted, the euro hasn't been doing quite as well against the buck lately. But isn't it always better to have the currency with more muscle?
 It's a little disappointing to find Mr. Marsh straddling the fence at the end of the book. It would have been better for him to choose a side. Maybe he should have consulted Jay-Z. The rapper knows a thing or two about storytelling. And when it comes to currency, he's no fool, either.

HEADLINE: Buffett Says Derivative Bets May Cost His Company Money

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: OMAHA 

 BODY:
Warren E. Buffett acknowledged Saturday that his company, Berkshire Hathaway, would probably lose money on some of the derivatives contracts that have prompted some analysts to speculate that the world's most famous investor has lost his touch. 
 At Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting, Mr. Buffett offered a gloomy forecast for parts of the American economy and Berkshire itself, and he said federal efforts to stimulate activity could pay off at a possible cost of higher inflation.
 ''It has been a very extraordinary year,'' Mr. Buffett said. ''When the American public pulls back the way they have, the government does need to step in.'' He added, ''It is the right thing to do, but it won't be a free ride.''
 The meeting attracted a record 35,000 people to downtown Omaha to see Mr. Buffett, the world's second-richest person.
 But it had a decidedly more serious and somber tone from years past as many investors expressed worries about the economy, Berkshire's investments, and how long Mr. Buffett, 78, planned to stay on the job.
 Mr. Buffett said that housing prices had yet to stabilize broadly, that retailers may be under pressure for a ''considerable period of time,'' and that he would not buy most American newspaper companies ''at any price.''
 He also said that in insurance, which represents about half of Berkshire's operations, the earnings power ''was not as good last year as normal'' and ''won't be as good this year.''
 Mr. Buffett also said that the four candidates to succeed him as Berkshire's chief investment officer failed to outperform the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index last year but that he remained confident they could perform well over time. Berkshire still has three internal candidates to succeed him as chief executive.
 Berkshire's stock has fallen 39 percent since December 2007. Profit last year fell 62 percent from a year earlier. Mr. Buffett said he would not buy back Berkshire stock because its price is not ''demonstrably below'' the company's intrinsic value.
 Mr. Buffett had transformed Berkshire since 1965 from a failing textile maker into a conglomerate with close to 80 businesses that sell things like Geico car insurance, paint, ice cream and underwear. It also has tens of billions of dollars of investments.
 Charles T. Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire, on Saturday defended the decision by Bank of America's chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis, to complete the acquisition of Merrill Lynch and not to disclose Merrill's mounting losses before the merger closed. ''I think the Treasury people behaved honorably and intelligently, and so did Bank of America.''
 In addition, Mr. Buffett said that ''we were dealing with a fragile situation,'' and that if Bank of America had backed away, Merrill might have suffered a fate similar to that of Lehman Brothers, which went bankrupt.

HEADLINE: The Curious Man Lucky Enough to Create 'the Lucky Spud'

BYLINE: By JANET MASLIN

 BODY:
There is a particular type of potato at the heart of Jane S. Smith's book about Luther Burbank, a man who described himself as an ''evoluter of new plants.'' Ms. Smith nicknames that potato ''the lucky spud.'' That turn of phrase is one of many reasons to appreciate ''The Garden of Invention,'' her colorful, far-reaching book about the genetic, agricultural, economic and legal issues raised by Burbank's life and legend.
''The road from the 19th century to the 21st global market twists and turns, of course,'' she writes, ''but a good part of it still passes through Luther Burbank's garden.'' Ms. Smith offers a thoughtful and often quirkily entertaining expansion on that idea. 
The lucky spud is the russet Burbank, honored as ''the classic American potato'' by the United Nations in 2008 (''the International Year of the Potato''). At 22, in 1871, Burbank bought a plot of land and began cultivating vegetables. This particular type of russet potato was created by his Darwin-inspired experiments in propagation. It would become hugely popular. How popular? So popular that decades later McDonald's would insist on its use for the making of French fries.
Then, in 1995, the Monsanto Corporation would genetically modify the russet Burbank so that the potato could produce its own pesticide to repel the Colorado potato beetle. So how lucky a spud is it, really? In a biographical study that casts a long shadow (George Washington was president when Burbank's father was born; Jimmy Carter was president when his widow died), Ms. Smith considers that question from every angle.
A few oddities from Burbank's childhood illustrate Ms. Smith's keen eye for detail. The soil in the region of Massachusetts where Burbank was raised must have been unusually fertile; it also produced John Chapman, a k a. Johnny Appleseed. Luther's mother, born Olive Burpee Ross, had a distant connection to the seed magnate W. Atlee Burpee and went to school with a girl named Mary Sawyer, who became known to every English-speaking child on the planet for being followed to school by her little lamb. As for ''Little Lute,'' as the family called him, he was described as a morbid and morose child. And he bathed only in ice water. ''These are slender threads from which to weave a tale of destiny,'' Ms. Smith writes. True, but it makes her own well-woven narrative that much more impressive.
The young man went West. After his first flush of success with the russet coup, he moved to California and began contemplating fruit. Under the spell of a wild melange of influences, from transcendentalism to the nature-related theories of Alexander von Humboldt, Burbank lived in a world fascinated with agricultural booms and bubbles. Rare hens, merino sheep and mulberries were all subjects of 19th-century financial speculation.
He himself became obsessed with learning how to speed up experiments in plant breeding. He grew fast-sprouting almond seedlings and grafted fruit blossoms onto them, hoping to accelerate the growth of profitable orchards. He became known as a miracle worker, prompting Ms. Smith to write about the Burbank catalog, ''New Creations in Fruits and Flowers,'' ''Had the Garden of Eden itself been up for sale, the prospectus might have read something like this publication.''
Burbank's methods were too complicated and cryptically recorded by him to be summarized here. (''Was '#=done' the same as '#=good'?'' Ms. Smith wonders) The book explains its subject's scientific achievements, but it is also interested in bigger things. Among them: the evolution of Burbank's reputation as a popular hero, despite the fact that he fit no familiar category (he particularly frustrated academics trying to assess his work) and represented different things to different people. He was asked to testify by both warring camps in the Scopes ''monkey trial.'' Henry Ford, smitten with Burbank's quaint persona and rustic surroundings, saw Burbank ''as a link to a way of life Ford's own inventions had done so much to render obsolete.''
''The Garden of Invention'' follows its subject's growth from zealous inventor to satirists' delight (''he could teach a mango to do the tango'') to hero of schoolchildren and figure of great renown. ''Like many celebrities, Burbank sometimes found it hard to remember that the ability to command an audience does not necessarily mean you have anything important to say,'' Ms. Smith writes. She traces Burbank's reputation from its turbulent phase to the ''simpler, saintlier narrative'' that made him the subject of a drama called ''The Man With Green Fingers,'' with Lionel Barrymore.
This book takes more than a passing interest in Burbank's income, insofar as it reflected his legal ability to protect his scientific advances. In his early professional years he grappled with the doctrine that held that while a gold mine was real property and a machine to extract gold was intellectual property, the actual mineral belonged to anyone who could find it; ditto with potatoes. Throughout his career, even as he developed friendships with tycoons like Ford and Thomas Edison, Burbank lived under constant financial pressure to keep creating new plant products. ''His income was entirely dependent on his latest marvel,'' Ms. Smith writes.
The final part of this book describes the wrangling over Burbank's legacy after his death. Fittingly enough, this section is far less colorful than what preceded it. ''The Garden of Invention'' trails off into a list of places where studies of Burbank's work can be found. But even as she cites these, Ms. Smith recognizes the problem that they pose. Research material on Luther Burbank, she writes, ''makes it seem as if the story of the garden somehow happens indoors.''

HEADLINE: No Actors, Just Patients in Unvarnished Spots for Hospitals

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
A television commercial for the Akron Children's Hospital in Ohio presents Austin, who is 14 and bald from chemotherapy, wearing a blue varsity jacket while seated in a rocking chair.
''I don't really see like how this all happened -- the whole cancer situation,'' says Austin, over footage of his playing basketball in his school gym, and walking down a hallway in a hospital gown. ''It just blows my mind that I end up getting it. I knew as soon as the doctor told me, I was like, 'I'm going to beat it, no matter what. It's just a disease.' ''
It is emblematic of a new approach to advertising by hospitals -- an industry that, despite the recession, is not slashing ad spending. 
The campaign, by the Marcus Thomas agency in Cleveland and running on about 20 cable channels and network stations in Ohio, is entirely unscripted. Other spots feature more patients and their young siblings, who talk about how their families are coping.
Patients in ads usually are success stories, survivors crediting hospitals with saving their lives. But the Akron campaign features patients in the throes of crises, with no inkling of their outcomes (which, considering that the footage was shot within the last few months, may still be unknown).
''Hospitals are dramatic places, but every commercial that has an outcome -- a typical testimonial spot -- is a foregone conclusion,'' said Jim Sollisch, a creative director at Marcus Thomas overseeing the campaign. ''So we thought, let's let the commercial reflect the inherent drama in the situation.''
Mr. Sollisch said the campaign, aimed at mothers ages 18 to 49, reflects the spirit of YouTube and Facebook, where nonactors are the stars, and spontaneity trumps scripted messages.
''Two or three years ago you could have had actors depicting patients, but the rules of engagement are changing,'' Mr. Sollisch said. ''We have to be more transparent.''
In the ads, though, the hospital is more than just transparent -- it is practically invisible. Its logo never appears, a first for any of its advertising, and it is mentioned only by name in subtitles, to identify the setting, for instance, as Austin walks its halls. The only direct reference is at the conclusion of each spot, where viewers are urged to learn more at akronchildrens.tv, a Web site that does highlight the hospital's attributes.
It is a bold approach, but it is not without precedent. Other hospitals also are avoiding some of the conventions of hospital advertising, like the bromides about how their doctors (''skilled'') and nurses (''caring'') work together (''teamwork''), or the boasts about how well the hospital was rated by a magazine or Web site.
Even hospitals, long considered recession-resistant, are feeling the economic pinch. But they are still placing ads. Total advertising spending by United States hospitals in 2008 was $1.23 billion, a slight increase over the previous year of $1.20 billion and more than twice as much as 2001, when hospitals spent $493 million, according to TNS Media Intelligence, a research unit of WPP.
When the New York advertising firm DeVito/Verdi was hired by Mount Sinai Medical Center in 2003, the New York hospital itself was ailing. The year before, a patient died a few days after donating part of his liver to his brother, leading the hospital to temporarily shut its liver-transplant program and institute internal reforms.
When DeVito/Verdi first surveyed the landscape of hospital advertising, it saw a number of orthodoxies, said Ellis Verdi, its president.
''There was an institutional tone, so the new building would be shown, or the new machinery,'' Mr. Verdi said. ''That goes against the most important aspect of what they do, which is provide a public service of making people feel better.''
When people were featured, they often were doctors or nurses comforting patients, accompanied by ''we care'' ad copy. But ''saying 'we care' is like the moment when someone says 'trust me,' '' Mr. Verdi said. ''I think, 'Maybe I won't.' ''
As for ads' tendency to cite ratings from the U.S. News & World Report's annual best hospitals issue, Mr. Verdi dismissed it as ''chest-beating'' and said it backfires because ''unless you're the Mayo Clinic you have to hedge it -- you say you're the fifth for a certain category, but only in the last three years.''
The agency's first ad for the hospital, which began appearing in 2003, features a small girl running along a beach, with this headline: ''We turned a child who couldn't hear into a typical 2-year-old who doesn't listen.'' The copy relates the experience of a girl from Romania whose hearing was surgically restored at Mount Sinai, and ends with the tagline, ''Another day, another breakthrough.''
Most ads in the campaign have also featured clever depictions of success stories (''Ruby Gaynor's parents cried when she suffered brain damage,'' begins another. ''They cried even more when she graduated Columbia''), but they also deviate on occasion.
An ad that first appeared in 2005 and still runs today, for example, features a baseball that, instead of a typical stitching pattern, has only a few red stitches, and the headline, ''Minimally invasive sports surgery.''
The campaigns have earned DeVito/Verdi dozens of national and international advertising awards; two more hospitals, Massachusetts General Hospital and Abington Memorial Hospital in Pennsylvania, have hired it.
When first working with Mount Sinai, the agency drafted a list of commandments it still follows.
''No pictures of doctors,'' it begins, ''no smiling people, no fancy machinery, no over-promises about medical care, no complicated medical terminology: just truthful expressions of critical care and breakthroughs.''

PERSON: Marilyn French 

HEADLINE: Marilyn French, Novelist and Champion of Feminism, Dies at 79

BYLINE: By A. G. SULZBERGER and HERBERT MITGANG

 BODY:
Marilyn French, a writer and feminist activist whose debut novel, ''The Women's Room,'' propelled her into a leading role in the modern feminist movement, died on Saturday in Manhattan. She was 79 and lived in Manhattan. 
 The cause was heart failure, said her son, Robert. 
 With steely views about the treatment of woman and a gift for expressing them on the printed page, Ms. French transformed herself from an academic who quietly bristled at the expectations of married women in the post-World War II era to a leading, if controversial, opinionmaker on gender issues who decried the patriarchal society she saw around her. ''My goal in life is to change the entire social and economic structure of Western civilization, to make it a feminist world,'' she once declared. 
 Her first and best-known novel, ''The Women's Room,'' released in 1977, traces a submissive housewife's journey of self-discovery following her divorce in the 1950s, describing the lives of Mira Ward and her friends in graduate school at Harvard as they grow into independent women. The book was partly informed by her own experience of leaving an unhappy marriage and helping her daughter deal with the aftermath of being raped. Women all over the world seized on the book, which sold more than 20 million copies and was translated into 20 languages.
 Gloria Steinem, a close friend, compared the impact of the book on the discussion surrounding women's rights to the one that Ralph Ellison's ''Invisible Man'' had had on racial equality 25 years earlier.
 ''It was about the lives of women who were supposed to live the lives of their husbands, supposed to marry an identity rather than become one themselves, to live secondary lives,'' Ms. Steinem said in an interview Sunday. ''It expressed the experience of a huge number of women and let them know that they were not alone and not crazy.''
 Ms. French continued publishing novels as well as books of essays and literary criticism with the common theme of male subjugation of women, whether the arena was Shakespeare or modern history. ''Men's need to dominate women may be based in their own sense of marginality or emptiness; we do not know its root, and men are making no effort to discover it,'' she wrote in ''The War Against Women'' (1992). 
 Critics accused her work of being anti-male, frequently citing a female character in ''The Women's Room'' who declares, after her daughter has been raped: ''All men are rapists, and that's all they are. They rape us with their eyes, their laws, and their codes.'' 
 In 1992 Ms. French, a longtime smoker, was given a diagnosis of esophageal cancer and told she had just months to live. She chronicled her winning battle against the disease, which included a 10-day coma, in ''Season in Hell: A Memoir'' (1998). 
 ''I cannot say I am happy I was sick,'' she wrote. ''But I am happy that sickness, if it had to happen, brought me to where I am now. It is a better place than I have been before.'' 
 Nevertheless, the disease and its treatment took such a sharp physical toll that, friends said, for a while afterward she questioned whether she should have survived. ''She was in pain for 15 years but she was extremely brave,'' said Carol Jenkins, a friend who runs the Women's Media Center, an advocacy group in New York. ''She fought through it, she wrote through it and carried on her life. The printed word was a source of life for her.''
 In the years since her supposed death sentence, Ms. French continued to publish prolifically; she has a novel scheduled for release this fall and was working on a memoir at the time of her death. Her most significant work since her illness was the four-volume ''From Eve to Dawn: A History of Women,'' published by Feminist Press and built around the premise that prevailing histories had denied women their past, present and future.
 Despite carefully chronicling a long history of oppression, the last volume ends on an optimistic note, said Florence Howe, who recently retired as director of the publishing house. ''For the first time women have history,'' she said of Ms. French's work. ''The world changed and she helped change it.''
 In recent years Ms. French struggled to get published, partly because of the gains in women's rights she had helped bring about. ''It was a source of embitterment to her and outrage to me,'' said Robin Morgan, a writer, feminist activist and close friend.
 Marilyn French was born on Nov. 21, 1929, in Brooklyn, the daughter of E. Charles Edwards, an engineer, and Isabel Hazz Edwards, a department-store clerk. She studied philosophy and English literature at Hofstra College in Hempstead, on Long Island, earning a bachelor's degree in 1951 and a master's in 1964. She was an English instructor at Hofstra from 1964 to 1968, then earned a doctorate from Harvard. She was an assistant professor of English at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass., from 1972 to 1976. 
 She married Robert M. French Jr., a lawyer, in 1950. They divorced in 1967. 
 Ms. French is survived by her son, Robert, of East Brunswick, N.J., and a daughter, Jamie French, of Cambridge, Mass. 
 While Ms. French was pleased by significant gains made by women in the three decades since her landmark novel, she was also just as quick to point out lingering deficiencies in gender equality, friends recalled. 
 ''She had,'' Ms. Steinem said, ''higher standards and higher hopes.''

HEADLINE: At Deadline, No Deal Yet On the Future Of The Globe

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO

 BODY:
Negotiations between the New York Times Company and the Boston Newspaper Guild over concessions that could avert the closure of The Boston Globe apparently reached Sunday's midnight deadline without a deal. 
 Little more than an hour before the deadline, the Times Company said it would file a notice under federal law stating its intention of closing The Globe within 60 days. 
 The union put out its own statement saying it had made a proposal that exceeded management's demands. The union called the company's statement that it would file the closure notice, ''representative of the bullying manner in which the Times Company has conducted itself during these negotiations.''
 The two sides could continue negotiating during the 60-day period, if the notice is filed, that is required under federal law to close a business of The Globe's size. A first deadline for a deal was Friday at midnight, but the two sides agreed to keep talking after the union said the company had made an accounting error that increased the amount of concessions the company was demanding from the union.
 In early April it emerged that the company had threatened to close The Globe if labor unions refused to accept major concessions such as pay cuts and reductions in pension contributions as well as the end of some lifetime job guarantees.
 The Times Company has said The Globe is on track to lose about $85 million this year amid the worst advertising decline for newspapers since the Great Depression. The company has been looking for $20 million in labor concessions, including about $10 million from the Boston Newspaper Guild, the largest union that represents Globe employees. 
 In 1993 the company paid $1.1 billion for The Globe, which is the highest price ever paid for a single American newspaper. 
 While the industry overall has been severely affected by the recession and the flight of readers to the Internet, the advertising decline has been worse in Boston than elsewhere in the country.
 In the recent quarter, advertising in the Times Company's publishing segment fell 28.4 percent, but the worst fall came in the New England Media Group, of which the largest portion is The Globe. Advertising in that unit fell 31.6 percent.
 The Times Company has also been seeking to sell its stake in the Boston Red Sox baseball team and the regional sports network NESN.

HEADLINE: After Lifetimes Selling Pontiacs, Feeling Sold Out

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Pa. 

 BODY:
 The Arnold Pontiac dealership is not one of those glass-encased bazaars winking from the main drag, with a showroom the size of a parking lot and a name that sounds like a law firm with too many partners: ''Acme Chevrolet Buick Jeep Hyundai Volkswagen Kia Saab. How may I direct your call?''
 No, Arnold Pontiac pretty much says it all.
 The dealership sits exactly where the Arnold family began a car business back in 1916: on the corner of North Main and East Pike in the pit-stop Western Pennsylvania town of Houston, right next to the First Presbyterian Church, where Arnolds are baptized. Small showroom downstairs, service and parts upstairs, free Pontiac calendars everywhere. 
 Until a few days ago, the Arnolds had a plan. In the tradition of his father and grandfather, Bob the white-haired elder, 74, would be turning the dealership over to his son, Bob the dark-haired younger, 44. The handoff would have happened sooner if not for the embezzlement of $400,000 a couple of years ago by a longtime employee who was like family and who, it turned out, liked to gamble.
 But a far deeper betrayal came last week, the Arnolds say, when another family member and poor gambler, General Motors, announced that by 2010 it would close its Pontiac division and 2,600 of its 6,200 dealerships -- all to convince a doubtful Obama administration that it had a business plan strong enough to beat a bankruptcy deadline of June 1 and to deserve more government loans.
 Pontiac: The Official Car of the 2009 Economic Crisis.
 Small, out-of-the-way Arnold Pontiac sells only Pontiacs, GMC trucks and used cars, so the Arnolds figure their G.M. warranty is about to expire. ''It was just like getting kicked in the stomach,'' says the elder Mr. Arnold, who sold his first car in 1950, to a local man named Paxton. (''Pontiac Catalina. Two-door hardtop. It was cream and rust.'')
 His son, who started working at the dealership when he was 6, using a step stool to dust the tops of gleaming Bonnevilles and GTOs, is still trying to process the apparent evaporation of this chunk of his inheritance. ''I'm not going to entertain that just yet,'' says the younger Mr. Arnold, who sold his first car in 1987. (''Green Sunbird.'')
 As Detroit and Washington work to save the car industry from going over a cliff like some roadster in a black-and-white melodrama, entire families have been upended -- families that long ago linked their surname to the name of Pontiac in commercial banns of marriage.
 For example, the Arnolds are friends with the Mikans, a longtime Pontiac family in Butler, about 60 miles north of here. Robert Mikan, 76, and his son, David, 39, watched last Monday's devastating news conference on a computer screen in their dealership, in a back room where an old plaque from the Pennsylvania Automotive Association hangs tilted on the gray paneled wall.
 After a while the son, whose first sale was a used white 1988 Pontiac Grand Prix, turned to his father, whose first sale was a gray 1946 Pontiac Torpedo, and said, ''Dad, I think that's it.''
 They knew the end had come to a legacy dating to Robert's father, Ivan, who started a car business in the town of Trafford in 1924, sold Chryslers and Hudsons for a while, then settled on Pontiacs. That was 70 years ago.
 Such excitement back then. Every year Ivan Mikan would paper over his showroom windows, building excitement, before unveiling the new Pontiac models at a reception where men wore suits and women wore dresses. Ladies and gentlemen, introducing:
 Your 1951 Pontiac Chieftain! And yes, that hood ornament lights up!
 Your 1958 Pontiac Bonneville! America's No. 1 road car! 
 Your 1968 Pontiac GTO! We call it The Great One!
 ''That's a lot of years working for a brand and for a division that is now going to be defunct,'' says Robert Mikan, who keeps a 1975 Pontiac Grand Ville convertible, red with white interior, in a garage out back.
 David Mikan, who runs the dealership now, says their sales of Pontiacs have steadily declined: 100 sold last year, compared with twice that in 2000. Although the emphasis has shifted to their Volkswagen line and their used cars, he says, the Mikans have always considered themselves a Pontiac family.
 Still, a few days ago he removed all the preening Pontiacs from the front of the dealership and replaced them with shiny Volkswagens. Partly out of anger, he says, and partly because Volkswagen, not Pontiac, is central to the Mikan future.
 Back in Houston, there is no Volkswagen fallback. The Arnolds have been hitched to Pontiacs since 1926, the year the car made its debut. Because of Pontiac, Bob Arnold the elder attended the General Motors Institute in Flint, Mich., more than a half-century ago. Because of Pontiac, then, he happened to meet his future wife, Angela, at an institute dance. 
 ''Girls got in free,'' recalls Ms. Arnold, whose first car was a 1955 Pontiac Star Chief Catalina, turquoise and ivory. Now she drives a 2005 Pontiac Bonneville, candy-apple red.
 It is quiet now in the dealership's office, save for the whoosh of passing cars outside, few of them Pontiacs.
 A man pops his head in long enough to say: ''Thanks, Bob. That was a good deal you gave my sister.''
 The visit underscores what Mr. Arnold has been saying about how small dealerships have cultivated relationships that span generations. Yes, Pontiac made mistakes, but Pontiac traditionally enticed younger people to join the G.M. family.
 Mr. Arnold wonders about the future -- what about their 20 employees? -- and soon that wonder turns to complaint. G.M. should never have gotten rid of the Bonneville. G.M. sacrificed Pontiac to save Buick. It's all about the Buick market in China, which comes at the expense of American jobs. In the end, G.M. betrayed its family.
 But Susan Garontakos, a G.M. spokeswoman, responds with a sobering perspective. The Pontiac line has been unprofitable for several years, she says. G.M. is trying to develop a survival plan under the government's deadline. Plants are closing and people are losing their jobs -- including her son-in-law.
 ''It's hitting everyone,'' she says.
 Mr. Arnold walks across the still showroom, shoes squeaking on the treated floor. He passes a display case of family memorabilia. Portraits of his parents and grandparents. A row of souvenir pens. A hood ornament whose amber glow once announced to the night: Here comes another Pontiac.
 He starts talking about how discouraged he is, but interrupts himself long enough to hand a visitor a 2009 calendar, courtesy of Arnold Pontiac, Houston, Pennsylvania.

HEADLINE: U.S. Media See A Path to India In China's Snub

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO

 BODY:
After many years of fervent lobbying and deal-making in China, American media companies have little to show for their efforts there and are increasingly shifting their attention instead to India. 
 Media executives still believe that Chinese audiences are receptive to Western culture -- ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' is a big hit in China -- but many companies have been pulling back out of frustration over censorship, piracy, strict restrictions on foreign investment and the glacial pace of its bureaucracy.
 In recent weeks, America Online shut its operations in China, for the second time. Warner Brothers, the movie studio that shares a corporate parent with AOL in Time Warner, had plans as recently as 2006 to open more than 200 retail stores throughout China, with a local partner. Today there are no such plans. 
 ''No one really has a decent-size presence there, and no one seems to know how to get one,'' said Michael Del Nin, senior vice president for international and corporate strategy at Time Warner. ''In terms of priorities, the focus is elsewhere.''
 Increasingly, that focus is India, a country with a fast-growing economy and fewer government impediments for foreign media companies. In March, the Motion Picture Association of America opened an office in India for the first time, in Mumbai. A little over four years ago, Dan Glickman became the head of the association, and he has visited China several times.
 ''The feeling was that there were greater opportunities then than there are now,'' he said.
 This is a stark reversal. For many years, American media executives have extolled the potential of China, wooing executives and promoting the potential goldmine of reaching its one billion-plus population. Sumner M. Redstone, who controls Viacom and CBS, entertained Chinese officials in his Beverly Hills mansion over meals prepared by Wolfgang Puck.
 But for media companies, frustrations have been growing. For several years, China has capped the number of foreign films that can be shown in theaters at 20. 
 Sometimes studios back away from even seeking the approval of Chinese authorities, as Warner Brothers did last year with ''The Dark Knight,'' because of a belief that the movie would not pass muster with government censors. ''The Dark Knight'' is the second-highest grossing movie of all time, with more than $1 billion at the worldwide box office, after ''Titanic'' (in dollars not adjusted for inflation). 
 In November, Warner became the first studio to announce it would make new movies available in China over a video-on-demand at prices low enough -- about 60 cents to $1 -- to compete with pirated versions. The service still is not under way.
 Even with access, it is possible to reach only a tiny portion of the Chinese. In China, for example, CNN International is available only in hotels that cater to foreign business travelers and in embassies. Viacom has an MTV China, but it reaches only about 14 million homes in the Guangdong Province. 
 ''It seemed like China captured everyone's imagination,'' said William H. Roedy, chairman of MTV International. ''I think everyone expected too much, too soon. You have to be patient.''
 Rupert Murdoch engaged in a decade-long odyssey -- some say obsession -- to entertain China's vast populace. Mr. Murdoch found a wife, but very little revenue. His wife, Wendi Murdoch is paid $100,000 a year to ''provide strategic advice'' on the development of MySpace China, a joint venture operated by the News Corporation, according to regulatory filings. 
 Other than that, Mr. Murdoch's activities in China are minimal. His Star TV, a pan-Asian satellite service, has channels in Chinese, but reaches only a small presence on mainland China. The company has significantly cut its staff in China in recent years. 
 Troubles with Chinese investments have even reached back to American shores. Yahoo and Google have been criticized in the United States for cooperating with Chinese censors.
 When Jack Cafferty, the CNN commentator, insulted China last year by saying its products were ''junk'' and its leaders ''goons,'' Time Warner quickly apologized. But the episode has lingered in the minds of executives. 
 Their gradual disenchantment puts media companies at odds with many industries, like consumer products, that still look for large-scale growth in China. Nike recently said China was its primary area of growth in Asia, as revenues there increased 29 percent through the first nine months of its fiscal year. Coca-Cola is planning to increase its business there, despite a recent ruling by Chinese regulators that shut down the takeover of a juice company. And despite its problems elsewhere, General Motors remains a force in China.
 In India, American-owned networks can reach far bigger audiences than in China, because of fewer government restrictions. Recently, Turner Broadcasting and its movie studio, Warner Brothers, which are part of Time Warner, established a new English-language channel called WB in India. Turner Broadcasting Systems, another unit of Time Warner, has started a Hindi-language pay-TV channel, REAL. 
 ''We're certainly focusing on India,'' said Louise Sams, executive vice president for and general counsel of Turner networks. ''There's been a huge amount of growth in the number of networks in India over the last couple of years.''
 Viacom, meanwhile, made a significant investment in India last year with Colors, which has become the top-rated entertainment network there in recent weeks. Its top show, ''Balika Vadhu,'' is a drama about a girl who marries at age 8. Another popular show is a locally based reality show with a premise like that of ''Fear Factor.'' MTV India of Viacom reaches 30 million homes, more than twice that of the network's China outpost. 
 But executives remain alert to any signs of a thaw in China. When ''Slumdog Millionaire,'' which was filmed in India, won an Academy Award for best film this year, it caused a stir in China's film community and raised hopes that China, out of regional rivalry and envy, might become more open to American studios.
 ''Now that they've seen 'Slumdog,' they want more movies produced in China,'' said Jeanette Chan, a lawyer who represents United States film studios in Asia. ''There's this undercurrent, this competition, between China and India. Particularly when they see Bollywood do well.''

HEADLINE: Universities Cutting Teams As They Trim Their Budgets

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
After three decades of steady growth in the number of teams and student-athletes, colleges and universities large and small, private and public, east and west, are slashing millions of dollars from their sports budgets.
 Colleges have dismissed athletic staff, reduced hours for pools and practice courts, and increased equipment and facility fees. Some have also cut the size of their travel squads, eliminated trips requiring air travel and done away with housing teams in hotels the night before home games.
 Institutions facing fat deficits have risked the wrath of students, parents and alumni and cut scholarships and teams. The University of Cincinnati wiped out scholarships for three men's sports: track, cross-country and swimming. Stanford University told its fencing teams to look for other financing. 
 The University of Massachusetts dropped its ski teams, and Kutztown University in Pennsylvania eliminated its men's soccer and men's swimming teams. On Friday, the University of Washington said it would cut its swimming teams to save as much as $1.2 million, less than half of the spending that the athletic department needs to reduce. 
 ''We just couldn't make cuts across the board anymore,'' said Blake James, the athletic director at the University of Maine, explaining why his department cut its men's soccer and women's volleyball programs. ''We were bleeding our programs to death.''
 Even the wealthiest universities are pinched. The Massachusetts Institute of Technologyannounced it was cutting eight teams -- Alpine skiing, competitive pistol, golf, wrestling and men's and women's ice hockey and gymnastics -- as a way to trim $1.5 million from its athletic budget.
 Taken together, the cuts could deeply alter the college sports landscape. The gap will widen between the haves with television and sponsorship deals, and the have-nots that rely mostly on alumni and their universities for financing.
 ''One of the things we have to worry about is competitive equity,'' said Myles Brand, the president of the N.C.A.A. ''If some schools have too small a budget, it could affect their play, and that isn't fair.''
 Programs that disappear are unlikely to return, particularly in Olympic sports like gymnastics and swimming. That could lead to less diversity on campuses and weaken the country's prowess at international events.
 ''It may take a couple of years to shake out,'' said Robert Bowlsby, the director of athletics at Stanford, which cut $1.8 million from its athletic budget this year and plans to save $3 million next year and $4.5 million in 2011. ''Once programs go away, they seldom come back. And if they do, they take many years to start again because all the remaining athletes are off campus and the money gets used for something else.''
 College sports have grown steadily during the past three decades thanks to Title IX, which provided equal opportunity in men's and women's sports. An increase in television and sponsorship dollars and growing pressure from alumni to spend more on athletics have fueled a surge in sports programs, too.
 According to N.C.A.A. figures, a record 17,682 college teams competed in the 2007-8 academic year, 60 percent more than in 1981-82. During that time, the number of student-athletes grew 78 percent, to a record 412,768.
 The number of women's teams has increased drastically, particularly in sports like lacrosse and soccer, thanks partly to growth in the number of youth leagues. The number of men's teams has also risen, though more modestly.
 Sports like fencing, gymnastics and wrestling have gradually disappeared on campuses, overshadowed by more prominent baseball, basketball and football teams.
 Yet only twice in the past two decades -- in 1988-89 and 1997-98 -- has there been a net decline in the number of men's and women's athletic programs nationally.
 The growth in college athletics has made it harder to cut back during lean times because of resistance from students -- especially those with athletic scholarships -- their parents, alumni, sponsors and civic boosters.
 ''There's great pressure on schools to win,'' said John Cheslock, who teaches at the Center for the Study of Higher Education at the University of Arizona. ''If I'm an athletic director and I drop a sport, I'm going to have everyone who plays the sport angry at me, as well as parents and former athletes and donors.''
 Though official figures are not yet available, Brand said he expected the number of athletic programs to shrink about 1 percent this year, or by about 130 teams. 
 ''We've seen some sports close because of financial reasons in the past, but that was spotty,'' he said. ''This is the worst I've seen it.''
 He said he did not have a forecast for the 2009-10 academic year.
 There are, to be sure, sacred cows. At many universities, football and basketball bring in more money than they spend, because of strong support from alumni, ticket sales and television and sponsorship revenue.
 Some programs are so wealthy that they subsidize entire athletic departments. In the 2007-8 season, the Southeastern Conference distributed an average of $5.3 million in football and basketball television revenue to each of its 12 members. In August, the SEC signed 15-year television contracts with ESPN and CBS that will generate even more money.
 Last week, the Arkansas athletic department said it would spend $1 million to help the university avoid increasing tuition. In December, the athletic department at South Carolina agreed to steer $1 million of its television revenue back to the university.
 ''There's no doubt that most if not all our institutions are experiencing budget issues with their state legislatures,'' said Mike Slive, the commissioner of the SEC. ''To the extent that our athletic departments can assist, they've done that.''
 Because many tickets to SEC football games for the coming season were sold before the downturn, universities may not feel the effect of the recession for another six or eight months, Slive said.
 The Ohio Valley Conference, which includes 11 universities in Alabama, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri and Tennessee, is not so fortunate. It reduced the number of teams that play in conference championship tournaments to six, eliminated media days before the football and basketball seasons (instead conducting news conferences online), and stopped printing media guides.
 ''We were doing cost containment before cost containment was cool,'' said Jon A. Steinbrecher, the conference commissioner until last week, when he took over as the head of the Mid-American Conference. ''It's not huge dollars, but by the time you eliminate two media days and print media guides, you're talking $25,000 to $40,000 in savings.''
 Teams in the conference are taking buses on longer trips to avoid flying, and staying overnight less often.
 At Lehigh, which has 25 varsity sports and competes in the Patriot League, athletes on the volleyball, field hockey and soccer teams will return to campus only a few days before dormitories open, instead of a full week. The change will save the athletic department about $20,000 in room and board.
 Joe Sterrett, Lehigh's athletic director, trimmed $250,000 from his budget. He said he was also concerned about a potential decline in the number of athletes who attend the university's sports camps, which bring in as much as $900,000 each summer.
 ''You have to look for ways to squeeze,'' he said.

HEADLINE: As Jets Focus on Sanchez, Harvard's Pizzotti Hopes for Second Look

BYLINE: By BRIAN HEYMAN

DATELINE: FLORHAM PARK, N.J. 

 BODY:
Chris Pizzotti dropped back to pass, just as he had on so many Ivy League Saturdays. But now his mind was cloudy with indecision during his second practice at the Jets' rookie minicamp.
 ''Hey, Harvard,'' Coach Rex Ryan said to Pizzotti, ''don't overthink it too much.''
 (''I was waiting for that opportunity to get that dig in that way,'' Ryan said the next day, laughing.) 
 Most of the eyes here Friday had a 20/20 focus on Mark Sanchez, Pizzotti's roommate for the three-day camp that ended Sunday. The Jets drafted Sanchez with the fifth overall pick to be the long-term answer to their quarterback question. But Pizzotti, a Harvard man and boyhood New England Patriots fan from Reading, Mass., got his chance to help fill out the depth chart.
 Pizzotti, who signed as an undrafted free agent after finishing No. 2 in Crimson history in completions, percentage and yards, needed to make a strong first impression to prove to the Jets he was worth a further look. He hopes to be around come training camp to fight on the undercard for a roster spot while Sanchez and Kellen Clemens vie to start out No. 1 behind center.
 ''I'm definitely looking to compete for the third spot with Erik Ainge and whoever else they bring in,'' said Pizzotti, the 2008 Ivy League player of the year. ''I just have to do whatever it takes to make the team.
 ''I always wanted to get to this step. To have an opportunity to keep playing football is a great thing.''
 The vital statistics are there for Pizzotti, who is 6 feet 5 inches and 225 pounds. ''He certainly looks the part,'' Ryan said.
 The other statistics were certainly there for him, too, playing at the Football Championship Subdivision level.
 ''He's very talented,'' said wide receiver Paul Raymond, who played for Brown against Pizzotti and grabbed an impressive intermediate-range pass from him Saturday. ''He has a nice ball.
 ''It's definitely a big jump, but if you have the talent to make that jump, that's all that matters.''
 Pizzotti's record as a starter over the last three seasons was 20-2, and he tossed only four interceptions each of the last two years, as Harvard won one Ivy title and shared another. As a fifth-year senior last season, he threw for 2,490 yards and 17 touchdowns, both the second most in a season at Harvard.
 ''I know where to go with the football, and I make good decisions,'' Pizzotti said. ''I don't throw too many interceptions. I bring good leadership to the team. I think I have a good arm. I don't have the bazooka that Matt Stafford or Sanchez might have.''
 The Pizzotti family tree is filled with football-playing branches. The Boston Yanks made his grandfather Frank Dancewicz the top overall pick in the 1946 N.F.L. draft as an all-American quarterback out of Notre Dame. Dancewicz played three years for Boston. He died in 1985, the year before Pizzotti was born.
 ''Me getting here was always something I wanted to do just because it's almost come full circle from him to me,'' Pizzotti said.
 Then there is Pizzotti's father, Steve, who played linebacker at Northeastern. Pizzotti's older brothers also played quarterback in college: Dave at Boston University and Steve at Tufts.
 ''Ever since I was young, I was always playing quarterback, whether it was Pop Warner or any street game,'' Pizzotti said. ''Just watching my brothers play in high school -- they both won state championships their senior year -- pushed me to be as good as them, if not better.''
 There was even more inspiration around, being a quarterback from the Boston suburbs. Pizzotti became a fan of the Patriots' Tom Brady and even studied film of him, marveling at his technique.
 ''I've always tried to strive to be someone like him,'' Pizzotti said.
 With a degree in economics, Pizzotti has thoughts of becoming a general manager or a coach one day. But for now, he just wants to be a Jet.
 ''Pizzotti's done really well,'' Sanchez said. ''Sharp kid, obviously. Harvard.''

DEAR DIARY:
 Visiting New York City a few years ago, I was walking down Avenue of the Americas in the 50s when I noticed a man selling watches out of a briefcase atop a garbage can. About eight people were eyeing the watches, a typical sight on these streets. 
 One potential customer asked, ''How can you sell these so cheaply?'' 
 The man answered, ''They're stolen, stupid!''

 Dear Diary: 
 At the Varick Street post office, there is often a man holding the door open for customers as they come and go, asking politely for change.
 On this particular day inside the post office, I noticed an elderly woman who appeared to be having a lot of difficulty walking. After leaving the post office, I crossed Seventh Avenue, glanced back, and saw that the woman I'd seen in the post office had made it only a third of the way across the crosswalk. Oncoming traffic began to zoom down Seventh Avenue, and the woman was trapped in the middle of the street.
 She screamed, and the pedestrians on my side of the avenue were frozen -- we didn't know what to do -- when the man in front of the post office, without hesitation, raced in front of the woman, his hand out signaling ''Stop!'' to oncoming traffic, and slowly guided her across the street, fending off and stopping traffic at each step.
 I would say a majority of us witnessing this were in tears when the pair reached the other side. Mary Ashby Brown

 My 3-year-old granddaughter was ''behind the wheel'' on the play equipment at the Washington Market Playground in TriBeCa. 
 I asked if she was driving a bus. She said no.
 ''A car?''
 ''No,'' she said.
 ''Oh, I know; it must be an airplane.'' Again she said no.
 ''What are you driving then?'' I asked.
 She said, ''A train.''
 ''Oh, what train is it?'' I asked.
 ''The E,'' she said.

 Dear Diary:
 I was in Zabar's recently on my way home to Vermont. I always ask them to double-wrap our smoked fish, since it is a four-hour ride home. 
 Next to me was a woman who asked with great concern, ''Does the lox travel well?''
 One of the old-time counter men said: ''It depends, lady. How far are you traveling?''
 ''Brooklyn,'' was her reply.
 The slicers politely grinned and assured her that her lox would be fine. Paul Bilsky

 Dear Diary:
 I was standing on the northwest corner of 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue when I heard someone shouting repeatedly, ''My friend, my friend, stop! Stop!''
 I soon realized it was the voice of a traffic cop standing at the northeast corner of 42nd Street, trying to alert pedestrians of vehicles turning north onto Eighth Avenue. Jean Osnos
 Dear Diary:
 Recently unemployed, I've become a voracious consumer of discounts as well as an explorer of neighborhoods off my beaten path. My two hobbies converged on a recent Friday on the Lower East Side, where this sign appears on Orchard Street: ''Buy One Boot or Shoe and Get One 1/2 Price.'' 
 I still can't decide if it is an ironic comment on the ubiquitous ''50 percent off'' signs around town, a reflection of the diverse immigrants to the Lower East Side or a shrewd attempt to render such confusion as to sell at a profit. George J. Tomczyk

HEADLINE: The X-Men Return To Motivate Moviegoers

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Weak reviews, cranky fans, a pirated version: none of it mattered.
 ''X-Men Origins: Wolverine'' kicked off the spring-summer blockbuster season with $87 million in ticket sales, continuing the year's box office boom and keeping a core franchise alive for 20th Century Fox and Marvel Entertainment.
 The fourth in a series that began in 2000 with ''X-Men,'' ''Wolverine'' stopped short of the performance by another superhero movie, ''Iron Man,'' which took in about $98.6 million when it was released by Paramount Pictures and Marvel on the same weekend last year. 
 But the new Fox film, which was directed by Gavin Hood with Hugh Jackman in the lead role, became an instant hit in the face of obstacles that have included boycott calls -- some of them set off by Fox's earlier threat to block Warner Brothers from releasing ''Watchmen'' in a legal dispute -- and a still-smarting leak that put a pirated version of ''Wolverine'' on the Internet a month before its release.
 The performance was particularly impressive in that ''Wolverine'' opened without the advantage of the supersize Imax screenings -- demand for the big-screen technology has exceeded supply -- that have boosted the opening weekend of fantasy thrillers like ''The Dark Knight.''
 ''If you had to nail it down to one thing, it would be the affection and appetite for Hugh and the character he's created,'' said Chris Aronson, a senior vice-president of Fox's distribution unit, said of the resilience shown by ''Wolverine.'' Mr. Aronson called the concern over the online leak ''agonizing'' and added that even as late as Saturday night a heavily viewed NBA playoff game had bitten into audiences in Chicago and Boston. And the critics did not help: one of many to pan the film, A. O. Scott, writing in The New York Times, said it showed that the superhero genre ''is suffering from serious imaginative fatigue.''
 But an unexpectedly large female audience -- nearly 50 percent of the total -- and a possible return of fans who were distracted by the basketball game boosted Fox's expectations for the film's continued strength. Returns from 101 foreign territories reached about $73 million, to give the film a global box office take of about $160 million, Mr. Aronson said.
 ''Ghosts of Girlfriends Past,'' a romantic comedy with Matthew McConaughey and Jennifer Garner, took in about $15.3 million to place No. 2 for Warner Brothers and its New Line Cinema division, according to a studio estimate. 
 Last weekend's No. 1 film, ''Obsessed,'' a thriller from Sony Pictures and its Screen Gems unit, placed third this weekend, with about 12.2 million in sales, and a total of $47 million since opening on April 24.
 Other pictures in the Top 5 were ''17 Again'' from Warner Brothers and New Line, with about $6.4 million in ticket sales and $48.5 million since opening on April 17, and ''Monsters vs. Aliens'' from Paramount and DreamWorks Animation, with $5.8 million, and $182.4 million since its release on March 27.
 In all, the weekend's top 12 films took in about $152.2 million, up about 1 percent from $150.7 million last year, when ''Iron Man'' -- which eventually took in more than $318 million to become last year's second biggest hit, after ''The Dark Knight'' -- turned in an exceptionally strong performance, according to the Hollywood.com Box-Office tracking service.
 For the year to date, the total box office is about $3.2 billion, up 16.4 percent from about $2.8 billion last year, Hollywood.com Box-Office said.
 The continuing surge in ticket sales appears to show an audience drawn to diversion in tough economic times and the growing power of the ultra-large-screen and 3-D technologies that pulled viewers to ''Monsters vs. Aliens'' and will support a number of forthcoming pictures, including the science-fiction thriller ''Avatar,'' expected from Fox and the filmmaker James Cameron later this year.

HEADLINE: Term Limits Say New Orleans Mayor Can't Return; Residents Say They Don't Mind

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS 

 BODY:
As Mayor C. Ray Nagin approaches his final year in office, he faces scandal, an acrimonious stalemate with the City Council and the worst popularity ratings ever recorded for a mayor here. 
 Term limits will keep him from running again, so Mr. Nagin's eight tumultuous years of leading what he called a ''chocolate city'' will come to an end next May. He has not been popular among middle-class white voters since the chaotic days after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, but now, with the city still in a halting recovery more than three and a half years later, residents citywide seem eager to see him go.
 In a recent poll by the University of New Orleans, Mr. Nagin was cited as one of the ''biggest problems'' for the city, coming in third after crime and education. Just 24 percent of residents over all said they approved of the mayor, a drop from 31 percent the year before. 
 ''It's the worst approval rating we've reported since 1986,'' when the poll was first conducted, said Robert T. Sims, the director of the university's survey research center.
 Among African-Americans, support dropped to 36 percent from about half of those polled last year. Among whites, who constituted much of Mr. Nagin's voting base in his first election, the approval rating was 5 percent. (The survey's margin of sampling error for whites was plus or minus five percentage points.)
 Edward F. Renwick, a retired professor of political science at Loyola University and a pollster himself, said he found that figure surprising. ''I have hardly ever seen 5 percent,'' Dr. Renwick said. On the other hand, he added, ''I have never met a white person who doesn't hate him.''
 That sentiment can be seen in a $2 bumper sticker that has become popular in the city's souvenir shops. In vivid Mardi Gras colors, it says: ''May 31, 2010: Nagin's Last Day. Proud to See Him Gone.'' 
 The creator of the bumper stickers and of a ''Nagin's Last Day'' Web site that features a countdown clock asked that his name not be revealed because he is a local businessman and worries about retribution. But, he said, the intent is to turn frustration into laughter. ''At funerals, we dance and have second-line parades,'' he said. ''We're dancing out the Nagin era.'' 
 A spokesman for Mr. Nagin, Terry Davis, said the mayor had questioned the methodology of the poll. But two days after the interview with Mr. Davis, a poll from Tulane University reported similar numbers. 
 Why is dissatisfaction so high? People have learned to take in stride Mr. Nagin's tendency to shoot from the hip with a howitzer and have tended to draw some satisfaction from his ability to avoid the serious taint of corruption that has dogged many Louisiana politicians. 
 Now, however, that sense is coming to an end, after accusations arose in a civil lawsuit concerning city technology contracts. In a deposition, a former city official said he took a Hawaiian vacation with Mr. Nagin and their families in 2004 that was paid for by a company whose owner did extensive business with the city through other companies. Claims of other trips raising ethics questions were raised in later testimony. 
 At a news conference on April 7, the mayor defended the Hawaiian vacation. ''I don't see it as a violation of any law, any ethics rules,'' he said, because he had been told that the city official -- Greg Meffert, the former chief of technology for New Orleans -- was paying for the trip, not the contractor.
 ''It's been cleverly portrayed that there's something wrong here, and no one has proven that yet,'' Mr. Nagin said at the time. He acknowledged, however, that ''there's still a question whether this is illegal or unethical.'' He declined requests for an interview.
 Mr. Nagin has also been in a long stalemate with the City Council over budget issues and a struggle with news organizations over public-records requests for his e-mail messages. After a judge ordered the messages released, it emerged that thousands of messages had been deleted. 
 But the biggest issue is the state of the city. Dr. Renwick, of Loyola, said that despite positive signs of rebuilding in neighborhoods like the French Quarter and the Garden District, enormous areas of the city were still crippled and government services were balky at best.
 Fixing a streetlight, Dr. Renwick said, can take months and repeated complaints. Over time, he said, ''you build up a mass of people who are irritated.''
 Ruston Henry, a pharmacist who lost his business in the Lower Ninth Ward to Hurricane Katrina and who works on economic development issues in the city, said residents were frustrated.
 ''They see tremendous opportunity, and they see not much getting done,'' Mr. Henry said, though he added that the Council must share part of the blame.
 Part of what initially got Mr. Nagin elected, Dr. Renwick said, was his reputation as a businessman, rather than a professional politician. But in the crisis, the city needed something more. 
 ''The mayor is not a hands-on administrator,'' Dr. Renwick said. ''He's more a big-picture guy. And fixing streetlights is small picture. There's a bit of a disconnect there.''
 The authors of the Tulane poll, including the political consultant James Carville, said voters believed by two to one that the city was ''on the wrong track,'' and they compared the city's mood to that of the nation ''in the final year of the Bush administration.''
 One of the mayor's top aides, Edward J. Blakely, executive director for recovery management, said in an interview that, to some extent, Mr. Nagin was a victim of his times.
 ''Everything that was broken before Katrina is now magnified, and the mayor has to be held accountable for it,'' Mr. Blakely said. Housing may be blighted, the streets pothole-strewn and the infrastructure crumbling, he said, but ''these things were broken long before Katrina.''

HEADLINE: Q. & A. with Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
Q: (Reader)
 I join those who feel that, by using a male voice for the sandwich oven in a new commercial, Quiznos has blown a great opportunity and turned it into a liability. 
 If heterosexual sex sells, does homosexual sex do the opposite? They could have done so much more with a sexy female voice, but instead they introduced the creepy factor, turning potential good vibes into bad. 
 I think Quiznos should re-record the voice-over with a sultry female voice and then do some test marketing -- or did they?
 What's the back story on the decision-making process that led to the use of a male voice?
 A: (Stuart Elliott)
 The commercial in question is for a new sandwich, the Toasty Torpedo, being sold at Quiznos for $4 each in a bid to undercut the $5 foot-long sandwiches that have proved so popular for a rival sandwich shop, Subway.
 The spot, by the New York office of Nitro, features the toaster-oven, with a male voice, talking to a Quiznos employee named Scott. The oven urges Scott to help him introduce the sandwich, which is described with some double entendres that will elicit giggles from the viewers who are still in middle school.
 Quiznos is known for campaigns created to be provocative and draw attention, and this commercial is no different.
 ''We're a challenger brand,'' says Rich Schaden, who recently returned as chief executive at Quiznos. ''We have a history of edgy advertising.''
 ''We like stuff that causes social discourse,'' he adds, ''and this ad has definitely done that.''
 The scene was modeled, Mr. Schaden says, after the scene in the 1968 movie ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' between Dave the astronaut and the HAL 9000 computer, which has a male voice.
 In fact, he adds, in the original story board for the commercial, the voice bore the label HAL.
 As for any suggestion that the relationship between the oven and Scott is untoward, Mr. Schaden says, ''I don't know if an oven has a sexual preference.''
 Dear reader, I am very sad that you believe there is something ''creepy'' about the situation and it generates ''bad vibes'' for you.
 If you are made that uncomfortable by the presumed sexuality of an appliance in a commercial, maybe you ought to turn off the TV, get off the sofa and get out into the real world more often.
 Q: (Reader)
 Is that voice in the commercials for Michigan tourism Tim Allen?
 A: (Stuart Elliott)
 Yes, dear reader, the comedian Tim Allen, a Michigan native, can be heard in the spots, says Ken Yarsevich of the Michigan Economic Development Corporation in Lansing.
 The spots are part of a campaign carrying the theme ''Pure Michigan,'' promoting travel and tourism. The campaign is created by the Birmingham, Mich., office of McCann Erickson Worldwide, part of the McCann Worldgroup division of the Interpublic Group of Companies.

HEADLINE: Worries Rise On the Size Of U.S. Debt

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY and JACK HEALY

 BODY:
The nation's debt clock is ticking faster than ever -- and Wall Street is getting worried.
 As the Obama administration racks up an unprecedented spending bill for bank bailouts, Detroit rescues, health care overhauls and stimulus plans, the bond market is starting to push up the cost of trillions of dollars in borrowing for the government. 
 Last week, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes rose to its highest level since November, briefly touching 3.17 percent, a sign that investors are demanding larger returns on the masses of United States debt being issued to finance an economic recovery. 
 While that is still low by historical standards -- it averaged about 5.7 percent in the late 1990s, as deficits turned to surpluses under President Bill Clinton -- investors are starting to wonder whether the United States is headed for a new era of rising market interest rates as the government borrows, borrows and borrows some more.
 Already, in the first six months of this fiscal year, the federal deficit is running at $956.8 billion, or nearly one seventh of gross domestic product -- levels not seen since World War II, according to Wrightson ICAP, a research firm. 
 Debt held by the public is projected by the Congressional Budget Office to rise from 41 percent of gross domestic product in 2008 to 51 percent in 2009 and to a peak of around 54 percent in 2011 before declining again in the following years. For all of 2009, the administration probably needs to borrow about $2 trillion. 
 The rising tab has prompted warnings from the Treasury that the Congressionally mandated debt ceiling of $12.1 trillion will most likely be breached in the second half of this year.
 Last week, the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, a group of industry officials that advises the Treasury on its financing needs, warned about the consequences of higher deficits at a time when tax revenues were ''collapsing'' by 14 percent in the first half of the fiscal year. 
 ''Given the outlook for the economy, the cost of restoring a smoothly functioning financial system and the pending entitlement obligations to retiring baby boomers,'' a report from the committee said, ''the fiscal outlook is one of rapidly increasing debt in the years ahead.'' 
 While the real long-term interest rate will not rise immediately, the committee concluded, ''such a fiscal path could force real rates notably higher at some point in the future.''
 In some ways, ballooning deficits should not matter. Deficits are a useful way for governments to use public spending to stimulate the economy when private demand is weak. This works as long as a country closes its deficit and pays back its borrowings after its economy starts to recover. 
 The trouble is that government borrowing risks crowding out private investment, driving up interest rates and potentially slowing a recovery still trying to take hold. That is why the Federal Reserve announced an extraordinary policy this year to buy back existing long-term debt -- $300 billion over six months -- to drive down yields. The strategy worked for a while, but now the impact of that decision appears to be wearing off as long-term interest rates tick up again.
 Then there is the concern that the interest the government must pay on its debt obligations may become unsustainable or weigh on future generations. The Congressional Budget Office expects interest payments to more than quadruple in the next decade as Washington borrows and spends, to $806 billion by 2019 from $172 billion next year. 
 ''You're just paying more and more interest and having to borrow more and more money to pay the interest,'' said Charles S. Konigsberg, chief budget counsel for the Concord Coalition, which advocates lower deficits. ''It diverts a tremendous amount of resources, of taxpayer dollars.''
 Of course, no one is suggesting the United States will have problems paying the interest on its debt. On Wednesday, even as it announced its huge financing needs for the latest quarter, the Treasury said financial markets could accommodate the flood of new bonds. ''We feel confident that we can address these large borrowing needs,'' said Karthik Ramanathan, the Treasury's acting assistant secretary for financial markets.
 One worry, however, is that there are fewer eager lenders to buy all that American debt. Most of the world is in recession, and other nations have rising borrowing needs as well. As other nations' surpluses turn to deficits, America will face competition in global financial markets for its borrowing needs. For the moment, the United States is actually benefiting from a flight to quality into Treasuries brought on by the global financial crisis, which helped reduce rates to record lows this winter. But the influx will not continue forever.
 China has lent immense sums to the United States -- about two-thirds of its central bank's $1.95 trillion in foreign reserves is believed to be in United States securities -- but it has begun to voice concerns about America's financial health.
 To calm nerves and fill the deficit hole, the government is getting creative. The Treasury is ramping up its auction calendar, holding more frequent sales of government debt and selling the debt in expanded amounts. It is now holding sales of its 30-year bond each month, up from four times annually.
 It is also resuscitating previously discontinued bonds, such as the seven-year note and the three-year note, to try to mop up any available money all along the yield curve. There is even talk of issuing billions of dollars of a new 50-year bond, though the idea has not won official approval.
 On a second front, the Treasury and the Federal Reserve are trying to bolster the mechanics of the market -- to make sure every auction goes smoothly. With such enormous sums involved, every extra basis point on the interest rate the government pays could mean extra billions of dollars for the taxpayer. Earlier this year, when demand was hesitant at a Treasury auction and when a British bond auction went poorly, investors grew nervous that the government might struggle to sell its mountain of debt.
 To avoid such an outcome and to keep borrowing costs low, the government is trying to expand the group of firms that bid at Treasury auctions. After the demise of such names as Lehman Brothers, the number of these firms, called primary dealers, has shrunk to 16, the smallest since this elite club was formed decades ago. Now the government is in discussions with smaller firms like Nomura and MF Global to persuade them to join.

HEADLINE: Still Unfinished Business

 BODY:
President Obama has correctly refocused American attention on Afghanistan and Pakistan, the real front in the war on terror. But the recent surge in bombings is an alarming reminder of all of the unfinished business from President Bush's unnecessary war in Iraq. 
 As American troops begin to hand combat posts over to the Iraqi Army, Sunni insurgents are trying to exploit any weakness. In April, more than 300 Iraqis died, up from under 200 in January. Eighteen American troops were killed, the highest toll in six months. 
 The problem isn't Mr. Obama's order to end America's longest-running war. It is the failure of Iraq's Shiite-led government to make the political changes that are the only chance for holding the country together. 
 We had hoped that the clear timetable for an American withdrawal would focus the attention of Iraq's leaders. So far it hasn't -- or at least not enough. Washington needs to be pressing them a lot harder, using all of the levers it has, including aid and Baghdad's appetite for American-made military equipment.
 Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki has reneged on a commitment to find government jobs for tens of thousands of members of the Sunni Awakening Councils, the former insurgents whose decision to switch sides helped change the course of the war. His government has also failed to implement a year-old law that would allow former members of the Baathist Party -- who were banned from government service after the 2003 invasion -- to return to their positions or collect pensions. 
 Old rivalries and hatreds are difficult to put aside. The decline in oil revenue makes it especially hard to expand government employment right now. But Iraq will pay a much steeper price if disaffected Sunnis turn again on the government. 
 Ethnic tensions are also growing in the north where the Kurds are pressing to annex oil-rich Kirkuk to their semiautonomous region. Turkmen and Arab residents insist on staying with the central government. United Nations mediators have proposed compromises, like making Kirkuk an autonomous city run by all three ethnic groups. If an agreement cannot be crafted, Washington, Baghdad and the Kurds may have to consider outside, possibly U.N.-led administration for some period. 
 Ways must also be found to mitigate frictions in Nineveh Province, a hotbed of Sunni insurgency. Sunni Arabs sat out the 2005 elections, leaving the Kurdish minority to run virtually unopposed. The Sunnis won big in January's provincial elections and now dominate the provincial council, its budget and patronage jobs. An Iraqi government spokesman said Sunday that an Iraq-United States security agreement would not be modified to allow American troops to stay in Mosul, the provincial capital, past the June 30 deadline. But if violence escalates, that may have to be revisited. 
 For two long months, Washington had no ambassador in Iraq. Now that Christopher Hill -- the veteran diplomat who led negotiations with North Korea during the Bush years -- is finally in place, he must move quickly to tackle these and other challenges. Iraq's government must be pressed to finally adopt a long-delayed oil law to equitably manage oil fields and share profits. There is still no plan for returning home the estimated four million Iraqis who are refugees or displaced inside Iraq. 
 Washington must also find a way to work with Iran and other of Iraq's neighbors to try to limit outside meddling as American troops prepare to go. The Pentagon has made progress building up Iraq's army and police, but there is much more training and equipping to be done before they can take over from American troops. 
 Even then, there will be no chance of a durable peace without a lot more political and economic reform and the participation of Iraq's neighbors.

HEADLINE: Debate Over Interrogation Methods Sharply Divided the Bush White House

BYLINE: By MARK MAZZETTI and SCOTT SHANE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The proclamation that President George W. Bush issued on June 26, 2003, to mark the United Nations International Day in Support of Victims of Torture seemed innocuous, one of dozens of high-minded statements published and duly ignored each year.
 The United States is ''committed to the worldwide elimination of torture and we are leading this fight by example,'' Mr. Bush declared, vowing to prosecute torture and to prevent ''other cruel and unusual punishment.''
 But inside the Central Intelligence Agency, the statement set off alarms. The agency's top lawyer, Scott W. Muller, called the White House to complain. The statement by the president could unnerve the C.I.A. interrogators Mr. Bush had authorized to use brutal tactics on members of Al Qaeda, Mr. Muller said, raising fears that political winds could change and make them scapegoats.
 White House officials reaffirmed their support for the C.I.A. methods. But the exchange was a harbinger of the conflict between the coercive interrogations and the United States' historical stance against torture that would deeply divide the Bush administration and ultimately undo the program. 
 The aftershocks of the interrogation policy continue. President Obama's recent decision to release Bush administration legal memorandums on interrogation and to fend off calls for a broad investigation has only fueled debate over the efficacy, legality and morality of what was done. Just last week, bloggers seized upon a new video clip of Condoleezza Rice, a former secretary of state, sharply defending the program to a Stanford undergraduate and saying nothing about the bitter internal arguments that accompanied the demise of the program. 
 Most news accounts of the C.I.A. program have focused on how it was approved and operated. This is the story of its unraveling, based on interviews with more than a dozen former Bush administration officials. They insisted on anonymity because they feared being enmeshed in future investigations or public controversy, but they shed new light on the battle about the C.I.A. methods that grew passionate in Mr. Bush's second term.
 The consensus of top administration officials about the C.I.A. interrogation program, which they had approved without debate or dissent in 2002, began to fall apart the next year. 
 Acutely aware that the agency would be blamed if the policies lost political support, nervous C.I.A. officials began to curb its practices much earlier than most Americans know: no one was waterboarded after March 2003, and coercive interrogation methods were shelved altogether in 2005.
 Yet even as interrogation methods were scaled back, former officials now say, the battle inside the Bush administration over which ones should be permitted only grew hotter. There would be a tense phone call over the program's future during the 2005 Christmas holidays from Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser, to Porter J. Goss, the C.I.A. director; a White House showdown the next year between Ms. Rice and Vice President Dick Cheney; and Ms. Rice's refusal in 2007 to endorse the executive order with which Mr. Bush sought to revive the C.I.A. program. 
 The real trouble began on May 7, 2004, the day the C.I.A. inspector general, John L. Helgerson, completed a devastating report. In thousands of pages, it challenged the legality of some interrogation methods, found that interrogators were exceeding the rules imposed by the Justice Department and questioned the effectiveness of the entire program. 
 C.I.A. officials had sold the interrogation program to the White House. Now, the director of central intelligence, George J. Tenet, knew that the inspector general's report could be a noose for White House officials to hang the C.I.A. Mr. Tenet ordered a temporary halt to the harshest interrogation methods.
 The report landed on the desks of some White House officials who were already having their doubts about the wisdom of the C.I.A.'s harsh methods. John B. Bellinger III, who, as the National Security Council's top lawyer, played a role in discussions when the program was approved in 2002, by the next year had begun to research past ill-fated British and Israeli use of torture and grew doubtful about the wisdom of the techniques. 
 Mr. Bellinger shared his doubts with his boss, Ms. Rice, then the national security adviser, who began to reconsider her strong support for the program.
 If the inspector general's report was a body blow to the C.I.A. program, the bill passed by Congress the next year was a knockout punch. Provoked by the abuse scandal at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq and pushed by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who had been tortured by the North Vietnamese, the 2005 bill banned cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. 
 Top C.I.A. officials then feared that the agency's methods could actually be illegal. Mr. Goss, who had succeeded Mr. Tenet at the C.I.A., wrote a memorandum to the White House saying the agency would carry out no harsh interrogations without new Justice Department approval. 
 The national security advisor, Mr. Hadley, was angered by the C.I.A.'s response. He called Mr. Goss at home over the Christmas holidays to complain; Mr. Goss, backed by his lawyers, would not budge. Mr. Hadley decided he could not push the C.I.A. to do what it thought might be illegal.
 Nobody knew it then, but the C.I.A.'s fateful experiment in harsh interrogation was over. The ''enhanced'' interrogation, already scaled back, would not be used again. 
 But Bush administration officials could not agree about what to do with the agency's prisoners. Already, disclosures of secret prisons in Eastern Europe had prompted the C.I.A. to fly many in a hurry to Afghanistan. 
 Mr. Cheney led those who argued that publicly acknowledging the detainees would reveal secrets and expose the program to exaggerated accusations of torture. 
 Ms. Rice, on the other hand, advocated moving the 14 remaining detainees in C.I.A. custody to the military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Only by publicly admitting that the United States had held the prisoners could Mr. Bush end what critics called the ''disappearing'' of terrorism suspects, she told colleagues. 
 Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales proposed a middle ground: move the detainees to Guantanamo but never acknowledge having held them in secret prisons. This proposal, lampooned by some officials as the ''immaculate conception'' option, was dismissed as unrealistic. 
 After a tense meeting in the White House's grand Roosevelt Room in summer 2006, Mr. Cheney lost the argument to Ms. Rice. Within days the C.I.A. prisoners were loaded onto a C-17 cargo plane and taken to Cuba. 
 Still, Mr. Cheney and top C.I.A. officials fought to revive the program. Steven G. Bradbury, the head of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel and author of the recently declassified 2005 memorandums authorizing harsh C.I.A interrogations, began drafting another memorandum in late 2006 to restore legal approval for harsh interrogation. Mr. Bradbury noted that Congress, despite the public controversy, had left it to the White House to set the limits.
 Early drafts of the memorandum, circulated through the White House, the C.I.A. and the State Department, shocked some officials. Just months after the Supreme Court had declared that the Geneva Convention applied to Al Qaeda, the new Bradbury memorandum gave its blessing to almost every technique, except waterboarding, that the C.I.A. had used since 2002. 
 Forced as secretary of state to defend the C.I.A. program before angry European allies, Ms. Rice and her aides argued that it had outlived its usefulness. 
 In February 2007, Mr. Bellinger wrote to the Justice Department challenging Mr. Bradbury's position. He called Mr. Bradbury's memorandum a ''work of advocacy'' that gave a twisted interpretation of the Geneva Conventions and told colleagues he might resign. 
 When Mr. Bush finally reauthorized C.I.A. interrogations with an executive order in July 2007, it reflected the yearlong lobbying of Mr. Bellinger and Ms. Rice: forced nudity was banned, and guidelines for sleep deprivation were tighter.
 But Mr. Cheney and his allies secured other victories. The executive order preserved the secret jails and authorized a laundry list of coercive methods. Ms. Rice, several officials say, declined to endorse the order but chose not to block it. 
 When Mr. Obama was sworn in on Jan. 20, the C.I.A. still maintained a network of empty jails overseas, where interrogators were still authorized to use physical pressure. Within 48 hours, he banned the methods. 
 Finally, last month, the program that had been the source of so many vigorous fights in Washington's power corridors met a prosaic end. 
 Leon E. Panetta, the new C.I.A. chief, terminated the agency's contracts providing the security and maintenance for the prisons, emphasizing the economic benefits. Closing the C.I.A. prisons, Mr. Panetta said, would save taxpayers $4 million.

HEADLINE: Paterson's Order Will Help Unions Trying to Organize

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
Gov. David A. Paterson has issued an order making it easier for labor unions to organize thousands of workers at some of New York's largest new hotel and convention center projects, including hotels in Niagara Falls and at the Belmont Park racetrack in Nassau County and the expansion of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan.
 The directive, which was signed on April 24 and issued on Friday, will require the operators of projects that receive assistance like loans, tax breaks or property leases from state agencies or public authorities to obtain ''labor peace'' agreements with unions seeking to organize their workers. 
 Under the agreements, workers would pledge not to strike, boycott or engage in other actions that would disrupt business or deprive the state of revenues. 
 The directive will give unions unprecedented leverage to demand right-to-organize provisions -- including ''card-check'' rights that allow a union to be recognized as soon as a majority of workers sign authorization cards -- for the roughly 2,000 workers expected to be hired at various facilities around the state once they are completed.
 Administration officials said the order would benefit taxpayers by preventing interruptions to the revenue from projects built with state assistance.
 ''Labor peace agreements have proven an effective means of ensuring that the state's interest in successful project development is not undermined by labor strife,'' said Peter E. Kauffmann, a spokesman for Mr. Paterson. ''When taxpayers provide assistance to a project, we must do all that we can to protect their interests, particularly in these troubled fiscal times. This directive will provide transparency to some of the largest economic development projects the state undertakes and assures New Yorkers that those projects will be managed in the most efficient and cost-effective way possible.'' 
 Labor experts said that it was the first time a governor had issued such a directive, and that it could portend a broader shift in strategy by labor unions if initiatives at the national level like federal card-check legislation falter in Washington.
 ''It is the scaling up to the statewide level of a strategy that has been mostly used at the local level or on a project-by-project basis,'' said Paul K. Sonn, a legal director at the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy organization. ''I think it is something we will be seeing more of.''
 The new rule signifies a major victory for Unite HERE, the hotel and restaurant workers union, which has been pressing Mr. Paterson and his predecessor, Eliot Spitzer, to issue the directive for more than a year. The move also gives Mr. Paterson, who is struggling to shore up his political base and improve his poll numbers, a chit with unions that have been close to Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo, his most likely rival in a Democratic primary.
 ''What the governor is basically saying with this order is if the state has a proprietary interest in a hospitality project, we need to take steps, just like any responsible private investor would, to forestall the possibility of any future disruption to revenues to the state associated with those projects,'' said Neal Kwatra, the director of political and strategic affairs for the New York Hotel and Motel Trades Council, which represents about 30,000 hotel workers, primarily in the city.
 The projects covered under the directive include a planned conversion of the Harriman State Office Building Campus in Albany into a technology and research center; the development of the Hudson Yards on the West Side, which would include hotel space; and the Niagara Falls Heritage Park, where a hotel and a performance center are planned. 
 State agencies and authorities could exempt projects from the requirement if they could show that it would substantially increase the cost to the state or prevent the project from moving forward.
 Business advocates said the directive could drive up labor costs and deter projects. 
 ''My concern would be that new restrictions like this are likely to discourage private-sector developers from working on state projects,'' said Kenneth Adams, president of the Business Council of New York State. ''Right now, nothing is getting built in this economy. So why are we adding new costs to these projects?''

HEADLINE: An Upstart Gossip Site With a Gentler Tone Is Making a Big Splash

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
The Web got something in February nobody knew it needed: another celebrity gossip site. Ho-hum and back to TMZ, E! Online, UsMagazine.com and the crowd of other star-watching sites, right? 
 Wrong. Wonderwall.com -- created and operated for MSN by two Hollywood powerhouses, Gail Berman and Lloyd Braun -- is a surprise hit. 
 The breezy site, which scrolls horizontally to emulate the feeling of flipping through a tabloid in the checkout lane, logged 6.4 million unique visitors during March, making it the fourth-ranked celebrity site, according to comScore. 
 Visitors spent an average of almost five minutes on each trip to the site during its first weeks in operation, looking at an average of 12.1 pages, ''engagement'' figures that far surpass those claimed by more entrenched sites like People.com. 
 ''The numbers are so good that I frankly thought there was something wrong with the data,'' said Scott Moore, the domestic chief of content and programming strategy for MSN, the Web portal owned by Microsoft. 
 The sizzling reception Wonderwall has received -- advertisers include CoverGirl, Disney's bridal business, Frito-Lay and Dove -- shows how fast a mature corner of online media can change. Because celebrity sites compete with essentially the same photos and news nuggets, packaging makes all the difference. The hotly competitive sector has also trained fickle consumers to hop to the of-the-moment site, analysts say. Perez Hilton? So yesterday.
 Indeed, Wonderwall signals that the pendulum may be swinging away from the kind of disparaging coverage doled out by Perez Hilton (actually a blogger named Mario Lavandeira). The site is sharper in design than in tongue: Ms. Berman and Mr. Braun saw an opening for celebrity coverage that fell between mean-spirited (TMZ) and matronly (People). 
 ''We didn't want to be nasty, and we didn't want to be your grandmother's take on celebrity,'' Mr. Braun said. OMG!, a site distributed by Yahoo with content from ''Access Hollywood,'' has also been working this middle ground, and it is the No. 1 celebrity site, according to comScore.
 Hollywood publicists say they like Wonderwall's tone and design, which is heavy on pretty pictures and appears to sparkle as the cursor moves across various story boxes. Some agents are already funneling the site exclusive photos to help it make inroads. Alex Blagg, the creator of the VH1 Best Week Ever blog, is Wonderwall's lead editor.
 ''We're not looking for gossip sites to be friendly, just fair,'' said Kelly Bush, the chief executive of ID, the public relations firm that has Jake Gyllenhaal and Amy Adams as clients. ''If Wonderwall is open to fact-checking and sourcing information, it is a very welcome endeavor.''
 Wonderwall has a lot to prove, but its early success has given Ms. Berman and Mr. Braun confidence to return to the spotlight -- a bit. The pair created a media company, BermanBraun, after stormy exits from Paramount Pictures (for her) and Yahoo's media group (for him). Since then, they have avoided the spotlight, routinely declining interview requests.
 Hollywood has been curious about what Ms. Berman and Mr. Braun have been busy doing, in part because of their track record. Before she worked at Paramount -- where she came up with the idea of doing the ''Star Trek'' prequel now arriving in theaters -- Ms. Berman ran Fox Broadcasting, putting ''American Idol'' and ''24'' on the schedule.
 Mr. Braun was previously chairman of the ABC Entertainment Group, where he had the initial idea for what became ''Lost.'' He was also a successful entertainment lawyer and manager, helping nurture ''The Sopranos'' for his client David Chase. Another client, Larry David, named a character -- a bombastic lawyer -- after him on ''Seinfeld.''
 Despite their resumes, they have sharply different personalities. He conducts a meeting slouched in a chair with his feet up on the coffee table. She sits demurely in a straight-back chair and takes thoughtful sips from a bottle of water. Where Mr. Braun can be dramatic, Ms. Berman has a quiet intensity.
 ''I had a little bit of a heart attack,'' Mr. Braun said, speaking of Wonderwall's horizontal design, something created by Paco Vinoly, the company's Web designer.
 ''I loved it immediately,'' Ms. Berman said.
 What they share is a belief that the current Hollywood landscape offers an opportunity for savvy independent operators. Studios and networks are retreating to their core businesses, shutting genre units and trimming fledgling mobile and Web efforts.
 BermanBraun, which also has four television pilots under consideration by CBS and NBC, at first approached the Internet like other traditional media entrepreneurs in Hollywood: devising Web versions of television shows. The two quickly realized that it was difficult to make such efforts versatile, scalable and profitable.
 So they started thinking about the Web as an opportunity to create entertainment brands and then align with a partner for distribution. Mr. Braun and his team pitched Wonderwall to MSN, which had a scattered approach to celebrity news, and MSN pounced. (Mr. Moore joined MSN almost a year later, but was a welcome ally: He was Mr. Braun's first hire at Yahoo.)
 Wonderwall has become one of MSN's more prominent offerings to advertisers, in part because the bar is low. MSN has been trying harder but its advertising revenue is still dwarfed by rivals like Yahoo. Still, analysts are impressed. 
 ''To successfully introduce a new advertising-based product in this economy is quite phenomenal,'' said David Hallerman, an analyst at eMarketer.
 The site still has some bugs -- pages occasionally seem to load very slowly or not at all -- but it is still in its testing phase. Geraldine Martin-Coppola, who heads BermanBraun's Internet division, says her team is trying more buttons and is making tweaks so users feel more comfortable with the horizontal scrolling.
 The company has three more Web projects in the works, although it's keeping them under wraps for now. ''The Web is undergoing the same shift television did early in its history,'' Ms. Berman said. ''It was founded by engineers and then programmers came in. We're the programmers.''

HEADLINE: Israel Faces Difficult Task in Shifting Policy Away From Palestinians and Toward Iran

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER

DATELINE: JERUSALEM 

 BODY:
The new government of Israel is seeking to reorient the country's foreign policy, arguing that to rely purely on the formulas of trading land for peace and promising a Palestinian state fails to grasp what it views as the deeper issues: Muslim rejection of a Jewish state and the rising hegemonic appetite of Iran.
 Advisers to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are drafting policy suggestions aimed at forming a framework that he plans to present to President Obama at their first summit meeting, in Washington on May 18. In addition, Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman left Sunday for Europe on his first official visit, and on Tuesday, President Shimon Peres is to meet with Mr. Obama in Washington. 
 Such an ambitious effort to reformulate the conflict will be, by all accounts, tough to sell for two reasons. 
 First, even though the standard approaches have not yielded success, no alternative has emerged. 
 Second, the Obama administration has repeatedly backed the two-state solution, as have the Europeans. In other ways, too, this White House has seemed to be closer in outlook to Europe than the past administration was. 
 Israel's effort to switch the discussion to Iran is likely to be met in Washington and in European capitals with the assertion that it is precisely because of the need to build an alliance to confront Iran that Israel must move ahead vigorously with the Palestinians as well as with the Syrians.
 ''President Obama views the region as a whole, and trying to isolate each problem does not reflect reality,'' said a senior American official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the American policy was still in formation. ''It will be a lot easier to build a coalition to deal with Iran if the peace process is moving forward.''
 A senior Israeli official, who also would speak only if not named because Israeli policy was being formed, said he believed that when Mr. Netanyahu met Mr. Obama, he would acknowledge that ultimately the goal was a Palestinian state. But it is expected that he would say that such a state was far in the future because Palestinian institutions and economic development required a great deal of work -- as well as investment from Arab states -- and that Palestinian education and public discourse needed to be more oriented toward coexistence.
 Mr. Lieberman is to begin his trip in Rome, seeing Foreign Minister Franco Frattini on Monday, and then travel to Paris, Prague and Berlin for similar meetings. He is one of the most controversial senior members of the Israeli government. As a candidate, he called for a loyalty oath aimed at Israeli Arabs. In addition, his public speech has been tough, sometimes brutal. And he himself lives in a West Bank settlement.
 Israel's own diplomats view his arrival as their chief with circumspection, especially because his predecessor, Tzipi Livni, was admired by her colleagues in Europe. Whenever she went to Paris, for example, she saw not only the foreign minister but also President Nicolas Sarkozy. So far, Mr. Sarkozy has not agreed to see Mr. Lieberman this week.
 ''I tell people who worry about Lieberman that I worry too,'' a senior Israeli diplomat said, requesting anonymity to speak freely of his boss. ''But after I stop worrying I tell myself, you have to be fair, you have to give this guy a chance to express himself as the foreign minister of Israel, not just as a candidate.'' 
 Yigal Palmor, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said that Mr. Lieberman had been scheduled to meet with all 27 European Union foreign ministers this month at a summit meeting, but that Mr. Lieberman had asked for a delay so the government could come up with its policy guidelines. The European Union agreed. 
 It seems likely that the plan that Mr. Netanyahu will present to Mr. Obama will have a strong regional component in an attempt to fend off pressure on Israel to accept the Arab League peace plan, which calls on Israel to return to the 1967 borders as well as to accept a right of return for Palestinian refugees to Israel. The new Israeli government completely rejects both.
 Mr. Lieberman is one of the strongest advocates for rethinking Israel's approach and rejecting what he views as failed past formulas. He wants tough sanctions against Iran as the first step. He told The Jerusalem Post in an interview published last week that the aim of the policy review was to make progress on Palestinian economic and political developments and ''to take the initiative'' in the region.
 ''People try to simplify the situation with these formulas: land for peace, two-state solution,'' Mr. Lieberman told the newspaper. ''It's a lot more complicated.'' He added that the real reason for the deadlock ''is not occupation, not settlements and not settlers.'' Nor, he said, is it the Palestinians. The biggest obstacle, he said, is ''the Iranians.'' 
 He, like the entire Israeli leadership, argues that since Iran sponsors Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, both of which reject Israel's existence and seek its destruction, the key to the Palestinian solution is to defang Iran and stop it from acquiring the means to build a nuclear weapon. 
 Increasingly, the Arab world -- especially Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan -- seems worried about Iran as well. American officials who have recently visited those countries said that their leaders spoke about Iran in ways that were almost identical to what they heard from officials in Jerusalem. Therefore, the opportunity for a regional alliance against Iranian influence is great. 
 But, they say, for Arab leaders to work alongside Israel on this, even quietly, requires demonstrable Israeli movement on ending its occupation of the West Bank by freezing or reducing settlements and handing over more power to the Palestinians. 
 Israel dislikes that formulation, arguing that the two issues need to be addressed separately. If they are linked, it is in the opposite way from what the West says. In other words, Israel says the occupation can be ended most easily once Iran is put in its place because then there will be much less risk of Iranian weapons being used against Israel from neighboring territory. Meanwhile, Israel says it cannot be expected to freeze settlement growth entirely. 
 The American, European and Arab response is that for Iran to be checked, every nation needs to do its part, and Israel's part is to work toward ending the occupation, stopping settlement construction and fostering the creation of a Palestinian state.
 When a senior American official was told that the Israelis did not view the Iranian and Palestinian problems as linked, he replied simply, ''Well, we do.''

HEADLINE: Link to Economic Crisis Is Vital to Obama Agenda

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, encapsulated President Obama's goal long before the first of the First 100 Days: ''Never let a serious crisis go to waste.''
 That post-election formulation remains the fulcrum for the legislative battle only now starting in earnest. Over the Next 100 Days, the outcome may turn on how convincingly the White House preserves the link between Mr. Obama's agenda and the painful recession he inherited.
 Team Obama casts his initiatives on health care, energy, education and the auto and financial industries as responses to that crisis. His Republican adversaries call the recession merely an excuse for big-government ambitions that liberals have failed to achieve for decades. 
 Mr. Obama currently holds the upper hand, riding high in the polls while Republicans appear chaotic and hapless. But he is racing to capitalize for good reason. Political history, and some early signs this spring, suggest that time is not on his side.
 Weak Economy's Lift
 As Mr. Obama entered the White House in January, the yearlong trickle of job losses had became a flood. The economy, government statistics later revealed, contracted by more than 6 percent in the final quarter of 2008.
 Mr. Obama exploited the nation's alarm in seeking rapid action on his $800 billion economic stimulus plan. Conservatives, pointing to Mr. Emanuel's remarks, accused the administration of pursuing what Wall Street Journal editorialists called a ''40-year wish list'' for liberals.
 That Mr. Obama quickly overcame Republican opposition provided the strongest evidence so far that the president and Congressional Democrats could seize their opportunity.
 ''Look at the results,'' Mr. Emanuel said in an interview last week. ''We've passed the largest economic recovery act in American history.''
 That paid dividends in public opinion. The latest New York Times/CBS News poll showed that 68 percent of Americans approved of his job performance; 70 percent said Republicans had opposed his economic plans ''mostly for political reasons.'' The proportion who said they believed the nation was headed in the right direction rose to 41 percent, from 15 percent just before he took office.
 Paradoxically, however, that success may complicate Mr. Obama's task going forward by easing the sense of crisis. And that, in turn, could help Republicans argue that he seeks an excessively costly expansion of government's role.
 An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll in February showed that 51 percent of Americans wanted government to do more to solve problems, compared with 40 percent who said government was ''doing too many things.'' Last week, the same survey showed an even split; a 52 percent majority said Mr. Obama had taken on ''too many other issues'' besides the economy.
 That helps explain why Mr. Obama found himself on the defensive at his prime-time news conference over government investments in banks and auto companies. ''I want to disabuse people of this notion that somehow we enjoy meddling in the private sector,'' he said. 
 Or, as Mr. Emanuel put it: ''The moment requires'' government involvement, but only to help troubled companies ''make this transition to a different place.''
 Risks for Democrats
 Some Democrats privately complain that Mr. Emanuel's ''crisis'' statement handed Republicans a cudgel for battering their motives. He voices no regrets, saying it is plain that national crises create opportunities for action that do not normally exist.
 ''It's not a political tactic,'' Mr. Emanuel said. ''It's an observation of human nature and history.'' He likened the health care and energy investments that Mr. Obama seeks to the creation of the transcontinental railroad during the Civil War and the G.I. Bill during World War II.
 In a jab at former President George W. Bush, he added: ''It's not like we are using this crisis to invade Iraq. You can ask the right-wing blogs about that.''
 Yet the Senate's defeat last week of a measure that Mr. Obama had endorsed, to let judges trim mortgages of homeowners in bankruptcy court, underscored the limits of Democrats' ability to act even after Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania augmented their majority by switching from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party. Just as the banking industry helped thwart Mr. Obama's allies on that issue, affected interests may bolster Republican challenges to the administration's health care and energy goals.
 Mr. Obama wants action in 2009 on both fronts, aware that predecessors like Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton saw their political capital decline markedly after their first years in office. His top aide, who also served in Mr. Clinton's White House, insists that an agile Democratic majority can still deliver.
 ''Don't make perfect the enemy of the essential,'' Mr. Emanuel counseled, arguing for compromise. In a remark doubling as self-description, he praised the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, as a ''pragmatic, put-points-on-the-board, get-wins'' legislator.
 Even if Americans had begun feeling better, Mr. Emanuel insisted that the crisis atmosphere remained strong enough to keep political winds at Mr. Obama's back.
 ''I still believe people know this is very fragile,'' he said. ''They believe this is a moment for big things, because we have big problems.''

PERSON: Jack Kemp 

HEADLINE: Jack Kemp, Football Star Who Became Champion of Tax Cuts, Dies at 73

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

 BODY:
Jack Kemp, the former football star turned congressman who with an evangelist's fervor moved the Republican Party to a commitment to tax cuts as the central focus of economic policy, died Saturday evening at his home in Bethesda, Md. He was 73. 
 The cause was cancer, said his son Jimmy Kemp. Jack Kemp's Washington consulting and lobbying firm, Kemp Partners, announced in January that he had cancer but did not disclose the type. 
 Mr. Kemp was secretary of housing and urban development under the first President George Bush and the Republican vice-presidential nominee in 1996. But his greatest legacy may stem from his years as a congressman from Buffalo, especially 1978, when his argument for sharp tax cuts to promote economic growth became party policy, one that has endured to this day. 
 Mr. Kemp, having embraced a supply-side economic theory, told the House that year that the nation suffered under a ''tax code that rewards consumption, leisure, debt and borrowing and punishes savings, investment, work and production.'' 
 Ronald Reagan adopted the issue as a central one in his 1980 presidential campaign, and in 1981 he won passage of a 23 percent cut over three years. The legislation was known as Kemp-Roth, named for Mr. Kemp and William V. Roth Jr., a Delaware Republican and his Senate co-sponsor. 
 Mr. Kemp's other great cause, in his 18 years in the House and for two decades thereafter, was to have his party to seek more support from blacks and other minorities. 
 ''The party of Lincoln,'' he wrote after the 2008 election, ''needs to rethink and revisit its historic roots as a party of emancipation, liberation, civil rights and equality of opportunity for all.''
 Mr. Kemp won his House seat in 1970 because of his celebrity as an all-star quarterback for the Buffalo Bills, twice champions of the American Football League. He connected his concern for minorities with his respect for his black teammates, especially the linemen who had protected him from pass rushers. 
 Vin Weber, a former congressman from Minnesota and a close friend, said Mr. Kemp would often say, ''I can't help but care about the rights of the people I used to shower with.''
 Mr. Kemp was an unlikely leader for a political cause based on a theory of economics. He majored in physical education while playing football at Occidental College in Los Angeles. When he entered politics, many Washington veterans dismissed him as a ''dumb jock'' and as a junior House member in 1977, he did not even serve on the tax-writing Committee on Ways and Means. 
 But though Mr. Kemp had not studied a lot at Occidental, he had been making up for it for years. On long team flights, his reading habits -- Ayn Rand and William F. Buckley Jr., among others -- stood out. The wide receiver Elbert Dubenion recalled this year, ''He was reading these political books, and we were reading the Katzenjammer Kids.'' 
 Mr. Kemp first heard about supply-side theory, as advanced by Arthur B. Laffer, a University of Southern California economist, in 1976. Soon he immersed himself in the case for tax cuts, reading deeply from the works of the Laffer camp as well as its critics. When he debated the subject on the House floor, he cited studies on the money supply, the experience of Britain and Sweden, and the impact of past tax cuts in the United States. 
 He persuaded his House colleagues to bring the idea to a vote in 1977 and three times more, in 1978. Each time they sought to reduce taxes across the board, starting with the 70 percent marginal rate, which was then imposed on the highest incomes. They lost each time -- once by only five votes -- but they had an election issue.
 Mr. Kemp had also convinced Bill Brock, chairman of the Republican National Committee, that the issue was political gold. ''He said, in effect, we need to restore the essence of our party, which is growth, which is jobs, which is creativity,'' Mr. Brock said in an interview this year. ''And the way to do that is to free people of the burden of excessive taxes.'' 
 Mr. Brock said the issue was central to the Republicans' gaining 15 seats in the House of Representatives and 3 in the Senate in the fall of 1978.
 While some allies wanted him to seek the Republican nomination himself in 1980, Mr. Kemp supported Reagan. In 1979 he organized a seminar in Los Angeles to explain the intricacies of the policy to Reagan and his campaign advisers. Reagan, who thought his own taxes as a movie actor had been too high, seized on the idea as one that would appeal to blue-collar voters.
 After his election, Reagan called for a three-year, 27 percent tax reduction, straight out of the Kemp-Roth bill, which had been introduced earlier. The three-year, 23 percent reduction that the president ultimately agreed to was supported by Mr. Kemp. Although its formal name was the Economic Recovery Tax Act, it became known as the Kemp-Roth tax cut.
 ''Jack Kemp is the indispensable political leader of the modern conservative economic revival,'' Edwin J. Feulner, president of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research institution in Washington, said recently, adding, ''Jack's role in developing and exploring the potential of supply-side economics in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for Reagan's economic program.'' 
 Norman J. Ornstein, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said of Mr. Kemp: ''I think there is no doubt that he had a greater impact on conservative and Republican economic philosophy than anybody else. More than Laffer, more than Reagan.'' And the change he helped bring about was not just in the party's attitude toward taxes, Mr. Ornstein said; Republicans, he said, were ''no longer worshiping at the shrine of a balanced budget, for better and for worse.'' 
 John French Kemp Jr. was born in Los Angeles on July 13, 1935. He had wanted to be a professional football player from the age of 6 but recognized that he did not have the bulk to be recruited by a major college team. Still, he wanted to join a football program that used a professional system, so he chose Occidental, where he started at quarterback. 
 It was also at Occidental that he met Joanne Main, who became his wife of 50 years. She survives him, as do two sons, who also played professional football, Jeff Kemp of Redmond, Wash., and Jimmy Kemp of Washington; two daughters, Jennifer Kemp Andrews of Middleburg, Va., and Judith Kemp of Potomac, Md.; and 17 grandchildren.
 The Detroit Lions drafted Mr. Kemp in 1957 (as the 203rd pick), but he did not make the team. He played briefly with the Pittsburgh Steelers and was cut by the New York Giants and the Calgary Stampeders, of the Canadian Football League. Finally, with the founding of the American Football League in 1960, he was chosen by the Los Angeles Chargers. 
 He went on to star as quarterback for the Chargers and was named to the all-A.F.L. team. In 1962, Mr. Kemp injured his passing hand, and the Chargers put him on waivers to open up his roster spot -- temporarily, they hoped. But the Buffalo Bills claimed him for $100.
 After his hand healed, his first game in Buffalo was against that year's league champions, the Dallas Texans. Mr. Kemp completed 21 of 35 passes for 230 yards and two touchdowns as the Bills upset the Texans, 23-14. 
 ''The fans stormed the field after the game and carried Kemp off on their shoulders,'' Larry Felser, a sportswriter at the time for The Buffalo Courier-Express, recalled earlier this year. ''It was a scene from a bad movie, but it happened.''
 Mr. Kemp led the Bills to league championships over the Chargers in 1964 and 1965, when he was chosen as the league's most valuable player.
 Billy Shaw, a Bills teammate and a member of the Hall of Fame, said in a recent interview: ''Jack Kemp is probably the most intelligent football player I ever played with. Jack had what I consider better than average ability or skills as a player, but because of his ability to use his head and to make good decisions on the field, his results were probably better than the talent that he had.'' 
 Mr. Kemp was a founder and president of the A.F.L. Players Association. In January 1965, he supported a boycott of an all-star game in New Orleans by the league's black players after they had been barred from nightclubs and cabs in the city. Mr. Kemp helped have the game moved to Houston, where the black players participated. 
 His last season as a professional player, in 1969, was a losing one in Buffalo, but he was named an all-star for the seventh time. It was also the league's last season before merging with the National Football League. Among A.F.L. quarterbacks, Mr. Kemp ranked first in number of passes (3,055), completions (1,428) and passing yardage (21,130).
 His transition to politics was smooth. As a popular football player he had campaigned in New York for Nelson A. Rockefeller and in California for Reagan in their gubernatorial races and for Richard M. Nixon and Barry Goldwater in their presidential bids. And he was a name in Buffalo. With a House seat open in the 1970 election, local Republicans persuaded Mr. Kemp to campaign for it. He won with just 51.6 percent of the vote, but in seven of his next eight races he cruised to victory with at least 70 percent of the vote.
 After helping the Reagan campaign in 1980, Mr. Kemp was elected chairman of the House Republican Conference, the third-ranking leadership post. In that role he sometimes clashed with Reagan, who was quicker to compromise on taxes than Mr. Kemp. ''Jack Kemp now knows I'm teed off with him,'' Reagan wrote in his diary in 1982. 
 But the president hailed Mr. Kemp on his retirement from the House in 1988, writing in a letter, ''We showed this town that -- if you want to make the government move -- let a guy from Hollywood and a football quarterback call the plays.''
 Mr. Kemp had hoped to succeed Reagan, running earlier that year for the Republican nomination and offering himself as the conservatives' alternative to Vice President George Bush and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader. But Pat Robertson, the religious broadcaster, took so much of the party's conservative base, finishing second to Mr. Dole in Iowa, that Mr. Kemp's hopes deflated. 
 Mr. Kemp dropped out of the race in March 1988 and endorsed Mr. Bush, clearly hoping for the vice-presidential nomination. That went instead to Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana. But after his victory in the fall elections, Mr. Bush did choose Mr. Kemp to take over the Department of Housing and Urban Development in 1989.
 His biggest task was cleaning up the corruption and favoritism that had marked the housing department during the Reagan administration. Again he was a bundle of energy. He met black leaders, visited homeless shelters and presided over the destruction of failed housing projects like Cabrini-Green in Chicago. He also offered proposals like tax preferences for inner-city ''enterprise zones'' and urged that public housing tenants be enabled to buy their homes. Most of these ideas went nowhere. One successful measure was the Affordable Housing Act, a block grant program that has spent about $1.5 billion a year since 1992.
 Mr. Kemp's final turn on the national stage came as Mr. Dole's vice-presidential candidate in 1996. It was a surprising choice. The two men differed on economic policy: Mr. Dole advocated balanced budgets, and Mr. Kemp wanted tax cuts and did not worry about deficits. They also disliked each other. In one exchange, in 1985, Mr. Dole said, ''Kemp wants a business deduction for hair spray.'' Mr. Kemp retorted: ''In a recent fire, Bob Dole's library burned down. Both books were lost. And he hadn't even finished coloring one of them.''
 But the choice of Mr. Kemp balanced the ticket. It pleased conservatives, who were skeptical about Mr. Dole, and it added Mr. Kemp's East Coast and California ties to Mr. Dole's Midwestern support. Mr. Kemp was 12 years younger than Mr. Dole, who was 73. 
 In the fall campaign, Mr. Kemp made a point of going to minority neighborhoods that rarely saw Republicans. But those efforts seemed to make little difference as President Bill Clinton won re-election comfortably. The Dole-Kemp ticket won 12 percent of the black vote, compared with 10 percent for the Bush-Quayle ticket in 1992.
 After 1996, Mr. Kemp became involved with charitable and political associations and headed Kemp Partners, a lobbying and consulting firm in Washington. He never again ran for office, ending a political career that in many ways reflected an answer he had given in 1970, when asked how his football experience qualified him for Congress. 
 ''Pro football,'' he replied, ''gave me a good sense of perspective to enter politics: I'd already been booed, cheered, cut, sold, traded and hung in effigy.''

NEW YORK ON LESS:
 Are Leaner Times
 Affecting Dating?
 Remember Madonna's ''Material Girl'' video? Channeling Marilyn Monroe, a begowned pre-Madge Madge is plied with diamonds by a beefcake troupe of tuxedoed dancers and ends up getting wooed by a man (played by Keith Carradine) proffering daisies and a lift in a dusty pickup truck. 
 Madonna, in her own way, could have been offering tips about how to date in a recession: Keep it simple. Don't break the bank to impress. And whatever you do, don't give the girl diamonds -- at least not on the first date.
 Recent anecdotal evidence suggests that people are not dating less because of the recession; instead, online dating sites are reporting double-digit growth in use. People's defenses tend to dip. They don't want to worry about money alone. They have a heightened desire to connect.
 But how to date in a downturn, especially in a city where cocktails can run upward of $18 and late-night cabs may be among the indulgences you're trying to cut? 
 Plenty of people believe in going dutch on dates anyway, and there are certainly ample suggestions out there on how to date for less. Still, New York is not cheap, walks in the park notwithstanding.
 So, to all the single ladies -- and guys, too -- do dish: How has the recession affected your dating life -- and your dates? 
 Post your thoughts on the blog.

 Re ''Shortage of Doctors Proves Obstacle to Obama Goals'' (front page, April 27), about a lack of primary care providers :
 As those of us responsible for delivering health care know, the battle between specialists and primary care doctors has been going on for years, and one side has been winning. 
 The marketplace has rewarded specialists financially, and like any other special interests, they are amply financed for this conflict. Still, I don't fault them. They have studied and worked hard, and are responding to market incentives, like good red-blooded Americans. 
 What we really need is a European-style single-payer system, with primary care doctors who emerge from their training with European-style debt loads: zero.

 As we strive to improve our health care system, we must remember that no one knows what will work. This is not Britain, Spain or France, and the Bronx is not Pocatello. A failed national experiment could be an expensive disaster. We must try different experiments in the laboratories of the states.

 Obama administration officials are right to be concerned about shortages of primary care doctors. We have known about this problem for 30 years -- and could learn a lesson from Britain on how to fix it.
 In the United States, primary care doctors are paid, on average, about 40 percent less than specialists. Doctors know this; medical students know this. In a national survey last fall of medical students, only 2 percent said they were considering a general internal medicine practice.
 Britain faced a similar shortage of primary care providers, along with a need to boost productivity and preventive care. Starting in 2004, general practitioners who hit their marks on improved services enjoyed substantial increases in pay. In the first year alone, these doctors saw their earning rise 10 percent, on average, and British patients saw a welcome increase in primary care services.
 Sounds like a plan to me.

 To the Editor: 
 Attracting and retaining doctors and other providers in primary care is not a problem that can be solved by simply spending more money on fees and adding more students in medical schools.
 As a primary care doctor for 32 years, I can unequivocally state that doctors and nurses are driven out of the field because of the dual and often conflicting role we now play. 
 In addition to trying to provide the highest possible standard of care while being second-guessed by insurers, we are asked to assume the sole responsibility for controlling the cost of health care in a system in which we have little power and no reward for the effort. 
 Medical subspecialists and surgical specialists have little interest in accepting responsibility for this work, and who can blame them? 
 In truth, primary care has become two jobs, which is why the salary doesn't adequately compensate for the work required.

 The writer is medical director of Brigham and Women's Primary Care of Brookline and an assistant clinical professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.
 To the Editor:
 Another possible solution to the shortage of primary care doctors is to relieve medical students of the large debts they accumulate during their education. These costs dissuade students from entering primary care because of the expected lower income. 
 There are a number of ways to accomplish this. For example, we could forgive the loans of graduates who enter primary care and agree to work in a rural or underserved area. I believe that freedom from debt would allow many more students to choose primary care.
 Walter Gamble Brookline, Mass., April 28, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Thirty-six years ago, as one of the first members of the National Health Service Corps, I was sent to western New Mexico, where there was a shortage of doctors. 
 Although delivering primary care to this medically needy population was probably the most meaningful period in my medical career, there were difficulties, including the lack of accessible specialty care. Seriously ill patients were transported 160 miles to the nearest tertiary medical center. I realized that most of my primary care services could have been delivered by a nurse practitioner.
 Many of the medically underserved areas are geographically remote and lack educational and cultural opportunities that would encourage doctors' families to set roots. Instead of sending doctors from afar, the government should train local nurses to become midlevel practitioners. By using a sophisticated electronic medical record, these practitioners could develop enhanced relationships with specialists in larger medical centers.

 To the Editor:
 Medical students in good standing should have the option of becoming ''government doctors.'' We should give them a very generous salary, befitting their learned and difficult profession, further adjusted for those willing to work in underserved areas or in specialties for which the need is greatest. 
 They would receive medical and malpractice insurance and retirement benefits, as well as an office allowance for rent, staff and supplies, and would serve anyone who walked in. Perhaps this could be financed by a national lottery.

HEADLINE: Despite Obama's Talk, Little Bump for Chrysler Sales

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY; Reporting was contributed by Rebecca Cathcart in Glendale, Calif.; Michael Parrish in Bridgeton, Mo.; Staci Semrad in San Antonio and Austin, Tex.; Mindy Sink in Wheatridge, Colo.; and Malia Wollan in Oakland, Calif.

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
Car salesman was probably not among the jobs that President Obama expected to assume during his first few months in the White House.
 And a slow weekend at many Chrysler dealerships around the country after the company filed for bankruptcy protection suggests that few consumers were moved by the president's plea on Thursday to help Detroit's automakers by buying an American car.
 The president's sales pitch was cheered in Michigan and among Chrysler's 3,200 dealers. And the company said his speech did help sell 11,400 cars on Thursday -- although much of that could have been the inventory clearance that is typical for the last day of a month. 
 But to the extent there was much action in Chrysler showrooms Saturday and Sunday, it often seemed to be shoppers hoping the company's plight might prompt dealers to offer give-away prices even lower than deep discounts the company has already been dangling. But sales managers do not have much remaining wiggle room.
 ''They're ambulance chasers trying to take advantage'' said Doug Swaim, general manager of Star Chrysler-Jeep in Glendale, Calif. 
 ''We bite our tongues and say, can you be more realistic?'' Mr. Swaim said. ''A lot of people hear the word bankruptcy and think worst-case scenario. They think Circuit City. That's, of course, not the case here.'' 
 Many consumers remain nervous about paying tens of thousands of dollars to a bankrupt company.
 ''I was just curious about how desperate they really are,'' Jerry Hubbard, a professional truck driver who stopped by Medved Chrysler-Jeep in the Denver suburb of Wheatridge, said on his way to shop for antiques on Saturday morning.
 Chrysler now plans to essentially sell its assets to the Italian carmaker Fiat, and it is closing all of its North American plants for the next one to two months, but hopes to emerge from bankruptcy later this summer. 
 But it could be late next year before the first Fiats, retooled to meet American crash protection standards, reach Chrysler showrooms. And it is not expected to be until sometime in 2011 that the first Fiat-designed vehicles start rolling out of Chrysler's North American plants. 
 Until then, Chryslers dealers are essentially buying time.
 ''Through the restructuring process we will be business as usual with our dealers and our customers,'' Steven J. Landry, Chrysler's vice president of North American sales, said Friday. 
 Although Chrysler is not going out of business, about 1,000 of its dealers soon could, according to its restructuring plan. Chrysler has about 3,200 dealers -- nearly twice as many as Toyota, even though its market share is considerably less -- and the company wants to thin out that network to improve its profit potential in the future.
 General Motors also is cutting dealerships -- about 2,600 of them by the end of next year, according to that company's plan. That means buyers of either company's vehicles soon could find themselves having to drive further for service or parts.
 In the meantime, dealers are trying to survive while selling far fewer vehicles than in the past. Chrysler's sales fell 48 percent in April, and new-vehicle sales plunged across the industry in the final week of the month, as talk of G.M.'s troubles and Chrysler's bankruptcy prospects intensified. 
 Consequently, Vince Capatosta, the owner of All Star Dodge-Chrysler-Jeep in Bridgeton, Mo., was thrilled to make 17 sales Thursday, his best day so far this year. But traffic dwindled again on Friday and Saturday. Still, Mr. Capatosta said he believed customers will stick with him through Chrysler's bankruptcy. 
 ''Their relationship is with me and my staff, not with Chrysler, and they have faith in me, and I deliver,'' he said. ''These guys are all 20- to 25-year veterans. So consumers come in and see these familiar faces, it gives a customer a sense of relief.''
 There have been signs in recent weeks that American car shoppers do take Mr. Obama's messages to heart. In a speech on March 30, even though he was rejecting the restructuring plans submitted by G.M. and Chrysler at the time, the president said one G.M. brand, Buick, was ''the most reliable car in the world.'' Buick sales were 21 percent higher in April than March. 
 ''Our president is behind us 100 percent, and that's good for sales, service, the economy and the nation as a whole,'' said Wes Skidmore, the vehicle sales director at Mission Chrysler-Jeep-Dodge in San Antonio. 
 On Saturday, his dealership ran a newspaper ad with an American flag and the headline ''Buy American.''
 Such messages resonate with shoppers like Bryan Kohler, 29, who test-drove a Jeep in Glendale on Saturday. ''I didn't even think about looking at others, at foreign cars,'' Mr. Kohler said. ''I'm trying to be patriotic, I guess.''
 Mehdi Asghari, a Chrysler salesman at the Bay Bridge Auto Center in Oakland, Calif., who previously worked at G.M. and Ford dealerships, said he had highlighted the benefits of buying American-made vehicles for years.
 ''I always say to customers, 'Buy an American car and help the U.S. economy,' '' Mr. Asghari said. '''Plus, American cars have more cup holders. They have cup holders everywhere.' ''
 Still, the fact that foreign brands now account for more than half of auto sales in the United States indicates that a vehicle's origin has become less of a priority than styling and price.
 Fred Weaver, 57, browsing Saturday at South Point Dodge-Chrysler-Jeep in Austin, Tex., seemed to be balancing patriotism and his pocketbook. ''I prefer an American-made car,'' he said, ''if I can get a good deal on it.''

HEADLINE: A Battle To Preserve A Visionary's Bold Failure

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
In 1901, Nikola Tesla began work on a global system of giant towers meant to relay through the air not only news, stock reports and even pictures but also, unbeknown to investors such as J. Pierpont Morgan, free electricity for one and all.
It was the inventor's biggest project, and his most audacious.
The first tower rose on rural Long Island and, by 1903, stood more than 18 stories tall. One midsummer night, it emitted a dull rumble and proceeded to hurl bolts of electricity into the sky. The blinding flashes, The New York Sun reported, ''seemed to shoot off into the darkness on some mysterious errand.''
But the system failed for want of money, and at least partly for scientific viability. Tesla never finished his prototype tower and was forced to abandon its adjoining laboratory. 
Today, a fight is looming over the ghostly remains of that site, called Wardenclyffe -- what Tesla authorities call the only surviving workplace of the eccentric genius who dreamed countless big dreams while pioneering wireless communication and alternating current. The disagreement began recently after the property went up for sale in Shoreham, N.Y.
A science group on Long Island wants to turn the 16-acre site into a Tesla museum and education center, and hopes to get the land donated to that end. But the owner, the Agfa Corporation, says it must sell the property to raise money in hard economic times. The company's real estate broker says the land, listed at $1.6 million, can ''be delivered fully cleared and level,'' a statement that has thrown the preservationists into action.
The ruins of Wardenclyffe include the tower's foundation and the large brick laboratory, designed by Tesla's friend Stanford White, the celebrated architect.
''It's hugely important to protect this site,'' said Marc J. Seifer, author of ''Wizard,'' a Tesla biography. ''He's an icon. He stands for what humans are supposed to do -- honor nature while using high technology to harness its powers.''
Recently, New York State echoed that judgment. The commissioner of historic preservation wrote Dr. Seifer on behalf of Gov. David A. Paterson to back Wardenclyffe's preservation and listing in the National Register of Historic Places.
On Long Island, Tesla enthusiasts vow to obtain the land one way or another, saying that saving a symbol of Tesla's accomplishments would help restore the visionary to his rightful place as an architect of the modern age.
''A lot of his work was way ahead of his time,'' said Jane Alcorn, president of the Tesla Science Center, a private group in Shoreham that is seeking to acquire Wardenclyffe.
Dr. Ljubo Vujovic, president of the Tesla Memorial Society of New York, said destroying the old lab ''would be a terrible thing for the United States and the world. It's a piece of history.''
Tesla, who lived from 1856 to 1943, made bitter enemies who dismissed some of his claims as exaggerated, helping tarnish his reputation in his lifetime. He was part recluse, part showman. He issued publicity photos (actually double exposures) showing him reading quietly in his laboratory amid deadly flashes.
Today, his work tends to be poorly known among scientists, though some call him an intuitive genius far ahead of his peers. Socially, his popularity has soared, elevating him to cult status.
Books and Web sites abound. Wikipedia says the inventor obtained at least 700 patents. YouTube has several Tesla videos, including one of a break-in at Wardenclyffe. A rock band calls itself Tesla. An electric car company backed by Google's founders calls itself Tesla Motors.
Larry Page, Google's co-founder, sees the creator's life as a cautionary tale. ''It's a sad, sad story,'' Mr. Page told Fortune magazine last year. The inventor ''couldn't commercialize anything. He could barely fund his own research.''
Wardenclyffe epitomized that kind of visionary impracticality.
Tesla seized on the colossal project at the age of 44 while living in New York City. An impeccably dressed bon vivant of Serbian birth, he was widely celebrated for his inventions of motors and power distribution systems that used the form of electricity known as alternating current, which beat out direct current (and Thomas Edison) to electrify the world.
His patents made him a rich man, at least for a while. He lived at the Waldorf-Astoria and loved to hobnob with the famous at Delmonico's and the Players Club.
Around 1900, as Tesla planned what would become Wardenclyffe, inventors around the world were racing for what was considered the next big thing -- wireless communication. His own plan was to turn alternating current into electromagnetic waves that flashed from antennas to distant receivers. This is essentially what radio transmission is. The scale of his vision was gargantuan, however, eclipsing that of any rival.
Investors, given Tesla's electrical achievements, paid heed. The biggest was J. Pierpont Morgan, a top financier. He sank $150,000 (today more than $3 million) into Tesla's global wireless venture.
Work on the prototype tower began in mid-1901 on the North Shore of Long Island at a site Tesla named after a patron and the nearby cliffs. ''The proposed plant at Wardenclyffe,'' The New York Times reported, ''will be the first of a number that the electrician proposes to establish in this and other countries.''
The shock wave hit Dec. 12, 1901. That day, Marconi succeeded in sending radio signals across the Atlantic, crushing Tesla's hopes for pioneering glory.
Still, Wardenclyffe grew, with guards under strict orders to keep visitors away. The wooden tower rose 187 feet over a wide shaft that descended 120 feet to deeply anchor the antenna. Villagers told The Times that the ground beneath the tower was ''honeycombed with subterranean passages.''
The nearby laboratory of red brick, with arched windows and a tall chimney, held tools, generators, a machine shop, electrical transformers, glass-blowing equipment, a library and an office.
But Morgan was disenchanted. He refused Tesla's request for more money.
Desperate, the inventor pulled out what he considered his ace. The towers would transmit not only information around the globe, he wrote the financier in July 1903, but also electric power.
''I should not feel disposed,'' Morgan replied coolly, ''to make any further advances.''
Margaret Cheney, a Tesla biographer, observed that Tesla had seriously misjudged his wealthy patron, a man deeply committed to the profit motive. ''The prospect of beaming electricity to penniless Zulus or Pygmies,'' she wrote, must have left the financier less than enthusiastic.
It was then that Tesla, reeling financially and emotionally, fired up the tower for the first and last time. He eventually sold Wardenclyffe to satisfy $20,000 (today about $400,000) in bills at the Waldorf. In 1917, the new owners had the giant tower blown up and sold for scrap.
Today, Tesla's exact plan for the site remains a mystery even as scientists agree on the impracticality of his overall vision. The tower could have succeeded in broadcasting information, but not power.
''He was an absolute genius,'' Dennis Papadopoulos, a physicist at the University of Maryland, said in an interview. ''He conceived of things in 1900 that it took us 50 or 60 years to understand. But he did not appreciate dissipation. You can't start putting a lot of power'' into an antenna and expect the energy to travel long distances without great diminution.
Wardenclyffe passed through many hands, ending with Agfa, which is based in Ridgefield Park, N.J. The imaging giant used it from 1969 to 1992, and then shuttered the property. Silver and cadmium, a serious poison, had contaminated the site, and the company says it spent some $5 million on studies and remediation. The cleanup ended in September, and the site was put up for sale in late February.
Real estate agents said they had shown Wardenclyffe to four or five prospective buyers.
Last month, Agfa opened the heavily wooded site to a reporter. ''NO TRESPASSING,'' warned a faded sign at a front gate, which was topped with barbed wire.
Tesla's red brick building stood intact, an elegant wind vane atop its chimney. But Agfa had recently covered the big windows with plywood to deter vandals and intruders, who had stolen much of the building's wiring for its copper.
The building's dark interior was littered with beer cans and broken bottles. Flashlights revealed no trace of the original equipment, except for a surprise on the second floor. There in the darkness loomed four enormous tanks, each the size of a small car. Their sides were made of thick metal and their seams heavily riveted, like those of an old destroyer or battleship. The Agfa consultant leading the tour called them giant batteries.
''Look up there,'' said the consultant, Ralph Passantino, signaling with his flashlight. ''There's a hatch up there. It was used to get into the tanks to service them.''
Tesla authorities appear to know little of the big tanks, making them potential clues to the inventor's original plans.
After the tour, Christopher M. Santomassimo, Agfa's general counsel, explained his company's position: no donation of the site for a museum, and no action that would rule out the building's destruction.
''Agfa is in a difficult economic position given what's going on in the global marketplace,'' he said. ''It needs to maximize its potential recovery from the sale of that site.''
He added that the company would entertain ''any reasonable offer,'' including ones from groups interested in preserving Wardenclyffe because of its historical significance. ''We're simply not in a position,'' he emphasized, ''to donate the property outright.''
Ms. Alcorn of the Tesla Science Center, who has sought to stir interest in Wardenclyffe for more than a decade, seemed confident that a solution would be worked out. Suffolk County might buy the site, she said, or a campaign might raise the funds for its purchase, restoration and conversion into a science museum and education center. She said the local community was strongly backing the preservation idea.
''Once the sign went up, I started getting so many calls,'' she remarked. ''People said: 'They're not really going to sell it, are they? It's got to be a museum, right?' ''
Sitting at a reading table at the North Shore Public Library, where she works as a children's librarian, Ms. Alcorn gestured across a map of Wardenclyffe to show how the abandoned site might be transformed with not only a Tesla museum but also a playground, a cafeteria and a bookshop.
''That's critical,'' she said.
Ms. Alcorn said the investigation and restoration of the old site promised to solve one of the big mysteries: the extent and nature of the tunnels said to honeycomb the area around the tower.
''I'd love to see if they really existed,'' she said. ''The stories abound, but not the proof.''

HEADLINE: In Fighting Noisy Jets, Mayor Divides His Town

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
VALPARAISO, Fla. -- In his 45th year as mayor, John B. Arnold Jr. picked a fight with the biggest patron and largest landowner in this small town about 40 miles east of Pensacola. In February, he led Valparaiso to sue his former employer, the Defense Department, demanding a better fix for noise from F-35 fighter jets scheduled to start arriving next year at Eglin Air Force Base.
''The survivability of this town is at stake,'' said Mr. Arnold, 79, arguing that property values would collapse because of overflights. ''It's David vs. Goliath.''
Critics, however, say Mr. Arnold looks more like Judas. Fearing that even a slight delay in the arrival of the F-35s would destroy a regional economy already bruised by the recession, Mr. Arnold's own county, Okaloosa, has countersued to stop him. Residents are calling the mayor a dictator and hanging signs across the Gulf Coast with messages like ''We support Eglin F-35 -- The Sound of Freedom.'' 
The battle here is one of many taking place across the country as the Defense Department re-evaluates its priorities at a time of economic insecurity.
Military analysts say the recession has added a subtext of fear to the always contentious debate over spending, leading elected officials to beg that weapon systems be treated not just as matters of national security, but also as economic stimulus.
''You have two different economic issues,'' said Loren B. Thompson, a military analyst and adviser to military contractors, including Lockheed Martin, maker of the F-35. ''One is just the general weakness of the economy. But in addition, there is the overall decline of the manufacturing base, which makes many workers wonder if they will ever find a job again.''
In a sign of how sensitive these decisions have become, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates recently embarked on a weeklong political tour to rally support for his proposed budget, which, at $534 billion, is 4 percent larger than last year's but includes proposed cuts to the Army's Future Combat Systems, F-22 fighter jets and helicopters for the president.
The Obama administration has called on Congress to rise above parochial interests, but with the proposed cuts threatening thousands of jobs nationwide, lawmakers and local officials have vowed to fight the changes.
Valparaiso would seem to be an unlikely location for such concerns. It has been a supportive neighbor to Eglin, the country's largest Air Force installation at 724 square miles, since the Depression. Most of the town's 6,000 residents have ties to the base, and in the continuing battle over military spending, they have been winners.
In 2005, the Base Closure and Realignment Commission, or BRAC, assigned Eglin the Army's Seventh Special Forces Group and made it a training center for the F-35, a fighter jet designed to be the military's premier strike aircraft for decades. The Defense Department estimated in October that the changes would add about 3,500 jobs and 9,000 people to the area.
It would take an act of Congress to send the F-35s somewhere else. With the recession pushing businesses here to the edge, this is what the mayor's critics say they fear.
''It's an emergency situation,'' said Bill Roberts, chairman of the Okaloosa County Board of Commissioners, after a hearing in the county's case against Valparaiso. ''The economic viability of our county is being threatened.''
The Democrats' control of Congress and the White House has added to the jitters. This is a heavily Republican area, and residents said Democrats might find ways to reassign F-35 training to more liberal states.
''California, Edwards -- they'd love to have them,'' said Caroleen Swanson, a Valparaiso resident, referring to Edwards Air Force Base in Mojave, Calif.
She was one of many area residents who said Mr. Arnold should be recalled from office, even though he has said he will not run for re-election next year. Others said he should be jailed.
For Mr. Arnold, the intense opposition has been a surprise that he dismisses as ignorance. ''You can make people do a lot of things,'' he said, ''but you can't make them think.''
A trim, no-nonsense man with eyebrows like paintbrushes, Mr. Arnold spent much of his career working as an engineer at Eglin. He said he first ran for office to fulfill a promise made to God ''when I was in a precarious position'' while serving in the Navy during the Korean War.
He maintains that he is neither anti-Air Force nor anti-F-35. ''I'm not looking for a fight,'' he said. ''My only responsibility is to provide information to the people.''
Last fall, he sent two letters to Valparaiso's 1,800 homes, expressing concern about noise levels from F-35 flyovers that would render conversation impossible. On Nov. 20, he warned that state and federal officials appeared ''willing to trade your city for the projected financial stimulus the BRAC 2005 actions might bring.''
In February, Mr. Arnold and two of the town's four commissioners voted to sue. The lawsuit accuses the Defense Department of failing to pursue alternatives in runway construction and flight patterns. It says the two options favored by the Air Force would destroy the city by subjecting 93 percent of its area to noise levels at or above 65 decibels -- a threshold described by the Defense Department as ''not normally compatible with residential use.''
Mr. Arnold said Valparaiso had filed the complaint because the town's concerns were not being taken seriously.
Air Force officials disagree. Lois Walsh, a spokeswoman at Eglin, provided a synopsis of community outreach efforts by Air Force officials that listed 14 events or briefings since August. Recently, the Air Force went even further, bringing the only completed F-35 to Eglin for what amounted to show and tell.
The jet did not fly over Valparaiso.
Col. Arnie Bunch,vice commander of the Air Armament Center at Eglin, said temporary efforts to address the noise concerns had been made. ''We have already placed limits on the number of night takeoffs and landings,'' he said. ''We have limited the use of afterburners.''
He acknowledged, however, that the limitations would probably have to be lifted in coming years as more jets arrived.
Residents opposed to the mayor's quest for an alternative, which could include a new runway, said they trusted the Air Force to work it out.
But with lawyers from both sides scheduled to meet on Thursday, and no resolution in sight, most people here expect a relentless battle between competing economic anxieties: fear of a collapse in property values because of jet noise versus fear of more lost jobs.
''People are scared to death,'' said Richard Woelfl, an Air Force veteran who owns rental properties in Valparaiso and is a plaintiff in the county's lawsuit against the town. ''All those condos we built over there in Destin -- they're empty.''

HEADLINE: OBAMA ASKS CURB ON USE OF HAVENS TO REDUCE TAXES

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and EDMUND L. ANDREWS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama on Monday called for curbing offshore tax havens and corporate tax breaks to collect billions of dollars more from multinational companies and wealthy individuals.
The move would appeal to growing populist anger among taxpayers but is likely to open an epic battle with some major powers in American commerce.
With the proposals he outlined at the White House, the president sought to make good on his campaign promise to end tax breaks ''for companies that ship jobs overseas.'' 
He estimated the changes would raise $210 billion over the next decade and help offset tax cuts for middle-income taxpayers as well as a permanent tax credit for companies' research and development costs.
The changes, if enacted, would take effect in 2011, when administration officials presume the economy will have recovered from the recession. But business groups were quick to condemn the White House for proposing tax increases amid a global downturn.
''This plan will reduce the ability of U.S. companies to compete in foreign markets, which will not only reduce jobs, but will also cripple economic growth here in the United States. It couldn't come at a worse time,'' said John J. Castellani, president of the Business Roundtable, a trade association of major businesses.
The proposals would especially hit pharmaceutical, technology, financial and consumer goods companies -- among them Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, Pfizer and Procter & Gamble -- that have major overseas operations or subsidiaries in tax havens like the Cayman Islands.
They have some of the mightiest lobbying armies in Washington, as well as influential patrons in Congress. That combination will test Mr. Obama's ability to stand up to powerful interests and marshal support among lawmakers at the same time that he is trying to win passage of major health and energy measures.
At issue are tax laws that were originally intended to prevent multinational corporations from being double-taxed, by the United States and by foreign countries, by allowing companies to defer reporting their foreign income to the Internal Revenue Service and to get tax credits in the United States for foreign taxes paid.
Economists are divided over whether higher taxes would give corporations incentives to move jobs overseas or impair economic growth at home. In the coming debate, both Mr. Obama and the business lobby will claim that their way will save jobs.
The top corporate tax rate is 35 percent, but the Treasury Department estimated that in 2004, the most recent year for which data is available, American multinationals paid $16 billion in taxes on $700 billion in foreign income -- an effective rate of 2.3 percent.
Mr. Obama's tax-raising initiative comes amid government bailouts for major financial institutions, auto companies and insurance giants, and polls show growing opposition. In February, a Senate proposal to give multinational companies a big tax cut if they brought profits back to the United States was defeated by a surprisingly large margin.
The president, in his remarks, reflected the public's restlessness in some of his most populist language to date.
Mr. Obama said most Americans paid taxes as ''an obligation of citizenship,'' but some businesses and rich people were ''shirking'' their duties, ''aided and abetted by a broken tax system, written by well-connected lobbyists on behalf of well-heeled interests and individuals.''
''It's a tax code full of corporate loopholes that makes it perfectly legal for companies to avoid paying their fair share. It's a tax code that makes it all too easy for a number -- a small number of individuals and companies to abuse overseas tax havens to avoid paying any taxes at all,'' the president said. ''And it's a tax code that says you should pay lower taxes if you create a job in Bangalore, India, than if you create one in Buffalo, New York.''
The Democratic chairmen of the House and Senate tax-writing committees, Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York and Senator Max Baucus of Montana, said in statements that some of Mr. Obama's proposals reflect ideas from their panels. But Mr. Baucus kept his distance, saying ''further study is needed to assess the impact of this plan on U.S. business.''
Congressional Republicans were relatively quiet. Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee and a frequent critic of tax schemes, said the president could ''count on my support'' to crack down on abuses. ''But if he's using tax shelters as a stalking horse to raise taxes on corporations at the cost of U.S. jobs, he'll lose me.''
Business groups had feared Mr. Obama would seek repeal of the tax-deferral law but he stopped short of that. Instead, he would prohibit companies from taking deductions in the United States for expenses on overseas investments until they have paid domestic taxes on the profits from those investments. Treasury estimated the proposal would raise $60.1 billion from 2011 through 2019.
General Electric has deferred American taxes on $75 billion in foreign profits by keeping them outside the United States, according to its annual report for 2008, and said it has no plan to ever repatriate that money. Citigroup has deferred taxes on $22.8 billion in foreign income.
The administration would raise $86.5 billion by ending a practice in which companies create foreign subsidiaries to shift income in ways that avoid taxes.
The Government Accountability Office has found that 83 of the 100 largest American companies have subsidiaries in tax havens; it counted 83 subsidiaries for Procter & Gamble alone. Financial services companies had even more, with Citigroup showing 427 and Morgan Stanley, 273.
Another proposal would close a loophole that allows companies to inflate the credits they claim for foreign taxes to the I.R.S., for an estimated $43 billion in new revenues. Separate steps to crack down on wealthy individuals would raise nearly $9 billion.
Tax experts, including some with Democratic leanings, caution that the proposals could put American corporations at a competitive disadvantage. The United States is part of a dwindling minority of industrialized countries that tries to tax corporate profits on a global basis. Most European governments tax corporations on the basis of their profits within their borders. ''If other countries are adopting systems that are friendlier to multinational corporations, then companies will have an incentive to locate their corporate headquarters outside the United States,'' said Alan Auerbach, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, who advised Senator John Kerry during his 2004 presidential campaign.
James Hines, an economics professor at the University of Michigan, suggested the president's proposals could be seen as creating unfair trade advantages for domestic goods and services.

HEADLINE: A Final Bargain at Filene's: The Stores, in Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM and JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Filene's Basement, the century-old retailer known for selling deeply discounted clothes and accessories by the likes of Gucci and Calvin Klein, filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday and said it planned to sell off most of its remaining stores. 
 Filene's said it had agreed to sell 17 of its 25 stores, including its flagship in Boston, to Crown Acquisitions, a New York real estate firm, for $22 million. Crown said it planned to run the stores under the Filene's brand. 
 Sluggish sales at new stores and increased competition from discounters like Century 21 and T. J. Maxx had weakened Filene's position in the market, the company said in its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in Delaware. Then, consumer spending dropped in the middle of the worst recession since the Great Depression, making ''a difficult situation much worse,'' the company said.
 The retailer said it owed $4.4 million to CIT Group Commercial Services and millions more to many other suppliers and landlords. In all, it said it had $83.8 million in assets and $182 million in liabilities.
 Filene's Basement becomes the latest in a string of retailers to file for bankruptcy protection as the recession has deepened, joining businesses like Circuit City, Sharper Image and Linens 'n Things.
 In the past, American shoppers have famously elbowed each other in the aisles of Filene's Basement for bargains on designer clothes. But lately, the retailer has been struggling to drum up sales and generate sufficient cash. 
 Sales at Filene's Basement stores open at least a year, an indicator of retail health known as same-store sales, fell 9.8 percent in the three months ended Jan. 31, and the chain closed 11 weak stores in January amid growing concerns about its viability. 
 On April 21, the chain's owner, Retail Ventures, of Ohio, essentially gave Filene's away to the liquidator Buxbaum Group for a $1.3 million fee and $375,000 in expenses. A few days later, the Buxbaum Group said it was considering ''all options'' for Filene's, and now it has picked one: bankruptcy reorganization.
 Crown Acquisitions hopes to take over Filene's locations in Boston, Baltimore, New York and elsewhere, capitalizing on the chain's well-known brand name and a pivot to thriftiness among American consumers. 
 ''This is a time when the high-end guys have no credit, have no money,'' said Stanley Chera, chairman of Crown Acquisitions. ''This is a tremendous opportunity. You sell a $2,000 garment at Bergdorf's, and I'm going to sell it for $299. They've got a problem.''
 The deal between Filene's and Crown is still subject to an auction in bankruptcy court. The court will solicit other bidders for the 17 stores Crown wants to buy, as well as for the other locations, Filene's said.
 Edward A. Filene founded Filene's Basement in Boston in 1909 to clear out excess merchandise from Filene's, his father's fancy department store upstairs. Eventually, the basement store began selling goods from other retailers and manufacturers too. The chain distinguished itself as one of the pioneers of automatic markdowns -- reducing prices on merchandise by certain percentages after it lingered for defined periods of time. 
 Filene's Basement continued drawing on its low-price roots with its ''Running of the Brides'' events, where $900 to $9,000 designer bridal gowns are marked down to $249 to $699. 
 But legendary bargains were not enough to keep the troubled chain going. A stalled renovation on the Filene's Basement flagship in Boston, which was a major tourist attraction, kept the lucrative store shut for two years. 
 While discount chains have performed far better than their upscale peers in the recession, Filene's faced competition from much lower-price chains as well as by high-end chains like Saks and Neiman Marcus, which suddenly began offering the latest designer fashions at deep discounts.

HEADLINE: Violence in Yemen Shows Growing Power of Insurgency

BYLINE: By ROBERT F. WORTH; Khaled Hammadi contributed reporting from Sana, Yemen.

DATELINE: BEIRUT, Lebanon 

 BODY:
A separatist movement in southern Yemen has gained political momentum and grown more violent recently, with a series of demonstrations and armed confrontations that have left at least eight people dead and dozens injured in the past week. 
 The unrest prompted an unusual statement of concern from the United States Embassy in Sana, the Yemeni capital, affirming American support for a unified Yemen and urging all parties to ''engage in dialogue to identify and address legitimate grievances.''
 The separatist violence is noteworthy because Yemen, a desperately poor country at the southern corner of the Arabian peninsula, is already facing an intermittent insurgency in the north and an increase in attacks by Al Qaeda's regional branch. All this has led some American officials to renew warnings that Yemen -- which has long served as a haven for jihadists -- could deteriorate into another Afghanistan.
 The global financial crisis has also worsened Yemen's situation, increasing unemployment and limiting the power of the state -- which has announced it will cut expenditures in half in 2009 -- to retain loyalty through pension payments and development projects. 
 The most recent round of violence began last Tuesday, when government troops established an additional checkpoint in the town of Radfan, in the southern Lahij Province. Angry local men attacked the checkpoint, killing two soldiers and injuring others. In the days since, demonstrations and violence have broken out in other towns, with three people killed in gun battles on Sunday. 
 In recent weeks, a number of political figures have begun openly demanding independence for the formerly socialist south, which was autonomous until the two Yemens unified in 1990. A brief civil war in 1994 left many southerners resentful of the north, and in the past three years grievances have steadily grown. These have been fueled mostly by economic disparities and the demands of retired southern soldiers who said they had not been paid their pensions. 
 Last month the separatists were joined by Tareq al-Fadhli, a prominent tribal figure and former ally of President Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen. Mr. Fadhli's public repudiation was especially noteworthy because he had helped organize jihadists to fight with the government against the socialist southerners during the 1994 civil war. 
 Mr. Saleh delivered a stark warning during an April 26 meeting in the capital with military and civilian leaders from the south, saying any division of Yemen would result in many states, not just two. 
 ''The people will fight from house to house,'' Mr. Saleh said. ''They should take a lesson from Iraq and Somalia.'' 
 Two days later, Mr. Fadhli called for a separate southern state during a large outdoor rally. 
 On Sunday, Yemen's foreign minister, Abu Bakr al-Qirbi, met in Sana with a group of ambassadors from Arab states apparently in an effort to secure their help in blocking support to the southern secessionist movement from abroad. A number of southern opposition leaders left Yemen in 1994, and some are said to receive support for their movement in Arab capitals.

HEADLINE: Lost Manuscript Unmasks Details Of Original Ponzi

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

 BODY:
In the summer of 1920, William H. McMasters, one of Boston's top publicists, was in a pickle. A new client, a dapper and charming Italian immigrant named Charles Ponzi, was raking in millions on promises to pay investors 50 percent interest in 45 days. 
 ''If he was everything he claimed, I would have a client such as no man ever had in the publicity field,'' Mr. McMasters wrote in a newly found and never published memoir. But, he reflected, ''if he was crooked or deluded, I must make up my mind to have him stop taking the money from the public.''
 As fate would have it, Mr. McMasters decided that Ponzi was indeed a fraud and wrote a newspaper expose in The Boston Post. The front-page article declaring that Ponzi was insolvent and had used incoming deposits to pay off earlier investors proved instrumental in unmasking him as history's most infamous swindler -- at least until Bernard L. Madoff came along. 
 Mr. McMasters remained convinced of his service to humanity -- ''I do not anticipate that another Charles Ponzi will ever appear in the financial world,'' he wrote. 
 Now that bittersweet narrative, so far known only in fragments, has emerged, offering insights into Ponzi's downfall, the machinations of the press, and one momentous week that rocked the financial world nearly 90 years ago. 
 The memoir -- ''The Ponzi Story,'' typed on 206 double-spaced pages and completed around 1962, six years before Mr. McMasters died at 94 -- is part of a trove of 2,200 books, manuscripts and pamphlets on swindlers and their frauds, hoaxes and confidence games acquired a year ago and recently catalogued by John Jay College of Criminal Justice. 
 ''We bought it before the financial crisis,'' said Larry E. Sullivan, the school's associate dean and chief librarian, calling the collection ''oh so timely.'' But, he said, ''McMasters was the clincher.''
 The works -- including titles like ''Frauds Exposed'' by Anthony Comstock, an 1880s anti-vice crusader; '' 'Yellow Kid' Weil,'' the biography of a legendary Chicago swindler; ''Famous Imposters'' by Bram Stoker, the author of ''Dracula''; and ''The Rise of Mr. Ponzi,'' the swindler's curious self-published, and self-serving, 1935 autobiography -- were purchased for $22,000 from an antiquarian, Patterson Smith, in Montclair, N.J. 
 The volumes, noncirculating but open to researchers by appointment, had been assembled by a retired Navy lawyer, William D. Gall of Waukegan, Ill., who had found the McMasters work in the Old Book Store in Fairlee, Vt., in 1990. The book dealer, John Larson, had no idea how it got there. Mr. Gall, who died last year, had consigned the collection to the Montclair shop for sale. 
 ''I think this is great stuff,'' said Mitchell Zuckoff, a Boston University professor who published a biography, ''Ponzi's Scheme,'' in 2005 and while using material from other McMasters writings had no idea that the publicist's memoir existed. ''My gut tells me he didn't get his due, but I'm not sure he was a complete Lone Ranger, either,'' he said. 
 Mr. McMasters's granddaughter and closest living relative, Faith B. Dickerson, a psychologist in Baltimore, said she too had also been unaware of the completed work, though she had copies of various shorter versions. ''His role has been shortchanged in Ponzi accounts going back to the 1920s,'' she said.
 Mr. McMasters was a pre-eminent public relations man when he took on Ponzi as a client in July 1920. A lawyer who had served in the Spanish-American War, he had handled publicity for the campaigns of several Massachusetts political figures, including Calvin Coolidge, John F. Fitzgerald (President John F. Kennedy's grandfather) and James M. Curley. Mr. McMasters himself ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1938, wrote a play produced on Broadway and exposed a baseball betting scandal. 
 Ponzi, on the other hand, was already a convicted felon, though Mr. McMasters and the world did not find that out until later. Born in Italy in 1882, he arrived in 1903 and made his way to Montreal, where he served three years for check forgery. 
 He eventually returned to Boston and devised a novel scheme to build a financial empire based on prepaid coupons that nations issued for postal replies. By buying the coupons at a fixed rate, he could exploit international currency fluctuations by redeeming them at a higher price. 
 But after offering depositors high interest rates, Ponzi never really dealt in postal coupons, which turned out to be too unwieldy for large-scale speculation. Instead, he just paid off his first depositors with money from later investors who would also have to be repaid. In the end, he was short as much as $10 million -- the equivalent of more than $100 million now. He pleaded guilty, was sent to prison, then was deported to Italy and died in Brazil in 1949. 
 While Ponzi, in his autobiography, barely mentioned Mr. McMasters, the publicist undeniably played a role in his unraveling -- a greater role, according to Mr. McMasters, than that acknowledged in existing accounts.
 After being hired by Ponzi, Mr. McMasters said he arranged an exclusive interview with the striving financier in The Boston Post, since defunct but then the largest-selling morning newspaper in the country. Ponzi's promised high rates were already drawing eager investors, but a front-page splash on July 24, 1920, under the headline ''Doubles the Money Within Three Months,'' aroused a frenzy.
 Privately, though, Mr. McMasters was beginning to have his doubts. ''I have never heard of such steady returns on any investment,'' he wrote.
 Mr. Zuckoff, in his biography, said Ponzi called the United States attorney, the Massachusetts attorney general and the district attorney for Suffolk County, which included Boston, and offered to explain his operations and to be audited. But Mr. McMasters wrote that he had pulled the strings to arrange Ponzi's interview with investigators. ''It was the first time I had seen any real evidence that he was a thief at heart,'' Mr. McMasters wrote.
 Later, poring over records, Mr. McMasters said he realized that ''the only money he had in his hands as of right now was money taken from investors,'' adding, ''The huge profits that he discussed so glibly were mythical and nonexistent.''
 ''Once I had reached that conclusion,'' he continued, ''I knew that I was faced with a duty that I owed to the public if I expected to stay in business for the rest of my life.'' That night, he said, ''I decided to write the expose of his fantastic story.''
 He offered the story to Richard Grozier, the Post's general manager and assistant publisher, telling him, ''How would you like to have a story blowing him up sky high?'' But the newspaper wavered. In an unusual move, Mr. McMasters said, he secretly secured a promise from Nathan Tufts, the district attorney where Mr. Grozier lived, to provide the publisher immunity from prosecution ''in case the story turned out to be untrue and libelous.'' 
 Over the objections of the city editor, Mr. Grozier gave Mr. McMasters the go-ahead, arranging to pay him $5,000 for the article plus a $1,000 bonus if all turned out well -- the huge sum (the equivalent of $64,000 today), according to the publicist, payable in cash to be untraceable if the story backfired.
 With the blaring headline, ''Declares Ponzi Is Now Hopelessly Insolvent,'' Mr. McMasters's article dominated the front page on Aug. 2, 1920, sealing Ponzi's fate, especially after The Post unearthed Ponzi's criminal record in Montreal a week later.
 ''It was a nail in the coffin,'' said Mr. Zuckoff, noting that other reporters had also begun chipping away at Ponzi's scheme. When The Post won a Pulitzer Prize for the story the following year, Mr. McMasters should have been happy, but he wasn't. ''No mention was made of my having given the paper its first shot at Ponzi,'' he grouses in his typescript. ''Instead it was made to appear that The Post editors had gone after this first story, which was not so.'' 
 ''The truth is that I almost had to beg the publisher to take the story,'' he wrote. But, he said, the newspaper ''in its self-laudation could hardly give credit to anyone outside of its staff.'' 
 ''This interpolation is inserted for the benefit of any young newspaperman who may read it,'' he concluded in the typescript he would not complete for 42 years. ''It cautions him not to expect too much for the things he may do for his paper. If he gets paid for his work, that is all he can expect.''

HEADLINE: Bailout Justice

BYLINE: By JOHN ASHCROFT. 
John Ashcroft was the United States attorney general from 2001 to 2005.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 I CAN imagine the Treasury secretary's face turning pale as he is told by the attorney general that one of the financial institutions on government life support has been indicted by a grand jury. Worse, I can imagine the attorney general facing not too subtle pressure from the president's economic team to go easy on such companies.
 This situation is hypothetical, of course, but in March, the F.B.I. director, Robert Mueller, warned Congress that ''the unprecedented level of financial resources committed by the federal government to combat the economic downturn will lead to an inevitable increase in economic crime and public corruption cases.'' Yet no one has discussed the inherent conflict of interest that the government created when it infused large sums of money into these companies. 
 The government now has an extraordinarily high fiduciary duty to safeguard the stability and health of companies that received hundreds of billions of bailout money. At the same time, the Justice Department has the duty to indict a corporation if the evidence dictates such severe action -- and an indictment is often a death sentence for a corporation. The quandary is obvious. How, then, does the Justice Department bring charges against a corporation that is now owned by the government? 
 The tsunami of corporate scandals that shook our economy in 2001 -- Enron, WorldCom, Adelphia and others -- provides us with an instructive example. The Justice Department moved swiftly to bring corporate wrongdoers to justice. But we also learned that when dealing with major companies or industries, we had to carefully consider the collateral consequences of our prosecutions. 
 Would there be unintended human carnage in the form of thousands of lost jobs? Would shareholders, some of whom had already suffered a great deal, lose more of their investment? What impact would our actions have on the economy? We realized that we had an obligation to minimize the harm to innocent citizens.
 Among the options we pursued were deferred prosecution agreements. These court-authorized agreements were not new but under certain circumstances offered more appropriate methods of providing justice in the best interests of the public as well as a company's employees and shareholders. They avoid the destructiveness of indictments and allow companies to remain in business while operating under the increased scrutiny of federally appointed monitors. 
 In September 2007, for instance, the Justice Department and the nation's five largest manufacturers of prosthetic hips and knees reached agreements over allegations that they gave kickbacks to orthopedic surgeons who used a particular company's artificial hip and knee reconstruction replacement products. The allegations meant that the companies faced indictment, prosecution and a potential end to their businesses. 
 Think of the effect on the community if these companies had been shuttered: employees would have lost their jobs, shareholders and pensioners would have lost their savings and countless people in need of hip and knee replacement would have been out of luck, as these five companies accounted for 95 percent of the market. The Justice Department could have wiped out an entire industry that has a vital role in American health care.
 Instead, the companies paid settlements to the government totaling $311 million. They agreed to be monitored by private sector individuals and firms with reputations for integrity and public service, with the necessary legal and business expertise and the institutional capacity to do the job. The monitoring costs were borne exclusively by the companies, saving taxpayers tens of millions of dollars that could be then used for other investigations and law-enforcement priorities. (I was a paid monitor for one of these companies, Zimmer Holdings.) In these types of circumstances, a deferred prosecution agreement is clearly better for everyone.
 The government must hold accountable any individuals who acted illegally in this financial meltdown, while preserving the viability of the companies that received bailout funds or stimulus money. Certainly, we should demand justice. But we must all remember that justice is a value, the adherence to which includes seeking the best outcome for the American people. In some cases it will be the punishing of bad actors. In other cases it may involve heavy corporate fines or operating under a carefully tailored agreement. 
 In 2001, we did not know the extent of the corporate fraud scandals. Every day seemed to bring news of another betrayal of trust by top executives of another company. But we learned that there was often a better solution than closing those companies. I believe that if we apply to this current crisis the lessons learned a few short years ago, we can achieve the restoration of trust in the financial system and the long-term vitality of the American economy.

HEADLINE: A Humbler Room Service

BYLINE: By KARLA COOK

 BODY:
As the sluggish economy forces hotel kitchens to do more with less, chefs have sought ways to retain a cherished perk of business trips: room service. 
 They are substituting cheaper cuts of meat, making some foods in advance, shrinking portion sizes and promoting local fresh fare. And they are serving comfort foods, said Ron DeSantis, director of consulting at the Culinary Institute of America -- like roasted chicken, Reuben sandwiches and French fries with a couple of dips instead of versions flavored with Parmesan and truffles. 
 ''Those are the things that resonate and aren't over the top in costs,'' he said. ''They want to use ingredients in a smart way to meet price points -- or expense accounts for business travel.'' 
 Even before the downturn, room service (now often called in-room dining) was not profitable on its own. ''Hotels have always tried to make money with room service, but they never could,'' said Joseph McInerney, president and chief executive of American Hotel and Lodging Association, a trade group. ''It's a service you need to have if you want to consider yourself a first-class hotel.'' 
 In-room dining is about making people feel welcome and at home, which translates to improved customer loyalty ratings and a heightened perception of the hotel, said Brad Barnes, a chef and a founder of GigaChef, a restaurant consulting firm. 
 ''Even if people don't partake, they like reading that a place has room service -- or overnight room service,'' he said. Then there is the business customer who arrives at midnight and is hungry and comes 20 times a year. ''You're not looking at his club sandwich. You're looking at his room.'' 
 For Fritz Doss, executive chef at the Hyatt Regency in Atlanta, that means offering a broad menu with items as varied as tuna sandwiches and dry-aged beef, and steaks in two sizes. For the diner who wants to ''eat with a conscience,'' he said, he offers a five-ounce portion of ''lean protein'' with no thick sauces and lots of vegetables.
 Mark Payne, executive chef at the Ritz-Carlton in Chicago, said he had seen a downturn in room service orders. Some items, he said, like the hamburger, Caesar salad, club sandwich, Cobb salad and the chocolate cake, remained popular. He said he had also been successful with the $35 three-course meal, featuring foods from the Green City Market. 
 At the Clift Hotel, near Union Square in San Francisco, the economy has forced reductions in the overnight room service staff. Thomas Rhodes, the executive chef, said the kitchen was assembling a limited menu with items like a Cobb salad, club sandwich, soup and hamburger -- all part of the burger-salad-sandwich triumvirate that is the foundation of room service. Staffing for dinnertime room service remains relatively intact. 
 Jan Freitag of Smith Travel Research, a hotel industry data analyst, said that demand for hotel rooms was down 8 percent in the first quarter but that he did not have statistics on demand for room service. 
 At the Crowne Plaza-Hamilton in Washington, restaurant and room service business has actually increased in the last six months, according to Spencer Wolff, the executive chef. He attributes that to the insular nature of the city, blustery spring weather that kept guests inside and the hotel's aggressive approach to maintaining sales. That includes a happy hour (with those menu items available to room service customers) and a new tapas menu. 
 After the Driskill, in Austin, Tex., reduced room rates and room service prices, occupancy rates and room service volume rose, said Jonathan Gelman, executive chef. ''Where we were offering a New York strip or a filet, it's now a skirt steak, or a steak salad with flank steak. It tastes great, so we all win,'' he said. He also has cut portion sizes -- a rib-eye steak is offered at 12 ounces, down from 16 ounces, and its price has been cut to $28, from $38. 
 When he is traveling, Mr. McInerney of the American Hotel and Lodging Association says he skips the chef's daily special in the restaurant in favor of a cheeseburger or a club sandwich from room service. He is on the road for two or three days a week, and said he preferred to unwind in his room and watch sports on the television or work on his laptop. ''I want to relax at my own speed,'' he said. 
 Rohit Verma, an associate professor of operations management at Cornell's School of Hotel Administration, said he preferred room service, too. ''Business travelers have flights at odd times, or they need a quick meal before a meeting,'' he said. ''If I'm by myself, I'd rather sit in my room and work while the food comes than sit in a restaurant.''

HEADLINE: French Are No. 1 In Eating and Sleeping

BYLINE: By MAIA DE LA BAUME

 BODY:
French people spend more time eating and sleeping than the habitants of any other highly developed country, according to a report published Monday by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The French sleep an average of nine hours every night, the report said. That is about 30 minutes longer than the average American and over an hour longer than the Japanese and Koreans. The O.E.C.D. study, based on a survey of 18 member countries, also shows that the French spend more than two hours a day eating, twice the time spent by people in Mexico, Canada and the United States.

HEADLINE: Once 'Very Good Rent Payers' Now Facing Eviction Notices

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
A registered nurse came close to losing her $1,550-a-month apartment on the Upper East Side after being let go from two jobs in three months. A woman found herself dipping into a 401(k) to keep her $3,375 unit in Peter Cooper Village after her husband was laid off in February from his six-figure marketing job. A father of two with an M.B.A. and a law degree owed $5,400 in back rent in Stuyvesant Town after he struggled to find steady work and lent money to his wife's family.
 Lawyers, judges and tenant advocates say the staggering economy has sent an increasing number of middle-class renters across New York City to the brink of eviction, straining the legal and financial services of city agencies and charities. Suddenly, residents of middle-class havens like Rego Park in Queens and Riverdale in the Bronx are crowding into the city's already burdened housing courts, long known as poor people's court. 
 Even some affluent people in high-end places are finding themselves facing off with landlords. One man, laid off by Merrill Lynch, was forced to move out of his $5,700 apartment in TriBeCa, owing $20,000 in back rent. Todd Nahins, a lawyer who represents owners of luxury residential buildings, has been busy negotiating payment plans for tenants in arrears.
 ''There's definitely an uptick of people who were basically very good rent payers until the economic downturn,'' Mr. Nahins said. ''There's so many of them. People who at one point had made money are now not earning enough to pay their rent.''
 No one knows exactly how many of those kinds of tenants are facing eviction; the city's five housing courts, and two smaller community courts that hear similar cases, do not keep data on the income level of litigants. Overall, court records show that the number of cases filed citywide for nonpayment of rent jumped about 19 percent in the first two months of 2009 from the same period last year, to 42,257 from 35,588.
 ''It's cutting across all lines,'' said Jaya K. Madhavan, supervising judge of Bronx Housing Court. ''The economy is really taking a toll on everyone.''
 While the downturn has certainly put plenty of lower-income people at risk of eviction, those involved in the housing court system say the growing numbers of accountants, salespeople, small business owners, construction project managers and other white-collar professionals being pursued for nonpayment is striking.
 Lawyers for District Council 37, the city's largest public employee union, provided free legal assistance to members on 2,572 housing court cases last year, up from 2,277 in 2006. ''People who never had eviction cases before are coming through our doors now,'' said Joan L. Beranbaum, director of the union's Municipal Employees Legal Services. 
 On the Upper East Side, the nonprofit Eviction Intervention Services has seen a spike in phone calls and office visits from tenants in rent-stabilized or rent-controlled apartments. In Bronx Housing Court, Room 360, which handles cases concerning units in co-ops and condominiums -- which are often more expensive than those in rental apartment buildings -- had 10,205 cases last year, up from 7,818 in 2007. 
 Landlords typically start nonpayment proceedings in housing court after a few months of missed rent, depending in part on a tenant's previous payment history; the goal is usually not eviction. ''It's not about, 'If you don't have the money, get the hell out,' '' Mr. Nahins said. ''It's about, 'Look, we want to work it out.' Nobody wants vacancies in high-end apartments.''
 Diane Scott, a single mother on Staten Island, lost her home to foreclosure in 2007 after she was laid off as a $72,000-a-year legal recruiter, only to be threatened with eviction from her $1,750 apartment when her $40,000-a-year bookkeeping job was eliminated in June. After appearing in housing court in February, Ms. Scott, 42, said she had been unable to tell her three sons they might again have to move. 
 Kevin Brewster-Streeks, 29, and his partner, Greg Armstrong, 22, struggled to pay their $1,650 rent on Mr. Armstrong's $18-an-hour salary as a medical assistant after Mr. Brewster-Streeks's $36,450 job as a records clerk at a law firm was eliminated last year.
 They borrowed $2,000 from relatives and friends and racked up $8,000 in credit-card debt. Mr. Armstrong withdrew about $4,000 from two pension and retirement accounts, and Mr. Brewster-Streeks started working as a hospital clerk for less than half of his previous pay. But they could not keep up: after two bouts in housing court, they moved out in February, owing nearly $7,000 in back rent.
 ''It's kind of dehumanizing,'' Mr. Brewster-Streeks said of the experience. ''They see you as a certain kind of person. We've never been that certain kind of person.''
 Mr. Armstrong stopped attending classes at LaGuardia Community College for two semesters and took so much time off from work to deal with the court case that he earned a negative job review. Along with legal help from District Council 37, of which Mr. Armstrong is a member, the couple got an emergency loan from the city's Human Resources Administration.
 They moved from a two-bedroom unit with ample closet space near Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx to a one bedroom with two small closets at the edge of the Cross-Bronx Expressway. The rent is $500 less, but they still have to pay off what they owe on the previous place, along with the $5,650 loan.
 ''It's going to take us a couple of years to get back from this,'' Mr. Armstrong said.
 For months, Christine A. Lewis, 46, has been living a kind of nomadic existence in her own apartment, using borrowed furniture, wearing borrowed clothing. Her own belongings -- bed, clothes, computer, television set -- were put in storage after a city marshal knocked on the door of her one-bedroom apartment in Co-Op City in the Bronx in June with an eviction order. She managed to quickly negotiate a return, but has been unable to raise $1,600 to pay off the storage company and get her possessions back. 
 So when her son died from bone cancer in December at age 18, Ms. Lewis had to borrow a suit to wear to the funeral.
 Ms. Lewis said she lost her job as a $52,000-a-year hospital lab technologist because she was unable to concentrate during her son's illness, and has been surviving since on unemployment benefits. She paid off $2,800 in back rent, but still worries about keeping up. 
 ''It's horrible and all, but I try to look at everything as if the glass is half full, as a learning experience,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Death Penalty Repeal Fails In Colorado

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: DENVER 

 BODY:
An effort to repeal Colorado's death penalty law stumbled Monday in the State Senate after two hours of sometimes anguished and angry debate, leaving the bill in limbo and supporters scrambling to find votes as the end of the session looms this week. 
 The Colorado House voted in support of repeal, by a single vote majority, last month.
 In their debate, lawmakers focused on questions of deterrence, certainty or doubt in the age of genetic evidence, and, far from least in the mix, money in a time of shrinking government resources.
 As proposed, the bill would have redirected about $1 million now devoted to death penalty costs to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation for investigating unsolved crimes known as cold cases. But the amendment that passed on a voice vote Monday pledged new money for cold cases -- popular with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle -- but made no mention of the death penalty. Democrats control both chambers of the General Assembly.
 ''They got what they wanted, and we got left behind,'' said Bradley A. Wood, the director of Lutheran Advocacy Ministry -- Colorado, which supported repeal.
 Questions of justice resonated from both sides.
 Senator Morgan Carroll, a Democrat and co-sponsor of the bill, said more money for cold-case work would mean more killers brought to justice. ''Justice at least means: find the person who did it,'' Ms. Carroll said. 
 She also said the costs of making a mistake when imposing the ultimate sanction were too high. ''In a democracy,'' she said, ''the decisions of the state come with blood on all of our hands in the event that we are wrong.''
 Senator Shawn Mitchell, a Republican, responded that life was imperfect and that some heinous crime must be set apart with greater sanctions, including the death penalty. ''It is the closest we can come to justice,'' Mr. Mitchell said. ''Not complete justice, it's just the closest we can get.''
 Contrary to the myths and legends of rough justice, most of the West -- with the major exception of California -- did not race back to imposing the death penalty after 1976, when the United States Supreme Court allowed states to resume the practice. 
 Colorado, Montana and Wyoming each have only two inmates on death row, as did New Mexico when it repealed its death penalty law in March, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a Washington-based research group that opposes capital punishment. Colorado has executed only one person since 1976. 
 The Colorado repeal bill was very much in keeping with what has become a national debate about the financial costs of the death penalty, especially as the recession hits state budgets hard. 
 For example, the Republican sponsor of a death penalty repeal proposal in Kansas specifically cited cost-benefit analysis in tough times as a reason for rethinking capital punishment. The bill cleared a legislative committee and was sent back for more study, ending its chances of passage this year.
 Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, a Democrat, also mentioned cost as part of his reason for signing a repeal measure.

HEADLINE: Home Sales Rise Again

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Pending sales of previously owned homes rose for a second month in March, while construction spending edged higher, according to reports on Monday that suggested moderation in the long housing slump. 
 The reports lent support to the view that the recession, now in its 17th month, was close to finding a bottom. A Federal Reserve survey of loan officers showed demand for prime mortgages rose in the first quarter for the first time since early 2007.
 ''On balance, it's an encouraging set of news. Pending home sales tell us, as far as the housing sector is concerned, we are getting near the bottom,'' said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Mass.
 The National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed in March, rose 3.2 percent as first-time buyers waded into the market to take advantage of favorable prices and mortgage rates, and an $8,000 federal tax credit.
 A report from the Commerce Department showed construction spending rose 0.3 percent in March, the first increase in six months.
 The pending home sales report added to evidence that sales had reached a bottom, said Michael Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners in Greenwich, Conn.
 ''That's critical because once sales bottom, it's only a matter of time before you work off excess inventories. That's the key to stabilization in the financial system and the economy at large. We're closer to that than people thought just a few months ago,'' said Mr. Darda.

HEADLINE: The New York Times Company Holds Off on Its Threat to Close The Boston Globe

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
After wringing concessions from all but one of The Boston Globe's labor unions, The New York Times Company on Monday postponed its threat to start the process of closing The Globe, leaving the newspaper's immediate future resting on talks with the largest union, the Boston Newspaper Guild. 
 Negotiations with the guild broke off about 6 a.m. Monday, after more than 19 hours. By then, the company had reached tentative agreements on wage, benefit and job security concessions with the unions representing mailers, drivers, press operators, machinists, electricians and others. 
 No further talks were scheduled as yet with the guild, which represents more than 600 Globe employees in the newsroom, advertising and some business offices.
 Under a federal plant-closing law, the company is required to give formal notice 60 days before shutting down The Globe, which it says is on a pace to lose $85 million this year. Late Sunday night it said it had written such a notice ''that we are prepared to file tomorrow'' unless it reached agreement with the unions by midnight.
 But deals with several unions were reached early Monday morning, and shortly before noon, the company said it would not file that day. It did not foreclose that option in the future.
 At the flagship New York Times newspaper, members of The Newspaper Guild voted 377 to 36 Monday to accept a 5 percent pay cut for the remainder of the year, which management had said was needed to avoid the layoffs of about 80 people.
 Officials at the Guild said that fewer than half of the members eligible to vote did so. 
 A similar pay cut was imposed last month on management at the paper and at the corporate level.
 The company has said since early April that unless the unions make wide-ranging concessions, it will close The Globe.
 The company is seeking wage and benefit givebacks to cut $20 million in annual costs at The Globe, and other concessions that would allow it to cut more in the future, like the abolition of lifetime job guarantees for more than 400 Globe employees.
 Of the $20 million in upfront cost cuts, the company says it needs to get $10 million from the guild. The guild says that it has offered concessions worth more than that amount, including cuts in wages and retirement plans, and unpaid furloughs, but that the company did not accept the offer.
 The shift of advertisers and readers to the Internet, coupled with the recession, has produced the worst downturn in the newspaper industry since the Depression. Trying to ride out the slump and protect The Times newspaper, the Times Company, which reported a $74.5 million loss in the first quarter, has made a series of cost cuts and maneuvers to raise cash.
 It has cut certain sections of The New York Times, eliminated a distribution subsidiary, sought to sell its minority share of the Boston Red Sox baseball team and related assets, executed a sale-leaseback of part of its headquarters building, and borrowed $250 million from Carlos Slim Helu, a telecommunications billionaire. Executives have also indicated that the company would be willing to sell The Globe.

HEADLINE: A Similar Stunner 38 Years Ago: Canonero II

BYLINE: By BILL FINLEY

 BODY:
When Mine That Bird romped in the Kentucky Derby, comparisons were made to Donerail, who won the Derby in 1913 at odds of 91-1, still the longest price ever for a Derby winner. 
 But Mine That Bird's shocking win might have been more reminiscent of another strange Derby outcome, one that happened in fairly recent times. Canonero II might have very well been the most illogical Kentucky Derby winner ever, or at least until Mine That Bird came around.
 Canonero II paid $19.40 to win the Derby in 1971, but only because he was part of the mutuel field. In the 1970s, the equipment used to conduct wagering could only handle 12 betting interests in a race. That meant that only the best 11 horses in the race could be bet on individually, and the remaining horses were grouped together. A bettor playing the field cashed in if any of the horses in the group won. 
 Canonero II, one of six horses in the field that year, probably would have gone off at odds higher than 91-1 had he been a sole betting interest.
 A Kentucky-bred, Canonero II sold for only $1,200 at the Keeneland sales, or $8,300 less than the purchase price for Mine That Bird, without accounting for inflation. He raced primarily in Venezuela, a minor racing country that has minuscule purses. In his final race before the Kentucky Derby, he finished third in a handicap race in Venezuela that had a $3,500 purse.
 Even racing experts in Venezuela were convinced he had no chance in the Derby. A Caracas newspaper said Canonero II would be ''hopelessly outclassed'' in the Derby.
 But that was hardly the case. Like Mine That Bird, Canonero II sat far back early before unleashing a powerful move. He closed from 18th before drawing away to a three-and-three-quarter-length win.
 ''Canonero II bombarded the form players today by crashing through to one of the most surprising victories in the 97-year history of the Kentucky Derby,'' Joe Nichols wrote in The New York Times.
 Canonero II turned out to be anything but a fluke. He won the Preakness by one and a half lengths and then took aim at the Belmont. His presence helped attract a crowd of 81,036, then a record for Belmont Park. But Canonero II was not at his best and finished fourth.
 Later sold to American interests, Canonero II remained in the United States, but struggled. He had eight starts after the Belmont, winning just one.

HEADLINE: Where Housing Crashed Early, Glimmers of Recovery Emerge

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO 

 BODY:
Is this what a bottom looks like?
 This city was among the first in the nation to fall victim to the real estate collapse. Now it seems to be in the earliest stages of a recovery, a hopeful sign for an economy mired in trouble and anxiety. 
 Investors and first-time buyers, the traditional harbingers of a housing rebound, are out in force here, competing for bargain-price foreclosures. With sales up 45 percent from last year, the vast backlog of inventory has diminished. Even prices, which have plummeted to levels not seen since the beginning of the decade, show evidence of stabilizing. 
 Indications of progress are visible in other hard-hit areas, including Las Vegas, parts of Florida and the Inland Empire in southeastern California. Sales in Las Vegas in March, for example, rose 35 percent from last year. 
 ''It's fragile, and it could easily be fleeting,'' said an MDA DataQuick analyst, Andrew LePage. ''But history suggests this is how things might look six months before prices bottom out.'' 
 Hope for housing was on full display in the stock market on Monday. News that pending home sales rose in March instead of falling, coupled with improved construction spending, propelled a strong rally. One broad market average, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, is now in positive territory for the year, after being down 25 percent on March 9. 
 No one in Sacramento is predicting that local housing prices, which have been cut in half from their mid-2005 peak, are going to reclaim much of that ground anytime soon. 
 Instead, this is what passes for wild-eyed optimism: a belief that things have finally stopped getting worse. ''A period of price stagnation would boost a lot of spirits,'' Mr. LePage said. 
 When a market bottoms, foreclosures usually stop piling up and banks become more willing to make loans, confident the collateral backing them will not fall in value.
 Nationally, signs of progress in real estate are still faint at best. Existing home sales in March were down 7 percent from last year, according to the National Association of Realtors. 
 The supply of unsold homes was about 10 months, a number that has changed little over the last year and is abnormally high. But first-time buyers were an impressive 53 percent of the market -- and that was largely before a first-time buyer's tax credit of $8,000 became available.
 With the tax credit in place and interest rates low, the pace of sales may be picking up. The Realtors' group said Monday that the number of houses under contract in March was up 1 percent from a year earlier. Those pending deals will be reported in the existing-home sales for April and May.
 Sales volume tends to recover long before prices. In fact, some analysts think price declines in many markets are accelerating. First American CoreLogic, a real estate data firm, reported that ''the depth and breadth of price declines continued to worsen in February.'' Fitch Ratings recently revised its estimate of future declines to 12.5 percent, from 10 percent, saying the drop would extend to the end of next year.
 Amid the uncertainty, Sacramento is drawing scrutiny as a test case. The area boomed in the first part of the decade; the population of Sacramento County increased 10 percent, to 1.4 million, as San Franciscans sought cheaper places to live. 
 When the market peaked and the ability to refinance all those costly mortgages dried up, the carnage began. There have been 28,898 foreclosures in Sacramento County since 2005.
 Sales in the top half of the market remain slow. The Federal Reserve reported on Monday that half of all banks recently tightened their lending standards on prime mortgages. Many would-be buyers, here as elsewhere, simply cannot get financing. 
 Sellers, meanwhile, are reluctant to lower their prices, preferring to bide their time. New construction is nearly nonexistent.
 What drives the market here, then, are all those foreclosures. Two-thirds of the 2,092 existing single-family houses and condominiums sold here in March were bank repossessions, up from 8.5 percent two years ago, according to MDA DataQuick, a real estate research firm.
 These cut-rate properties are engendering the same frenzy and frustration that symbolized the boom, as Rebecca and Chris Whitman discovered when they started looking for a house in December. Ms. Whitman's new job as an athletics director at Sacramento State required an immediate move from Chico, two hours north.
 In two months the couple looked at 100 houses, nearly all foreclosures priced under $200,000, making verbal offers on 20. Only rarely did they get a response. Banks trying to unload large numbers of properties are less interested in traditional transactions with individuals than all-cash offers from investors.
 As interest rates fell, the Whitmans were able to increase their price limit. They ended up buying from investors. A syndicate had bought a three-bedroom foreclosure on a cul-de-sac in eastern Sacramento last fall for $172,000, made a few improvements and was flipping it -- another boom-era element that is back. The Whitmans bought it three weeks ago for $224,500.
 ''We think we got a good deal,'' said Ms. Whitman, 31. Their monthly payment, including property taxes, will be about $1,200. Renting an equivalent house, with space for their two dogs, two cats and the baby they are expecting, would have been hundreds of dollars more. 
 When buying is cheaper than renting, markets begin to turn. At the current rate of sales, there is less than three months of inventory in the Sacramento market. In normal times, that would indicate a seller's market.
 Except these are not normal times. The unemployment rate in the county is 11.3 percent, the highest in decades. That will prompt more foreclosures all by itself. Furthermore, banks have lifted various processing moratoriums that lowered foreclosures last fall. 
 These two factors yielded a rise in the number of default notices filed in Sacramento County in March to 2,819, a record. Thousands more bank-owned houses are likely to come to market this summer and fall.
 ''That will stall any progress toward stability,'' said Michael Lyon, chief executive of Lyon Real Estate. ''The prospects for a recovery are fool's gold.''
 Mr. Lyon expects further price declines and slowing sales. But David Berson, the chief economist for the mortgage insurer PMI, argues that such bleakness from the people whose livelihood is selling houses is itself a positive sign. ''Things are awful at the bottom, and we're at the bottom,'' Mr. Berson said. ''No question about it. But the trend going forward should be higher sales, and that will eventually affect prices.''

HEADLINE: Jack Kemp's Futile Quest

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
I remember Jack Kemp from way back, from his football days. He was the all-star quarterback for the Buffalo Bills in the game in 1965 in which Joe Namath made his first start for the New York Jets. The United States was at war and Lyndon Johnson was drafting every young man he could get his hands on for his buildup of forces in Vietnam, but neither Kemp nor Namath had to worry about that. Football injuries made them unfit for service. 
 Kemp and the Bills beat Namath and the Jets on that September afternoon in Buffalo, 33-21. 
Kemp, who died on Saturday from cancer, would later be much better known for his long career as a conservative Republican politician. He had two very big ideas for his party. One was terrific, spot on. The other couldn't have been more boneheaded. The G.O.P. being the G.O.P. rejected the good idea and went hog wild for the boneheaded one.
 Kemp's good idea was that the Republicans should vastly expand their tent, get past their narrow-mindedness and begin actively seeking the support of blacks and other ethnic minorities. 
 The G.O.P. would have none of it. It was, after all, the party of the southern strategy, and there was precious little that was racially enlightened about its conservative wing. One of the writers who influenced Kemp's thinking about politics, William F. Buckley, was at the opposite pole of Kemp's progressive thinking about race. Buckley took a scurrilous stand in the aftermath of the Brown v. Board of Education decision that desegregated the nation's public schools.
 Whites, being superior, were well within their rights to discriminate against blacks, according to Buckley. ''The White community is so entitled,'' he wrote, ''because, for the time being, it is the advanced race ...''
 Kemp was whistling in a hurricane.
 The bad idea, advanced by Kemp with fanatical energy and devotion, was supply-side economics -- ''voodoo economics,'' as George H.W. Bush so famously and rightly derided it. Supply-siders saw tax cuts as the answer to every prayer. Cut taxes, they argued, and watch the economy take off like a rocket.
 What they never spelled out for the electorate was that most of the tax cuts would go to the rich, that the rich would harvest most of the money from the increased economic activity, and that the radically reduced tax revenue would send government budget deficits streaking toward the moon.
 Kemp professed not to be worried about the deficits. He seemed to have believed that somehow everything would work out. The ultramilitants to his right, people even further out in their orthodoxy than Kemp, were delighted by the deficits. They wanted to ''starve the beast,'' reduce the government's revenues to the point where elected officials would have no choice but to cut programs and services that benefited people who were not rich. Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid were primary targets.
 ''Our goal,'' said Grover Norquist, ''is to shrink government down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub.''
 Norquist, a driving force behind the George W. Bush tax cuts, once called John McCain a ''tax-increasing Bolshevik.'' We are talking about weirdness of a very high order here, and that weirdness dominated the economic policies of the United States for years.
 Working people were told they should sign onto this craziness because the economic benefits of supply-side tax policies would ultimately benefit everyone. As every scheme imaginable was developed to bolster the fortunes of the rich, ordinary people were left in the humiliating position of waiting for some of the goodies to trickle down to them.
 We've seen how it all worked out.
 The way to look at the endless theoretical and intellectual posturing of the right is to look at who actually does well when the so-called conservative policies are implemented, and who doesn't. Inevitably it's the rich who benefit.
 Jack Kemp meant well, but the great irony that cloaked his entire career was that it was not possible to achieve the ends he sought using the means he pushed with such zeal. He wanted to help the middle class and the poor. He wanted the nation's inner cities to thrive, and he wanted America's prosperity to be broadly shared.
 But he chose as his vehicle the party of the rich. The changes he advocated and helped shepherd into law went far beyond correcting excesses in the tax code. They radically transformed the economic system in ways that proved a boon to those who were already wealthy, were harmful to the very people he wanted to help and eventually left the overall economy in ruins.
 In Saturday's column, I mistakenly referred to Jim DeMint as the governor of South Carolina. He is a U.S. senator.

HEADLINE: The Long Voyage Home

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Republicans generally like Westerns. They generally admire John Wayne-style heroes who are rugged, individualistic and brave. They like leaders -- from Goldwater to Reagan to Bush to Palin -- who play up their Western heritage. Republicans like the way Westerns seem to celebrate their core themes -- freedom, individualism, opportunity and moral clarity. 
 But the greatest of all Western directors, John Ford, actually used Westerns to tell a different story. Ford's movies didn't really celebrate the rugged individual. They celebrated civic order. 
 For example, in Ford's 1946 movie, ''My Darling Clementine,'' Henry Fonda plays Wyatt Earp, the marshal who tamed Tombstone. But the movie isn't really about the gunfight and the lone bravery of a heroic man. It's about how decent people build a town. Much of the movie is about how the townsfolk put up a church, hire a teacher, enjoy Shakespeare, get a surgeon and work to improve their manners. 
 The movie, in other words, is really about religion, education, science, culture, etiquette and rule of law -- the pillars of community. In Ford's movie, as in real life, the story of Western settlement is the story of community-building. Instead of celebrating untrammeled freedom and the lone pioneer, Ford's movies dwell affectionately on the social customs that Americans cherish -- the gatherings at the local barbershop and the church social, the gossip with the cop and the bartender and the hotel clerk.
 Today, if Republicans had learned the right lessons from the Westerns, or at least John Ford Westerns, they would not be the party of untrammeled freedom and maximum individual choice. They would once again be the party of community and civic order.
 They would begin every day by reminding themselves of the concrete ways people build orderly neighborhoods, and how those neighborhoods bind a nation. They would ask: What threatens Americans' efforts to build orderly places to raise their kids? The answers would produce an agenda: the disruption caused by a boom and bust economy; the fragility of the American family; the explosion of public and private debt; the wild swings in energy costs; the fraying of the health care system; the segmentation of society and the way the ladders of social mobility seem to be dissolving.
 But the Republican Party has mis-learned that history. The party sometimes seems cut off from the concrete relationships of neighborhood life. Republicans are so much the party of individualism and freedom these days that they are no longer the party of community and order. This puts them out of touch with the young, who are exceptionally community-oriented. It gives them nothing to say to the lower middle class, who fear that capitalism has gone haywire. It gives them little to say to the upper middle class, who are interested in the environment and other common concerns.
 The Republicans talk more about the market than about society, more about income than quality of life. They celebrate capitalism, which is a means, and are inarticulate about the good life, which is the end. They take things like tax cuts, which are tactics that are good in some circumstances, and elevate them to holy principle, to be pursued in all circumstances.
 The emphasis on freedom and individual choice may work in the sparsely populated parts of the country. People there naturally want to do whatever they want on their own land. But it doesn't work in the densely populated parts of the country: the cities and suburbs where Republicans are getting slaughtered. People in these areas understand that their lives are profoundly influenced by other people's individual choices. People there are used to worrying about the health of the communal order. 
 In these places, Democrats have been able to establish themselves as the safe and orderly party. President Obama has made responsibility his core theme and has emerged as a calm, reassuring presence (even as he runs up the debt and intervenes rashly in sector after sector).
 If the Republicans are going to rebound, they will have to re-establish themselves as the party of civic order. First, they will have to stylistically decontaminate their brand. That means they will have to find a leader who is calm, prudent, reassuring and reasonable. 
 Then they will have to explain that there are two theories of civic order. There is the liberal theory, in which teams of experts draw up plans to engineer order wherever problems arise. And there is the more conservative vision in which government sets certain rules, but mostly empowers the complex web of institutions in which the market is embedded.
 Both of these visions are now contained within the Democratic Party. The Republicans know they need to change but seem almost imprisoned by old themes that no longer resonate. The answer is to be found in devotion to community and order, and in the bonds that built the nation.

HEADLINE: The Cost of Staying Home Sick

 BODY:
It sounded like the responsible course of action when President Obama and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged people with flu symptoms to stay at home so they do not infect others in the community -- and to keep any sick children out of school as well. So far, the new swine flu virus has caused only mild disease in the United States, but it has spread through most of the country, making it likely that rising numbers of people will be developing symptoms. 
 But what are civic-minded workers to do when staying home will cost many their daily pay and, in a recession-plagued economy, possibly their jobs if employers become exasperated over their absence? 
 Roughly 60 million American workers have no paid sick leave, and only a minority can draw pay if they stay home with sick children. The lack of paid leave is especially acute in this country among low-wage workers, food-service workers and part-timers, among others. 
 Many other countries do better. According to Dr. Jody Heymann, director of the Institute for Health and Social Policy at McGill University, more than 160 countries ensure that all their citizens receive paid sick leave and more than 110 of them guarantee paid leave from the first day of illness. 
 If President Obama is serious about responsible action to control infectious disease threats, he should back legislation to grant Americans at least seven paid sick days a year -- long enough to stay home until an influenza infection subsides. Then virtually all Americans could heed his advice, and we would all be safer.

HEADLINE: Obama Plan Leaves One Path to Lower Taxes Wide Open

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
The Obama administration's plan to restrict or shut down several widely used tax loopholes takes away many -- but not all -- of the sophisticated tax moves commonly used in corporate America. 
 The most widely used tactic not covered by the plan is known as transfer pricing, which multinational corporations employ routinely to reduce the taxes they owe to the United States by keeping their profits offshore in low-tax or no-tax havens.
 The highly complex tactic has become a cause of growing concern within the Internal Revenue Service in recent years because it deprives the Treasury of billions of dollars a year, according to private-sector estimates. One senior government official briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he said he was not authorized to comment publicly, said on Monday that transfer pricing abuses were the single largest source of tax avoidance in corporate America.
 Rosanne Altshuler, an economics professor at Rutgers, called transfer pricing ''the elephant in the room'' that was not addressed under the Obama plan. 
 Corporate America ''will still have the ability to do and use transfer pricing -- it's still there,'' said Robert Willens, an independent tax and accounting expert in New York.
 Like the two tax loopholes covered under the Obama plan -- the proposal restricts the ability of companies to defer taxes owed on profits earned overseas, and eliminates a popular method, known as check the box, for reducing taxes through transfers of money to overseas affiliates -- transfer pricing involves the same issue of lowering taxes through maneuvers involving overseas subsidiaries and affiliates.
 As part of the tax code, the tactic allows corporations, typically Fortune 500 companies like Wal-Mart, Exxon Mobil and General Electric, to reduce their United States taxes by calculating the prices they charge on goods and services transferred between their global divisions. 
 While corporations are supposed to compute those costs as if they had been assessed between independent, neutral entities, and to pay any taxes owed on them -- the top rate is around 35 percent -- corporations often fudge the numbers to their advantage, according to senior analysts.
 In other words, corporations routinely abuse the tactic to minimize their taxes by undercharging or overpaying their foreign subsidiaries for goods and services. 
 With the Obama plan closing other loopholes, corporations are ''now going to get crazy with their transfer pricing,'' said Lee Sheppard, a commentator for Tax Analysts, a trade publication.
 On another front, Robert S. McIntyre, the director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a research group, said that the Obama plan to make permanent the research and development tax credit would provide more leeway for pharmaceutical and technology companies, which make extensive use of such credits, to lower their taxes in questionable ways.
 Such companies, Mr. McIntyre said, increasingly use the credits for purposes other than research, like salaries and overhead.

HEADLINE: Back To Basics With Buffett

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN. 
The latest news on mergers and acquisitions can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook.

DATELINE: Omaha 

 BODY:
 ''If you have a 150 I.Q., sell 30 points to someone else. You need to be smart, but not a genius.''
 So said Warren Buffett, the world's most famous value investor, at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting here on Saturday, a regular pilgrimage for some 35,000 shareholders that many call Woodstock for capitalists. This year there wasn't as much free-flowing love, given what a difficult year it's been for capitalists, Mr. Buffett included.
 But shareholders still hung on every word from the 78-year-old investor's lips. Between sips of Cherry Coke and bites of peanut brittle, he served up some wisdom that might have saved a lot of heartache (not to mention jobs and untold financial losses) had investors heeded it over the last decade: keep it simple. 
 During the boom, the country became too enamored with the idea that the best and brightest could predict the future; too dependent on complicated financial models developed by quant jocks; and too reactive to every uptick or slight drop in the market. It still may be today. 
 ''If you need to use a computer or a calculator to make the calculation, you shouldn't buy it,'' he said. Given that the stress tests for the banking system -- developed with complex spreadsheets and using sophisticated formulas predicting the next two years' worth of earnings and write-downs -- are being released this week, it was timely advice. (He still likes his investment in Wells Fargo, by the way, and suggests it has enough capital already. Though, it's worth noting, he seemed less optimistic about the economy than officials in Washington.)
 Charlie Munger, Mr. Buffett's 85-year-old business partner, added his two cents: ''Some of the worst business decisions I've ever seen are those with future projections and discounts back. It seems like the higher mathematics with more false precision should help you, but it doesn't. They teach that in business schools because, well, they've got to do something.''
 I had traveled to Omaha to sit on stage, along with two other journalists, to pepper Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger with questions -- some quite tough -- for more than five hours. Shareholders had sent in thousands of them by e-mail before I left. Even while I was on stage, they kept arriving, stuffing my BlackBerry.
 Some questions I received showed flashes of real anger. Mr. Buffett, who had earned the nickname ''the Oracle of Omaha'' for his long-term performance, had let some of these shareholders down, they said. This past year was his worst ever. Like everyone else, he missed the credit crisis and subprime debacle. 
 Not surprisingly, however, his fan club is still strong, dismissing his bad year as part of the ''markets go up and markets go down'' inevitability of value investing. Even so, Mr. Buffett himself acknowledged, ''I didn't cover myself in glory'' in 2008. 
 Others, though, wanted to know why Mr. Buffett was still invested in Moody's, whose credibility took a huge hit in the bust along with other credit rating agencies after it doled out Triple-A ratings the way McDonald's sells hamburgers (a shareholder's analogy, not mine). There were plenty of questions about Mr. Buffett's succession plan (or lack thereof, to the dismay of many investors). And if it was not about Mr. Buffett's successor, it was about his reinsurance guru, Ajit Jain, who runs Berkshire's wildly profitable reinsurance business. ''The Titanic-like ending of A.I.G., after Greenberg left, has me spooked,'' wrote Ben Knoll, in reference to Maurice Greenberg, A.I.G.'s former chief. He wanted to know who was next in line to take over a job that requires assessing risk.
 Mr. Buffett sometimes meandered, but he did not skirt the questions. It ''would be impossible'' to replace Mr. Jain, he said, saying that ''we won't find a substitute for him.'' He suggested that if Mr. Jain were ever to leave, Berkshire didn't have anyone it would allow to write the same size insurance policies. Most C.E.O.'s I know would have said they had a succession plan even if they didn't.
 To the question about Moody's, he said the company ''eagerly sought stupid assumptions that enabled them to do clever mathematics.'' As to why he didn't exert his influence, he said: ''I don't think I've ever made a call to Moody's. We don't tell Burlington Northern what safety procedures to put in or AmEx who they should lend to. When we own stock, we are not there to try and change people.''
 When asked why the conglomerate structure seemed to work so well for him, he remarkably -- and surprisingly, to me -- explained the structure is efficient and comes in handy around April 15. ''We've got this ability in terms of moving money around into various opportunities'' without tax consequences, he said, describing how he can invest the profits from one business into another without being taxed.
 Most of what Mr. Buffett said was basic and obvious -- and was roundly ignored during the period leading up to this mess. ''Leverage is what causes people real trouble in this world,'' Mr. Buffett said. ''You don't want to be in a position where someone can pull the rug out from under you or, emotionally, where you pull it out from under yourself.''
 Not that Mr. Buffett doesn't have a rug or two of his own. For a man who preaches the virtues of simplicity in all things investing, he is wrapped up in a lot of complicated investments, namely the very same derivatives that he has called ''weapons of mass destruction.'' On Saturday, he acknowledged that he had futures and options contracts on stock indexes and foreign currencies, but added that, in and of themselves, ''derivatives aren't evil.''
 Insurance, by the way, is not exactly simple, either. There is a crystal-ball aspect to the industry, papered over with spreadsheets of probability calculations.
 On Sunday morning, the day after the meeting, I attended a private brunch for the company's directors and managers. It was a star-studded affair (for financial types): Bill Gates, Don Graham of The Washington Post, Charlie Rose, Steve Wynn, Mr. Jain and even a movie star, Glenn Close. 
 It had been a long weekend. Everyone was heading to the airport. One C.E.O. told me, ''If I can just hold on and try to think like Warren for a couple of days when I get home every year after this weekend, it's a success.''
 I shook Mr. Buffett's hand goodbye and tried to remember his words from the day before: ''There is so much that's false and nutty in modern investing practice and modern investment banking,'' he said. ''If you just reduced the nonsense, that's a goal you should reasonably hope for.''

HEADLINE: Gov. Paterson Seeks a Cap On Spending by the State

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
With new poll numbers raising fresh doubts about his political viability, Gov. David A. Paterson unveiled a plan on Monday that would set mandatory limits on state spending, his latest attempt to position himself as a fiscal conservative.
 Mr. Paterson's proposal would limit the increase in spending to the average inflation rate over the previous three years, a move that could save billions of dollars annually, but one seen as having little chance of approval by his fellow Democrats, who control the Legislature. And even if it were passed, it could have little practical effect unless it were an amendment to the State Constitution, since lawmakers can and routinely do supersede existing law in the budget process. 
 The governor discussed his plan at a news conference hours after the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion released a poll suggesting that voters are increasingly skeptical of him. Only 19 percent of registered voters surveyed by Marist believe the governor is doing a good or excellent job -- down from 26 percent in a survey released in March -- and most would rather have Eliot Spitzer back as governor. The previous poll had been the lowest rating Marist had recorded n the 27 years it has been surveying opinion of New York governors, and the numbers have kept falling. 
 Certainly, the governor has had a series of setbacks and challenges, from the recession to a standoff with public-sector unions over proposed pay cuts, to perennial cabinet turmoil, to his torturous selection process to fill Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate seat. 
 Asked what his strategy was for turning around voter sentiment, Mr. Paterson began by reciting a list of people who might be upset with him. 
 ''If you are a taxpayer that makes over $300,000 a year, you couldn't be very happy with the governor right now,'' he said. ''If you are a state worker, it's clear that they're not happy with the governor right now. If you are a recipient of a lot of the cuts that the budget has brought to the public, you won't be happy.'' 
 ''I don't blame the public for how they feel,'' he added, ''I'm just going to work hard so this state is in good fiscal condition next year and perhaps people will feel differently.''
 One of his strategies since taking office in March 2008 has been to argue for fiscal austerity. That said, the budget for this fiscal year, which began last month, was criticized in many quarters for not doing enough to rein in spending.
 The current budget relies on temporary federal stimulus dollars and a three-year tax increase on the wealthy.
 The Senate minority leader, Dean G. Skelos, a Long Island Republican, called the governor's proposed spending cap ''too little, too late.''
 ''The governor doesn't need a law or a Constitutional amendment to cap state spending,'' he added. ''He already has the power to freeze, cut or veto spending.''
 A spokesman for the assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, said that they were reviewing the proposal. A spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Malcolm A. Smith, had no immediate comment. 
 The Marist poll contained more bad news for the governor, showing that he had no reliable base of support in any political, ethnic or economic subgroup. Seventy percent of voters surveyed believe Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo, who is seen as a challenger to Mr. Paterson in a Democratic primary next year, is doing a good or excellent job. 
 Marist surveyed 1,029 registered voters by phone last Tuesday and Wednesday; the margin of error for a sampling of that size is plus or minus 3 percentage points.

HEADLINE: Tax Salvos

 BODY:
There is something wrong with a system where some of the largest and most profitable companies contribute a pittance to the Treasury. And President Obama was right to call attention to the problem when he proposed corporate tax increases on Monday. The administration noted that in 2004, the latest year for which data were available, American multinational corporations paid about $16 billion on $700 billion in foreign earnings, an effective tax rate of about 2.3 percent. 
 A deeper problem, however, is that, with few exceptions, there are no easy fixes to tax problems posed by global profits. The Obama proposals oversimplify the challenge, both technically and politically. 
 One of the most controversial proposals would delay deductions against overseas profits until those profits are brought back to the United States. In theory, that makes perfect sense, because matching deductions and income in the same year is a fundamental principle of United States tax law. 
 In practice, applying the matching principle to overseas operations could put American companies at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies that do not face United States tax laws. It could even impede job creation in the United States -- exactly the opposite of what the Obama administration intends. That's because some of the expenses incurred in generating foreign profits are for support jobs in the United States, like human resources and accounting positions. If companies cannot write off those employment expenses in the year they are incurred, they may move the jobs overseas. 
 The administration has also proposed to make it harder to abuse the foreign tax credit, a provision that allows companies to claim a credit on their American taxes for taxes paid to another country. No one objects to curbing abuse. Unfortunately, the extent of the alleged abuse is unclear. That presages a much tougher fight, with arguments on each side as to whether the proposal is a mere loophole closer or a fundamental shift in how the credit is calculated and applied. 
 The administration is on firmer ground in proposing to change a practice whereby companies shift income from foreign subsidiaries to foreign tax havens, erasing their United States tax liability in the process. The practice was first allowed in the Clinton administration, despite warnings at the time that it would lead to aggressive tax avoidance. That is exactly what has happened, reducing tax revenue by billions of dollars a year. 
 The Obama administration deserves credit for putting some of the problems of the corporate tax system on the table, but we hope it is only a warm-up act. Once the economy begins to recover, comprehensive reform of the tax system will be needed to raise enough money in a way that spreads the burden as widely as possible. Done properly, that would inevitably require new tax sources, like a value-added tax or energy taxes -- or both. Enacting those would be a monumental challenge that would make enacting the current package of corporate proposals look puny by comparison.

HEADLINE: Sprint Nextel Earnings Decline as Customers Leave

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
Sprint Nextel reported nearly a $600 million net loss on a 12 percent decline in revenue during its first quarter, largely because of defections of the company's customers to other wireless carriers. 
 The company said Monday it lost 182,000 customers over all in the first quarter -- a sharp improvement from the company's fourth quarter, when it lost 1.3 million. But Sprint still lost 1.25 million customers with long-term contracts, a trend the company attributed to a troubled economy affecting its business consumers.
 That drop-off was largely offset by gains in prepaid and wholesale subscribers. Boost Mobile, the company's unit that sells prepaid phone service, added 764,000 subscribers in the quarter. 
 ''There's no question that there is a movement in this country toward prepaid,'' said Daniel R. Hesse, the company's chief executive. ''We're going to ride that horse.''
 Mr. Hesse said he was disappointed by the continued loss of the company's best customers. ''We need to do better,'' he told Wall Street analysts during a conference call. 
 By comparison, Verizon, the largest wireless carrier, added 1.3 million new subscribers in the first quarter and AT&T, the second-largest carrier, added 1.2 million new subscribers during the same period.
 Mr. Hesse said despite the losses he was pleased with the company's efforts to re-establish the brand, which includes making improvements to the customer care response times and overall experience. 
 In addition, Mr. Hesse said was buoyed by the popularity of devices like the Kindle, Amazon.com's wireless e-book device, which is powered by Sprint's EV-DO network.
 The company, based in Overland Park, Kan., reported a net loss of $594 million, or 21 cents a share, in the first quarter. A year ago, the company lost $505 million, or 18 cents a share. The company also said it recorded a $327 million charge for severance and other exit costs associated with its announcement in January to eliminate 8,000 jobs to help cut costs.
 Sprint's revenue for the quarter was $8.21 billion, down from $9.3 billion a year earlier. 
 Mr. Hesse was also optimistic about the addition of a touch-screen device from Palm, called the Pre, which he said was still scheduled for release during the first half of the year. Sprint hopes the sleek smartphone will help the company attract new subscribers and compete with rival offerings like the iPhone and BlackBerry Storm.
 ''When you have the best handset you don't have to worry about people leaving to get another handset,'' Mr. Hesse said. ''It's a big part of our plan moving forward.''
 Investors seemed to be cheered on by the earnings news, sending Sprint's stock up nearly 13 percent after the announcement. It closed up 33 cents at $5.
 ''Just like the broader economy, there's just enough green shoots to be optimistic,'' said Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, referring to Sprint's slowing loss of its customer base. 
 But he cautioned against congratulating the company too quickly. 
 ''If there's a dark cloud to the silver lining, it's that Sprint is trading higher-value postpaid subscribers for lower-value prepaid subscribers,'' Mr. Moffett said. ''It might make it difficult for Sprint to restore profitability if their customers are all prepaid.''
 And there's still plenty of competition for prepaid subscribers from companies like MetroPCS and Leap Wireless International's Cricket, he said. 
 Nonetheless, he praised the beleaguered company's efforts, such as adopting cost-cutting measures, to reverse its fallen fortune.
 ''Sprint has taken some good first steps,'' Mr. Moffett said. ''But they're still a long way from exiting the tunnel.''

HEADLINE: Advances by the Taliban Sharpen U.S. Concerns

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER; Reporting was contributed by Helene Cooper, David D. Kirkpatrick, Mark Mazzetti and Eric Schmitt.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, said Monday that he was ''gravely concerned'' about Taliban advances in Pakistan and Afghanistan, as President Obama prepared for meetings here this week with President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan in an atmosphere of crisis.
 Recent militant gains in Pakistan have so alarmed the White House that the national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones, described the situation as ''one of the very most serious problems we face.'' Pakistan, he said Monday, ''has to survive as a democratic nation.'' 
 There were new signs of uneasiness on Capitol Hill about United States involvement in the region. The Democratic chairman of the House Appropriations Committee pronounced himself as ''very doubtful'' that Mr. Obama's plan for Afghanistan and Pakistan could succeed. The chairman, Representative David Obey, of Wisconsin, said he would allow only one year for the White House to show concrete results, and repeatedly likened Mr. Obama's approach to President Richard Nixon's plans for Vietnam in 1969.
 Mr. Obama is under pressure not only to defuse a sometimes-hostile relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan, but also to show some progress against extremists from the Taliban and Al Qaeda who are using Pakistan as a staging area for attacks on American troops in Afghanistan. The meetings in Washington will also include President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan. 
 American officials say that the gains by Taliban militants in Pakistan threaten the existence of Mr. Zardari's government and also endanger American interests in the region and security at home.
 Administration officials, who spent part of Monday in a National Security Council meeting, sought to temper recent sharp criticism of Mr. Zardari as they completed their preparations for the meeting on Wednesday. 
 ''It's a week to be positive publicly, to not stir up a hornet's nest,'' said a Defense Department official who has been involved in the planning for the meetings.
 ''There's been a lot of mistrust between us and the Pakistanis,'' the official said, speaking anonymously to discuss internal deliberations.
 Mr. Zardari comes to Washington with one major item on the top of his agenda: getting the Obama administration to turn on the funding spigot to begin the flow of hundreds of millions of dollars of military and development aid to his government. 
 Pakistani officials said that the White House had done little to use American aid to shore up Mr. Zardari's support base, and have said that Washington was far more supportive of Pakistan when it was run by a military dictator, Pervez Musharraf, than it has been since a civilian government took over in Islamabad.
 Between 2001 and 2008, the Bush administration sent more than $10 billion in economic and military aid to Pakistan. According to a senior Pakistani official who did not want to be identified discussing Pakistan's strategy ahead of the meeting, the flow of funds has largely dried up since the middle of last year. Islamabad is still waiting for Washington to reimburse the Pakistani government for $1.5 billion it has spent in military operations against militants, the official said.
 President Obama has given support to an economic aid package of $7.5 billion over five years, but he faces sharp opposition from Mr. Obey and others who are seeking to put strict conditions on aid to Islamabad. 
 Mr. Obey, whose committee oversees all federal discretionary spending, said Monday that in the supplemental war-funding bill the House Democrats plan to require the White House to report to Congress next year with measurements of progress from Afghanistan and Iraq in five specific areas: political consensus, government corruption, counterinsurgency efforts, intelligence cooperation and border security. 
 And he hinted strongly that he would move to cut off funds if the progress was not robust. ''I am not going to be looking at those standards like I am the permanent president of the optimists' club,'' Mr. Obey said.
 Although administration officials have reached out recently to Mr. Zardari's chief rival, Nawaz Sharif, they said Monday that they had not given up on Mr. Zardari. 
 ''We aren't distancing from Zardari,'' Richard C. Holbrooke, the special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, said in a telephone interview. ''If we were, why would President Obama invite him to Washington this week?''
 Mr. Holbrooke acknowledged that he and other administration officials were in contact with Mr. Sharif, but only, he said, because Mr. Sharif was the chief opposition leader.
 ''We do of course want to have a close relationship with Nawaz Sharif and his brother,'' Mr. Holbrooke said, referring to Shahbaz Sharif, the powerful chief minister of Punjab Province. 
 For their part, Pakistani officials said they intended to portray Mr. Sharif during the meetings this week as beholden to the government of Saudi Arabia and someone the United States would have difficulty working with. 
 ''The Americans have no leverage over Sharif, only the Saudis have leverage over Sharif,'' said the Pakistani official.

HEADLINE: Resume: G.O.P. Job: In Cabinet. Role: Odd Jobs.

BYLINE: By MARK LEIBOVICH

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Ray LaHood, the secretary of transportation, is not one to toot his own horn over how much he knows about planes, trains and automobile bailouts. On the contrary.
 ''I don't think they picked me because they thought I'd be that great a transportation person,'' Mr. LaHood says with refreshing indifference as to how this admission might play if, say, he were ever to bungle a bridge collapse. 
 Yes, transportation is Mr. LaHood's day job, a post that a few days ago required him to attend a groundbreaking ceremony for a highway in New Hampshire, speak to a group about the dangers of tailgating trucks and discuss ''bird strikes'' on CNN.
 But one of the astonishing things about Mr. LaHood, 63, is how limited his transportation resume is, how little excitement he exudes on the subject (other than about high-speed rail) and how little he seems to care who knows it. So why exactly did President Obama pick this former seven-term Republican congressman from Illinois to oversee everything that moves? 
 Mr. LaHood posits a theory. ''They picked me because of the bipartisan thing,'' he explained, ''and the Congressional thing, and the friendship thing.''
 The ''bipartisan thing'' and the ''Congressional thing'' are self-evident: Mr. LaHood is a Republican with close ties to Capitol Hill. One White House insider described Mr. LaHood as ''a master of odd jobs,'' whose knowledge of Washington allows him to take on assignments as varied as lobbying lawmakers on the budget and helping political novices in the cabinet navigate Beltway social rituals (''cocktail situations,'' as Energy Secretary Steven Chu calls them).
 ''The friendship thing'' perhaps most explains why Mr. LaHood is in his job. The White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, is one of Mr. LaHood's closest friends, and wanted him around. Mr. Obama told Mr. LaHood as much when Mr. LaHood interviewed for the job in December.
 Four months later, here is Mr. LaHood, smiling broadly in his sprawling office, sipping a ''healthy'' Frappuccino lunch (''healthy because it will keep me awake this afternoon''). Behind his desk hangs a photograph of Mr. Obama adjusting Mr. LaHood's neckwear (inscribed: ''This isn't the House, straighten your tie'').
 As transportation secretary, Mr. LaHood leads an agency with 56,000 employees, a $70 billion budget and a huge barrel of economic stimulus money. While that gives him some influence inside the cabinet, his bond with Mr. Emanuel, his former House colleague from Illinois, most likely gives him more.
 ''There's the chain of command that you would draw up on the org chart, and the chain of command as it actually happens,'' explains Christopher Lu, the White House liaison to the cabinet departments. Mr. LaHood talks regularly on the phone with Mr. Emanuel and eats dinner with him once a week. And he unabashedly plays his Rahm card when it suits his infighting purposes.
 A few weeks ago, for example, Mr. LaHood was in Arizona to announce a $36 million light-rail train project when someone from the White House Office of Management and Budget called and tried to halt the event, saying the project might not be eligible for stimulus money. Mr. LaHood called the budget director, Peter R. Orszag, to complain, but the matter only dragged on.
 ''That's when I called Rahm,'' Mr. LaHood said. ''And that took care of it.''
 While Mr. LaHood once sat on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, he was not generally considered an expert on transportation issues. (He has said he would be just as happy to have been named secretary of agriculture.)
 Mr. LaHood describes himself as highly interested about issues relating to high-speed rail, and he has been a cheerleader for the administration's ''green'' transportation initiatives, like bicycle paths and streetcars. But vehicles are only a small part of his portfolio. ''Yes, he's secretary of transportation, but he's kind of our ambassador at large,'' Mr. Emanuel said in an interview.
 This primarily means ''ambassador at large'' to Capitol Hill, especially Republicans.
 One of only two Republicans in the cabinet (Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates is the other, though he is not formally registered as one), Mr. LaHood was assigned to lobby 20 House Republicans on the economic stimulus package. None voted for the measure, an outcome Mr. LaHood calls ''a personal failing.'' But his former Republican colleagues say his inclusion in the cabinet -- and near-constant presence on the Hill -- have helped foster bipartisan good will. 
 ''I don't think anyone looks at him as a traitor or anything,'' said Representative Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican who is one of Mr. LaHood's closest friends in Congress.
 Mr. LaHood's odd jobs also extend to dirty work. After Senator Judd Gregg, a New Hampshire Republican, withdrew from consideration as secretary of commerce, Mr. LaHood volunteered on MSNBC that Mr. Gregg had repeatedly approached White House officials seeking the job -- an assertion that led to a tense confrontation between Mr. LaHood and Mr. Gregg at the White House a few days later. 
 ''I don't appreciate you impugning my motives,'' Mr. Gregg told Mr. LaHood, according to Mr. LaHood. Administration officials have said that the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, suggested Mr. Gregg for the job and that Mr. Gregg followed up with multiple calls and e-mail messages. Mr. Gregg, who has previously told reporters he did not ''campaign'' for the job, declined to comment for this article. 
 During his 14 years in the House, Mr. LaHood would alternately toe the Republican line (presiding over President Bill Clinton's impeachment proceedings) and buck it (opposing former Speaker Newt Gingrich's Contract With America). In the White House, Mr. Chu describes Mr. LaHood, a former junior high school social studies teacher, as a source of ''fatherly advice'' for Washington newcomers like himself. 
 One ''cocktail situation'' occurred recently at the annual Gridiron Club dinner. Mr. LaHood was seated at the head table near Mr. Chu, and between Arne Duncan and Timothy F. Geithner, the education and Treasury secretaries. The men asked Mr. LaHood if they could flee the dinner before the interminable speechifying ended. No, Mr. LaHood counseled.
 ''I said, 'Look, you're window dressing,' '' Mr. LaHood said. '' 'You're more of a prop. But it's part of what we have to do.' '' Mr. Chu and Mr. Duncan heeded the advice; Mr. Geithner did not.
 Friends of Mr. LaHood said it was unlikely he would ever take a public position that contradicted Mr. Obama's, despite his willingness to defy his party's leaders in Congress. ''People understand the business,'' said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma. ''You take the king's shilling, you become the king's man.''
 When asked if he could foresee disagreeing with the administration on anything, Mr. LaHood shrugged, and eventually shook his head. ''I've never been passionate about any particular issue,'' he said. ''I'm not going to sit around agonizing. The answer is, probably not.''
 By the same token, Mr. LaHood said he was deeply disappointed with his party. ''It has to be for more than just tax cuts,'' he said. Buthe has no plans to follow Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania onto the Republican exit ramp. 
 ''I am a Republican,'' Mr. LaHood said. ''It's too late for that kind of thing.''

HEADLINE: Chrysler and Fiat Have Hopes for Happy Relationship

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC and NELSON D. SCHWARTZ. 
Bill Vlasic reported from Detroit, and Nelson D. Schwartz from Paris.

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
When Daimler-Benz merged with Chrysler in 1998, their leaders told the world to ''expect the extraordinary'' from the German-American auto giant.
 The expectations for Chrysler's newly minted alliance with the Italian automaker Fiat are much less grandiose.
 And partly because of its more modest promises, the Fiat-Chrysler alliance may ultimately become the success that DaimlerChrysler never was. 
 Automotive mergers and alliances have a poor track record and seldom yield lasting results. A long list of deals soured because of cultural differences and an inability to meld product lines and deliver on promises to cut costs.
 Daimler acquired Chrysler to augment its own line of Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, not to integrate their operations and products. That merger ended badly in 2007, when the German parent could no longer tolerate the losses of its American division, and sold Chrysler off to the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management.
 By contrast, Fiat and Chrysler both sell into the mass market, though with vehicles of starkly different sizes. They hope to build on their similarities, and save money in the process by sharing purchasing, engineering and distribution.
 ''Our goal since we first entered discussions with Chrysler nearly a year ago is to leverage the strengths of both companies to yield the scale, efficiencies and cost savings necessary to create two stronger automakers,'' Sergio Marchionne, Fiat's chief executive, said last week.
 Mr. Marchionne is eager to add the European operations of General Motors to the mix as well.
 But first, he must avoid the same mistakes that derailed the DaimlerChrysler deal.
 The German leaders of that combined company -- first Jurgen E. Schrempp and then Dieter Zetsche -- refused to tear down the walls that separated Chrysler from Mercedes. Instead, they tried to run Chrysler as a stand-alone division and failed to take advantage of opportunities to develop vehicles together.
 Fiat executives say there is no comparison to their alliance. ''For Daimler to buy Chrysler was like Neiman Marcus merging with Home Depot,'' said one Fiat executive, who insisted on anonymity because of company policy. ''They are a mass carmaker, and we are a mass carmaker,'' he said of Fiat and Chrysler. ''We know this market better.''
 Fiat and Chrysler have much to offer each other. Chrysler desperately needs Fiat's small cars and fuel-efficient engines to balance an aging lineup of S.U.V.'s.
 For Fiat, Chrysler offers an instant dealership network for its return to the United States. They can also benefit from savings on the $46 billion worth of parts and materials they would buy as a combined entity.
 Chrysler's prospects are far worse now than when Robert Eaton, then its chairman, sold the company to Daimler. In the late 1990s, Chrysler was enormously profitable and determined to grow in tandem with Daimler.
 Now Chrysler is bankrupt, and Fiat is its only hope. 
 Since it was sold in 2007, Chrysler has pursued a merger, alliance or joint ventures with several automakers, including G.M., Volkswagen, Toyota, Honda, Nissan and Hyundai, according to documents filed in the company's bankruptcy case in New York.
 None of the overtures worked, including a last-ditch attempt in February to drum up interest from Chinese automakers in Chrysler's assets and product lines.
 ''Despite continual efforts over the course of approximately two and a half years, no party except Fiat has emerged as a viable and willing alliance partner for us,'' Thomas LaSorda, a Chrysler vice chairman, said in a court affidavit.
 From the first discussions between Mr. LaSorda and Mr. Marchionne in March 2008, it was clear that the interests of the two companies were well aligned. 
 ''The two companies were ideally matched,'' Mr. LaSorda said in his affidavit. He added that joining with Fiat would ''solve strategic problems that Chrysler has been wrestling with for years.''
 Under Daimler's control, Chrysler lost its knack for reading consumer tastes and delivering timely products, like the original minivan and its first Jeep Grand Cherokee. An Italian union leader, Giorgio Airaudo, said that Fiat did not operate that way.
 ''The German managerial system is more rigid, hierarchical,'' Mr. Airaudo said. Mr. Marchionne has vowed not to stifle Chrysler's designers and engineers, or overwhelm its executives with demands from Italy.
 ''The mentality of Chrysler is closer to the Italians,'' said Ferdinand Dudenhoffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research in Gelsenkirchen, Germany.
 Mr. Dudenhoffer said that DaimlerChrysler was crippled by the endless committees that Mr. Schrempp and others favored in the decision-making process. ''All they did was find arguments about why thing wouldn't work,'' he said.
 Fiat also will not be taking over Chrysler from top to bottom as Daimler did upon acquiring it in a $36 billion stock deal.
 Initially, Fiat will have only a 20 percent stake in Chrysler, although it can increase its ownership to 35 percent by meeting benchmarks set by the Treasury Department.
 And Mr. Marchionne has signaled that he will see Chrysler facilities himself before making changes to plants and products. 
 ''Over the coming weeks and months, I will be spending a great deal of time meeting with Chrysler employees and touring its facilities,'' he said.
 Experts in Italy said it was unlikely that Fiat would succumb to the overconfidence that Daimler exhibited when it took over Chrysler.
 ''In this unforeseeable situation for the world economy, everybody is under pressure to be humble,'' said Mario Monti, president of Bocconi University in Milan. ''They shouldn't have inferiority complexes either.''

HEADLINE: Step Right Up, It's Time to Play 'Name That Flu'!

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
What does swine flu have in common with the American International Group (and, no, this has nothing to do with accusations that executives at the troubled financial giant were being piggy with their bonus money)? For that matter, what do A.I.G. and the flu share with global warming and No Child Left Behind?
 All of them have what a shrink might describe as image issues. And in each instance, a favored solution seems to be to give the problem a new name, and just hope for the best. 
 Take swine flu, which turned up in pockets of New York City. Confirmed cases, however, have been mild. At St. Francis Preparatory, a Queens school where some students became ill, officials felt confident enough to reopen on Monday after a week's shutdown.
 The illness is called swine flu because scientists say that most of its genetic material comes from viruses that infect pigs. But the name makes some bureaucratic types queasy. ''Swine flu'' sounds awful. The World Health Organization asks everyone to call the disease by its scientific name: A(H1N1).
 But A(H1N1), in addition to sounding like an affliction peculiar to R2D2, does not exactly trip lightly off the tongue. A W.H.O. spokeswoman acknowledged as much the other day, suggesting that we all try to come up with a more ''user friendly'' name. We could even have a competition, she said.
 Oh goody, we like game shows. How about ''Name that Flu''? We'll get the ball rolling. Let's try Animals with Cloven Hooves Odious Outbreak -- ACHOO, for short. Anyone can remember that.
 (We also recommend that new flu cases in New York be put under quarantine in the sections of Yankee Stadium that the team avariciously tried to sell for $2,500 a seat per game. You can sit in splendid isolation there.)
 The American International Group, the New York-headquartered company that is now 80 percent owned by taxpayers, also sees a name change as an answered prayer.
 Two months ago it rechristened its big insurance unit as American International Underwriters. That tweaking apparently did little good. Company executives say further rebranding is now needed, but they have yet to say what it might be. Wary taxpayers can only hope that it isn't something like American International Undertakers.
 Similarly, the education secretary, Arne Duncan, has said that the No Child Left Behind law could do with a new name. No change has been announced. Presumably, the secretary is not considering a truly reality-based name -- something along the lines of, say, the We're So Desperate In Our Schools That We'll Do Anything Act.
 As for global warming, a marketing company in Washington was reported the other day as having concluded that the very phrase ''global warming'' was a turnoff for many people. Better, it advised, to talk about ''our deteriorating atmosphere.'' Right. Words like ''our deteriorating atmosphere'' aren't going to scare anyone half to death.
 These efforts are the latest in a long tradition of slapping new labels on problems in the risible belief that things will get better as a result.
 Decades ago, someone decided that people without a dime in their pocket wouldn't feel so bad about being poor if they were described as ''disadvantaged.'' And poverty-stricken countries, we've been led to believe, do better when they are called ''developing nations.''
 Lost your job? The company didn't fire you; it laid you off. The economy isn't shrinking; it's experiencing ''negative growth.'' When American soldiers accidentally kill their buddies, it is called ''friendly fire.'' Horses that go lame are ''euthanized.'' Prisons morphed long ago into ''correctional facilities.'' Pouring water over a terror suspect to make him fear he will drown is called ''waterboarding''; it sounds like something they might do off the Malibu coast. Also, don't call it torture. It is an ''enhanced interrogation technique.''
 The list could go on. Nor is the euphemizing confined to this city or this country. One of my favorites was a phrase used by Emperor Hirohito of Japan to describe his country's brutal occupation of Korea from 1910 to 1945. The emperor referred to it 25 years ago as ''an unfortunate past.'' Quite.
 In much the same way, the efforts under way now to rename swine flu and the others amount to little more than trying to put lipstick on a pig.
 Oops. After the uproar over that phrase in the last presidential election, are we allowed to use it?

HEADLINE: Former Basketball Star Wins Short Term as Detroit Mayor

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Voters on Tuesday elected Dave Bing, a former Detroit Pistons basketball star who had never run for political office, as the city's next mayor.
Mr. Bing, the longtime owner of a local auto parts business, will serve the final eight months of former Mayor Kwame M. Kilpatrick's second term. Mr. Kilpatrick resigned in September, when he pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and agreed to serve three months in jail for attempting, as part of an $8.4 million lawsuit settlement, to cover up an extramarital affair with his chief of staff. 
Mr. Bing, 65, narrowly defeated the interim mayor, Kenneth V. Cockrel Jr., who will return to his previous position as City Council president for the rest of the year. Mr. Bing received 52 percent of the vote to 47 percent for Mr. Cockrel.
Mr. Bing is expected to be sworn in next week.
He will have to begin campaigning to keep his job almost immediately. The regularly scheduled election, for a four-year term, is in November, and the filing deadline for the August nonpartisan primary is next Tuesday. Mr. Cockrel is expected to be among those trying to unseat Mr. Bing in the fall.
Mr. Bing enters City Hall during an economic crisis that has left Detroit with one of the nation's highest unemployment rates. He campaigned heavily on his experience as a business owner in Detroit and lack of ties to the city's previous administration.
Stricken, Mayor Loses Race
JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- The indicted mayor of Mississippi's largest city lost his bid for re-election Tuesday in a contentious Democratic primary that came a week before his second federal trial. The mayor, Frank Melton, was taken from his home in an ambulance late Tuesday, before final results were known,
The Mr. Melton, 60, who has a history of heart problems, faced nine Democratic challengers in the city's primary. Unofficial results show he came in fourth.
A second trial was set to start next week for Mr. Melton and a former bodyguard, who each face federal civil rights charges related to a sledgehammer attack on a duplex on Aug. 26, 2006, that Mr. Melton said was a crackhouse. A judge declared a mistrial in the first case in February after a jury failed to reach a verdict.
Harvey Johnson, the former mayor Mr. Melton unseated in 2005, and city Councilman Marshand Crisler advanced to a May 19 runoff.

HEADLINE: Rent Board Proposes Increases Despite the Complaints of Tenants

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
The board that oversees rents for New York City's one million rent-stabilized apartments proposed a range of rent increases on Tuesday, disappointing tenants and their supporters, who say the recession warrants a rent freeze.
 In a preliminary vote, the city's Rent Guidelines Board proposed increases of 2 percent to 4.5 percent for one-year leases and 4 percent to 7.5 percent for two-year leases. Last year, the board approved its highest set of rent increases since 1989 -- 4.5 percent on one-year leases and 8.5 percent on two-year leases. The board will hold two public hearings, on June 15 and June 17; it is to take a final vote at a meeting June 23.
 Landlords have argued that the board's rent increases in recent years have been outpaced by the rising operating costs of rent-stabilized units. Tenants and some elected officials, meanwhile, have called on the nine-member board to freeze rents for rent-stabilized units, citing rising unemployment, falling median household incomes and growing numbers of tenants in housing court facing eviction for nonpayment of rent. 
 ''This would be an appropriate year to do that,'' Wasim Lone, a tenant organizer with the nonprofit group Good Old Lower East Side, said of the rent freeze. ''This is the worst recession we've seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.''
 A report released last month by the board's staff found that operating costs for rent-stabilized buildings increased 4 percent from April 2008 to last month; the increase was 7.8 percent in the corresponding period in 2007-8. The report also found that the 4 percent increase was offset by decreases in fuel oil and insurance costs. 
 The City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, said in an interview that she would urge the board to impose a rent freeze, in part because of the impact of the recession on tenants as well as the report showing that operating costs had not risen significantly. ''We can create some relief for tenants without creating an unfair burden for landlords,'' Ms. Quinn said. ''We believe even with a rent freeze, landlords would continue to make a profit. They would just make a smaller profit.'' 
 Since the board was established in 1969, it has never approved a rent decrease or a rent freeze.
 Joseph Strasburg, president of the Rent Stabilization Association, which represents thousands of owners of rent-stabilized apartments, said he was disappointed by the preliminary range of increases approved on Tuesday, adding that small property owners had been hard-hit by the economy and had struggled to pay property taxes, water and sewer bills and fuel costs. He said the group was opposed to any rent freeze. 
 ''Ten percent of my membership may not survive by this time next year,'' Mr. Strasburg said, referring to small property owners. ''We discovered in early fall that they were still paying off their winter fuel bills.'' 
 The final vote last year was a rowdy affair, marked by shouting matches between landlords and tenants, many of whom had sneaked in plastic whistles and blew them at ear-ringing volume during the proceedings. In contrast, the meeting on Tuesday at the Great Hall at Cooper Union in the East Village was sparsely attended. The audience numbered about 100, most of them tenants or tenant organizers.
 The meeting gave rise to divergent views on who was suffering the most during tight economic times -- tenants or landlords. Steven J. Schleider, a member of the Rent Guidelines Board who represents owners, said that 1 in 10 properties was distressed because rents did not cover expenses. Adriene L. Holder, a board member representing tenants, said the severity of the recession, including rising unemployment, called for the board to adopt no rent increase. 
 ''People cannot shoulder these types of increases being proposed,'' Ms. Holder said. 
 Last year, the board approved a controversial supplemental rent increase for tenants who had lived in their units for six years or more, and a range of similar increases were approved on Tuesday. Owners of buildings with those tenants have the option of charging them the approved increases, or a $20 to $45 monthly increase for one-year leases or $40 to $75 for two-year leases, whichever is greater. 
 Two legal aid groups, the Legal Aid Society and Legal Services NYC, sued the board over the supplemental increase last year; the case is pending.
 On Tuesday, to the howls of the tenants in the audience, the board voted 6-to-3 to approve the range of proposed increases and the range of supplemental increases. 
 Much of the discussion between board members leading up to the vote centered on last year's deliberations. Tenants and their supporters last year said that the supplemental increase should not have been voted on, because it was not part of the tentative range of increases the board had previously approved. The board's chairman, Marvin Markus, said at the time that the board had authorized supplemental increases in previous years and that the board's actions were within the law.

HEADLINE: As Investors Circle Ailing Banks, Fed Sets Limits

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON

DATELINE: CAINSVILLE, Mo. 

 BODY:
No one seems to want to own a business in this dusty, windswept corner of rural America, population 370, with its crumbling sidewalks and boarded-up storefronts. 
 Except, that is, for J. Christopher Flowers, a media-shy New York billionaire who last year bought the First National Bank of Cainesville, one of the United States' smallest national banks.
 Mr. Flowers, a private equity manager, has no particular love for rural Missouri; in fact, he has never set foot in Cainsville. Rather, he wants to use the national bank charter he picked up in this farm town to go on a nationwide buying spree.
 With that charter in hand, Mr. Flowers plans to take over a handful of large struggling banks, casualties of the economic crisis. In some cases, he hopes, the federal government will help. 
 But Mr. Flowers, whose investments in banks overseas have made him one of the richest men in America, has run into a major obstacle in the United States: the Federal Reserve, and its very notion of what a bank should be. 
 The Fed does not mind if private equity firms have a minority interest in banks -- the Obama administration even wants them to invest. But the Fed will not let them take control, a stance the firms are lobbying regulators mightily to change, especially given that stress test results to be released Thursday are expected to show a glaring need for capital in the banking system. 
 It's not personal, Fed officials say. It's just that as the nation recovers from one of the worst banking crises in history, the Federal Reserve wants to make sure that it does not set the stage for the next financial implosion by turning banks over to private equity firms, some of the riskiest players in the business world.
 So while Mr. Flowers was able to buy the bank here with his own money, he cannot tap into the billions his firm, J. C. Flowers & Company, has raised. 
 How this battle -- and others being fought in the aftermath of the economic crisis -- plays out will help determine the future shape of the financial industry.
 For all the talk of the banking crisis, Mr. Flowers and other giant private equity players are circling distressed banks around the country, competing to buy into the industry. Bidding wars are now breaking out among private equity firms, including the Carlyle Group, which is going up against Mr. Flowers's firm for a stake in BankUnited of Florida. 
 They and other investors see banks as the recession's biggest prize: potential money machines that could one day generate fabulous returns, particularly after the federal government eats the losses of failed banks, then heavily subsidizes their sale. But like Mr. Flowers, some of them would prefer to take over the banks completely, replace their managements and take all the profit.
 ''I don't think the Republic is going to be brought to its knees if private equity owns banks, personally,'' Mr. Flowers said from his Midtown Manhattan office with its expansive views of Central Park. ''We invest around the world -- Japan, Germany, England, no problem.''
 The Fed is resisting this pitch, for several reasons. Current law prohibits mixing banking and commerce, based on a fear that if industrialists own banks, they will dominate -- and try to manipulate -- the economy, as they did during the early-20th-century heyday of John Pierpont Morgan.
 The government also wants the ability to stabilize a teetering bank by drawing on the funds of its parent company. That is hard to do with private equity firms, which have numerous businesses owned by funds, each of which is walled off to protect investors.
 For these reasons, banks generally cannot be owned by nonfinancial companies like the Carlyle Group, whose assets are as varied as an interest in Dunkin' Donuts and United Defense Industries, a maker of combat vehicles and missile launchers.
 The equity firms counter that banking desperately needs cash if the economy is going to recover, and that they are the only big sources of money around. An executive at the Carlyle Group said the industry had an estimated $400 billion in ''dry powder,'' or ready-to-invest reserves. 
 To push their case at the White House, the Treasury and the Fed, Mr. Flowers and others in his industry have enlisted an all-star cast of advisers, lobbyists and lawyers. They include H. Rodgin Cohen, chairman of the Sullivan & Cromwell law firm and Wall Street eminence grise, and Randal K. Quarles, a managing director of the Carlyle Group and a Treasury under secretary in the administration of President George W. Bush. Part of their strategy, Mr. Flowers said, is to persuade the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, to pressure the Fed to back down.
 ''Chris is obviously a get-it-done type of person -- and he wants to get this done,'' said Mr. Cohen, who represents Mr. Flowers. ''He believes, as I do, that it is unfortunate to deprive the banking system in the United States of this key source of capital.''
 While they press their case, the firms have found some ways around the rules.
 They have formed so-called club deals, in which teams of private equity firms and other investors each buy up to the legal limit of a bank -- about a quarter or a third, depending on the type of bank -- with their individual pieces adding up to 100 percent control. IndyMac, the failed California bank, was sold by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation last fall to one such club, which includes funds controlled by Mr. Flowers; the hedge fund billionaires George Soros and John Paulson; and Michael S. Dell, founder of the Dell computer company. The investors are barred from acting in concert to, in effect, take control of the bank -- an unwieldy arrangement but one that regulators insist they can enforce. 
 As part of the IndyMac deal, the F.D.I.C. agreed to take most of the risk from future losses on loans acquired by the partnership -- leading Mr. Flowers to quip at one investor forum in New York in January that ''the government has all the downside and we have all the upside.''
 Mr. Flowers has come up with another way around the restrictions. There is no limit on an individual's taking over a bank, so he purchased all of the First National Bank of Cainesville in his own name and with his own funds. But that deprives him of the billions his equity firm has set aside to buy banks, so his new bank sits in this tiny town, waiting for a change in the rules. 
 First National -- whose second story is boarded up and whose $17 million in assets are worth about a third of what Mr. Flowers paid for an Upper East Side town house in 2006 -- seems an unlikely launching pad for a new American banking empire.
 It is so tradition-minded that it refused to change the spelling of its name, even after the town did so back in 1925 to honor its founder, Peter Cain.
 Suddenly, in February, the First National Bank name was dropped and ''Flowers Bank'' was painted on the window. New bank executives showed up, passing out packs of promotional sunflower seeds with the bank's new logo, urging the mostly elderly town residents to get ready to ''Grow with Us.'' 
 ''Everyone wonders, who is this Flowers guy?'' said Lefty McLain, as he finished up the ham, mashed potatoes and butter beans lunch special at the Little Store, an all-in-one restaurant, deli, pool hall and gossip post here in the one-block downtown. 
 Mr. Flowers, while still in his 20s, founded Goldman Sachs's financial services merger business, helping line up the $62 billion merger of NationsBank and BankAmerica (now Bank of America) and the $34 billion takeover of Wells Fargo by Norwest.
 By 1998, he had left Goldman to start his own business, focusing at first overseas, with the 2000 purchase from the Japanese government of the failed Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, which was renamed Shinsei Bank, its name meaning ''new life.'' 
 Mr. Flowers, now 51, made a sizable chunk of his fortune when he and his partners took the bank public four years later. But the deal left some in Japan steaming, as they wondered how an American businessman could make such an enormous profit when the government was never repaid most of the trillions of yen it had spent bailing out the failed bank. The bank is now in trouble again, from investments in subprime mortgages that went sour and exposure to Lehman Brothers, which went bankrupt.
 His holding in Hypo Real Estate in Germany is also suffering because of bad real estate investments, even after Mr. Flowers and Shinsei poured money into it. German regulators are threatening to take over Hypo and force Mr. Flowers out.
 These kinds of high-risk investments make United States banking officials nervous, though Mr. Flowers points out, accurately, that many Japanese banks are struggling, not just Shinsei. 
 The private equity firms are pitching to regulators a way to let them take control of banks while respecting banking traditions. Essentially, they would separate the entities -- they call them silos -- that buy the banks, walling off their other private equity investments from any newly created bank holding company. 
 Fed officials will not speak about banks for the record, but they have told the firms that they view the silo concept as little more than a subterfuge.
 Mr. Flowers and other executives have lobbied hard; their efforts have included a recent meeting with William C. Dudley, chairman of the New York Fed. At the meeting, Mr. Flowers and his colleagues bragged about how they could raise as much as $10 billion in 48 hours to help with a bank takeover if they were given the chance, according to one executive in attendance.
 Mr. Flowers, in an interview, said he was confident he would prevail. Even if he cannot make the Fed reverse its policy, he will consider it a victory if the Fed approves an individual deal.
 He has estimated his banking empire will one day earn at least a 35 percent return on banks it has bought in the United States. ''I find it to be an extraordinary time to invest,'' he said.
 He was even more blunt when he spoke to an industry group in New York earlier this year. ''Lowlife grave dancers like me will make a fortune,'' he predicted.

HEADLINE: King Cotton's Fall

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: GREENWOOD, Miss. 

 BODY:
Cotton is no longer king of the Mississippi Delta.
 Farmers working land that has bloomed a dazzling snowy white every September since before the Civil War are switching to corn and soybeans. As gleaming silver corn silos go up on farm after farm, cotton gins are laying off workers or shutting down.
 ''We're closer than we've ever been to looking like Iowa,'' said Danny Hargett, a veteran farmer who has decided for the first time not to grow any cotton this year on his 3,000 acres of fertile, well-irrigated land. ''It was extremely hard for me to make this decision, but the economics have made it almost impossible to make cotton a profitable crop.'' 
 The most immediate cause of King Cotton's decline is that people around the world are buying less clothing and home furnishings. Global cotton production and consumption are dropping, and the Agriculture Department expects the nation's exports to fall by $1.2 billion this year.
 Cotton growers have seen hard times before, of course. As with other commodities, prices and acreage have gone up and down on economic cycles. But cotton farmers and farm economists say they have never seen a downturn quite like this, one that started during the global boom and has quickened in the recession.
 The Agriculture Department estimates that 8.8 million acres of cotton will be planted in the United States this year, down 7 percent from 2008 and 42 percent from 2006. 
 It will be the lowest cotton acreage since 1983, an anomalous year when farmers cut acreage after a string of bountiful harvests that created a surplus.
 Nowhere has the slump been greater than in Mississippi, where farmers decreased their cotton planting to 365,000 acres in 2008, from 1.2 million acres in 2006. A survey suggested that could fall to 268,000 acres this year. 
 Meanwhile, the number of gins in the state has dropped to 71, from 89 in 2006, said Darrin Dodds, an extension service agronomist at Mississippi State University, who predicts this year, ''we may lose a few more.'' 
 Cotton acreage has been declining in Mississippi for decades, but it remained the crop of choice for many farmers in the Delta, the fertile region in the northwestern part of the state, where the Mississippi and Yazoo Rivers share a flood plain.
 Not everyone is likely to feel nostalgia for a crop long associated with abject work conditions and low wages. Though a source of wealth, cotton was also a source of back-breaking work for slaves and sharecroppers, and later for poor farm laborers.
 Early in the 20th century, the travail of picking cotton in the blazing Delta sun was a touchstone theme for the blues musicians of the region. Later, mechanization in the cotton fields contributed to several waves of black migration from the South to industrial cities of the North, and to high rates of unemployment for those left behind. These days, cotton is rarely picked by hand -- machines do the work. 
 Cotton's cultural roots are still on display around Greenwood, where visitors are welcomed by a sign proclaiming it ''Cotton capital of the world.'' Some people plead with farmers to keep planting cotton beside the roads, considering it prettier than other crops, and fearing that corn stalks will obstruct drivers' vision on curved roads.
 ''It's a funny sense, a different sense, not seeing the cotton crop,'' said Mike Sturdivant Jr., a farmer who has cut his cotton crop to 2,400 acres this year, from 4,900 in 2007. ''I don't like it.'' 
 The rapid slump of cotton in the United States has been influenced by numerous factors, including weather and the plummeting fortunes of the American textile industry. But lately, the most important factor has been the declining profitability of cotton farming, in contrast to the rising profitability of corn and soybean farming.
 Poor canola harvests in Europe and dietary changes in several countries produced a world shortage of vegetable oil, pushing up the price of soybeans, which are crushed for their oil. Meanwhile, as middle classes grew in China, India and other developing countries, demand for feed grains grew, and world corn prices rose.
 ''Globalization has dethroned King Cotton without question, not only in Mississippi, but throughout the South and the United States,'' said O. A. Cleveland, professor emeritus of agricultural economics at Mississippi State. 
 Expanding federal mandates for ethanol prompted farmers to plant more corn to keep up with its growing role as an energy feedstock. Also, new corn strains have made the crop more practical in Mississippi's hot climate.
 Since 2003, cotton prices have declined nearly 23 percent, while prices for soybeans are up more than 38 percent and corn nearly 65 percent. Cotton surpluses have been stacking up around the globe in part because of rising yields from genetically modified cotton seeds and other technological improvements.
 Those trends are leaving farmers and cotton gin owners feeling pessimistic.
 With the textile mills that make clothes ''leaving the country to where the labor is cheaper, it's not very smart to think we can grow the commodity here so they can make a shirt in China,'' said Walter Reese Pillow IV. He followed in the footsteps of his father, grandfather and great-grandfather in growing cotton -- until 2006, when he and his family converted their cotton fields to corn and soybeans.
 ''The prospects for cotton coming back here are about as good as the mills coming back to South Carolina,'' Mr. Pillow said.
 Jason Colquett, owner of the Crossroads Gin, said his plant ginned 33,000 bales of cotton in 2006, 24,000 in 2007 and 15,000 in 2008. He does not expect to reach 10,000 this year. That has meant a loss of jobs, as it has at other gins across the state. Mr. Colquett's repair crew has dropped to four full-time workers, from nine, and his ginning season has been reduced to 30 days, from 90.
 ''I can imagine Mississippi without cotton gins,'' Mr. Colquett said. ''It's not a pretty picture.''

HEADLINE: Already Ill, Texan Dies After Getting Swine Flu

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN and SHARON OTTERMAN. 
Elisabeth Malkin reported from Mexico City and Sharon Otterman from New York. Reporting was contributed by Laura Tillman; Andrew Jacobs from Beijing; Anahad O'Connor, Gardiner Harris and Donald G. McNeil Jr. from New York; Marc Lacey from Mexico City and Alan Cowell from Paris.

 BODY:
The first American has died after contracting the swine flu virus, Texas health officials said Tuesday. Officials did not identify the 33-year-old Texas woman but added that she suffered from an unnamed pre-existing medical condition.
 The health of the woman, a schoolteacher who lived in Harlingen, near the border with Mexico, was worsened by the H1N1 flu virus, said Leonel Lopez, the Cameron County Department of Health and Human Services epidemiologist. Mr. Lopez said that the woman had recently given birth, and added that the baby was in good health.
''I don't want people to panic,'' Mr. Lopez said. ''Her death was a combination of a pre-existing health condition and the flu. The flu just made things worse.'' 
 The woman had been hospitalized with complications from the flu since April 14, and died earlier this week, said Doug McBride, a spokesman for the state health department. He said that other members of her family had undergone testing and none were known to have contracted the flu. 
 The woman's death came roughly a week after the first known swine-flu fatality in the United States, a Mexican toddler who died in a Houston hospital on April 27. Earlier on Tuesday, federal health officials said they expected that more cases of the disease, including some deaths, would come to light. 
 But while the virus, officially called influenza A(H1N1), has continued to spread across the United States and around the world, it is far less deadly than initially feared. In Mexico, where the outbreak apparently had its origins, new cases have begun to ebb, and President Felipe Calderon lowered the national alert level on Monday.
 Still, Mexico called off Cinco de Mayo celebrations on Tuesday, including the biggest -- a re-enactment of the May 5, 1862, victory over French troops in the central state of Puebla. The number of confirmed cases in Mexico now stands at 942 and 29 deaths, according to the Mexican authorities.
 The authorities have been seeking to strike a balance between the health risk of widespread shutdowns and the economic cost of keeping parts of the economy shuttered. In Mexico, the nationwide impact on industries, including tourism, has cost about $2.3 billion, or between 0.3 percent and 0.5 percent of gross domestic product, Finance Minister Agustin Carstens said Tuesday.
 ''We know that there could be a light or small increase in the number of cases, but we are also conscious of the importance of reactivating the economy and the return to normality of ordinary life for all Mexicans,'' Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova said Monday afternoon. 
 Instead of closing schools, he said, officials said parents should keep children showing any symptoms home, and teachers will keep a close eye on the health of students. But bars, nightclubs, cinemas and theaters, however, will remain closed until further notice. 
 Worldwide, health authorities are taking a variety of measures to try to limit the outbreak, as confirmed cases continue to rise.
 In Geneva on Tuesday, the World Health Organization said 1,490 cases had been confirmed in 21 countries, compared with 1,085 cases in the same number of countries a day earlier. The only confirmed deaths have been in Mexico and the United States, which is now reporting 403 confirmed cases in 38 states. Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said they believed the disease was not nearly as lethal or severe as they had initially thought it could be, and they recommended on Tuesday that schools with confirmed cases no longer shut their doors. 
 ''Closing schools is not effective'' in halting the spread of the virus, said Dr. Richard E. Besser, acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
 In Illinois, the number of confirmed infections rose more than tenfold in the space of 24 hours, climbing from eight cases on Monday to 82. New York continues to lead the tally, with 90 confirmed cases of H1N1 flu. There can be up to a week delay in confirming infections due to laboratory backlogs, experts say.
 Vigilance remains important because this is a new disease to which people have limited immunity and whose course remains uncertain, Dr. Keiji Fukuda, W.H.O.'s deputy director general, said in a Tuesday news conference. Pandemics, he said, can start out mild, and over the course of several months become a severe illness, as was the case during the devastating flu pandemic of 1918. 
 ''This is a situation that can evolve,'' Dr. Fukuda said. ''If it stays mild and people stay healthy, that's great. But if it does turn severe, this is something that we have to jump on.''
 To date, the majority of laboratory-confirmed infections, Dr. Fukuda said, have been occurring in people younger than 60, with the average age around the mid-20s, for still uncertain reasons. Males and females are getting infected at the same rate, he said. 
 The incubation period for the disease appears to be one to five days, nearly that of a seasonal flu virus. The new strain appears to be the same in confirmed cases around the world, and it remains responsive to two antiviral drugs, Tamilflu and Relenza, Dr. Fukuda said. It is still not clear in what percentage of cases the disease results in serious respiratory disease, he said. 
 In China, a Mexican airliner hop-scotched the country on Tuesday picking up 70 Mexican nationals who had have been quarantined by health authorities since the weekend, when a Mexican traveler arrived in Hong Kong and promptly tested positive for the virus. 
 In Shanghai, a squadron of police stood by as masked personnel in protective clothing directed passengers from their hotel into 27 ambulances, according to Xinhua, the state news agency. The plane was scheduled to pick up people in Beijing, Guangzhou and Hong Kong, although health officials said they would not allow the 25-year-old infected patient to leave the hospital, where he is in stabile condition.
 About 240 other guests will remain quarantined for three more days at the Metropark Hotel, where the man briefly stayed. 
 The Chinese government agreed to release those sequestered after Mexican officials criticized the measures as unreasonable and discriminatory, given that many of those who sent into isolation showed no signs of illness. Although many of those put in quarantine shared a flight with the sick patient, others were rounded up simply because they held Mexican passports.
 Also Tuesday, the U.S. Embassy said that four America citizens had been quarantined in China, although two of them had been released by the afternoon. Susan Stevenson, an embassy spokeswoman, said she could not provide more information about the others, one of whom was being quarantined in Beijing and the other in Shanghai. ''We would hope all the decisions were made on the basis of sound science,'' she said. 
 In Britain, the authorities began distributing leaflets to households on Tuesday regarding basic hygiene to ward off infection. Some 27 cases have been confirmed in Britain and five schools have been closed. Throughout Europe, 107 infections have been confirmed, the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control said. Most patients had recently traveled to Mexico, but 17 cases were transmitted person-to-person within Europe. Still, transmission between people in Europe remains limited, authorities said. 
 This is a more complete version of the story than appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Korean New Yorkers Hope for Council Seat in Queens, Their First

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

 BODY:
You hear it a lot these days among New York's Korean-Americans, a heady declaration of political entitlement: ''It's our time.''
 Korean-Americans number more than 132,000 in the state, according to the latest census figures, and have become a significant economic force in the New York region. Yet none have ever been elected to the New York City Council, the State Legislature or any statewide office.
 But now that John C. Liu, a Chinese-American who represents Flushing, Queens, on the City Council, is running for city comptroller, many Korean-American civic leaders and political operatives say this is the opportunity they have been waiting for. 
 Two Korean-American candidates have announced they will run for Mr. Liu's seat: S. J. Jung, a community organizer, and Ronald Kim, Gov. David A. Paterson's regional representative for Queens. A third, John Chou, Mr. Liu's chief of staff, said he might also jump into the fray, and there has been talk of still others. 
 The growing field mirrors the increasing visibility of Koreans -- not just in Mr. Liu's ethnically diverse district, where a Koreatown of restaurants, shops and other businesses thrives, but also across the region, where the contest is drawing interest and money from Korean-Americans. Chung-Wha Hong, executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition, said this could be ''a decisive moment'' in the political maturation of the Korean-American community. 
 ''They're exploding onto the scene,'' said Ms. Hong, who is Korean-American. ''I think the Council race is only one manifestation of that.'' (Ms. Hong has thrown her personal support behind Mr. Jung, though her organization is nonpartisan.) 
 For all the excitement, victory for a Korean-American candidate is far from guaranteed. With the primaries still more than four months away, the contest to succeed Mr. Liu in the overwhelmingly Democratic 20th Council District is already shaping up as one of the season's most dynamic and intriguing local races.
 The field is crowded. Three Chinese-Americans -- a community activist and former teacher, a Queens Democratic Party district leader, and a businessman who is the only Republican running so far -- have announced their candidacies, as have a Greek-American college student and a civic activist and retired cancer researcher of Sephardic Jewish heritage. 
 The ethnic diversity of the district, which covers a swath of northeast Queens, is reflected in the voice-mail greeting on Mr. Liu's office phone: ''Thanks for calling,'' Mr. Liu, who was born in Taiwan, says on the message. ''For English, press two; Spanish three.'' He then cycles through options in Korean, Chinese, Russian and Greek. 
 The Asian-American population in the district has grown rapidly over the last three decades, to more than half of the total population. Residents of Chinese descent are by far the largest ethnic group, composing about 32 percent of the population and outnumbering Korean-Americans by roughly 2.5 to 1, according to calculations by Andrew A. Beveridge, a Queens College demographer, based on the latest census statistics. 
 The election of Mr. Liu, in 2001, was hailed as a watershed for the Chinese-American community, which had long been shut out of the political mainstream. Mr. Liu, the only person of Asian descent ever to sit on the City Council, easily won re-election in 2003 and 2005. 
 The number of Korean-Americans in the district has actually declined slightly over the last decade, but the number in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut has increased by about 19 percent, according to census data. 
 Korean-American leaders say that larger community is now politically mature and organized enough to elevate one of its own.
 Ms. Hong said that in recent years, a variety of Korean-American advocacy groups around the region had become more politically active and sophisticated, learning how to mobilize their community and lobby elected officials on welfare and immigration matters. They have forged ties with more-established civil rights and immigrant rights groups. 
 Yonghwa Ha, president-elect of the Korean-American Association of Greater New York, said a record voter turnout in late March for the association's presidential elections reflected the increasing political participation of the community. In that election, more than 15,000 people voted in New York City and New Jersey. 
 Though anyone of Korean descent was eligible to vote, regardless of legal status, Mr. Ha said he hoped to harness that enthusiasm and register more Korean-American voters in time for the City Council election. ''I want that fever,'' he said. 
 Community leaders say Korean-American money from around the region has already been flowing into the candidates' campaigns in District 20.
 But political analysts say it is unlikely a candidate can win without cobbling together broad support spanning various ethnic and racial groups. According to Evan Stavisky, a Democratic political consultant who lives in the district, about 35 percent of the registered voters there are Asian-American, a roughly equal number are white, 20 percent are Latino and 10 percent are African-American. 
 ''In communities like Flushing, there's no one single group that's capable of delivering an election to their favorite son or daughter,'' Mr. Stavisky said. ''Instead, you not only must galvanize your own constituency but you need to be able to break through to other groups, putting aside any historic differences or tensions between the communities.'' 
 In interviews, some Korean-American candidates took pains to distance themselves from ethnic labels.
 ''I've been a bridge builder,'' said Mr. Jung, who showed up with a multiethnic, multidenominational group of supporters to celebrate his campaign's start in April. ''I've worked with diverse communities.'' 
 Mr. Kim, Governor Paterson's representative, said he was ''not just running as a Korean person.'' 
 ''I'm just a local kid from Queens,'' he said. ''I just want to represent the district and want to represent everybody in that district.''
 Still, they will have to win Korean votes. And community leaders intent on electing one of their own admit that the more Korean-Americans in the race, the less likely it is that any one will win enough of that natural base to prevail. Indeed, if the field still remains crowded come Primary Day, Sept. 8, the Korean-American community may well find that it has been too successful in spurring political involvement.
 ''If three Koreans come out, you have no chance,'' declared Fred Fu, a prominent Chinese-American member of the Flushing business community. ''When you say this is the year for a Korean, you say 'Korean,' not 'Koreans.' No 's!' '' 
 Few forces could break a logjam of candidates like an endorsement from Mr. Liu. The councilman said in an interview last Wednesday that he would probably ''weigh in,'' but would hold off until the roster of candidates crystallized, perhaps at the beginning of June. 
 ''It's definitely fever pitch among the Korean-American community to once again make history in Flushing,'' he said. ''The community is organized and galvanized.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 11, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about the political maturation of Korean-Americans in New York City misspelled the surname of Councilman John C. Liu's chief of staff, a Korean-American who is a possible candidate for the City Council, and misstated the date of primary elections in New York. The chief of staff is John Choe, not Chou, and the primaries will be held on Sept. 15, not Sept. 8.

HEADLINE: Who Is Hiring? Restaurants, Hospitals and Colleges

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: Everyone knows the grim news 

 BODY:
unemployment in the United States has jumped to 8.5 percent, a 25-year high, and is racing toward double digits. Since November, the nation has lost more than three million jobs. 
 But not everyone knows the brighter side to the equation: deep in the maw of the deepest recession since the Great Depression, millions are still being hired.
 So, while 4.8 million workers were laid off or chose to leave their jobs in February, employers across the country hired 4.3 million workers that month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
 ''The best thing you can say about these numbers is it speaks to the dynamism of the U.S. economy, and the net negative number that we all traffic in masks that,'' said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at ITG, a research and trading firm. ''Ninety out of 100 people who know the number -- 650,000 were lost in February -- think that means no one was hired and 650,000 were fired.'' 
 In February -- before the economy started to show the first faint signs of a possible recovery -- there were three million job openings nationwide. And despite large new job losses likely to be announced Friday, there are still millions of job openings. 
 Who is hiring? Hospitals, colleges, discount stores, restaurants and municipal public works departments. I.B.M. is hiring more than 700 people for its new technical services center in Dubuque, Iowa, while the Cleveland Clinic has 500 job openings, not just for nurses but also for pharmacy aides and physical therapists. And after President Obama's stimulus package kicks into gear, state, local governments and road-building contractors are expected to hire more. 
 Zachary Schaefer has hired 72 people since February for the Culver's hamburger and frozen custard restaurant that he and several partners just opened in Surprise, Ariz. 
 ''The amount of applicants who are qualified is definitely up,'' he said. ''Whereas before we were counting on a lot of high school applicants, now there are a lot more middle-age people applying.''
 Eddie Hamm, a former construction worker, was unemployed for five months when he drove by the site where the Culver's was under construction. Mr. Hamm, 29, applied for a job there, and now he's a ''fry guy.''
 ''I'm just happy I got hired -- I didn't want to stay home, not doing anything,'' he said, hardly complaining that he is earning half the $15 an hour he made in construction. ''I don't look at it like I'm making $7.50. I look at it -- I'm having a job in a down time, and it's a job where I can move up.''
 Economists and job counselors advise the unemployed that there are definitely jobs to be had, even if there aren't nearly enough to go around. With 13.2 million people out of work, there are 4 1/3 unemployed Americans for every job opening. ''You're facing more competition for every job you apply for, but the reality is there is a lot of hiring going on,'' said Andrew M. Sum, director of the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University. ''You're never going to find anything unless you apply.''
 Even industries that have taken a beating are doing plenty of hiring. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, construction companies hired 366,000 workers in February, and manufacturers hired 249,000. Retailers hired 536,000 workers in February, but that was down 25 percent from the previous February. 
 Some job openings are to replace retirees, some to replace employees who left for other jobs, but many openings result from expansion. Companies that are still growing are blessed with talented applicants. 
 ''It's easier to hire in a recession -- we have about five applications for every position,'' said Howard Glickberg, principal owner of Fairway Market, the well-known grocery company based in Manhattan. 
 Fairway just hired 350 people for its month-old store in Paramus, N.J., the first Fairway outside of New York State. The company plans to add 1,200 more workers over the next two years by opening stores in Queens; Pelham Manor, N.Y.; and Stamford, Conn. 
 ''What you have to be afraid of is hiring someone who can't find something better at the time, and when they find something better they leave you,'' Mr. Glickberg said. ''I want to hire someone who will make a career of it.'' 
 The nation's largest private-sector employer, Wal-Mart Stores, is also hiring aplenty. Wal-Mart, with 1.4 million workers nationwide, hires several hundred thousand workers each year because of employee turnover, and expects to increase its domestic work force by nearly 50,000 this year, thanks to plans to open 150 new stores.
 Shawnalyn Conner is running a hiring center for a Wal-Mart store that will open on June 17 in Weaverville, N.C., near Asheville. She plans to hire 350 workers.
 ''The biggest comment that we get from people is that they're looking for a company that's growing, and Wal-Mart offers that,'' said Ms. Conner, who, as the top manager of the new store, has hired 77 people so far. Gisel Ruiz, senior vice president for the people division of Wal-Mart U.S., said the company had a hiring program for former junior military officers, often for jobs as assistant store managers. With many veterans having a hard time landing jobs, Wal-Mart hired 150 former officers last year.
 The health care industry has held its own in hiring. The University of Miami medical school, which runs three hospitals, has 250 openings and is hiring about 35 people a month, compared with 100 a month in good times. Cleveland Clinic has 500 job openings, compared with 2,000 during better times. 
 ''We have a hiring freeze on, but even when there's a hiring freeze, we need to maintain our head count,'' said Joe Patrnchak , Cleveland Clinic's chief human resources officer. ''We have 40,000 people, and you're going to have some openings.''
 He is encountering an unusual snag in hiring people. ''A challenge we have now is people from other areas are having problems selling their homes,'' Mr. Patrnchak said. ''People aren't quite as mobile nowadays.''
 The University of Miami medical school is also facing an unexpected problem. ''There's a flood of applicants, but even so, it's harder to find really good, experienced people,'' said Paul Hudgins, its associate vice president for medical human resources. ''We're seeing people hunkering down and saying they're going to stay where they are.''
 The recession has encouraged people to cling to their jobs. Just 1.5 percent of workers voluntarily quit their jobs in February, the lowest level since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began collecting those numbers eight years ago. 
 Like many educational institutions, Washington University in St. Louis continues to hire. It has 175 job openings in admissions, residential life and other areas. There is a flood of job applicants, and Ann Prenatt, vice chancellor for human resources, said that has pros and cons, the advantage being that the university does not have to offer large premiums as often to draw coveted applicants.

HEADLINE: Global Financial Crisis Reduces Investments

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The International Olympic Committee said the global economic crisis had reduced its financial investments by $34 million. The fall in financial markets has sliced about 8 percent off the I.O.C.'s overall reserves of about $400 million since January 2008, Jacques Rogge, the I.O.C. president, said in an interview with the Web site insidethegames.com. The I.O.C. also said it could lose up to $4.8 million in the Ponzi scheme tied to the disgraced financier Bernard L. Madoff. 
 Darryl Seibel announced his resignation as the chief communications officer of the United States Olympic Committee. He is the fourth executive to leave the organization since the end of the Beijing Games. Seibel, 41, said he would leave June 5 to pursue new professional opportunities, but would offer consulting help on some projects. usoc

HEADLINE: Jack Kemp

BYLINE: By DOROTHY SAMUELS

 BODY:
By the time he retired from quarterbacking for the Buffalo Bills, in 1970, Jack Kemp had some impressive records, including the most completions and yards on passes in his league's history. His political career included 18 years in Congress, a stint as the first President Bush's secretary of housing and urban development, a 1996 run for vice president on Bob Dole's ticket, and a steadfast and influential promotion of that wishful Republican voodoo known as supply-side economics. 
 But what truly distinguished Mr. Kemp, who died last week at age 73, was his passionate and principled support of civil rights and of government's vital role in helping people out of poverty -- qualities that increasingly made him an outlier in the Republican Party.
 A self-styled ''bleeding heart conservative,'' Mr. Kemp came to understand the importance of respecting the rights of people, regardless of race, during his time playing football. ''I can't help but care about the rights of the people I used to shower with,'' he famously said.
 That caring led him to become an outspoken opponent of apartheid in South Africa, and to buck his party by endorsing economic sanctions against that country. His belief in affirmative action, and his generally tolerant views on immigration, including opposition to a 1994 California ballot initiative that denied public services like health care to illegal immigrants, greatly annoyed his party's right wing.
 He spent time getting to know inner-city neighborhoods and joined with Democrats to fight the Republican leadership's attempts to gut successful housing programs for the poor.
 To his credit, Mr. Kemp was also an early and vociferous supporter of giving the District of Columbia a voting representative in Congress. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District's nonvoting representative, worked closely with him on the issue. She says she's sure Mr. Kemp would have opposed the current Republican effort to tie the District's vote to a dangerous measure, backed by the National Rifle Association, to gut the city's gun regulations. 
 Why is she so sure? ''He was a civil rights man, through and through,'' she explains.

HEADLINE: A Reform School, Reborn

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH ABBOTT

DATELINE: CRANSTON, R.I. 

 BODY:
This suburb of Providence has not been spared the economic decline that has swept the rest of Rhode Island, where the unemployment rate, 10.5 percent, is one of the highest in the country. In this city of 80,000 people, home foreclosures have risen, and the bankrupt retailer Circuit City and other stores have closed in Garden City Center, Cranston's well-known shopping center.
 Despite this slide, however, one Rhode Island developer has been steadily plowing forward with a $90 million mixed-use project here. Carpionato Properties, based in nearby Johnston, is taking an unusual 30-acre site, where Rhode Island's reform school for boys once stood, and creating an outdoor shopping center called Chapel View, named for an 1891 stone chapel on the property. 
 When the project is completed this fall, it will feature 10 buildings with a total of 304,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space, 75,000 square feet of office space and 35 residential condominiums -- some carved out of the old stone dormitories that once housed wayward boys.
 At the junction of two of Cranston's busiest thoroughfares, Chapel View is notable not only for its unusual history, but also for a distinctive stone wall that the developer has built around half of the perimeter. That granite wall, made from stone on the site and measuring seven feet high in some places, cost $400,000, said K. MacArthur Coates, a senior vice president of Carpionato Properties.
 According to Mr. Coates, stone was incorporated into the project's design as an echo of the Gothic-style stone cottages at the Sockanosset Training School for Boys, which opened in the late 1800s. Carpionato Properties began buying pieces of the former training school in the mid-1990s, years after the state moved its delinquent boys elsewhere.
 The company's founder, Alfred Carpionato, a longtime Cranston resident, envisioned a retail-commercial development for the site, but at the time it was proposed, not everyone was happy with the plans. ''Some people thought it should be a city park,'' Mr. Coates recalled. 
 Others expressed concern that the project would worsen an already congested intersection of New London Avenue and Sockanosset Cross Road. 
 Still others did not want any of the seven stone dormitories to be torn down. On a Web site that tracks the fate of Rhode Island's old buildings, artinruins.com, dozens of people have posted memories of the ''Bad Boys School,'' as many Rhode Islanders called Sockanosset.
 ''I love these buildings,'' one man wrote. ''Echoes of my mother saying, 'If you're not good, I'm taking you to Sockanosset!' ring in my head every time I drive by.''
 The city of Cranston wanted a development that would do justice to the site's strategic location and contribute significantly to the tax base, said Kevin Flynn, who was the city's director of planning throughout Chapel View's long planning phase. At no time was serious consideration given to making the site a park, he said.
 The city pushed the developer to include office space in Chapel View. Carpionato added the residential component toward the end of the planning stage.
 Seven buildings have been completed and leased to tenants, including the outdoor retailer REI, a law firm, a Ted's Montana Grill and a supermarket. The three remaining buildings, including the chapel, which will become a restaurant, are expected to be completed in September. Businesses began moving in during 2005.
 The developer worked with Cranston's Historic District Commission, as well as state preservation officials, to respect the site's history, Mr. Coates said.
 Three of the old stone dormitories were restored and connected by new construction to form a three-story building with retailing on the first floor, offices on the second and condominiums on the top level.
 In addition, Carpionato has preserved the chapel, rebuilt an infirmary that was once attached to the chapel but was destroyed by fire, and protected a magnificent copper beech tree, which now has its own grassy bed in one of the parking areas.
 The buildings that were torn down could not be salvaged, Mr. Coates said.
 Chapel View is on a hill with sweeping views of Providence to the north and several Rhode Island communities to the east. According to Mr. Coates, the project has been a labor of love for Mr. Carpionato, who started his career at a teenager buying triple-decker wooden houses in the Federal Hill neighborhood of Providence and now has one of the largest real estate management and development firms in the state.
 The company's portfolio includes two hotels in Rhode Island, numerous shopping centers with a total of 1.3 million square feet of retail space, 500 apartments and 2,000 units of housing for the elderly and handicapped. ''Have we been hit by the recession? Of course,'' Mr. Coates said.
 He noted the recent closing of a Bombay Company store, which had leased 45,000 square feet in Chapel View, as well as a certain ''skittishness'' on the part of prospective tenants. ''No one is immune from the market,'' Mr. Coates said.
 But because of the project's location and the fact that Rhode Island's retail sector is not seen as overbuilt, ''we're very confident about Chapel View,'' he said.
 The Training School at Sockanosset was part of a ''state farm,'' which included an asylum for the insane, an adult prison and a state almshouse. Its dormitory cottages were built in 1881 to 1895 and featured rubblestone walls, brownstone quoins and arched windows. 
 A report by the Rhode Island Historical Preservation and Heritage Commission said, ''Although in disrepair, the buildings at Sockanosset, beautifully sited on spacious grounds behind a stone wall, are among the finest 19th-century institutional buildings in the state.''
 Carpionato razed three of the old dormitories to construct Chapel View. When the decision was made to let a private developer buy the property, Rhode Island did not yet have a historic tax credit program that would have helped a developer offset the cost of rehabilitating the cottages, noted Edward Sanderson, executive director of the historical commission. Nor was the former school listed on any register of historic places.
 It would have been preferable to preserve all of the old buildings, he said, but at that time it was probably unrealistic.

HEADLINE: Hawks Are Doing Just Fine Without Childress

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK

 BODY:
The surprise defection of Josh Childress to Greece last summer prompted two knee-jerk conclusions. One was that a wave of talented N.B.A. players would follow Childress's lead. The second was that Childress's departure would stifle the Atlanta Hawks' progress. 
 The evidence to date suggests both assumptions were wrong.
 About a dozen players left the N.B.A. for foreign teams last summer, but most were nominal role players, and one (Nenad Krstic) has already returned. It remains to be seen whether the trend will grow this summer.
 But there can no longer be any question about Atlanta's wisdom in letting Childress walk.
 The Hawks won 47 games this season, a 10-win improvement over 2007-8, when Childress was their savvy, versatile sixth man. On Sunday, Atlanta won its first playoff series in 10 years, beating the Miami Heat.
 In all likelihood, the Hawks will be quickly eliminated by Cleveland in the second round. But they made a big leap forward this season without Childress, illustrating once more that smart spending is as critical to N.B.A. success as anything else.
 Childress reportedly wanted $10 million a year from the Hawks. He balked at Atlanta's final offer -- $33 million over five years -- and instead took a three-year, $32.5 million deal with the Greek team Olympiacos. 
 The Hawks replaced Childress with two players: the veterans Mo Evans and Flip Murray. Both are playing major roles. Together, they made $4 million this season -- about $2.6 million less than the Hawks would have paid Childress, and $6 million less than he demanded.
 ''Sure, we lost Chills, which was I thought a tremendous loss at the time,'' Coach Mike Woodson said this week, ''but Mo and Flip, they haven't missed a beat.''
 It is a lesson worth considering for free-agent role players -- who may not be as indispensable as they think -- and for general managers -- who annually overspend on nonstars.
 Consider the case of James Posey, who left Boston last summer to take a more lucrative offer from New Orleans. The Hornets, viewing Posey as the missing piece to a title run, gave him a four-year, $25 million deal to become their sixth man. But he made little impact, and the Hornets were bounced in the first round of the playoffs.
 Perhaps the Celtics miss Posey's contributions. But just as critical is that they failed to sign anyone worthwhile to replace him on the bench.
 Posey signed for the so-called midlevel exception, about $5.6 million, or the equivalent of the average N.B.A. salary. There is a frighteningly long list of average-salaried players who have become payroll albatrosses in recent years, including Jared Jeffries and Jerome James (both signed by the Knicks), Brian Cardinal (Memphis), Marcus Banks (Phoenix), Nazr Mohammed (Charlotte), Tim Thomas (Los Angeles Clippers), Marko Jaric (Minnesota), Dan Gadzuric (Milwaukee), Mikki Moore (Sacramento), Luke Walton (Los Angeles Lakers), Mickael Pietrus and Tony Battie (Orlando), and DeSagana Diop (Dallas).
 General managers may be forced to spend conservatively this summer because of the poor economy. They may also do well to consider the lesson provided by the Hawks.

HEADLINE: Equipment Crackdown Brings More Turmoil To Cycling's Time Trials

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

 BODY:
Professional cycling is in a heated struggle among its governing body, its teams and the companies that manufacture expensive equipment over what is a legal racing bike.
 The International Cycling Union abruptly alerted teams at the start of this season that it intends to clarify and reinterpret its often oblique rules governing bicycle design through increased equipment inspections.
 The announcement was an unwelcome surprise. Bicycles and accessories may be banned within weeks. That could leave teams scrambling to find new bikes for top riders, and the manufacturers could find it harder to sell their merchandise. 
 ''When I initially looked at it, I wasn't too worried,'' said Phil White, a co-founder of Cervelo, a Toronto-based bicycle manufacturer, which also sponsors a European professional team. ''But now I'm quite concerned. This could be quite crushing.''
 The crackdown and the renewed debate over bicycle design are not entirely unwelcome. Some prominent cyclists say that recent advances made possible by new materials and manufacturing techniques may be unfairly penalizing teams that have limited access to the latest technologies.
 The cycling union first told teams about its plans through a warning letter sent in January, after the teams had accepted delivery of their bikes for the season. A month later, in the middle of the Tour of California, cycling union officials said that they would begin banning equipment immediately, although they backed down after protests. Now, the cycling group's president, Pat McQuaid, said components must comply with standards by July 1, which means after the Giro d'Italia, which starts Saturday, but before the Tour de France. Enforcement of other standards, however, would not begin until next year.
 Exactly why the cycling union decided to raise the issue without giving notice is unclear. McQuaid said the warning letter came out of discussions at the end of 2008.
 ''We decided to bring both the sport and the manufacturers back to reality,'' McQuaid said from his office in Switzerland. ''The sport needs to be a sport of athletic ability, not technical ability.''
 The dispute largely involves bicycles and parts designed for time trials, the individual race against the clock. Because time trial rules ban drafting, aerodynamics are thought to significantly boost a rider's speed. During the off-season, well-financed teams use tests in wind tunnels to evaluate bicycles and to optimize riders' positions. What emerges are expensive and exotic bicycles.
 The cycling union has long banned the use of anything intended to cheat the air. But the increasing use of carbon-fiber reinforced plastic resins, which can be shaped into a variety of forms, during the 1990s created new issues. In the '90s, the British cyclists Chris Boardman and Graeme Obree broke the distance record for one hour -- the sport's gold standard -- using bicycles with unusual designs and aerodynamic riding positions. Obree broke the record twice, on two bicycles he built himself (one used bearings from a washing machine), only for his designs to be banned later by the cycling union. In ''The Flying Scotsman,'' a 2006 film based on Obree's life, the role of the villain is played by officials from a thinly disguised International Cycling Union.
 In 2000, new rules included requiring bicycles be the traditional diamond shape and not weigh less than 6.8 kilograms (about 15 pounds). But another rule is more ambiguous, referring to ''a fuselage form,'' which the cycling union defines as an ''extension or a streamlining of a section.'' Whatever that may be, it cannot have a ratio that exceeds three to one. (For comparison, traditional bicycle tubing is round and has a ratio of one to one.)
 Until January, manufacturers assumed the rule covered only the individual sections of a bicycle frame and went to great lengths to increase that ratio without breaking the rule, or so they thought. Giant, Scott and Felt make time-trial bicycles with elongated front ends for better aerodynamics. But in a bid to stay within the ratio, those bikes connect the forks and handlebars to the rest of the frame in unusual and complex arrangements. On its Web site, Felt asserts, ''Our design created an effective airfoil shape with approximately a 6:1 aspect ratio, that is still U.C.I. legal because it does not rely on a fairing-instant speed.'' U.C.I. are the cycling union's initials in French.
 In an interview, Jim Felt, the founder of Felt, an American company, said he was still confident the bicycle would pass inspection. Giant, however, had doubts and redesigned it. The biggest surprise for the industry was the announcement that all the parts of a bicycle would be under the ratio rule. Many handlebars and some cranks greatly exceed the limit. Cervelo's White said that many of his company's seat posts also violated the rule.
 White was initially unconcerned because most of Cervelo's customers do not race or they compete in triathlons, which are not governed by the cycling union. But he said that when a clip-on handlebar extension was banned for road-racing bikes in 2000, the popular product's market evaporated. 
 Even recreational cyclists, White said, shun products once they are banned for professional use. That, combined with the current recession, he said, could ruin some companies.
 ''I am sometimes a bit surprised by the way things work in the industry,'' said Rene Wiertz, a former electronics executive who owns 3T Cycling, a major handlebar maker based in Italy. ''Doing things like this is pretty arrogant.''
 Some riders say they would like to see not only stricter enforcement but also more restrictive rules for time-trial bikes.
 Marco Pinotti, the current Italian national time-trial champion who rides for Team Columbia-Highroad, acknowledges the special equipment has benefited him, but he also says that it gives an unfair advantage to teams with large budgets for wind-tunnel testing and sophisticated equipment.
 He favors forcing riders to use conventional bicycles without aerodynamic handlebars or wheels for time trials. That is unlikely to find favor with bike makers, who rely on time-trail bicycles to generate publicity -- and sales.
 Pinotti's American teammate, Craig Lewis, agreed, saying in an e-mail message: ''It was first named the race of truth for a reason. Now it's just a race between the biggest budgets.''

HEADLINE: Inquiry Panel on the Economy Nears a Vote

BYLINE: By KATE PHILLIPS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Congress will take a major step on Wednesday toward creating an independent panel with sweeping powers to investigate the root causes of the economic crisis. 
 The House is expected to vote in support of a commission modeled on the Sept. 11 panel, which was made up of former lawmakers and former administration officials who used subpoena powers to investigate lapses in intelligence gathering and law enforcement that had led to the attacks. 
 Backed by the Democratic leadership with some Republican support, the House provision closely tracks a Senate measure already approved. The panel would probably have 10 members, most appointed by the leadership in both chambers. 
 Lawmakers said the panel would tackle issues including oversight of Wall Street banks, regulatory agencies and an investors' bill of rights. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and others have based the panel on the Sept. 11 commission and the Pecora commission in the 1930s. 
 That earlier commission was named for Ferdinand Pecora, the investigative counsel for a Senate committee during the Depression whose work contributed to the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and provisions in the Glass-Steagall Act, which separated investment and commercial banks. 
 Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California, welcomed the panel's creation as a way to restrain legislation that might otherwise be rushed. ''The commission is the best reason to force a slowdown of those things which are not emergency measures,'' Mr. Issa said.

HEADLINE: Novel Use of Stimulus Money Incites Soul-Searching in Akron

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

DATELINE: AKRON, Ohio 

 BODY:
Its official name, the one on maps and signs, is the All-America Bridge. Most people here call it the Y Bridge, though, for the way it forks as it enters downtown. But so many people have jumped off since it was built 28 years ago that it sometimes goes by a less-welcome nickname: the Suicide Bridge.
 Now the City of Akron has decided to do something about it, and it is tapping an unusual source: the federal stimulus money. Ohio plans to use more than a million dollars of it to build a fence to keep people from jumping to their deaths in the Little Cuyahoga River valley below. 
 In doing so, the city has prompted a sometimes emotional conversation about suicide and mental illness, government spending, and Akron's image and future as it continues to remake itself and adjust to a new economy without the thousands of tire manufacturing jobs that once led people to call this the Rubber Capital of the World.
 There has already been one suicide off the bridge this year, and there have been 28 since 1997, according to the Summit County medical examiner's office. The police are called to the bridge to try to save would-be jumpers roughly once a week. 
 The county's suicide rate is not out of line with the state's or the nation's, and only a small percentage of people who kill themselves here use the bridge. But mental health officials say the All-America Bridge has become a ''magnet bridge'': one with a reputation for suicides, therefore drawing more troubled people to try to jump off of it. 
 ''I think that for a community to have, and I'm going to use this word, an icon that represents suicide, and then not to take some action, do something -- we'd really look like an uncaring community,'' said Mayor Donald L. Plusquellic, who has been in office 22 years, during which the city's downtown has been revived with a giant new library, a baseball stadium, a convention center and, most recently, a strikingly modern addition to the Akron Art Museum. ''That is not what our image should be out there.''
 But the plan for a fence has long been opposed by people who question its cost, complain that it would block the sweeping views or worry that people will simply find other ways to kill themselves. And now that the city has found federal stimulus money to pay for it, instead of local dollars, some are debating whether the money should be used to save lives or save jobs.
 Some callers on local talk radio have criticized the fence as a waste of money, as have some comments on the Web site of The Akron Beacon Journal, which has written editorials in favor of the fence. And the proposal has political ramifications. 
 The mayor, who suffered a setback last year with the defeat of his proposal to create a college scholarship for Akron students with money that would have been raised by privatizing the city's sewer system, is now fighting a recall effort. He said an automated phone call made to local residents by one group pushing for his removal from office questioned why he wanted to spend federal stimulus money on the fence instead of other worthwhile projects.
 Many people in this city of just over 200,000 have stories about the bridge. The City Council president, Marco S. Sommerville, said he once pulled a man threatening to jump to safety. Hazel Morton, 81, who has lived in the valley since 1952, long before the current bridge was built, said that every six months or so bodies would fall into her neighborhood. 
 ''I kind of got discouraged from so many people jumping off,'' she said. 
 The debate over the fence has gone on for years. In 2000, a protester calling for a fence used to sit in her wheelchair by the foot of the bridge and hold up a sign that asked ''Y let them jump?'' 
 Later, as studies showed that fences at other bridges were effective at preventing suicides, and questioned whether people actually did go on to kill themselves in other ways, mental health advocates here began calling for a fence. Newspaper articles and a student documentary film have been devoted to the subject. 
 Robert and Carolyn Conley, two Akron schoolteachers, said they never thought much about the bridge until 2006, when their son, Kevin -- who had been an A student, a wrestler, a practical joker and a compelling Macduff in a school production of ''Macbeth'' -- jumped off the bridge at the age of 20. Kevin, whom the couple adopted from Korea when he was 2, ''lost his way'' at 16, they said.
 As the Conleys drove to his funeral, which drew more than a thousand people, they passed a sign at a restaurant. ''It said, 'In honor of Kevin Conley, fence the bridge,' '' recalled Mrs. Conley, 60, who teaches first grade. 
 A year and a half later, Mr. Conley, 59, who teaches middle school, said they were ready to begin publicly advocating for a fence. 
 Mr. Plusquellic said he became convinced several years ago that a fence was needed not just to prevent suicides, but also to protect the people in the neighborhood below from falling bodies. He tried in vain for several years to secure a federal earmark to build a fence. Then the stimulus bill passed. 
 Akron plans to spend the biggest share of its federal transportation money, $8 million, improving the roads and infrastructure around a new Bridgestone-Firestone complex. It intends to spend $7.5 million rehabilitating the All-America Bridge, of which $1 million to $1.5 million is likely to go to the fence, depending on the design. 
 Larry Parker, 74, who runs a Web site that questions city spending, sponsored the telephone calls questioning the decision to spend stimulus money on the fence. ''It's not going to create any more jobs,'' Mr. Parker said.
 He added that he knew the problem firsthand: the roof of a shed on property he owns under the bridge still has a hole made by a jumper.
 Other states are using stimulus money for safety projects, including wider lanes and guard rails. But the fence here has struck a nerve. When the state agreed to it, State Representative Brian G. Williams, Democrat of Akron, recalled in a speech in the Statehouse how, as the city's schools superintendent, he once looked out his office window and saw a man jump off the bridge. 
 ''I mentioned that some of these projects are actually going to save lives,'' he said later.

HEADLINE: Drugs Hollow Out Lives In Shell of Cultural Center

BYLINE: By DEXTER FILKINS

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
The men, hollow-eyed and matted, start coming at dawn, shuffling into the remains of the old Soviet Cultural Center, which in its day staged films celebrating the glories of a new era.
 These days, the shell of the abandoned building serves as perhaps the world's largest gathering spot for men looking to satisfy their lust for heroin and opium. Stooping in the darkened caverns of the place, amid the waste and exhalations of hundreds of others, the men partake of the drug that has begun to wreak its deathly magic in the very country where it is produced.
 One such man, who called himself Mohammed Ofzal, struck a match beneath a piece of foil and sucked in the blue smoke that rose from the liquefying little mass. Then he sat back in a crouch, legs shaking a little. His eyes, glazed and half-shut, stared blankly at the floor. 
 ''My parents are fed up with me; they are telling me to quit,'' Mr. Ofzal said. He said he was 18. His clothes, unlike nearly everyone else's in the gathering post, were pressed and clean. He said he would go home soon; he would not be spending the night. ''If you don't take care of yourself, you could die here.''
 Around him were a hundred other men, some crouching, some collapsed, some unconscious; some, perhaps, were dead. The visitors, though not the denizens, covered their faces from the smell. Mr. Ofzal lit another match and bent down to drink in the smoke.
 Afghanistan, the world's largest producer of opium, is drowning in a sea of its own making. While the country's narco-traffickers ship vast quantities of the stuff to Europe and the United States, enough of it stays behind to offer a cheap and easy temptation to the people at home. A United Nations survey taken four years ago revealed 200,000 opium and heroin addicts in a population of about 35 million; a new study, to be completed in the summer, is expected to show even more.
 Addiction in Afghanistan is rising along with the country's opium production, which is cranking at something close to fever pitch. With much of its society and many of its institutions ruined by 30 years of fighting, Afghanistan produces more than 90 percent of the world's opium. The money earned from narcotics accounts for more than half of the country's gross domestic product. It feeds the Taliban insurgency.
 The Soviet Culture Center is the most public of arenas in which to view the trade's depredations on ordinary people. (For the men, that is; the center, like virtually every other public place in Afghanistan, is strictly segregated by sex.) The building sits in the Dehamatzang neighborhood of western Kabul, the scene of ferocious and prolonged fighting during the civil war that engulfed the country in the 1990s. The exterior walls are crumbled and pockmarked with bullet holes.
 Inside is a landscape of extraordinary human wreckage. The rooms resemble catacombs; lightless and fetid and crammed with dozens, even hundreds, of bodies, each one clinging to his bit of space, his bit of elixir. Clouds of blue smoke rise, linger and dissolve. Almost no one speaks. In a corner, a man, seated on the floor, offers candy and cigarettes. In an ordinary day, 2,000 men pass through here. That's on top of the nearly 600 who never leave. ''Did you bring any money?'' one of the men asked, as hunched and withered as a gargoyle.
 ''No,'' said another, slipping his friend a tiny packet.
 Next to them a body slumped in an improbable pose -- curled, stiff, yet balanced, delicately, as if on the head of a pin. After a time the body fell over, as frozen as before. No one looked up.
 Men and boys are not the only people who have fallen prey to the drug; women and girls are merely harder to find. Typically, females, prohibited from wandering the streets, stay indoors, which mitigates their helplessness but shields them from help.
 A woman named Aziza, for instance, lives at home with her six children, who range in age from 18 months to 21. Aziza, who like many Afghans has only one name, is a gaunt and reduced figure, possibly beautiful once, but now a woman of papery skin and sunken cheeks and eyes sunk deep in her skull. For Aziza, as for many here, smoking opium is a way to escape a life without hope.
 Two years ago, Aziza's husband died in a car accident, and with no way of supporting her family on her own -- women in this deeply conservative society do not generally work outside the home -- she fell into despair. One day, a friend offered her a pipe and opium. She took it. Since then, Aziza has been smoking two or three times a day, sometimes in front of her children.
 ''Opium has been a good friend to me; it has taken away my sorrows,'' Aziza said, seated in the corner of her one-room house, with her children looking on.
 Kabul contains a tiny handful of clinics that treat drug abuse, but they have nowhere near the capacity to treat the number of people in need. About six months ago, the counselors from one clinic, alerted by the neighbors, found Aziza in her home and invited her to the clinic. Aziza stayed for 24 hours.
 ''When I need it, it is a kind of an attack,'' she said afterward. ''I can't resist the opium; it is stronger than I am.''
 With her children standing by, Aziza reached into a cloth bag and produced a filthy spoon, a bit of powder and a straw. Her 6-year-old son, Mirwais, stood to his mother's left, 10-year-old Sonia stood to her right. Aziza, eyes glazed, struck a match but could produce no spark. She tried again and failed. Finally, Sonia took the box from her mother's hands, struck a flame and handed the match to her mother.
 Aziza bent over and breathed in the blue smoke.

HEADLINE: Shovel-Ready, but Investor-Deprived

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
For more than three years, Roger Brandt, a Rochester developer of housing for people with low incomes, has been planning the second phase of his Union Meadows project in suburban Chili (rhymes with mai tai).
 He hopes to build 42 apartments in a town home style, with brick veneer facades and vinyl siding, and rent them to people earning as little as $25,000 a year. The first phase, with 48 units, was completed in 1998 and has a waiting list of 234 families.
 In January, New York State awarded Union Meadows low-income housing tax credits, giving Mr. Brandt access to the equity he needed to make the $8.4 million project feasible. (To generate equity, developers sell the tax credits to corporations seeking to offset profits.)
 But then last month, KeyCorp, the Cleveland financial institution that had agreed to buy the tax credits, backed out of Mr. Brandt's project. The bank also disclosed that it had lost nearly $488 million in the first three months of the year. 
 KeyCorp's withdrawal left Mr. Brandt, president of Rochester's Cornerstone Group, scrambling for a replacement. ''We've been dialing for dollars,'' said Mr. Brandt, who has built 877 units of rent-restricted housing over the last two decades. In most of his projects, the monthly rent for a two-bedroom apartment is about $575 a month, compared with about $850 for a market-rate apartment, he said.
 Mr. Brandt's experience is being mirrored throughout the nation, demonstrating the shortcomings of a financing vehicle that was conceived more than two decades ago to inject market discipline into the development of income-restricted housing. The theory was that investors would support only those projects likely to be successful.
 Many developers are finding themselves either unable to sell tax credits that they have been awarded or short millions of dollars because the price that investors are willing to pay for a tax credit has tumbled from $1 or more to less than 75 cents today. 
 Today, the total amount of tax credit equity available for low-income housing has shrunk to $4 billion to $4.5 billion, down from about $9 billion in 2007, Frederick H. Copeman, the national director of tax credit investment advisory services at Ernst & Young, said in an interview in his Boston office. 
 In New York State, some 16 affordable housing projects that were awarded tax credits by the Division of Housing and Community Renewal have yet to find buyers, the agency said. In Michigan, state officials say that of 59 proposed developments that were awarded this type of tax credits last year, they know of only two deals that have been completed, though the actual number may be slightly higher.
 ''Every deal is struggling,'' said Deborah VanAmerongen, the New York State housing commissioner. Last year, developers of five projects turned in their tax credits after they could not find investors, she said. And yet, applications for the tax credits have increased 20 percent statewide (and have doubled in New York City), she said.
 Two temporary remedies were included in the stimulus package passed by Congress. The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development will give the states $2.25 billion to distribute to developers to fill the gap left by falling tax credit prices. A second program will allow the states to exchange unused tax credits for cash from the federal government.
 Allocated by the federal government since 1987, tax credits are awarded by the states to projects that meet strict requirements and are used by investors to reduce their federal income tax over a 10-year period.
 Initially, the program drew a variety of investors, including companies like Chevron and Berkshire Hathaway. More recently, the program has mainly attracted financial institutions, which often use the credits to fulfill their obligations under the Community Reinvestment Act to invest in poorer neighborhoods where they have customers. 
 Until last year, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac acquired 30 percent or more of the tax credits. But as their losses piled up, these agencies stopped buying credits, as did many other troubled financial institutions, including Citigroup, another big player.
 Some of the remaining investors are reluctant to back projects outside major urban areas, fearing that these developments will face increased competition now that market-rate rents have slipped. The tax credits are forfeited if a foreclosure occurs, and cost overruns cannot be passed on to tenants.
 ''Basic market forces are at work here,'' said William Traylor, the president of Richman Housing Resources, a syndication company affiliated with the Richman Group, that operates in New York City. ''Investors are looking for strong real estate transactions in strong real estate markets.''
 Developments the size of Union Meadows in Rochester have also suffered because investors find it more economical to participate in a few large projects rather than a lot of smaller ones, industry specialists said.
 But despite the overbuilding that occurred during the housing boom, there remains a critical shortage of rental housing for low-income families and elderly people. Nationwide, about five million additional units are needed, Mr. Copeman said.
 ''This program at its peak efficiency creates 90,000 units a year, and more than that go out of service each year,'' said Mr. Copeman, 58. ''We're not going to overbuild affordable housing in my lifetime.''
 But he said that not long ago, the rent differential between market-rate and affordable housing in certain markets like Austin and Atlanta was as little as $25 a month, showing that sometimes projects are built when they are not needed. ''People took their eye off the ball when capital was easy to come by,'' he said. Still, he said, affordable housing remains one of the safest of all real estate investments, with a default rate of only 0.08 percent.
 Though the risk is minimal, tax credit investors now insist on financial guarantees from developers if the project runs into trouble, developers said. ''The requirements are much more onerous,'' said Robert Hoskins, president of the NuRock Companies, a developer in Alpharetta, Ga.
 In Framingham, Mass., outside Boston, a nonprofit organization, Jewish Community Housing for the Elderly, has been stymied in its efforts to break ground on a 150-unit mixed-income development on land it has owned since 2003. ''We have one investor we have received offers from,'' said Allan Isbitz, the vice president for real estate, who had hoped to begin construction last year. ''The offer has changed twice in the month that we have been negotiating with them. They want a lot of different risk reducers in the partnership agreement.''
 He said his project was particularly challenging because it fell under the type of program that included bond financing. These days, investors are shying away from putting more debt on their books, he said.
 New York City developers are also affected. Lemle & Wolff, a developer, won the right to build a mixed-income project on city land in the East Bronx. But with the decline in price of tax credits, the project is $3 million short of what it needs. ''Making the numbers work is very, very difficult,'' said Frank Anelante, the chief executive. 
 Last month, New York became the first state in the nation to allocate some of the $253 million in stimulus money intended to close the tax-credit financing gap, choosing nine projects deemed ''shovel ready.'' 
 The state is also working with a syndicator in Lansing, Mich., Great Lakes Capital Fund, that has created a fund to attract a new group of investors to projects upstate. 
 ''We think thereis an opportunity for new investors, who haven't been in the market recently,'' said James L. Logue, Great Lakes' chief operating officer. ''We're cautiously optimistic.''

HEADLINE: New Jersey Beckons Housewives' Next Series

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
Amid the expensive cars, sprawling houses, gilded interiors and gilded breasts featured in the first episode of ''The Real Housewives of New Jersey,'' which has its premiere on Bravo next Tuesday, there's at least one nod to economic distress. One of the housewives, Teresa Giudice, is shopping for what she calls ''French-chateau-look'' furniture. When the tally comes to $120,360 -- that covers one room's worth -- Ms. Giudice pulls out a stack of hundred-dollar bills. 
 ''I hear the economy's crashing, so that's why I pay cash,'' she says.
 Bravo's ''Real Housewives'' franchise, with its conspicuous consumption, may seem like the opposite of sensible, economy-conscious programming. But in the recession, this three-year-old series, chronicling the lives of rich women interested in clothes, Botox and pinot grigio, is more popular than ever. 
 The current season of ''The Real Housewives of New York City'' has had an average of 1.6 million viewers per episode, according to Nielsen, up about 50 percent from the first season. (The audience is small by network television standards, but larger than that of, say, AMC's ''Mad Men,'' which had an average of 1.5 million viewers last season.) The preview of the New Jersey version in early April was Bravo's highest-rated preview show ever, with 1.43 million. 
 ''Everyone likes to judge,'' said Jennifer O'Connell, executive vice president of Shed Media US, which produces the New York show. And Bravo makes that easy. Unlike most other reality shows, this one about ''housewives'' is not filmed on a set but during the women's actual lives. And the episodes rely on cutaway shots showing the reactions of the real-real people in the women's lives: the cringe of a child, the frown of a disapproving sales clerk, the sigh of an overworked nanny. The subjects may be rich, the shows suggest, but their lives aren't necessarily desirable. And that may be the most recession-conscious message of all. 
 Andy Cohen, senior vice president for original programming and development at Bravo, described those reaction shots as ''winks'' to the audience. ''I know more really, really smart people who watch these shows who are like, 'I'm embarrassed to admit it,' '' he said. ''That wink is also something that allows a lot of people to feel like it's O.K. to watch these women.''
 The series began during the economic boom, in 2006, with ''The Real Housewives of Orange County.'' The recipe for the show drew from other hits focusing on nouveau-riche characters: ''Desperate Housewives,'' Fox's teenage drama ''The OC'' and MTV's reality series ''Laguna Beach.'' The series has been a moneymaker for Bravo: in 2008 the shows pulled in about $22 million in advertising for the network, according to the research company TNS Media Intelligence.
 ''Given the last 10 years and how much wealth was created, and how many people became upper-middle-class, a lot of us are looking for signs on how to behave: what's acceptable behavior; if you have wealth, how should you behave,'' said Michael Hirschorn, a partner in Ish Entertainment, which produces television shows, and former executive vice president for original programming at VH1. ''The 'Real Housewives' series are really smart about class and taste, and people, especially women, are fascinated by that.''
 After three seasons in Orange County, Bravo introduced ''The Real Housewives of New York City'' in 2008, followed by ''The Real Housewives of Atlanta.'' Atlanta focused on black women, largely athletes' wives; many of the New York women held jobs and traded stinging commentary. 
 New Jersey has its own accent: two of the five women are sisters, and a third is their sister-in-law. The family dynamics add intrigue -- as do connections of some cast members to a mobster who was killed in 1983 -- but the women's personality traits are the same as their predecessors'. Among the choice lines of the first episode: ''The phone sex was ... wow''; ''He's very successful, and he lets me spend the money''; and a complaint by one woman that her breasts ''are too big for tennis.'' 
 Like the other housewives, these women have lapses in self-awareness. At one point Ms. Giudice announces, ''I am so not a stage mom.'' The show cuts to her sitting in an auditorium, mimicking the moves to a dance her daughter is performing. Onstage, after the performance, the little girl complains about the lip gloss her mother made her wear, though no makeup was allowed.
 ''A lot of great reality lives in the gap between what the person thinks about themselves and what other people think about them, and these shows are particularly smart about exploiting that,'' Mr. Hirschorn said.
 The franchise goes beyond the shock value and machinations of other reality shows like, say, ''Rock of Love'' or ''Survivor,'' because the cast members know one another and live and play in some semblance of the real world, which allows audience members to relate to them better.
 ''They're not sequestered -- they're not being given, like, a hot tub and lots of alcohol, and then let's see what happens,'' said Shannon Fitzgerald, a freelance writer in San Francisco who watches all of the versions. ''If you're in Atlanta or Orange County or New York City, even if you're not in the same circles, you know who these women are.''
 That makes spying on their lives and styles enticing. Whether the ladies have bordello-style condos in New York or a palace-cum-banquet-hall in New Jersey, ''it's either going to be aspirational to someone or jaw-dropping to someone else,'' Mr. Cohen said, adding, ''We love the idea of taste.''
 Mari Ines Woodsome, a stay-at-home mother in Burlingame, Calif., who has watched all the seasons of all the shows, said she found the women's spending habits even more fascinating in the current economy. ''I imagine if I had that kind of money, how would I spend it differently,'' she said. ''It's interesting to see them throw it away on all these crazy cars, and all this stuff I find so tacky and out of control. I feel it's really amusing to watch in these times.'' 
 ''This sounds so terrible,'' she added, ''but I almost enjoy watching them sort of go a little crazy.'' 
 Beyond the consumption, the women display rare glimpses of humanity. In the first New Jersey episode, one talks about losing social status after a divorce. ''When I filed for divorce, it was like I had the plague,'' she says. The episode ends with her being stood up by a blind date, and two cast members hugging her. 
 ''There's always some kind of identification in a successful show,'' said Jane Feuer, a television critic and a professor of English at the University of Pittsburgh. ''You're not going to watch a show just to feel scorn toward the character, so on the other side of it is their likability.'' 
 But the most likable, sympathetic people in the 'Real Housewives' series are not the housewives, but the housekeepers, caterers, contractors and children who handle the women's expensive demands. Like many of the viewers, they didn't create the economic burp that bankrolled these women, but they're dealing with the consequences.

HEADLINE: A Tech Company's Campaign to Burnish Its Brand

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
AD AGENCIES usually hang on their clients' every directive. But when Intel was developing its biggest advertising campaign in years, it handed a carefully thought-out brief to the ad agency Venables Bell & Partners, which said Intel's idea -- to talk about the company's role in everyday life -- was, in a word, bad.
 Intel's notion was, ''we're so important to your everyday life. Imagine a world without Intel. Your lights would go out. The world would stop revolving,'' said Deborah Conrad, vice president and general manager of Intel's corporate marketing group. ''Venables Bell said, 'You got that wrong.' '' 
 The campaign that Venables Bell fashioned, which begins Monday in the United States, focuses instead on the amusingly weird, technology-focused culture of Intel and celebrates the company's role in the future, rather than the present. The tagline is ''Sponsors of Tomorrow,'' and the ads highlight achievements of Intel engineers in a humorous way. 
 The campaign is Intel's first that focuses on its brand rather than its products, Ms. Conrad said. It is Intel's most expensive campaign since 2006, and the company wants it to run for at least three years. One of the company's challenges is that people do not buy products from Intel directly -- it makes chips and materials that go into electronics made by Dell and Hewlett-Packard, among others. ''The fact that we're an ingredient, it's easy to get lost,'' Ms. Conrad said. ''We really needed to put some meaning into Intel, so 'Intel inside' means something again.''
 Before it created the campaign, Venables Bell pulled together clips from 20 or so commercials for technology companies and realized that pretty much every company had talked about its role in the present.
 ''Every cellphone company, every printer company, gosh, even Web sites, even Cisco -- Cisco makes routers! -- they're all claiming to be the ones delivering that everyday life angle,'' said Greg Bell, co-creative director and founder of Venables Bell, based in San Francisco. ''It's just really trite.''
 So the agency began looking at what Intel had actually produced in terms of research and development, and found that Intel's engineers really were not working on powering today's world. They were working on projects that were a few years from hitting the market. That inspired the tagline ''Sponsors of Tomorrow.''
 As for the advertising, ''we went into the pitch with our perception: 'Well, they're kind of just a big microprocessor company, so it should be interesting to put a shine on that,' '' Mr. Bell said. 
 Then ad executives began spending time at Intel, and noticed its appealing culture. ''We started thinking about Intel, like, 'OK, what's it like in the cafeteria when they're in there eating lunch together?' There's got to be a whole hierarchy of people in there who they admire,'' Mr. Bell said. That inspired the ads' theme: the odd technophile Intel culture.
 In one television ad, a group of employees gape, scream and writhe as a middle-aged Indian man in a navy vest, an ID tag hanging from his neck, struts through a break room. One employee rips open his button-down shirt to reveal a T-shirt with the man's image on it, while another worker clamors for his autograph. ''Ajay Bhatt, co-inventor of U.S.B.,'' an on-screen graphic reads as the man, an actor, winks at an admirer. ''Our rock stars aren't like your rock stars.''
 In a related print ad, photographs depict a group of rock musicians next to lab workers in white coats. ''Your rock stars aren't like our rock stars,'' the ad reads.
 The real inventors are not in the ads; they are played by actors. Mr. Bell said he wanted to ensure the commercials were humorous, and avoid arguments with Intel employees over which should be featured. 
 ''When you are required politically to cast certain people and get everyone involved, you tend to get this watered-down, feel-good campaign that works really well internally and makes the company itself feel good,'' but does not appeal to consumers, he said.
 The ads will run in about 30 countries by the end of June, with media buying handled by OMD, a unit of the Omnicom Group. Intel asked for ads where it would not have to change much besides the language from country to country. Still, when Intel hired a London company called Tag to advise it on adjusting the ads globally, Tag suggested certain changes. 
 What is seen as a funny comparison in the United States, Tag told Intel, could be offensive elsewhere. One American ad shows a little girl smiling over her neat bedroom, and another shows technicians wearing spacesuitlike outfits in an immaculate Intel factory. 
 ''Your clean room isn't like our clean room,'' it reads. But in China, that comparison can be seen as offensive. ''In China, you've got to appear like you're not talking down about another group for the sake of making your group look good,'' Mr. Bell said. ''You've got to be careful if they think that comes off as arrogant.'' So the agency adapted that ad to show engraved jade next to an intricate Intel chip. ''Your exquisite carving isn't like our exquisite carving,'' it says. 
 The campaign also includes digital elements. The company is doing a home page takeover on NYTimes.com on Monday. Visitors to the site will see a version of a paper as though it were 2040, with headlines like ''Star Athlete Tests Positive for Android.'' ''We're really excited about it but we're a little cautious'' Ms. Conrad said. ''We think we've done this in a tasteful, fun way.''
 It also includes digital billboards in Times Square, Berlin, Los Angeles, San Francisco and several other locations, with questions like, ''What do you hope to see in the future?'' Viewers can send text responses to a special number. A few minutes later, after Intel has reviewed the answers for appropriateness, the responses will appear on billboards throughout the United States.
 Despite sliding sales at Intel, where first-quarter revenue fell 26 percent to $7.1 billion and profit fell 55 percent, Ms. Conrad said this was a smart time to spend money on marketing. The co-founder of Intel, Gordon E. Moore, has always encouraged spending in a recession, she said.
 ''His whole view was you should invest during the recession so when you come out of it, you're in a leadership position, not two steps behind,'' she said. ''Year in, year out, you'll see us investing.''

HEADLINE: Amid France's Woes, Satirists Turn to Sarkozy, as a Punch Line

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Maia de la Baume and Jeanette Coombs contributed reporting.

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
In a time of economic crisis, and in the absence of effective political opposition, there is derision -- of those in power, especially the king. That is not to say that revolution is around the corner, but simply that humor punctures power and helps to cure a sense of powerlessness.
 This elected king, the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, with his aggressive personality, is a seemingly endless fount of material for the satirists, whose increasing boldness is a sign of deeper unhappiness with the government as it struggles with rising unemployment and worker anger. 
 ''We comedians are lucky to have someone colorful and easy to caricature, a little like American comedians with George Bush,'' said Stephane Guillon, one of the fiercest satirists now working in France. ''Sarkozy is a godsend for comedians, and if I exaggerate I should say that Sarko is a treasure chest of blunders all by himself. I really don't know how to thank him.''
 In the past year, he said, ''political humor has come back into fashion,'' even if the tone can be upsetting. ''Humor in times of crisis is like a valve; it allows people to decompress,'' he said. ''We live in times that are favorable for laughter.''
 Mr. Guillon, 45, appears three times a week at 7:55 a.m. on the public radio station France Inter, attracting an audience of two million people. Mr. Sarkozy has brought an unrestrained crassness to the presidency that has unleashed comedians, Mr. Guillon said.
 He mentioned one incident last year at an agricultural fair at which Mr. Sarkozy responded to a heckler in a vulgar way. ''A president of the republic could never have said this before,'' Mr. Guillon said. ''It shattered his image; the presidential position is no longer sacred. Sarkozy no longer embodies it.''
 On his radio show, Mr. Guillon called the president ''a Lilliputian politician married 6 months out of 12,'' and said that ''Sarkozy making a speech is like Jean-Claude Van Damme doing politics.''
 Mr. Guillon tried to explain what he portrayed as Mr. Sarkozy's obsession with President Obama this way: ''It's kind of understandable. For months, Sarkozy was the leader of Europe. Of the world even. And now he's forced to be just the president of France. I hope we'll be good enough for him.'' After six months of dealing with the Middle East and the Caucasus, ''now he has to try to resolve our little problems of losers, unemployment, social security.
 ''You get the feeling we're annoying him sometimes.''
 Mr. Guillon certainly is. Mr. Sarkozy called him ''unacceptable and mean,'' and the newspaper Le Figaro, which supports the president, called Mr. Guillon's style ''provocation au bazooka.'' The weekly magazine Le Point said, ''This era loves blood and Guillon provides nice spurts of it.''
 There is competition from others, including two impersonators, Laurent Gerra, with 1.8 million listeners on RTL, and Nicolas Canteloup, with 1.5 million listeners on Europe 1. Mr. Canteloup once described a visit by Mr. Sarkozy to a shoe store to buy higher platform heels -- ''the Everest model'' -- before meeting Mr. Obama. 
 Mr. Guillon sees the new satire as a welcome return to the intellectual jesters of the past, like Coluche (Michel Colucci, who died in a crash in 1986) and Pierre Desproges, who died in 1988. But the tone is coarser now, perhaps because politics are.
 With France troubled by strikes, ''bossnappings,'' scattered acts of industrial sabotage, worries over jobs, and university demonstrations that last weeks, Mr. Sarkozy's ratings have dropped, with some 55 percent of the French viewing him unfavorably, according to an Ipsos survey. At the same time, the popularity of his dull predecessor, Jacques Chirac, under investigation for allegations of embezzling public money, has been soaring.
 The sense of political spectacle and absurdity extends to the Socialist Party. The Socialists are divided, with feuding between the new party leader, Martine Aubry, and the former presidential candidate, Segolene Royal, who has been mocked by many in her own party for apologizing to foreigners in the name of France for Mr. Sarkozy's words. The Socialists also have no clear answer to the economic crisis.
 In this strange setting, satirists like Mr. Guillon are having a field day. He has called Ms. Aubry ''a fat tobacco jar,'' while Ms. Royal considers Mr. Canteloup, who imitates and mocks her, a prime reason she lost the presidential election.
 Mr. Guillon became infamous in February for his attack on another Socialist with presidential ambitions, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, who had an affair with an employee. To prepare for Mr. Strauss-Kahn's entry into the building at Radio France, Mr. Guillon said, ''exceptional measures have been taken in order not to awaken the beast,'' including the banning of high heels and leather pants. The head of publicity would greet him in a burqa, and ''at the sound of a siren, Stage 5 of the alert system, all female workers must be evacuated.''
 Mr. Strauss-Kahn was not amused, saying, ''Humor is not funny when it is essentially nastiness.''
 Mr. Guillon likes to compare himself to Lenny Bruce. ''I say out loud what a million people think in secret'' in a country where ''few people are willing to take risks,'' he said.
 But unlike the most prominent political comedian in the United States, Jon Stewart, Mr. Guillon has no interest in meeting the politicians he skewers. ''When you start socializing with politicians, you lose your independence,'' he said. ''I want to keep my freedom of tone.''

HEADLINE: Seeking a Hollywood Ending in Sacramento

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO 

 BODY:
It has been a while since hordes of bedazzled constituents lined up outside pancake breakfasts in rural California to get a peek at their governor. The magazine covers once decorated with his butterscotch-hued visage have been replaced with images of the president, or, in recent days, swine. 
 Those convivial cigar breaks with lawmakers in the tent outside his office are now part of Sacramento history. 
 Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose mere name once stirred calls for lifting the constitutional ban on foreign-born presidents, is facing the most difficult period of his political career. 
 His approval rating is in the 30s, his state is broke and the policy celebrations of the past have been replaced with scenes like one recently in Los Angeles in which Mr. Schwarzenegger stood on a sweltering patio at a senior housing center trying to persuade a small group of voters to back a slate of budget-related ballot measures needed to keep California solvent. 
 If the measures do not pass on May 19 -- and polls show them to be unpopular -- California will be forced to deal with tens of billions of dollars in new budget gaps. Politically, it has become a do-or-die moment for the Republican governor, whose own party has largely abandoned him, to the point that Mr. Schwarzenegger says he is considering endorsing a Democrat in the 2010 race to succeed him.
 Perhaps the ultimate indignity: Mr. Schwarzenegger has the sympathy of Gray Davis, the Democrat he ousted as governor in the recall election of 2003, when the state was mired in another budget morass and Mr. Davis was blamed for it. ''I told him during the transition, you need two things to be successful,'' Mr. Davis said. ''You need rain in the north and a strong economy. And there is nothing you can do about either one.'' 
 If any of this pains Mr. Schwarzenegger or makes him fret about the future, he has not indicated it. But he seems cured of his desire to be in public office. 
 Barred by term limits from running for governor again, Mr. Schwarzenegger said he had no intention to run for the United States Senate, as previously rumored; indeed the mere mention of the office in an interview here seemed almost to offend him. 
 ''I'm not going to do that, no!'' he said. Once he leaves office, Mr. Schwarzenegger said he would continue to take up environmental causes and election reform as well as dabble in body building and, if the right scripts come his way, acting. 
 ''I always tell my wife, 'I'm not switching this thing out for that; I'm just adding,' '' Mr. Schwarzenegger said. ''I read body building magazines, I read the movie magazines and I read the political magazines, so I cover myself.''
 Early in his first term, he tried to use the ballot process to get tougher rules for teachers' tenure, restrict political activity by unions, cap state spending and redraw legislative districts, all with the goal of reining in the power of elected Democrats and the public employee unions. But organized labor, most notably the teachers' union, lobbied hard for the measures' failure.
 Now, he is again seeking to cap state spending -- with a tax increase thrown in -- and make changes to the lottery system. He also wants to move dedicated pools of money away from programs for the mentally ill and children into the general fund to plug large budget holes -- actions that require voter approval and were part of a budget deal with lawmakers last month. 
 This go-round, the governor's ballot efforts come with the blessing of some of the public employee unions. ''These are different times,'' said Gale Kaufman, a Democratic political consultant whose clients include the California Teachers Association. ''He still has an amazing capacity to believe that he can sell anything to voters. I think that is a remarkable quality.''
 Polls show that five of the six budget-related measures are trailing with voters. The sixth measure, which would bar legislators and state officers from getting a pay raise when there is a budget deficit, has the support of 72 percent of those polled by the California Field Poll.
 The governor has spent much of the last month behind the scenes asking Hollywood executives and others for money to help pay for the campaign to pass the ballot measures, while he has let firefighters and teachers do much of the face-to-face campaigning on behalf of the measures. It is a jarring turnaround from the previous effort, when Mr. Schwarzenegger was the star of the campaign and the same firefighters and teachers were his enemies.
 If the effort succeeds, and California scrapes out of yet another budget mess, it would further allow the governor to pursue his final goals of health care for all Californians and some sort of answer to the state's intransigent water supply issues. Add to that his success in getting a law passed that curbs emissions of heat-trapping gases in the state, and the passage last fall of a ballot measure on redrawing legislative districts, and Mr. Schwarzenegger would wind down his tenure in Sacramento on a high.
 ''Then he will leave office having as much impact as any governor in a generation,'' said Dan Schnur, director of the Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California and a former adviser to Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. 
 If the ballot measures do not pass, however, Mr. Schwarzenegger will have to contend with something less than historic success, a place he is not accustomed to. His environmental legislation and redistricting coup will save him from serious comparisons to Jesse Ventura, the other celebrity turned governor, who left Minnesota's Capitol in a blast of mutual ill will with voters, but Mr. Schwarzenegger's legacy hangs a great deal on how his final 18 months in office go. 
 The governor, in the interview in his office, admitted to some letdowns. ''You know how strong ideology is here, and that kind of thing really surprised me and was also disappointing,'' he said.
 But when you are independently wealthy, congenitally cheerful and popular outside your own state, the political realities of Sacramento are often not enough to bring you down.
 ''I don't really have a plan, because we don't know what the next 18 months will bring and I don't want to think that much about it,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger said. ''I like not having a safety net. I like the risk of not knowing. But I will be involved in all kinds of great things.''
